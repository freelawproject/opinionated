Because defendant attacks the facial validity of the charges against her, we will review the evidence presented by the State to determine whether there was probable cause for the grand jury to find that these crimes were committed and that defendant committed them. <em>In re State ex rel. A.D., </em>212 <em>N.J. </em>200, 218, 52 A.3d 1024 (2012). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Defendant took highly confidential original documents owned by her employer, contending that she did so to support her employment discrimination lawsuit. Relying on <em>Quinlan v. Curtiss-Wright Corp., </em>204 <em>N.J. </em>239, 8 A.3d 209 (2010), defendant argues that her acts are not criminally sanctionable. She contends that because <em>Quinlan </em>purportedly establishes an absolute right <em>for </em>employees with employment discrimination lawsuits to take potentially incriminating documents from their employers, the judge erred by denying her motion. We disagree. <em>Quinlan </em>did not establish such a bright-line rule as defendant suggests. <em>Quinlan, </em>a <em>civil </em>employment discrimination case, enunciated a seven-part totality-of-the-circumstances test (the <em>\u2018\u2018Quinlan </em>analysis\u201d) to determine whether a private employer can terminate its employee for the unauthorized taking of its documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">We hold, under the facts of this case, that a criminal court judge is not required to perform a <em>Quinlan </em>analysis to decide a motion to dismiss an indictment charging a defendant with official misconduct predicated on an employment-related theft of public documents. Instead, the judge should apply well-settled standards regarding whether to grant such motions. That is, to survive a motion to dismiss an indictment, the State need not produce evidence adequate to sustain a conviction; but rather, the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>must introduce sufficient evidence before the grand jury to establish a prima facie case that defendant has committed a crime. <em>State v. Hogan, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>216, 236, 676 A.2d 533 (1996). Because the State produced such evidence here, the judge properly concluded that the indictment was not manifestly deficient or palpably defective. <em>Id. </em>at 228-29, 236, 676 A.2d 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Whether a petit jury ultimately finds defendant guilty of official misconduct and theft will depend on the State\u2019s ability to prove beyond a reasonable doubt each and every element of these crimes. If there is sufficient evidence to support defendant\u2019s contention that she honestly believed she had a right to the documents in question, she can raise such a claim as an affirmative defense at trial. The State then would have the burden of proving, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant did not act pursuant to a claim of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">The North Bergen Board of Education (the \u201cBoard\u201d) employed defendant for several years as a clerk.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She started working in the Board\u2019s payroll department and remained there for ten years. She was thereafter assigned to the Board\u2019s Special Services Department and became a clerk for a child study team.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s son also worked as a part-time employee for the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">In November 2009, one year before the Court decided <em>Quinlan, </em>defendant and her son filed a complaint against the Board, her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>supervisor, an office manager, and a North Bergen Township Commissioner.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant alleged that she was a victim of gender, ethnic, and sex discrimination. The complaint also alleged that the Board terminated defendant\u2019s son because defendant voiced what she understood to be problems in her workplace regarding alleged pay irregularities, reimbursing employees improperly for \u201cunused\u201d vacation time that they had actually used, wrongful denial of employee unpaid family leave, violations of child study team regulations, and \u201cunsafe conditions.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> They alleged, among other causes of action, employment discrimination, hostile work environment, and retaliatory discharge, in violation of the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination (the \u201cLAD\u201d), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-1 to -49, and they sought punitive damages.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Defendant\u2019s counsel in the civil case learned eventually from defendant that defendant possessed hundreds of documents owned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>by the Board. Criminal defense counsel on this appeal indicated in his merits brief that defendant\u2019s civil lawyer <em>\u201cchose to use </em>the documents during the discovery phase of [defendant\u2019s] pending lawsuit against [the Board].\u201d (Emphasis added). Defendant\u2019s civil attorney turned over those documents to counsel defending the Board in the employment discrimination suit. The Board\u2019s attorney notified the Board\u2019s general counsel. The general counsel brought the matter to the attention of the Hudson County Prosecutor, who determined that the matter should be presented to a grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The grand jury convened to hear evidence in this case in April 2012, more than two and one-half years after defendant had filed her civil complaint. The State called the Board\u2019s general counsel to testify as its only witness before the grand jury. He testified that defendant had sued the Board and that \u201cthere [was] a [civil] lawsuit outstanding.\u201d The general counsel testified that defendant had taken from the Board 367 documents, including at least sixty-nine original documents. He informed the Board\u2019s defense counsel that \u201cthe information [contained] in those documents was highly confidential, very sensitive, and [that the Board] needed to act on [defendant\u2019s decision to resort to self-help] immediately.\u201d He then described five of the documents, focusing on the confidential nature of each one.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">The first document is a bank statement that a parent provided to the Board. The Board used this bank statement to verify whether that parent and the parent\u2019s child met the school district\u2019s residency requirements. This document reveals the parent\u2019s name and address, a bank account number, an account balance, a description of the type of account (either a checking or savings account), and a statement date.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">The second document is an appointment schedule of a psychiatrist who treated students with special needs in the district. This document identifies the names of various students whom the psychiatrist planned to treat, and it contains a note that one named student \u201cis on medication and needs [more] medication.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>Releasing this document to the public would jeopardize the Board\u2019s ability to ensure that its students with mental health issues receive psychiatric treatment and would violate the students\u2019 privacy rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">The third document, which general counsel believed to be an original, is entitled \u201cConsent for Release of Information to Access Medicaid Reimbursement for Health-Related Support Services.\u201d This document discloses the name and private contact information of a parent who agreed to participate in a Medicaid-reimbursement program, and it identifies the student\u2019s name, date of birth, enrollment date, school, and grade level. The Board uses this type of document to seek reimbursement from Medicaid for medical and other services that students with special needs receive. The Board faces liability exposure if the State or Federal Government performs an audit and this document is missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">The fourth document, also believed to be an original, is a signed letter from a parent whose child is receiving confidential services for the child\u2019s special needs. It contains the family\u2019s private information, such as names of the parents and student, the name of the student\u2019s school, and contact telephone numbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">The fifth document is an original letter from a different parent to the Director of Special Services regarding an emotional problem involving that parent\u2019s child. In the letter, the parent indicated that her son \u201ccame off the bus soaked in urine, very nervous, and his eyes were twitching.\u201d The document reveals the identity of the student.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">General counsel testified that the documents in defendant\u2019s possession belonged to the Board. He explained that Board \u201cemployees are trained and informed!,] via internal policies!,] guidelines!,] and regulations!,] that these documents are highly confidential and are not to be disclosed or tampered with in any way.\u201d He stated that these documents are not to be \u201cdisclosed for] taken\u201d by Board employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>In May 2012, the grand jury indicted defendant and charged her with committing the crimes of official misconduct and theft. Defendant then moved to dismiss the indictment. During oral argument on that motion, the judge focused on whether the State presented sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case that defendant committed these offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Defense counsel contended that defendant took the documents for a lawful use, that the State failed to present exculpatory evidence to the grand jury, and that the State was punishing defendant for exercising improper judgment on the job. Defense counsel argued that <em>\u201cQuinlan </em>says it\u2019s legal to take confidential documents,\u201d and that preventing defendant from taking the confidential documents would have a chilling effect on future LAD cases.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">The State maintained that it presented to the grand jury sufficient evidence to show that defendant committed these crimes. The assistant prosecutor argued that defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Quinlan </em>was misplaced. He stated that <em>Quinlan, </em>which he emphasized was decided in the context of a civil case rather than on a motion to dismiss an indictment, did not create a bright-line rule permitting a public servant such as defendant to take highly confidential documents that did not belong to her. The State asserted that the indictment was not manifestly deficient or palpably defective and there existed no exculpatory evidence that squarely refuted an element of the offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">In October 2012, the judge issued a thorough written decision agreeing with the State\u2019s arguments, and denied the motion. The judge recognized that on a motion to dismiss the indictment, the State need not produce evidence adequate to sustain a conviction, but rather, the State\u2019s evidence must be sufficient to establish a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>prima facie showing that a crime has been committed. She acknowledged that defendant bears a \u201c \u2018heavy burden\u2019 of demonstrating that the \u2018evidence is clearly lacking to support the charge[s].\u2019 \u201d The judge then concluded that defendant did not meet her burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Although the judge rejected the applicability of <em>Quinlan, </em>she performed the <em>Quinlan </em>analysis out of an abundance of caution. The judge concluded that the <em>Quinlan </em>factors weighed heavily in favor of the Board.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The judge then held that \u201can employee\u2019s removal of documents from his or her employer for use in a [ ]LAD suit, is not per se lawful.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">On appeal, defendant raises the following points:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-8\">POINT i</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-9\">THE INDICTMENT FOR \u201cOFFICIAL MISCONDUCT\u201d SHOULD BE DISMISSED AS THE STATE HAS FAILED TO PRESENT SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO THE GRAND JURY TO SUSTAIN A PRIMA FACIE CASE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-10\">A.

BOARD OF EDUCATION TO VIOLATE THE CANONS OF ATTORNEY ETHICS.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">We begin by addressing whether the judge abused her discretion by denying defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment. We will not disturb the denial of such a motion \u201cunless [the judge\u2019s discretionary authority] has been clearly abused.\u201d <em>State v. Warmbrun, </em>277 <em>N.J.Super. </em>51, 60, 648 A.2d 1153 (App.Div.1994) (quoting <em>State v. Weleck, </em>10 <em>N.J. </em>355, 364, 91 A.2d 751 (1952)), <em>certif. denied, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>277, 658 A.2d 300 (1995). Against this standard, we conclude that there was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">A judge should not dismiss an indictment except on the clearest and plainest ground, where it is \u201cmanifestly deficient or palpably defective.\u201d <em>Hogan, supra, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>at 228-29, 676 A.2d 533. When reviewing such motions, the court must construe the facts in the light most favorable to the State. <em>State v. Fleischman, </em>383 <em>N.J.Super. </em>396, 398, 891 A.2d 1247 (App.Div.2006), <em>aff'd, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>539, 917 A.2d 722 (2007). \u201cAs long as an indictment alleges all of the essential facts of the crime, the charge is deemed sufficiently stated.\u201d <em>State v. Schenkolewski, </em>301 <em>N.J.Super. </em>115, 137, 693 A.2d 1173 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>77, 697 A.2d 549 (1997). We have stated that \u201cthe quantum of this evidence ... need not be great.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-11\">The State produced sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case of theft of movable property. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-3a provides that \u201c[a] person is guilty of theft if he unlawfully takes, or exercises unlawful control over, movable property of another with purpose to deprive him thereof.\u201d Here, theft is a third-degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>offense pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-2b(2)(g). At this stage in the case, we must look at the facts presented to the grand jury in the light most favorable to the State. From this perspective, the State introduced evidence that defendant violated the Board\u2019s \u201cinternal policies!,] guidelines!,] and regulations!,]\u201d by taking its highly confidential original documents, which suggests that defendant did so with the purpose to deprive the Board. The State also introduced evidence suggesting that by taking these documents, defendant intended to disrupt the psychiatric treatment of students with special needs, and also exposed the Board to liability in the event of a state or federal Medicaid audit.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Defendant\u2019s counsel contends, like he did before the criminal judge, that the State is unable to show that defendant \u201cunlawfully\u201d took the documents because <em>\u201cQuinlan </em>says it\u2019s legal to take confidential documents.\u201d We disagree with defendant\u2019s reading of <em>Quinlan. </em>We also emphasize that the grand jury is an accusatorial rather than an adjudicative body; grand jurors do not determine guilt or innocence. <em>Hogan, supra, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>at 227, 676 A.2d 533. A grand jury is simply \u201casked to determine whether \u2018a basis exists for subjecting the accused to a trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Trap Rock Indus., Inc. v. Kohl, </em>59 <em>N.J. </em>471, 487, 284 A.2d 161 (1971) , <em>cert. denied, </em>405 <em>U.S. </em>1065, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>1500, 31 L.Ed.2d 796 (1972) ). Here, the record demonstrates that the grand jury correctly performed its limited role.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\"><em>We agree </em>with the trial judge that <em>Quinlan </em>is factually distinguishable. The plaintiff in <em>Quinlan, </em>a private individual rather than a public employee like defendant, contended that her employer discriminated against her when it promoted a less qualified man to the position of supervisor. <em>Quinlan, supra, </em>204 <em>N.J. </em>at 244, 8 A.3d 209. During discovery in her LAD case, her employer, a private company, learned that Quinlan had taken confidential documents. <em>Ibid. </em>Thereafter, her employer terminated her. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">The Supreme Court framed the issue in <em>Quinlan </em>as \u201ccreating] the appropriate framework against which [civil] courts may weigh and consider whether, and to what extent, an employee who finds, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>copies, and discloses an employer\u2019s otherwise confidential documents in the context of prosecuting a discrimination ease was engaged in conduct protected by the LAD.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 245, 8 A.3d 209. In undertaking that challenge, the Court balanced the rights of \u201cindividual plaintiffs seeking to vindicate their rights and employers legitimately expecting that they will not be required to tolerate acts amounting to self-help or thievery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 245-46, 8 A.3d 209. The Court created a seven-part analysis for use in a civil case, \u201ca flexible, totality of the circumstances approach.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Civil judges apply this seven-part analysis by considering, in part, such things as whether: \u201cdiscovery of the document was due to the employee\u2019s intentional acts outside ... her ordinary duties\u201d; the document \u201cincludes personal or confidential information such as Social Security numbers or medical information about other people\u201d; there is a \u201ccompany policy on privacy or confidentiality that the employee\u2019s disclosure has violated\u201d; use of the document \u201cis unduly disruptive to the employer\u2019s ordinary business\u201d; the employee can obtain the document by \u201cdescribing it or identifying its existence to counsel so that it might be requested in discovery\u201d; and whether there is \u201ca likelihood that the employer would not maintain it, or would have discarded it in the ordinary course of business, that it would have been destroyed, or that its authenticity would be called into doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 269-71, 8 A.3d 209. The Court applied this balancing test and stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4M\">[a]pplying [the <em>Quinlan </em>analysis] to the documents before the court, we find ourselves in agreement with the distinction that the trial court drew. The trial court correctly told the jury that plaintiffs act of taking the documents, ... was not protected [activity] and that the employer was free to terminate her for doing so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 273, 8 A.3d 209.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">We reject defendant\u2019s argument that the holding in <em>Quinlan </em>essentially prevents the State from introducing evidence before the grand jury that demonstrates a prima facie showing that defendant \u201cunlawfully t[ook], or exercise[d] unlawful control over\u201d the documents. <em>Quinlan </em>did not establish a bright-line rule that automatically entitled defendant to take the Board\u2019s highly confi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>dential original documents. In fact, the Court in <em>Quinlan </em>made clear that even with the availability of its multifaceted analysis, employees</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-6\">run the <em>significant risk </em>that the conduct in which they engage will not be found by a court to fall within the protection [the <em>Quinlan </em>analysis] creates. <em>The risk of self-help is high </em>and the risk that <em>a [petit civil] jury </em>will reject a plaintiffs argument that he or she was fired for using the document, rather than for finding it and taking it in the first place, will serve as <em>an important limitation </em>upon any realization of the fears that the employers have expressed to the Court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>[Id. </em>at 272, 8 A.3d 209 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">The State produced sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case of official misconduct. Here, the official misconduct charge is a second-degree offense pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:30-2, because the State presented evidence to the grand jury that defendant derived a non-pecuniary benefit. <em>See State v. Phelps, </em>187 <em>N.J.Super. </em>364, 375, 454 A.2d 908 (App.Div.1983) (stating that \u201ca person may be convicted of the second[-]degree offense of official misconduct even though no pecuniary benefit is involved\u201d), <em>aff'd, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>500, 476 A.2d 1199 (1984). Pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:30-2b, official misconduct is a third-degree offense \u201c[i]f the benefit obtained or sought to be obtained ... is of a value of [$200] or less.\u201d The Court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-9\">the Legislature ... intended to treat more moderately offenses which, by an objective standard, could be measured to be relatively less consequential in nature than would otherwise be the case. It carved out a type of official misconduct for lenient treatment. But the Legislature did not in the downgrading provision deal with a benefit not subject to pecuniary measurement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-10\"><em>[Phelps, supra, </em>187 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 375, 454 A.2d 908.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-11\">Pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:30-2a,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-12\">[a] public servant is guilty of official misconduct when, with purpose to obtain a benefit for himself or another or to injure or to deprive another of a benefit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>a. He commits an act relating to his office but constituting an unauthorized exercise of his official functions, knowing that such act is unauthorized or he is committing such act in an unauthorized manner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">Thus, pursuant to this section of the statute, official misconduct has three elements: (1) a defendant must be a \u201cpublic servant,\u201d (2) \u201cwho committed \u2018an act relating to his office,\u2019 which constituted \u2018an unauthorized exercise of his official functions,\u2019 knowing that it was unauthorized or committed in an unauthorized manner,\u201d and (3) had a purpose \u201cto obtain a benefit for himself or another\u201d or \u201cto injure or deprive another of a benefit.\u201d <em>State v. Quezada, </em>402 <em>N.J.Super. 277, </em>283, 953 A.2d 1206 (App.Div.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">The State made a prima facie showing that defendant is a \u201cpublic servant,\u201d defined by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:27-1g as any \u201cemployee of government, ... [who performs] a governmental function[.]\u201d \u201cThe term \u2018public servant\u2019 is \u2018defined broadly for purposes of [official] misconduct ... for ... offenses against public administration.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Perez, </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>204, 206, 883 A.2d 367 (2005). As long as defendant performed a \u201cgovernmental function,\u201d she is considered to be a public servant under this section of the statute. <em>See Quezada, supra, </em>402 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 283, 953 A.2d 1206 (focusing on the actor\u2019s performance of a governmental function); <em>see also Perez, supra, </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>at 207, 883 A.2d 367 (stating that a clerk of the North Bergen Department of Motor Vehicle\u2019s office is a \u201cpublic servant\u201d because she performed governmental functions). The Board, which is itself a public entity under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:1-3, is unquestionably a \u201cgovernmental vehicle through which [the constitutional obligation to provide a] mandatory education takes place.\u201d <em>Tonelli v. Bd. of Educ., </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>438, 450, 888 A.2d 433 (2005). Here, defendant performed a governmental function by serving public school students with special needs and their families as a clerk for a child study team in the Board\u2019s Special Services Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">The State also made a prima facie showing that defendant committed \u201can act relating to [her] office\u201d which constituted \u201can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>unauthorized exercise of [her] official functions,\u201d knowing that it was unauthorized or committed in an unauthorized manner. General counsel testified that the Board trained and informed its employees, \u201cvia internal policies[,] guidelines^] and regulations^] that the documents defendant took are highly confidential and are not to be tampered with in any way.\u201d He asserted that these documents are not to be \u201cdisclosed [or] taken\u201d by Board employees. Giving the State the benefit of all reasonable inferences, as we must on a motion to dismiss an indictment, the State showed that it notified defendant in writing that she was unauthorized to remove the five documents presented to the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Finally, the State produced sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie showing that defendant had a purpose \u201cto obtain a benefit for [herself] or another\u201d or \u201cto injure or deprive another of a benefit.\u201d A \u201cbenefit\u201d is a \u201cgain or advantage or anything so regarded by the beneficiary.\u201d <em>Phelps, supra, </em>187 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 375, 454 A.2d 908; <em>see also N.J.S.A. </em>2C:27-1a. The statute does not require a malicious intent, but rather an \u201caffirmative act.\u201d <em>State v. Kueny, </em>411 <em>N.J.Super. </em>392, 404, 986 A.2d 703 (App.Div.2010). General counsel informed the grand jury that defendant sued the Board and that defendant\u2019s civil case was pending. Looking at the facts in the light most favorable to the State, <em>Fleischman, supra, </em>383 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 398, 891 A.2d 1247, defendant acted with the purpose to derive a benefit by taking the documents to support her civil lawsuit, or to \u201cinjure or deprive\u201d the Board of its ability to defend the allegations in the civil suit. Moreover, the removal of copies and original Board documents exposed the Board to potential liability by making the Board unprepared for an audit related to Medicaid reimbursement, and by possibly disrupting psychiatric treatment for students with special needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">Defendant argues that \u201cif she committed any wrongdoing,\u201d she made an \u201chonest error.\u201d Defendant asserts that because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>she may have exercised \u201cimproper judgment on the job,\u201d by taking documents that may constitute an \u201cunauthorized\u201d act, the judge erred by denying her motion to dismiss the indictment. Defendant equated her decision to remove the Board\u2019s highly confidential financial and medical records with that of a janitor erring by taking home a mop. The premise of her argument is that the Legislature did not intend to include her conduct as activity that constitutes official misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">\u201cThe crime of official misconduct serves to insure that those who stand in a fiduciary relationship to the public [such as defendant] will serve with the highest fidelity, will exercise their discretion reasonably, and will display good faith, honesty, and integrity.\u201d <em>Schenkolewski, supra, </em>301 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 145-16, 693 A.2d 1173. As we have previously stated, \u201c[a]s long as an indictment alleges all of the essential facts of the crime, the charge is deemed sufficiently stated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 137, 693 A.2d 1173. Defendant stood in \u201ca fiduciary relationship\u201d to the public and therefore was expected to serve with the \u201chighest fidelity.\u201d Thus, we reject defendant\u2019s contention that the Legislature did not intend to include within the official misconduct statute the activity of taking highly confidential documents while performing a governmental function as a public servant.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Defendant\u2019s \u201chonest error\u201d argument is not insignificant, however, because it amounts essentially to a claim of right defense. The time to assert such a defense, though, is at trial, rather than as a basis to dismiss the indictment. Pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-2c, a defendant may assert the affirmative defense that she \u201c(1) [w]as unaware that the property ... was that of another; [or] (2) [a]cted under an honest claim of right to the property ... that [s]he had a right to acquire or dispose of it as [s]he did.\u201d The jury charge for this defense states in part that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-7\">[i]n addition to ... her general denial of guilt, the defendant contends that ... she is not guilty of [theft and official misconduct] because ... she was acting pursuant to a claim of right to the property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>Our law provides that it is a defense to prosecution [<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] for [theft] that the defendant acted under an honest claim of right to the property ... or that ... she had a right to acquire or dispose of the property as ... she did. An honest claim is one that is genuinely, though not necessarily correctly, believed by the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-5\">This defense, you should note, is not limited to situations in which a defendant believed ... she owned the property! ] Rather, it includes those situations in which the defendant honestly, although not necessarily correctly, believed that ... she had either the right or the authorization to receive, take, acquire, or dispose of the property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-6\">As I have mentioned to you, since this is a criminal ease the burden of proof is on the State. The defendant is, therefore, not required to prove that ... she acted pursuant to a claim of right; rather the burden is on the State to prove that the defendant did not act pursuant to a claim of right____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-7\">[I]f the State has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt ... that the defendant did not honestly believe ... she had a right to the property or was authorized to receive, take, acquire, or dispose of the property, then you must find the defendant not guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">At oral argument before us, counsel addressed questions regarding whether the judge should have conducted what was described as a <em>\u201cQuinlan </em>hearing\u201d to resolve whether to grant defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Here, the judge performed the <em>Quinlan </em>analysis out of an abundance of caution. We are satisfied, however, that <em>Quinlan </em>does not apply directly to the facts presented here because the Supreme Court did not intend its holding in that civil case to act as a means of mounting a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>facial challenge to the indictment in this criminal case. As we have discussed at length <em>infra, </em>the standards for assessing the sufficiency of an indictment are well-settled. <em>Hogan, supra, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>at 228-29, 676 A.2d 533. There is nothing in <em>Quinlan </em>that signals any deviation from <em>Hogan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Defendant contends that the indictment must be dismissed because the State failed to present to the grand jury exculpatory evidence \u201crelating to\u201d her LAD lawsuit against the Board. Defense counsel argues that defendant\u2019s taking of the documents to support her civil lawsuit against the Board \u201cis legal ... under <em>Quinlan,\u201d </em>and that the assistant prosecutor failed to present defendant\u2019s purported reason for taking the documents. Defendant argues, therefore, that this evidence would have negated her guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">A prosecutor\u2019s duty to present exculpatory evidence to a grand jury arises \u201conly if the evidence satisfies two requirements: it must directly negate guilt and must also be clearly exculpatory.\u201d <em>Hogan, supra, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>at 237, 676 A.2d 533. Limiting the prosecutor\u2019s duty to presenting \u201cevidence that directly negates ... guilt\u201d recognizes that \u201cthe sole issue before the grand jury is whether the State has made out a prima facie case of the accused\u2019s guilt.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Exculpatory evidence must \u201csquarely refute[] an element of the crime.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab\">[ascertaining the exculpatory value of evidence at such an early stage of the proceedings can be difficult, ... and courts should act with substantial caution before concluding that a prosecutor\u2019s decision in that regard was erroneous. We emphasize that only in the exceptional case will a prosecutor\u2019s failure to present exculpatory evidence to a grand jury constitute grounds for challenging an indictment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 238-39, 676 A.2d 533 (citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">Here, presenting evidence to the grand jury that defendant took the documents to pursue her civil lawsuit against the Board is not \u201cclearly exculpatory.\u201d Even if <em>Quinlan </em>were directly on point, which it is not, \u201cwhat the employee did with the document\u201d is only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>one factor to consider pursuant to the <em>Quinlan </em>analysis. Undertaking the <em>Quinlan </em>analysis is \u201ca difficult ... task,\u201d <em>Quinlan, supra, </em>204 <em>N.J. </em>at 271, 8 A.3d 209 and defendant\u2019s purported reason for taking the documents does not in and of itself constitute \u201cclearly exculpatory\u201d evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">There is also no credible evidence that the State deceived the grand jury during its presentment of this matter. <em>See Hogan, supra, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>at 236, 676 A.2d 533 (maintaining that \u201cthe grand jury cannot be denied access to evidence that is credible, material, and so clearly exculpatory as to induce a rational grand juror that the State has not made out a prima facie case against the accused\u201d). General counsel informed the grand jury that defendant\u2019s lawsuit against the Board was \u201coutstanding.\u201d In fact, the grand jury at one point acknowledged that defendant had filed a suit against the Board and discussed among themselves the possibility that she took the documents to support her civil case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-6\">JUROR: Could I ask a question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-7\">MR. HERNANDEZ: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-8\">JUROR: What \u2014 I\u2019m just curious. I thought I heard someone ... say that she</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-9\">was going to sue the Board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-10\">MR. HERNANDEZ: Yes ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-11\">JUROR: But how is that relevant ...[?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-12\">(At this time, discussion occurs among Grand Jurors.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-13\">MR. HERNANDEZ: I believe you answered your own question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-14\">The assistant prosecutor correctly refrained from speculating about defendant\u2019s purported reason for taking the documents. <em>See ibid, </em>(stating that \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s sole obligation is to present a prima facie case that the accused has committed a crime\u201d). In fact, the grand jury was not expected to resolve the credibility of a potential affirmative claim of right defense. <em>Ibid. </em>(indicating that \u201c[cjredibility determinations and resolution of factual disputes are reserved almost exclusively for the petit jury\u201d). Therefore, presenting such evidence to the grand jury would not \u201csquarely refute[ ] an element of the crime.\u201d Thus, the assistant prosecutor\u2019s unwillingness to speculate about defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>purported reason for taking the documents did not interfere with the grand jury\u2019s decision-making.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Defendant maintains that allowing the State to criminalize her conduct through this prosecution will have a chilling effect on \u201cpotential plaintiffs in LAD claims.\u201d Defendant implies that prosecuting her for theft and official misconduct is against LAD\u2019s public policy of rooting out discrimination in the workplace. This implication amounts to a request that we hold it is against public policy to criminally prosecute employees for taking employer public documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">At the outset, we note that whether to charge an individual suspected of criminal offenses is within the prosecutor\u2019s discretion. <em>State v. DiFrisco, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>253, 265, 571 A.2d 914 (1990) (citing <em>State v. Hermann, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>122, 127, 402 A.2d 236 (1979)). \u201c[T]he Executive Branch has exclusive authority and absolute discretion to decide whether to prosecute a case.\u201d <em>United States v. Nixon, </em>418 <em>U.S. </em>683, 693, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>3090, 3100, 41 L.Ed.2d 1039, 1055 (1974), <em>superseded by statute, Fed.R.Evid. </em>104(a). \u201cBeyond purely constitutional concerns, the judiciary generally defers to the prosecuting attorney\u2019s discretion to charge or not to charge because enforcement decisions are the product of prosecutorial value judgments and expertise, and [because] courts lack standards by which to review these decisions.\u201d <em>DiFrisco, supra, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>at 265, 571 A.2d 914 (alteration in original) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">As an intermediate appellate court, we do not have the power to determine, as a matter of public policy, what should be considered criminally culpable conduct. The framers of the New Jersey Constitution expressed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>[tlhe powers of the government shall be divided among three distinct branches, the legislative, executive, and judicial. No person or persons belonging to or constituting one branch shall exercise any of the powers properly belonging to either of the others, except as expressly provided in this Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-6\"><em>[N.J. Const., </em>art. Ill, H1.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">We discern no constitutional basis for the judiciary, much less this court, to intrude into the policy-making arena, an area traditionally reserved in our tripartite system of governance to the legislative and executive branches. As ably expressed by Chief Justice Vanderbilt sixty-three years ago, \u201cno deviation from the ... separation of powers [doctrine] will be tolerated which impairs the essential integrity of one of the [three] branches of government.\u201d <em>Massett Bldg. Co. v. Bennett, </em>4 <em>N.J. </em>53, 57, 71 A.2d 327 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">Our commitment to this fundamental principle of governance has been reaffirmed and reflected in a variety of opinions issued by the Supreme Court as well as this court. <em>See Ross v. Transp. of N.J., </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>132, 147, 553 A.2d 12 (1989) (refusing to carve out an exception to the statutory framework governing governmental limitations on tort liability); <em>In re Closing of Jamesburg High Sch., </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>540, 550, 416 A.2d 896 (1980) (holding that \u201cimportant policy question[s]\u201d should be left to the Legislature); <em>Robinson v. Zorn, </em>430 <em>N.J.Super. </em>312, 324-25, 64 A.3d 571 (App.Div.) (declining to create an exception to the policy governing governmental limitations on liability reflected in the Tort Claims Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:1-1 to -12.3), <em>certif. denied, </em>216 <em>N.J. </em>8, 75 A.3d 1162 (2013); <em>In re Veto by Governor Christie, </em>429 <em>N.J.Super. </em>277, 285-86, 58 A.3d 735 (App.Div.2012) (refusing to \u201cinterven[e]\u201d where the Legislature decided not to amend a 2001 statute that is related to and arguably inconsistent with comprehensive 2011 legislation), <em>certif. denied, </em>214 <em>N.J. </em>116, 67 A.3d 1191 (2013); <em>Brick v. Spivak, </em>95 <em>N.J.Super. </em>401, 406, 231 A.2d 380 (App.Div.) (stating that \u201ceven if [the court] were to assume that there was an inadvertent omission\u201d in the pertinent statute, the court \u201cshould not assume the function of the Legislature and rewrite the law to include therein something which those charged with the legislative responsibility <em>might </em>have inserted if the matter had been called to their attention\u201d), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>49 <em>N.J. </em>400, 230 A.2d 503 (1967). Following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>this well-settled precedent, we leave to the wisdom of the Legislature further consideration of whether to amend the theft and official misconduct statutes. <em>State ex rel. B.P.C., </em>421 <em>N.J.Super. </em>329, 347, 23 A.3d 937 (App.Div.2011) (\u201cOur role as a court is not to question the wisdom of legislative enactments, but to enforce them as long as they are not contrary to constitutional principles.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Although defendant couches her argument broadly, contending that the State\u2019s prosecution will have a chilling effect on \u201cpotential plaintiffs in LAD claims,\u201d we consider this contention under the facts of this ease. The Court in <em>Quinlan </em>considered the potential concern that an employer would destroy inculpatory documents or that otherwise relevant documents would become unobtainable if an employee did not resort to self-help measures to acquire confidential documents pertinent to the employee\u2019s LAD ease. But here there is no evidence to suggest that the documents necessary to prove defendant\u2019s case against the Board would have been unobtainable by using the ordinary lawful means for securing discovery. Defendant does not argue that she limited her self-help measures to a document or documents that were clearly inculpatory, so-called \u201csmoking gun\u201d evidence, to support her claims. Nor does defendant assert on appeal that she took the documents because \u201cthere was a likelihood that the [Board] would not maintain [them], or would have discarded [them] in the ordinary course of business, that [they] would have been destroyed, or that [their] authenticity would be called into doubt.\u201d <em>Quinlan, supra, </em>204 <em>N.J. </em>at 271, 8 A.3d 209. Likewise, she does not contend that the documents would have been unavailable if she described them or identified their existence to the lawyer representing her in the civil case so that he might demand them in discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">Rather, defendant asserts in general that permitting the State\u2019s prosecution of her for official misconduct and theft would have a chilling effect on \u201cpotential plaintiffs in <em>LAD </em>claims.\u201d (Emphasis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>added). A plaintiff in a discrimination case such as this, however, has a variety of options by which to obtain information that is reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, including, but not limited to (1) seeking, under certain circumstances, to preserve evidence through taking depositions and obtaining documents before filing a lawsuit <em>(R. </em>4:11-1); (2) requesting documents pursuant to a protective order <em>(R. </em>4:10-3); (3) taking depositions after the commencement of the action <em>(R. </em>4:14-1); (4) subpoenaing non-party witnesses for depositions <em>(R. </em>4:14-7); (5) propounding interrogatories <em>(R. </em>4:17); (6) serving document demands <em>(R. </em>4:18); (7) propounding requests for admissions <em>(R. </em>4:22-1); (8) obtaining orders to make discovery <em>(R. </em>4:23); (9) seeking sanctions for failure to comply with court orders <em>(R. </em>4:23-2); and (10) obtaining further sanctions for failure to make discovery <em>(R. </em>4:23-5). There is no credible suggestion in this case that any of these lawful discovery avenues were unavailable to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">There are also safeguards in place for employees like defendant who might believe that their employers will hide or destroy evidence. For example, a trial judge in a civil case may give an adverse inference charge to the jury, that the destroyed or concealed evidence would have been unfavorable to the employer. Under certain circumstances, a judge might issue sanctions against the employer or its counsel, and a party may bring a new cause of action based on the tort of fraudulent concealment. <em>Robertet Flavors, Inc. v. Tri-Form Constr., Inc., </em>203 <em>N.J. </em>252, 272-74, 1 A.3d 658 (2010); <em>see also Bldg. Materials Corp. of America v. Allstate Ins., </em>424 <em>N.J.Super. </em>448, 472, 38 A.3d 644 (App.Div.) (explaining various methods of addressing spoliation of evidence), <em>certif. denied, </em>212 <em>N.J. </em>198, 52 A.3d 176 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">There are other safeguards in place to deter employers from pursuing criminal prosecution unfairly against employees. For instance, an aggrieved party may bring a claim for malicious prosecution if she can show that \u201c(1) a criminal action was instituted by [the] defendant against [her]; (2) the action was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>motivated by malice; (3) there was an absence of probable cause to prosecute; and (4) the action was terminated favorably to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>LoBiondo v. Schwartz, </em>199 <em>N.J. </em>62, 90, 970 A.2d 1007 (2009) (citing <em>Lind v. Schmid, </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>255, 262, 337 A.2d 365 (1975)). And, importantly, pursuant to <em>R.P.C. </em>3.4(g), a lawyer runs the risk of ethics charges if that lawyer \u201cpresent[s], participate[s] in presenting, or threaten[s] to present criminal charges to obtain an improper advantage in a civil matter.\u201d <em>See Ruberton v. Gabage, </em>280 <em>N.J.Super. </em>125, 134, 654 A.2d 1002 (App.Div.) (indicating that \u201ccounsel walks a fine line in view of <em>R.P.C. </em>3.4(g)\u201d), <em>certif. denied, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>451, 663 A.2d 1358 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Moreover, defense counsel has not contended that defendant photocopied or took a document that \u201cclearly indicates that the [Board] was engaged in illegal conduct.\u201d <em>Quinlan, supra, </em>204 <em>N.J. </em>at 282, 8 A.3d 209. Although defense counsel states generally the policy concern that indicting employees who take such documents would undermine LAD\u2019s purpose of rooting out discrimination, counsel does not point to any \u201csmoking gun\u201d document in this case. Nor does counsel explain why the documents were relevant to defendant\u2019s civil claims. Instead, counsel has noted that defendant\u2019s counsel in her civil ease merely \u201cchose\u201d to use the documents. As Justice Albin stated in his dissent in <em>Quinlan, </em>in the circumstance of \u201cclassic whistle-blowing activity,\u201d \u201c[a] test to balance the competing interests of an employee and employer and the public good, ... may well be required.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Although an affirmative defense of a claim of right would also be available to an employee who took, for example, the \u201csmoking gun,\u201d we need not reach what consequence, if any, such a potential balancing test would have on the State\u2019s ability to establish before a grand jury a prima facie case of official misconduct or theft because that question is not squarely before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">Our dissenting colleague concludes that the indictment should be dismissed with prejudice based on fundamental fairness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>grounds. She maintains that it is unfair to prosecute employees who reasonably believe that they are entitled to take employer documents to support LAD and CEPA claims. To dismiss the indictment as suggested by our colleague, however, would amount to the judiciary establishing a public policy that employees must be categorically insulated from criminal prosecution under the theft and official misconduct statutes if they take confidential employer documents to support potential LAD and CEPA claims. Such an approach violates the separation of powers doctrine and requires a sweeping application of the fundamental fairness doctrine beyond that currently adopted by our Supreme Court. As we have stated in Point VI A, we leave that policy question to the wisdom of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The fundamental fairness doctrine applies \u201cwhen the scope of a <em>particular </em>constitutional protection has not been extended to protect a defendant.\u201d <em>State v.

Rather, because the law, including the theft and official misconduct statutes, provides no warning the conduct is proscribed, I suggest that the judiciary expand and apply the doctrine of fundamental fairness in order to ensure justice for all employees who act in good faith pursuant to the LAD and/or CEPA. <em>See Zehl v.

Thus, Saavedra faces a five- to ten-year term of imprisonment if convicted of this crime. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b559-9\"> Saavedra raised her CEPA claim in the first count of her complaint, alleging she was subjected to retaliation and harassment as a result of her complaints about her employer\u2019s violations of law and public policy, including pay irregularities, employee abuse of vacation time, and violations of the Family Medical Leave Act, 29 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2601-2654, the New Jersey Family Leave Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:1 IB-1 to -16, and child study regulations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b563-8\"> Likewise, the Board's alleged policies and regulations relating to its confidential documents, which the State presented to the motion judge but not the grand juty, do not warn employees of any consequences, let alone criminal prosecution and imprisonment. The State never presented any evidence to the grand jury that Saavedra received or was actually aware of these alleged documents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b563-9\"> The Court also upheld the punitive damages award, in part, because the employer \"branded [Quinlan] a thief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 276, 8 A.3d 209.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b565-12\"> This conflict may also extend to the New Jersey False Claims Act (FCA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:32C-1 to -17. The FCA encourages employees to disclose confidential employer information for the purpose of filing lawsuits alleging fraud of or by State-funded entities, such as the Board in this case. As with the LAD and CEPA, the Legislature has prohibited employers from taking adverse employment action against employees who disclose confidential employer information pursuant to the FCA. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:32C-10b. However, there is nothing prohibiting criminal prosecution of these employees for theft and official misconduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
