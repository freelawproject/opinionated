We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">We discern the following facts and procedural history from the record on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">Advance owns a 31.79-acre property in the Township\u2019s 1-2 industrial zone. The property consists primarily of cleared land, with woods around the edges, and a wetland and riparian zone along Route 22. In addition to an office building on an adjacent lot, nearby uses include additional office and industrial buildings to the west and across Route 22, single-family homes, including those in the North Branch Hamlet and a mobile-home park, to the north and east, and public park land to the south.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-11\">Principal uses permitted in the 1-2 zone include \u201c[ojffice buildings for executive, engineering and administrative purposes,\u201d \u201c[sjcientific and research laboratories,\u201d \u201c[wjarehousing,\u201d \u201c[ajssembly and fabrication using previously manufactured components,\u201d and \u201c[ajgricultural uses.\u201d Branchburg, N.J. Ordinance No.2008-1114 \u00a7 3-19. Conditional uses include \u201c[gjovernmental uses and public utility facilities,\u201d as well as principal uses that involve \u201cextraordinarily hazardous substance facilities.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Housing is not a principal or conditional use in the zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-12\">In August 2009, Advance filed an application with the Board seeking a use variance, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-70(d)(1), for construction of a multi-family residential development consisting of 292 units, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>which fifty-nine would be affordable housing units. The development as proposed consists of twenty-eight buildings, including a mix of apartments, condominiums, and townhouses. Affordable housing units would be integrated with the market-rate units.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The Board took testimony and considered the application during eleven public hearings between July 2010 and July 2011. Advance argued before the Board that inclusion of the fifty-nine affordable units, approximately twenty percent of the total, rendered the entire development an inherently beneficial use for the purposes of the (d)(1) variance. The Board ultimately disagreed and framed its analysis of the application as a \u201cclassic, standard\u201d (d)(1) variance, as opposed to one in which the positive criteria were satisfied by the inherently beneficial use. The Board voted to deny Advance\u2019s application at its meeting in July 2011, and memorialized its decision in a resolution adopted in September.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">In October, Advance filed a complaint seeking to overturn the Board\u2019s denial of the (d)(1) variance. It also asserted claims of discriminatory zoning against the Board and Branchburg Township (Township). In those counts, Advance sought a builder\u2019s remedy under the Fair Housing Act, <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:27D-301 to - 329.19.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Toll Bros., Inc. v. Twp. of W. Windsor, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>502, 512, 803 A.2d 53 (2002). In April 2012, the Board and the Township moved for dismissal of the claims seeking the builder\u2019s remedy. The motion was granted in April.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">Following argument by counsel in October 2012, the trial judge placed an oral decision on the record explaining his reasons for upholding the Board\u2019s denial of the (d)(1) variance and dismissing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>Advance\u2019s amended complaint. The judge concluded that granting the (d)(1) variance requested by Advance would amount to awarding a builder\u2019s remedy through the variance process rather than through the mechanism established by the Fair Housing Act. He entered an implementing order on November 13. This appeal followed. We subsequently granted the Township\u2019s application to appear as amicus curiae.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">On appeal, Advance argues that (1) its proposed housing development is an inherently beneficial use in the context of a(d)(l) variance application, (2) the requested (d)(1) variance would not constitute zoning by variance or interfere with the Township\u2019s ability to plan for affordable housing, and (3) the trial judge erred in failing to find that the positive criteria outweighed the negative criteria even if the proposed development is not inherently beneficial. Before addressing the merits of the case, we outline the law that governs our consideration of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Our standard of review for the grant or denial of a variance is the same as that applied by the Law Division. <em>Bressman v. Gash, </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>517, 529, 621 A.2d 476 (1993). We defer to a municipal board\u2019s factual findings as long as they have an adequate basis in the record. <em>Lang v. Zoning Bd. of Adjustment of N. Caldwell, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>41, 58, 733 A.2d 464 (1999); <em>Fallone Props., LLC v. Bethlehem Twp. Planning Bd., </em>369 <em>N.J.Super. </em>552, 562, 849 A.2d 1117 (App.Div.2004). We are ordinarily not bound by an agency\u2019s determination on a question of law, <em>In re Distrib. of Liquid Assets, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>1, 11, 773 A.2d 6 (2001), and a municipal board\u2019s construction of its own ordinances is reviewed de novo. Nevertheless, we \u201crecognize the board\u2019s knowledge of local circumstances and accord deference to its interpretation.\u201d <em>Fallone, supra, </em>369 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 562, 849 A.2d 1117; <em>accord DePetro v. Twp. of Wayne Planning Bd., </em>367 <em>N.J.Super. </em>161, 174, 842 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>266 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>181 <em>N.J. </em>544, 859 A.2d 689 (2004). Like the trial judge, we may not \u201csubstitute [our] own judgment for that of the municipal board invested with the power ... to pass upon the application.\u201d <em>Kenwood Assocs. v. Bd. of Adjustment of Englewood, </em>141 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 4, 357 A.2d 55 (App.Div.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Where an applicant\u2019s proposal for a variance is denied, the applicant bears \u201cthe heavy burden of proving that the evidence presented to the board was so overwhelmingly in favor of the applicant that the board\u2019s action can be said to be arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable.\u201d <em>Med. Realty Assocs. v. Bd. of Adjustment of Summit, </em>228 <em>N.J.Super. </em>226, 233, 549 A.2d 469 (App.Div.1988). This is because \u201cmore is to be feared in the way of breakdown of zoning plans from grants than denials of variances.\u201d <em>Galdieri v. Bd. of Adjustment of Morris, </em>165 <em>N.J.Super. </em>505, 515, 398 A.2d 893 (App.Div.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">In <em>Kinderkamack Road Associates, LLC v. Mayor &amp; Council of Borough of Oradell, </em>421 <em>N.J.Super. </em>8, 12-13, 22 A.3d 129 (App.Div.2011), we reiterated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-8\">[blecause of the legislative preference for municipal land use planning by ordinance rather than variance, use variances [under <em>N.J.S.A </em>40:55D-70(d)(1) ] may be granted only in exceptional circumstances. <em>E.g., Nuckel v. Borough of Little Ferry Planning Bd., </em>208 <em>N.J. </em>95 [26 A.3d 418 (2011) ] (acknowledging this preference); <em>Funeral Home Mgmt., Inc. v. Basralian, </em>319 <em>N.J.Super. </em>200, 207 [725 A.2d 64] (App.Div.1999) (stating that \u201conly exceptional cases warrant use variances\u201d). Therefore, a municipal board of adjustment may permit \u201ca use or principal structure in a district restricted against such use or principal structure\u201d only where the applicant can demonstrate \u201cspecial reasons\u201d for the variance. <em>N.J.S.A </em>40:55D-70(d)(1). This requirement is known as the \u201cpositive criteria.\u201d <em>New Brunswick, Cellular Tel. Co. v. Borough of S. Plainfield Bd. of Adj., </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>1, 6, 733 A.2d 442 (1999). In addition, a variance application must meet the \u201cnegative criteria,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>by \u201cshowing that [the] variance can be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and will not substantially impair the intent and purpose of the zone plan and zoning ordinance.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>40:55D-70(d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-9\">Regarding the positive criteria, the Court has stated that \u201c \u2018special reasons\u2019 takes its definition and meaning from the general purposes of the zoning laws\u201d enumerated at <em>N.J.S.A </em>40:55D-2. <em>Burbridge v. Twp. of Mine Hill, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>376, 386, 568 A.2d 527 (1990) (citing <em>Kohl v. Mayor of Fair Lawn, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>268, 279, 234 A.2d 385 (1967)). In <em>Saddle Brook Realty, LLC v. Township of Saddle Brook Zoning Board </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number><em>of Adjustment, </em>388 <em>N.J.Super. </em>67, 76, 906 A.2d 454 (App.Div.2006), we observed three situations in which \u201cspecial reasons\u201d may be found:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-5\">(1) where the proposed use inherently serves the public good, such as a school, hospital or public housing facility; (2) where the property owner would suffer \u201cundue hardship\u201d if compelled to use the property in conformity with the permitted uses in the zone; and (3) where the use would serve the general welfare because the proposed site is particularly suitable for the proposed use. [ (Internal citations and quotation marks omitted).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-6\">All use variance applicants must satisfy the first prong of the negative criteria, which requires proof that \u201cthe variance can be granted \u201cwithout substantial detriment to the public good.\u2019 \u201d <em>[Medici v. BPR Co., </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>1, 22 n. 12, 526 A.2d 109 (1987) ]. In addition, any proponent of a use that is not inherently beneficial must satisfy \u201can enhanced quality of proof\u2019 that requires \u201cclear and specific findings by the board of adjustment that the variance sought is not inconsistent with the intent and purpose of the master plan and zoning ordinance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21 [526 A.2d 109], These findings \u201cmust reconcile the proposed use variance with the zoning ordinance\u2019s omission of the use from those permitted in the zoning district.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-7\"><em>See also Med. Ctr. at Princeton v. Twp. of Princeton Zoning Bd. of Adjustment (Medical </em>Center), 343 <em>N.J.Super. </em>177, 200, 778 A.2d 482 (App.Div.2001) (quoting <em>Smart SMR of N.Y., Inc. v. Borough of Fair Lawn Bd. of Adjustment, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>309, 323, 704 A.2d 1271 (1998)) (\u201c[I]f the proposed use is inherently beneficial, the applicant\u2019s burden of proof is significantly lessened because \u2018an inherently beneficial use presumptively satisfies the positive criteria.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">The Legislature has defined an \u201cinherently beneficial use\u201d as one \u201cwhich is universally considered of value to the community because it fundamentally serves the public good and promotes the general welfare. Such a use includes, but is not limited to, a hospital, school, child care center, group home, or a wind, solar or photovoltaic energy facility or structure.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-4. An inherently beneficial use is evaluated under the standard set forth in <em>Sica v. Board of Adjustment of Township of Wall, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>152, 164-66, 603 A.2d 30 (1992), which calls for a balancing of the positive and negative criteria against one another, taking into account the public interest involved, the detriment to the community, and possible conditions the board can apply to mitigate any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>detriment. The applicant under this more relaxed standard need not satisfy the \u201cenhanced quality of proof\u2019 set forth by the Court in <em>Medici, supra, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>at 21, 526 A.2d 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Under <em>Medici, </em>the first inquiry under the negative criteria focuses on the potential effects of the variance on the surrounding properties. \u201cThe board of adjustment must evaluate the impact of the proposed use variance upon the adjacent properties and determine whether or not it will cause such damage to the character of the neighborhood as to constitute substantial detriment to the public good.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 22 n. 12, 526 A.2d 109 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Satisfaction of the second prong of the negative criteria analysis normally requires the applicant also \u201cdemonstrate through \u2018an enhanced quality of proof ... that the variance sought is not inconsistent with the intent and purpose of the master plan and zoning ordinance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smart SMR, supra, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>at 323, 704 A.2d 1271 (quoting <em>Medici, supra, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>at 21, 526 A.2d 109). The enhanced standard articulated in <em>Medici </em>guards against \u201c \u2018arbitrary action and untrammeled administrative discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Medici, supra, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>at 22, 526 A.2d 109 (quoting <em>Ward v. Scott, </em>11 <em>N.J. </em>117, 126, 93 A.2d 385 (1952)). This reflects the policy concern that \u201c \u2018because of their peculiar knowledge of local conditions!, boards of adjustment] must be allowed wide latitude in the exercise of [variance] discretion!,]\u2019\u201d and zoning change is most appropriately accomplished legislatively, rather than through excessive and arbitrary use of variance discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 23, 526 <em>A.</em>2d 109 (quoting <em>Kramer v. Bd. of Adjustment, Sea Girt, </em>45 <em>N.J. </em>268, 296, 212 A.2d 153 (1965)).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">We turn first to the issue of whether the housing development with an affordable housing element proposed by Advance is, as a matter of law, an inherently beneficial use for the purposes of a(d)(l) variance application. That determination will govern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>whether we apply the <em>Sica </em>or <em>Medici </em>standard to our review of the Board\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Advance relies on our decision in <em>Homes of Hope, Inc. v. Eastampton Township Land Use Planning Board, </em>409 <em>N.J.Super. </em>330, 336, 976 A.2d 1128 (App.Div.2009) (citing <em>Sica, supra, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>at 165, 603 A.2d 30), in which we stated that \u201c[a]ffordable housing is an inherently beneficial use.\u201d The Board and the Township, however, point to the fact that <em>Homes of Hope </em>involved a proposal to build eight units of affordable, multi-family housing in a residential zone that permitted only single-family homes. They argue that, although a project including only affordable housing units may be inherently beneficial, the addition of affordable units to a proposed development in which most of the proposed units are market-rate housing does not make the entire project inherently beneficial. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">In support of its position, Advance relies on several unreported opinions of this court. They concern cases in which (1) the development at issue was totally composed of affordable units, (2) only the affordable units of a larger residential development required a variance, and (3) the issue was not actually determined by the court. It is well established that unreported opinions have no general precedential effect and that they may not be cited for that purpose. <em>R. </em>1:36-3. Although a panel of this court may find the prior unreported opinions of other panels to be persuasive, our review of the specific opinions relied upon by Advance persuades us that they are unhelpful because the factual situations in those cases are not substantially similar to the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Relying on <em>Medical Center, supra, </em>343 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 193, 778 A.2d 482, Advance asserts that \u201cthe market units are inherently beneficial by virtue of their support of the affordable units.\u201d The inherently beneficial use in <em>Medical Center </em>was the operation of an acute care hospital, the issue was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-7\">whether the \u201cback-office\u201d functions of an admittedly inherently beneficial use under the [Municipal Land Use Law], N.J.S.A 40:55D-70d, (section d), fall within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>umbrella of the core use so as [to] preclude the necessity of applying the enhanced burden of proof required for section d relief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 185, 778 A.2d 482.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">In our opinion, we set out a framework for analysis of that issue and remanded to the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">The gist of Advance\u2019s argument is that, because the financial viability of the affordable units proposed for its development depends on its ability to build four times as many market-rate units, those market-rate units are an integral part of the inherently beneficial use of affordable housing, just as the back-office units were integral to the inherently beneficial operation of the hospital. We do not find that reasoning persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">In <em>Medical Center, </em>we remanded and focused the decision-making process on the function of the relatively small number of back-office units in relation to the core healthcare purposes of the larger hospital. <em>Id. </em>at 205-211, 778 A.2d 482. We opined that, although some of the units might appropriately be built in the residentially zoned area adjacent to the hospital because of the integration of their function with the operation of the hospital and the need for close proximity to it, others might not. <em>Id. </em>at 206-09, 778 A.2d 482. However, it was the larger beneficial use that potentially permitted the smaller non-inherently beneficial uses in the residential zone. There is nothing in our opinion to suggest that the analysis we established would be applicable where the predominant use is not the inherently beneficial one.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-11\">In addition, we do not find the financial benefit upon which Advance relies, even if combined with the social benefit of mixed-income housing, to be comparable to the relationship between the hospital and back-office operations on which we relied in <em>Medical Center. </em>There, the concern was whether the back-office facilities needed to be near the hospital on an ongoing basis so that it could function as a healthcare institution. Here, the issue is whether Advance needs to build a large, predominantly market-based development in the industrial zone to finance its ability to build a smaller number of affordable units in the same location.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>A developer\u2019s ability to build market-rate units undoubtedly facilitates its building of affordable housing financially, and the mixture of affordable and market-rate housing may well provide benefits to the residents of both. However, we see no basis under our current statutory or decisional law to hold that the inclusion of affordable housing as a relatively small component of a much larger residential development transforms the entire project into an inherently beneficial use for purposes of obtaining a(d)(l) variance under circumstances such as those existing here.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">Consequently, the trial judge did not err in declining to find that Advance\u2019s project was an inherently beneficial use.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-5\">[At the direction of the court, the discussion of the remaining issues in the appeal has been omitted from the published version of the opinion.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b279-9\"> The parties have argued, and we agree, that the merits of this case do not turn on the status of the Township's compliance with the Fair\u2019 Housing Act. Nothing in our decision would prevent the Township from deciding to change the zoning in the future to comply with its Fair Housing Act obligations or prevent Advance from seeking to build on its land in the event it is ultimately found to be entitled to a builder's remedy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b279-10\"> Advance filed an amended complaint shortly thereafter, but did not add any additional claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
