The voters in a Faulkner Act municipality \u201cmay propose any ordinance and may adopt or reject the same at the polls, such power being known as the initiative----\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:69A-184. They \u201calso have the power of referendumf,] which is the power to approve or reject at the polls any ordinance submitted by the council to the voters or any ordinance passed by the council, against which a referendum petition has been filed____\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>40:69A-185.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-13\">We have said that \u201c[t]he \u2018salutary purposes\u2019 of both initiative and referendum include \u2018arousing public interest\u2019 and \u2018placing in the hands of the voters ... direct means of controlling proposed or already enacted municipal legislation and also of accomplishing the enactment of legislation which has neither been proposed nor adopted.\u2019 \u201d <em>City of Ocean City v. Somerville, </em>403 <em>N.J.Super. </em>345, 352, 958 A.2d 465 (App.Div.2008) (quoting <em>Maese v. Snowden, </em>148 <em>N.J.Super. </em>7, 11, 371 A.2d 802 (App.Div.1977) (citations omitted)). The \u201c[t]wo statutes ensure that the voters have that right both before and after the council adopts an ordinance on any particular subject.\u201d <em>Ibid,, </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>This appeal involves an initiative petition and proposed ordinance filed with the Camden city clerk, defendant Luis Pastoriza, by defendants Vance Bowman, Larry Gilliams, Eulisis Delgado, Mary I. Cortes and Robert Davis, collectively known as the Committee of Petitioners (the Committee). The ordinance was proposed in response to Camden\u2019s decision to disband its municipal police department and join a newly-formed county police force. Plaintiffs, Mayor Dana L. Redd and City Council president Francisco Moran, filed a complaint seeking to declare the petition-initiated ordinance invalid before it was submitted to the City Council or placed on any ballot.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">The Law Division judge determined that the proposed ordinance did not \u201cunduly restrict\u201d Camden\u2019s \u201cstatutory authority\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-118, which grants \u2018every municipality the right to \u201ccreate and establish\u201d a police force. However, the judge entered restraints \u201cprohibiting\u201d the city clerk \u201cfrom accepting the petition and proposed ordinance for filing\u201d because the proposed ordinance \u201ccreate[d] an undue restraint on the future exercise of municipal legislative power,\u201d was \u201cinvalid,\u201d and could not \u201cbe placed on the ballot for voters to act upon.\u201d The judge specifically refrained from considering whether the proposed ordinance was pre-empted by the Municipal Rehabilitation and Economic Recovery Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27BBB-1 to -75 (MRERA), and the Special Municipal Aid Act, <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:27D-118.24 to -118.31 (SMAA). The Committee filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">We have considered the arguments raised in light of the record and applicable legal standards. We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">The facts are not disputed. Camden\u2019s existing municipal police department was established and organized by ordinance as authorized by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-118. On June 17, 2008, Camden entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Division of Local Government Services (DLGS) in the Department of Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>munity Affairs (DCA) for the provision of $61.5 million in aid pursuant to the SMAA. The MOU required Camden to accept certain oversight measures and other conditions imposed by the State. Camden entered into similar MOUs in order to receive additional aid in 2009 and 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Nevertheless, Camden\u2019s financial woes continued. On June 23, 2010, DLGS published qualification standards for the \u201cTransitional Aid to Localities\u201d program (TAL), which superseded prior programs, including the SMAA. As declared by DLGS, TAL was intended for \u201cmunicipalities that have the most severe structural financial problems,\u201d \u201cdespite aggressive cost reductions and service modifications,\u201d and need additional assistance \u201cto mitigate significant property tax increases.\u201d The standards emphasized \u201clabor cost reductions and changes in service delivery\u201d as \u201cpreconditions for receipt of aid.\u201d Such reductions and changes would require the elimination of \u201credundant or excessive services.\u201d A municipality\u2019s application for TAL funding needed to demonstrate cost reductions compared to its 2009 budget, including \u201cdocumented efforts to share public safety dispatch, code enforcement, public health services, and other services offered by neighboring municipalities, area boards of education, local authorities, or the county, if those costs are less than the current full cost of providing equivalent service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Camden sought $54 million in TAL funding for 2011. The application painted a dire picture of increasing costs and projected budget shortfalls, as well as the anticipated adverse impact that reductions in Camden\u2019s police force would have upon the acknowledged historic, and intractable, violent crime rate in the city. Camden agreed to enter into an MOU by which DLGS would have outside \u201cmanagement, financial, and operational specialists\u201d assess municipal operations, and the city would \u201c[i]mplement actions as recommended____\u201d On November 24, 2010, DLGS awarded Camden $69 million in TAL funding for 2011, and, on December 15, Camden and DLGS entered into a new MOU for 2011. The MOU required Camden to reduce staffing further for 2012, and make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>other efforts to reduce costs, maximize recurring revenue, and eliminate the need for TAL funding within four years. Camden continued to negotiate collective bargaining agreements with those unions representing its police department, which had experienced a significant reduction in force. Camden came under some degree of DLGS oversight and control, although it is unclear from the record its nature and extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">In a February 15, 2011 notice, DCA clarified that the receipt of TAL funding required a municipality to show it \u201cha[d] moved beyond planning for operational efficiency and ha[d] begun to reduce costs.\u201d DCA \u201cexpect[ed] that the municipality ... [had] engaged with its unions and non-union employees to effectuate savings through reduced salary costs, reduced staffing levels, modified work rules, modified controllable benefits costs, or other efforts to mitigate\u201d salary and wage costs. Participation would require the municipality to \u201c[s]ubmit[] to broad State controls over hiring, procurement, and other matters[,]\u201d and \u201cadditional fiscal control measures as may be directed by [DLGS].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">In June 2011, Camden issued \u201cCamden Forward, the Transition Plan for 2011-2015.\u201d While recognizing the intended use of non-TAL funding to rehire laid-off police officers as a short-term measure, the plan noted Camden\u2019s intention to explore \u201cregionalized or shared services for police and fire services as a long-term solution for public safety and the fiscal challenges confronting the City.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">On August 9, 2011, the City Council passed a resolution authorizing Camden to enter into an MOU with DCA and the County of Camden (the County) \u201cfor the purpose of preparing a plan for the creation of the Camden County Police Department,\u201d a new countywide agency. On August 29, 2011, the MOU was executed by plaintiffs, County officials and the Director of DLGS. Under the terms of the MOU, Camden agreed to \u201cact as a co-applicant on submittals and filings ... with respect to the creation of the Camden County Police Department.\u201d The County would act as the \u201clead agency\u201d in forming the County police department which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>would be \u201cavailable to all municipalities within the County on a voluntary basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">On the same day, Camden requested $67.5 million in TAL funding for 2012. The application represented that the 2012 budget anticipated an agreement with the County \u201cunder which [Camden] would pay $14,000,000 for police services.\u201d On October 7, DLGS advised Camden that it would receive $61.4 million in TAL funding for 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">On December 27, 2011, the City Council adopted a resolution immediately implementing the MOU regarding formation of a County police department. The resolution noted that the County police department would include a Camden Metro Division \u201cto provide for public safety and law enforcement in ... Camden,\u201d while \u201crequiring the County Police Department to offer employment to qualified officers previously employed\u201d by the Camden police department. Camden\u2019s police department would be dissolved upon the creation of the Camden Metro Division. On January 26, 2012, the County adopted a resolution establishing the county police department.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">On April 10, 2012, the Committee submitted a petition seeking consideration of an initiative ordinance amending Camden\u2019s municipal code to read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-9\">A. There shall be created and maintained in continued existence, in, for and by the city of Camden, its own Police Department which shall remain the police department for the City of Camden and which shall consist of a Police Director, a Chief of Police and members and officers as shall be deemed necessary by the governing body of the City of Camden which shall, from time to time, determine the number of persons, including, without limitation, temporary officers and members in an emergency, to be appointed to these positions, together with their compensation, all as provided for under <em>N.J.S.A </em>40A:14-118.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-10\">B. The City of Camden shall not disband its Police Department pursuant to the creation of any county wide Police Department established by or for the County of Camden and shall not participate or join in the creation of any such police department established by or for the County of Camden, nor participate in any consolidation of or regionalization of police services sought to be created by any establishment of a county wide police department, and shall instead continue to maintain its own police department.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>Pastoriza reviewed the petition, and, on April 20, concluded it was legally sufficient. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>40:69A-187 (requiring all initiative and referendum petitions to be filed with the municipal clerk who \u201cshall determine whether ... the petition has a proper statement of the circulator and ... is signed by a sufficient number of qualified voters\u201d). Pastoriza advised the Committee, plaintiffs and other interested parties that he would \u201cmove the certified petition forward as an ordinance on [second] reading and public hearing [at] the next regularly scheduled City Council meeting (May 8[ ], 2012) for City Council consideration and action as required by law.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Plaintiffs filed their complaint on May 2, 2012, naming the Committee and its individual members, the City Council, Pastoriza, and various County officials as defendants. Plaintiffs sought a declaration that the \u201cproposed petition-initiated ordinance [was] null and void,\u201d and injunctive relief, specifically enjoining Pastoriza from submitting the ordinance to the City Council and the City Council from considering it. The Committee answered and asserted a counterclaim and crossclaim, seeking a declaration that the ordinance was valid, requiring its submission to the City Council and, if rejected, its placement on the ballot for consideration by the voters.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">The judge granted plaintiffs temporary restraints, and the parties stipulated to the dismissal of the complaint as to the City Council with prejudice. Following a hearing on June 11, 2012, the judge placed his oral decision on the record and entered the order under review.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">The Committee claims that the proposed ordinance was a valid exercise of the initiative powers granted by the Faulkner Act, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>the judge erred by concluding the proposed ordinance impermissibly restrained future municipal legislation. The Committee also asserts that the initiative ordinance was not prohibited by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-118, nor preempted by the statutory regimes impacting local finance and budgeting in Camden.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">We begin by noting that \u201ca question of statutory interpretation[ ] ... is a purely legal issue and, thus, we owe no deference to the trial court\u2019s legal conclusions.\u201d <em>In re Trenton Ordinance 09-02, </em>201 <em>N.J. </em>349, 358, 990 A.2d 1109 (2010) (citing <em>Manalapan Realty v. Twp. Comm. of Manalapan, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995)). \u201c \u2018Our task ... is to determine and effectuate the Legislature\u2019s intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Bosland v. Warnock Dodge Inc., </em>197 <em>N.J. </em>543, 553, 964 A.2d 741 (2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">As noted, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:69A-184 allows the voters in a Faulkner Act municipality to \u201cpropose <em>any ordinance </em>and ... adopt or reject the same at the polls....\u201d (Emphasis added). The Faulkner Act \u201cdoes not limit the power of initiative to only those areas of municipal concern which have never been the subject of favorable council action.\u201d <em>Smith v. Twp. of Livingston, </em>106 <em>N.J.Super. 444, 450, </em>256 A.2d 85 (Ch.Div.), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>54 <em>N.J. </em>525, 257 A.2d 698 (1969). Instead, it lets voters seek \u201cto amend a long-standing ordinance\u201d when \u201cthere is either a change in the circumstances or in the will of the people.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\"><em>\u201cN.J.S.A. </em>40:69A-184 ... by its very terms admits of no qualification.\u201d <em>Ocean City, supra, </em>403 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 357, 958 A.2d 465. Yet, while the express language permitting the proposal by initiative of \u201c \u2018any ordinance\u2019 means \u2018all ordinances,\u2019 ... no one disputes that the power of initiative is not without limitation.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>In Re Ordinance 01-75, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>446, 454, 460-61, 931 A.2d 595 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>(2007)). \u201c[T]here are certain ordinances ... which are simply not subject to initiative and referendum because of the subject matter involved or because they are statutorily excluded from the initiative and referendum provisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 359, 958 A.2d 465 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">For example, in <em>In re Ordinance 04-75, supra, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>at 465, 931 A.2d 595, the Court recognized that the referendum provision of the Faulkner Act \u201ccontains at least a partial, if not total, exception to the referendum rule for municipal budgets.\u201d The Court also set forth a non-exhaustive list of statutes that exempt ordinances enacted thereunder from the referendum provisions of the Act. <em>Id. </em>at 466-67, 931 A.2d 595. \u201cThat sampling clearly establishes that the Legislature has determined, on multiple occasions, those municipal matters that should not be called before the voters in a referendum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 467, 931 A.2d 595.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">\u201cBut even where the legislative directive has not been as express or precise, limitations on initiative authority may be inferred or implied from comprehensive State supervision, regulation or occupation of the field.\u201d <em>Ocean City, supra, </em>403 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 360, 958 A.2d 465. We need not repeat the examples of this proposition we previously cited in <em>Ocean City. Id. </em>at 360-70, 958 A.2d 465.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">In declaring the initiative ordinance invalid in this case, the Law Division judge did not rely upon either the express language of the Faulkner Act or some other statute, or the \u201ccomprehensive State supervision, regulation or occupation of the field.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 360, 958 A.2d 465. Indeed, he specifically declined to address whether the SMAA or MRERA preempted the initiative-generated ordinance. Instead, the judge concluded the ordinance was invalid because it \u201cereate[d] an undue restraint on the future exercise of municipal legislative power.\u201d We now consider that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">In <em>Ocean City, supra, </em>we recognized another limit \u201con the power of initiative [that] stems from the settled principle that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>governing body cannot, <em>absent specific legislative permission, </em>divest its successors of legislative power.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 359, 958 A.2d 465 (citing <em>Maese, supra, </em>148 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 13, 371 A.2d 802 (quoting <em>McCrink v.

We declared the \u201cordinance [was], on its face, defective[,]\u201d noting \u201c[i]t is fundamental that a governing body could not, by an ordinance presently adopted, place a restraint upon the future exercise of municipal legislative power.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 91, 204 A.2d 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">In <em>Maese, supra, </em>an initiative ordinance sought to prohibit the governing body or officials of the township \u201cfrom committing or spending any public funds,\u201d \u201cincurring any indebtedness\u201d or \u201cpledging or obligating public funds\u201d to construct a municipal complex on township land. 148 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 10, 371 A.2d 802. Relying on <em>McCrink, supra, </em>the trial judge concluded the \u201cordinance was invalid on its face \u2018because it acts as a restraint on all future actions, not only by this governing body but by any other governing body.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11, 371 A.2d 802. We affirmed, holding,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-8\">[tjhe invalidity of the proposed initiative ordinance ... springs from an attempt to shackle, if not to completely immobilize, the governing body in connection with construction on the municipally-owned tract.

However, as we recognized in <em>Ocean City </em>and <em>Mae se, </em>an exception to the general rule exists when the Legislature specifically permits present legislative bodies to restrict the legislative power of their successors. <em>Ocean City, supra, </em>403 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 359, 958 A.2d 465; <em>Maese, supra, </em>148 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 13, 371 A.2d 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:48-1 provides that \u201c[t]he governing body of every municipality may make, amend, repeal and enforce ordinances----\u201d However, the Legislature has bestowed a unique characteristic on an ordinance passed by initiative.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Faulkner Act specifically strips away the power of the governing body to repeal a validly-approved initiative ordinance and bestows that power solely on the voters.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-12\">If a majority of the qualified electors voting on the proposed ordinance shall vote in favor thereof, such ordinance shall thereupon become a valid and binding ordinance of the municipality and be published as in the case of other ordinances. <em>No such </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number><em>ordinance shall be amended or repealed unthin [three] years immediately following the date of its adoption by the voters, except by a vote of the people.

Sept. 28,1982) (the Amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">The Amendment also changed the terms of the Commission Form of Government Law, known as the Walsh Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:70-1 to 40:76-27, which theretofore had provided, without limitation, that any ordinance passed by initiative \u201cshall not be repealed or amended except by a vote of the people.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:74-18 (1982). The Amendment added a similar three-year limit during which an initiative ordinance could not be repealed or amended in a Walsh Act municipality unless submitted to, and approved by, the voters. <em>L. </em>1982, c. 145, \u00a7\u00a7 16, 17. The Legislative statement accompanying the Amendment makes clear its purpose: \u201c[T]o establish a uniform [three] year time limit within which a governing body may, solely by submission to the voters, amend or repeal an ordinance adopted by initiative....\u201d <em>Bill Sponsor\u2019s Statement to S.763 </em>(1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">Prior to the Amendment, an ordinance approved by initiative in a Faulkner Act municipality \u201cbec[a]me a valid and binding ordinance of the municipality and [would] be published as in the case of other ordinances.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:69A-169 (1982). Presumably, like any other ordinance, it was subject to immediate repeal by the municipal governing body. Hence, application of a general principle of municipal corporate law to initiative ordinances \u2014 a present legislative body may not bind the hands of it successors \u2014 was logical. The voters could not restrict the legislative powers of a successor governing body any more than the present governing body could.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>However, through passage of the Amendment, the Legislature has given the voters in a Faulkner Act municipality the power to restrict the legislative actions of the present governing body and its successor for a period of three years, which restriction may only be removed if the governing body returns the issue to the people for a vote. In other words, the Legislature has granted to the people \u201cspecific legislative permission,\u201d <em>Maese, supra, </em>148 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 13, 371 A.2d 802, to divest the governing body of its legislative power for a finite period of time, thereby creating an exception to the general rule that \u201c[n]o governing'- body ... may divest its successors of legislative power.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Given the legislative changes made to the Faulkner Act since <em>Maese </em>and <em>McCrink </em>were decided, those cases have limited vitality.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Lest our opinion be read too broadly, we reiterate that the Faulkner Act\u2019s provisions only limit the governing body\u2019s right to repeal an initiative ordinance for three years, unless the voters choose otherwise. Because the issue is not before us, we need not consider, for example, whether an initiative ordinance that expressly prohibited the governing body from taking action for a period longer than three years, or committed the governing body to a particular action for more than three years, would be permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">In this case, the proposed ordinance contained no such restrictions. Paragraph A called for the creation and \u201ccontinued existence\u201d of the municipal police department, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-118. As we noted, Camden had already created a municipal police department by ordinance, and the department\u2019s continued existence was implicit unless, and until, the existing police ordinance was repealed or modified. <em>See, e.g., Inganamort v. Ft. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number><em>Lee, </em>72 <em>N.J. </em>412, 421 n. 2, 371 A.2d 34 (1977) (\u201c[A]n ordinance may be promulgated which continues in force until repealed or superseded.\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Paragraph B of the initiative ordinance prohibited the city from disbanding the police force and joining any County police force, requiring that Camden \u201cshall instead continue to maintain its own police department.\u201d Such general language certainly does not violate the expressed or implied terms of the Faulkner Act. By analogy, in <em>Concerned Citizens of Wildwood Crest v. Pantalone, </em>185 <em>N.J.Super. </em>37, 40, 47, 447 A.2d 200 (App.Div.1982), we held a Walsh Act initiative ordinance that, without temporal limitation, \u201caffirmatively provide[d] that the beaches in Wildwood Crest w[ould] be free,\u201d was not an improper restraint on the future exercise of legislative action.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Furthermore, based upon the Court\u2019s recent guidance, judicially-constructed limits on the right to initiative and referendum are inappropriate.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-8\">[W]here the legislative intent is not clear \u201cfrom the statute\u2019s text, legislative history, or place in the larger statutory scheme[,]\u201d an intention to immunize an ordinance from a Faulkner Act challenge will not be found....

Since that time, Camden has been subject to its terms. The Legislature found that, with regard to certain municipalities, State aid filled their \u201cstructural [financial] deficits\u201d but failed to \u201cfunction as an economic impetus toward the rebuilding of those municipalities\u201d by addressing the elements needed \u201cto ensure [their] long-term economic viability,\u201d including healthcare services, public safety, and \u201cmarket-rate housing\u201d that would \u201cexpand the local tax base and provide a greater diversity of income levels among municipal inhabitants.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27BBB-2(j) to (m).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-15\">The Legislature intended MRERA to address those needs through \u201cexceptional measures, on an interim basis,\u201d to \u201cstrategically invest\u201d funds that would help the subject municipalities achieve such viability. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27BBB-2(n), (o).

In addition, upon notice by the Commissioner of DCA of a municipality\u2019s eligibility, the Governor appoints a \u201cchief operating officer [ (COO) ] in consultation with the mayor and the governing body.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:27BBB-7(a). The COO is charged with \u201creorganizing governmental operations ... in order to assure the delivery of essential municipal services and the professional administration of that municipal government.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27BBB-3. The goals are \u201cmunicipal rehabilitation\u201d and \u201ceconomic recovery,\u201d pursuant to a \u201cstrategic revitalization plan\u201d that also addresses \u201cregional issues, including public safety.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27BBB-6, -29, -38 and -40.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The COO serves during a \u201crehabilitation term\u201d of five years, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27BBB-2.2(a), -6(a), -7(e)(1), although the Commissioner of DCA may extend it upon the COO\u2019s recommendation. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27BBB-3, -7(c). The COO has all the authority allocated by law to the mayor, although the mayor and the governing body retain a degree of participation in budget decision-making. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27BBB-9, -11, -23, -25. The end of the rehabilitation term marks the expiration of the COO\u2019s term. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27BBB-6(a), -7(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">During the rehabilitation term, the COO may veto any ordinance or resolution adopted by the governing body, but \u201cthe governing body may override the veto by a two-thirds vote of the fully authorized membership thereof.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:27BBB-23(a)(1)(a). If the COO believes the override to be \u201ccontrary to the rehabilitation or economic recovery goals which justified the rehabilitation declaration,\u201d he or she may submit the matter to the \u201cspecial arbitrator\u201d for a final and unappealable determination. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27BBB-23(a)(l)(b). The special arbitrator may uphold the override \u201conly upon a finding that the action is consistent with the rehabilitation and economic recovery of the qualified municipality.\u201d <em>Ibid.; see also N.J.S.A. </em>52:27BBB-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">In 2007, the Legislature accepted the recommendation of Camden\u2019s COO for a rehabilitation term of ten years rather than five. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number><em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27BBB-2.2(c), (d); <em>L. </em>2007, c. 176, \u00a7 1.

The rehabilitation term is followed by a five-year \u201ceconomic recovery term.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27BBB-3, -6(a). During that term the mayor resumes full authority, with certain enhanced appointment and veto power over municipal boards and authorities. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27BBB-6(b)(l) to (5). However, the municipality remains subject to annual State compliance audits, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27BBB-6(b)(6), and the financial assistance continues until the municipality no longer meets the eligibility criteria of SMAA. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27-BBB-6(b)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">TAL superseded SMAA. <em>See S.

TAL funding is a \u201cdiscretionary aid program.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-118.42a. DLGS was accordingly allowed to impose the same kinds of rigorous and intrusive conditions on a municipality that SMAA had authorized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\">Conditions, requirements, or orders deemed necessary by [DLGSj may include, but not be limited to, the implementation of government, administrative, and operational efficiency and oversight measures necessary for the fiscal recovery of the municipality, including but not limited to requiring approval by |DLGS] of personnel actions, professional services and related contracts, payment in lieu of tax agreements, acceptance of grants from State, federal or other organizations, and the creation of new or expanded public services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-7\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-118.42a.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">The statutory scheme described seemingly demonstrates the Legislature\u2019s decision to fully occupy the field of municipal finance in Camden. The proposed initiative ordinance was not a budget ordinance; yet, it cannot be disputed that elimination of the police force, and Camden\u2019s membership in, and support of, a County police force was an integral part of the city\u2019s overall financial strategy as mapped out in the various MOU\u2019s referenced above. On its face, the statutory scheme does not mandate that Camden enter into a particular regionalized or shared service plan. If it did, the initiative ordinance would be barred. <em>See, e.g., In re </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number><em>Ordinance 04-75, supra, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>at 469, 931 A.2d 595 (\u201cA state mandate that does not allow for the exercise of municipal discretion cannot be overridden by a referendum.\u201d). Yet, certain provisions of the MRERA, including the powers of the COO during the \u201crehabilitation term,\u201d and the extraordinary device of appointment of a special arbitrator to render unappealable decisions, impliedly leave little room for other voices to be heard. Perhaps, even the voices of the voters of Camden.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">The record before the Law Division and before us consists of several certifications from municipal officials along with voluminous supporting documentation. However, there is nothing provided, for example, from DLGS or DCA regarding the actual implementation of the MOUs and the nature of State oversight as to the provision of municipal services that impact the budget. In other words, the record inadequately explains if adoption of the proposed initiative ordinance creates \u201can obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of the Legislature!.]\u201d <em>Overlook Terrace Mgmt.

Yet, we cannot state with certainty how the passage of time since the matter was before the Law Division may have changed the municipal landscape, particularly as it relates to the preemption issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Therefore, we are compelled to remand the matter to the Law Division for further consideration of whether the various statutory schemes at issue have preempted consideration by the voters of the proposed initiative ordinance in this case. We leave the conduct of the remand to the sound discretion of the Law Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
