We conclude that the defense may present expert psychiatric testimony, so long as it is limited pursuant to the principles stated in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-15\">Defendant was suspected of participating in a brutal sexual assault and murder. Two of his friends confessed to their involvement, but did not implicate defendant. He initially denied any involvement in the crime. However, a few days later, while he was in jail on an unrelated warrant, he confessed. Prior to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>trial, defendant claimed that the confession was not voluntary and was unreliable, because he was suffering from severe heroin withdrawal symptoms at the time he gave the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Following a <em>N.J.R.E. </em>104 hearing, the trial judge held that at an upcoming <em>Miranda</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>hearing and at trial defendant could present an expert psychiatrist to testify about the possible relationship between his heroin withdrawal and his confession. The expert would be permitted to testify that defendant was addicted to heroin and was suffering from withdrawal when he gave his statement to the police, and that his claims about the effects of withdrawal were \u201cconsistent with his claim that he was giving an unreliable statement at the time\u201d of his confession, \u201cgiven his history of issues with heroin dependence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">In a written opinion, dated January 15, 2012, the trial judge explained his reasons for admitting the testimony. Relying on <em>State v. King, </em>387 <em>N.J.Super. </em>522, 904 A.2d 808 (App.Div.2006), he concluded that the testimony was admissible to explain defendant\u2019s mental disorder to the jury and to explain why someone suffering from heroin withdrawal might confess to a crime as a result of the effect of the withdrawal symptoms, whether or not the confession was accurate. However, the judge ruled that the expert could not testify as to whether this defendant\u2019s statement was reliable or unreliable. After reviewing the record and the applicable law, we agree with the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">In evaluating a proffer of expert testimony, the court must apply the provisions of <em>N.J.R.E. </em>702.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-9\">[T]he rule sets forth three basic requirements for the admission of expert testimony: \u201c \u2018(1) the intended testimony must concern a subject matter that is beyond the ken of the average juror; (2) the field testified to must be at a state of the art that an expert\u2019s testimony could be sufficiently reliable; and (3) the witness must have sufficient expertise to offer the intended testimony.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-10\"><em>[State v. Torres, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>554, 567-68, 874 A.2d 1084 (2005) (citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>Those requirements are construed \u201cliberally\u201d in favor of admitting expert testimony. <em>State v. Jenewicz, </em>193 <em>N.J. </em>440, 454, 940 A.2d 269 (2008). We review a trial judge\u2019s evidentiary rulings \u2014 including a decision to permit an expert to testify pursuant to <em>N.J.R.E. </em>702 \u2014 for abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 455, 940 A.2d 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">On this appeal, the State characterizes the trial judge\u2019s decision as a departure from established case law. We disagree. His ruling was consistent with settled precedent upholding a defendant\u2019s right to present expert testimony designed to explain to the jury why a particular defendant\u2019s psychological condition would make that defendant vulnerable to giving a false confession. By contrast, courts have routinely rejected efforts to present expert testimony concerning the phenomenon of false confessions in general or the impact of police interrogation methods in producing false confessions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">In this State, the leading cases are <em>State v. Free, </em>351 <em>N.J.Super. </em>203, 798 A.2d 83 (App.Div.2002), <em>State v. King, supra, </em>and <em>State v. Rosales, </em>202 <em>N.J. </em>549, 998 A.2d 459 (2010). In <em>Free, </em>the defense sought to introduce expert testimony addressing false confessions as a phenomenon and applying the expert\u2019s views on that topic to the details of the defendant\u2019s interrogation in that case. We held that the testimony was inadmissible, distinguishing cases permitting testimony about a specific defendant\u2019s psychological diagnosis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>However, in each of those cases the psychological testimony concerned scientifically recognized mental disorders relevant to each defendant\u2019s confession, rather than, as here, testimony about the effects, in general, of police interrogation techniques. We also acknowledge that a few decisions from other jurisdictions have permitted psychological testimony on the effects of police interrogation. For now, we merely note that none of them went as far as the trial judge did here, and that, in any case, as shall appear, we do not find them persuasive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-5\"><em>[Free, supra, </em>351 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 213, 798 A.2d 83 (citation omitted).l</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">By contrast, in <em>King, </em>the defendant had a long and documented history of mental illnesses of various types recognized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). <em>See King, supra, </em>387 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 532, 904 A.2d 808. We held that the defendant could present expert opinions concerning his mental illness and testimony explaining to the jury why someone with those types of mental illnesses would be more vulnerable to giving false confessions. <em>Id. </em>at 538, 904 A.2d 808. However, we held that the expert could not testify that this defendant\u2019s confession was false or was a product of his mental disease. <em>Id. </em>at 540, 904 A.2d 808.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">Our decision in <em>King </em>derived from the United States Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Crane v. Kentucky, </em>476 <em>U.S. </em>683, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>2142, 90 L.Ed.2d 636 (1986). There, the Court held that a defendant had a constitutional right to present evidence concerning \u201cthe physical and psychological environment in which the confession was obtained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 684, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2143, 90 L.Ed.2d at 641. The Court reasoned that such evidence was relevant and admissible on the issue of the truthfulness, as well as the voluntariness, of a confession:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-8\">[T]he circumstances surrounding the taking of a confession can be highly relevant to two separate inquiries, one legal and one factual. The manner in which a statement was extracted is, of course, relevant to the purely legal question of its voluntariness, a question most, but not all, States assign to the trial judge alone to resolve. But the physical and psychological environment that yielded the confession can also be of substantial relevance to the ultimate factual issue of the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence. Confessions, even those that have been found to be voluntary, are not conclusive of guilt. And, as with any other part of the prosecutor\u2019s case, a confession may be shown to be \u201cinsufficiently corroborated or otherwise ... unworthy of belief.\u201d Indeed, stripped of the power to describe to the jury the circumstances that prompted his confession, the defendant is effective<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>ly disabled from answering the one question every rational juror needs answered: If the defendant is innocent, why did he previously admit his guilt?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 688-89, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2145-46, 90 L.Ed.2d at 644 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">The Court noted that the issue of whether a confession was voluntary might overlap with whether it was reliable. However, a defendant has the right to present the jury with evidence on the confession\u2019s unreliability, even if the judge earlier held that the confession was voluntary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-8\">[R]egardless of whether the defendant marshaled the same evidence earlier in support of an unsuccessful motion to suppress, and entirely independent of any question of voluntariness, a defendant\u2019s case may stand or fall on his ability to convince the jury that the manner in which the confession was obtained casts doubt on its credibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 689, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2146, 90 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 644 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">In <em>King, </em>we recognized that courts from many other jurisdictions had relied on <em>Crane </em>in permitting expert testimony concerning \u201ca defendant\u2019s psychological makeup and internal psychological characteristics impacting on the reliability of the confession.\u201d <em>King, supra, </em>387 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 538, 904 A.2d 808.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-11\">In <em>People v. Hamilton, </em>163 <em>Mich.App. </em>661, 415 <em>N.W.2d </em>653 (1987), the Michigan Court of Appeals reversed a murder conviction because of the trial court\u2019s exclusion of testimony by a clinical psychologist as to how the defendant\u2019s psychological makeup might have affected his statements to the police. The Court stated, <em>\u201cCrane </em>did not concern evidence of the defendant\u2019s psychological makeup, but focused instead on the physical and psychological aspects of an interrogation. Nonetheless, we believe the United States Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning is equally applicable to otherwise admissible expert testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 655; <em>see also, State v. Oliver, </em>280 <em>Kan. </em>681, 124 P.3d 493, 505-09 (2005) (holding psychologist\u2019s testimony of the defendant\u2019s post-traumatic stress disorder and dependent personality disorder admissible as part of the psychological environment under <em>Crane </em>as bearing on defendant\u2019s ability to respond reliably to interrogation, but finding preclusion of testimony harmless error), <em>cert. denied, </em>[547] <em>U.S. </em>[1183], 126 <em>S.Ct </em>2361, 165 L.Ed.2d 286 (2006); <em>State v. Buechler, </em>253 <em>Neb. </em>727, 572 <em>N.W.2d </em>65, 71-74 (1998) (reversing a murder conviction, holding that under <em>Crane </em>a clinical psychologist should have been allowed to testify that the defendant\u2019s drag withdrawal and psychological disorders may have resulted in a false confession, as such testimony pertained to the psychological circumstances under which the defendant confessed and had a bearing on the reliability of the confession); <em>Pritchett v. Commonwealth, </em>263 <em>Va. </em>182, 557 S.E.2d 205, 208 (2002) (same as to testimony of clinical and forensic psychologists about the defendant\u2019s mental retardation and vulnerability to interrogative suggestibility).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-12\">[Id at 538-39, 904 A.2d 808.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>Notably, that precedent included <em>Buechler, supra, </em>which addressed the admissibility of expert testimony concerning the defendant\u2019s drug withdrawal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There, the Nebraska Supreme Court held that the testimony was admissible to explain the defendant\u2019s mental state and how it might have affected the reliability of his confession:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-6\">Thus, we reach the question as to whether the district court here abused its discretion in rejecting the psychologist\u2019s proffered testimony, which undertook not to tell the jury how to decide the case or what result should be reached on any issue to be resolved by it, but, rather, to explain Buechler\u2019s menial state at the time of the recorded confession. While ordinary citizens might understand that drug withdrawal is uncomfortable, without expert evidence ordinary citizens would not be expected to understand that in Bueehler\u2019s case, withdrawal, combined with his disorders, may have made him suggestible, may have caused him to process information haphazardly, and may have caused him to reach faulty conclusions. Under that state of the record, we must conclude that the district court abused its discretion in excluding the proffered testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-7\"><em>[Buechler, supra, </em>572 N.W.2d at 73.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">The admissibility issue, however, long predated <em>Buechler. </em>In 1879, the Iowa Supreme Court held that a defendant was entitled to present expert testimony that he suffered from alcohol addiction and withdrawal symptoms at the time of his confession:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1\">The defendant, for the purpose of showing his mental condition at the time of the alleged confession testified to by Mrs. Squires, introduced witnesses who showed that prior to that time he had been exceedingly intemperate. The defendant then called one Dr. Hay as an expert in nervous diseases, including delirium tremens and other forms of insanity. He was asked in substance what mental condition was indicated in the defendant at the time he was seen by Mrs. Squires, supposing his conduct, language and appearance to be such as described by her, and supposing his habits to be such as shown in regard to drink. The counsel for the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>objected to the question as incompetent and immaterial to the main issue in the case. The counsel for the defendant then stated that they proposed to show by the witness that the defendant, at the time of the alleged confession, was laboring under delirium tremens. The counsel for the State repeated their objection, and the objection was sustained. In this we think that the court erred. Where a confession is shown, and there is evidence tending to show that the defendant, at the time of the confession, was laboring under delirium tremens, or was otherwise insane, we think that the opinion of an expert may properly be taken upon the defendant\u2019s mental condition as indicated by the proven facts. We see no reason why his insanity may not be established by any kind of evidence which is employed in any case to establish such a fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-5\"><em>[State v. Feltes, </em>51 <em>Iowa </em>495, 1 <em>N.W. </em>755, 760 (1879).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Hence, it is well established that a defendant has the right to present expert psychological testimony bearing on the reliability of his confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Nonetheless, that right has limits. While a defendant may present expert testimony bearing on psychological diagnoses that require knowledge outside the understanding of lay jurors, an expert may not testify to factors within the ken of the average juror. <em>See Rosales, supra, </em>202 <em>N.J. </em>at 563, 998 A.2d 459. Thus, expert testimony is unnecessary to explain to jurors why a defendant might have falsely confessed after the police allegedly threatened to electrocute him. <em>Id. </em>at 566, 998 A.2d 459. Nor may an expert invade the jury\u2019s role by testifying that a defendant \u201cconfessed to a crime he did not commit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 552, 998 A.2d 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">While <em>Rosales </em>upheld the trial court\u2019s exclusion of expert testimony about false confessions, we find the State\u2019s heavy reliance on <em>Rosales </em>to be misplaced. In <em>Rosales, </em>the Court cited <em>King </em>and <em>Free </em>with approval. It found that, as in <em>Free </em>and unlike in <em>King, </em>the expert evidence Rosales offered consisted of generalities about false confessions, untethered to any recognized psychological disorder.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-9\">In the present case, we agree with the Appellate Division\u2019s conclusion that the proposed expert opinion of Dr. Latimer was more akin to the expert testimony disallowed in <em>Free, supra, </em>and unlike the expert testimony allowed in <em>King, supra. </em>Here, defendant had no longstanding prior diagnosis of a mental disorder. Instead, in support of defendant\u2019s motion to allow expert testimony on false confessions, Dr. Latimer simply alluded to defendant\u2019s generalized notions of anxiety and fear in the interrogation setting, as well as his education and national origin. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Simply stated, we find nothing exceptional about this case to require an expert to opine that defendant gave a false confession. The average juror would understand defendant\u2019s argument that because he was threatened with immediate death by electrocution he gave a false confession to save his life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-5\"><em>[Id. </em>at 566, 998 A.2d 459.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The Court also found that, on the record presented, the proposed testimony \u201cwas not about a field that is at a \u2018state of the art\u2019 to be considered sufficiently reliable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 565, 998 A.2d 459.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> For future guidance, the Court provided a general principle for evaluating expert witness testimony concerning confessions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-7\">We recognize that in some other case the evidence presented may satisfy the <em>New Jersey Rules of Evidence </em>to permit expert testimony regarding a defendant\u2019s confession. We are in general accord with the Attorney General\u2019s suggestion that New Jersey should follow the following principle:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-8\">[EJxpert witnesses may testify to a witness\u2019s or defendant\u2019s mental disorder and the hypothetical effect of that disorder. Expert witnesses may not, however, render an opinion on the defendant\u2019s veracity or reliability of a confession because whether a confession is reliable is a matter in the jury\u2019s exclusive province; it is essential that the testimony actually tell jurors something they would not otherwise know from their usual human experience and that it remain hypothetical or theoretical, and it must stop short of expressing the expert\u2019s judgment on the defendant\u2019s reliability in the specific instance of the confession submitted for the jury\u2019s consideration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 566-67, 998 A.2d 459 (quoting 23 <em>C.J.S. Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 1444 (2006) (footnotes omitted)).!</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">The Court analogized that principle to the rule allowing expert opinion on Child Sexual Abuse Accommodation Syndrome \u201c \u2018to describe traits found in victims of such abuse\u2019 \u201d but not to assess witness credibility or other \u201c \u2018ultimate issues that are for jury resolution.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 567, 998 A.2d 459 (quoting <em>State v. J.Q., </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>554, 556, 617 A.2d 1196 (1993)). The Court drew the same analogy to expert testimony on battered woman\u2019s syndrome. <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>State v. Townsend, </em>186 <em>N.J. </em>473, 492-93, 897 A.2d 316 (2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>This holding was consistent with the Court\u2019s prior ruling in <em>State v. Vandeweaghe, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>229, 827 A.2d 1028 (2003). In <em>Vandeweaghe, </em>a defense expert testified, based on defendant\u2019s history of alcohol addiction and his physical symptoms at the time of the crime, that defendant was so intoxicated that he could not form the mens rea to commit purposeful or knowing murder. <em>Id. </em>at 234, 827 A.2d 1028. In rebuttal, the State produced an expert who testified that because defendant was a longstanding alcoholic, he was actually less likely to be affected by ingesting large amounts of alcohol. <em>Id. </em>at 234-35, 827 A.2d 1028. The Court expressed no disapproval of either expert\u2019s testimony about the effects of defendant\u2019s alcohol addiction. However, the Court held it was prejudicial error for the State\u2019s expert to also testify that the defendant suffered from an antisocial personality disorder that made him more likely to lie and lie successfully. <em>Id. </em>at 239-10, 827 A.2d 1028. That testimony \u201cimpermissibly usurped the jury\u2019s exclusive role in assessing witness\u2019 credibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 239, 827 A.2d 1028.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">In <em>State v. Townsend, supra, </em>186 <em>N.J. </em>at 479, 897 A.2d 316, the State sought to present expert testimony on the issue of battered woman\u2019s syndrome, to explain why the victim\u2019s dying declaration, which exculpated the defendant, might not be credible. As in this case, the expert\u2019s testimony was intended to explain to the jury why a statement normally considered reliable (there, a dying declaration; here, a confession) might be unreliable. The Court held that the expert testimony was admissible. <em>Id. </em>at 499, 897 A.2d 316; <em>see People v. Kowalski, </em>492 <em>Mich. </em>106, 821 <em>N.W.2d </em>14, 36 (2012) (noting that \u201ccircumstances of a false confession are beyond the average person\u2019s understanding\u201d and expert testimony \u201ccan help jurors understand ... counterintuitive behavior.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">In <em>State v. Burr, </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>119, 948 A.2d 627 (2008), the Court held that the defendant could present expert testimony about Asberger\u2019s syndrome in order to explain to the jury defendant\u2019s seemingly odd or suspicious behavior. Citing <em>King </em>with approval, the Court reviewed the myriad situations in which expert psychiat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>ric testimony was appropriate. <em>Id. </em>at 128, 948 A.2d 627. \u201c[E]vidence of mental defect, illness, or condition has been admitted ... to assess credibility or otherwise evaluate the subjective perceptions of an actor.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Court noted that those permissible purposes included evaluating a \u201cdefendant\u2019s false confession claim.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Applying the above cited cases to the record before us, we agree with the trial judge that this case is similar to <em>King </em>and dissimilar to <em>Rosales </em>and <em>Free. </em>Drug addiction and withdrawal are recognized physical and psychological conditions that defendant\u2019s expert was well qualified to explain to the jury. <em>See N.J.R.E. </em>702; <em>King, supra, </em>387 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 544, 904 A.2d 808. Further, lay jurors might not perceive all of the ways in which a person experiencing heroin withdrawal could be vulnerable to giving a false confession.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See N.J.R.E. </em>702. At the <em>N.J.R.E. </em>104 hearing, the expert cogently explained the myriad agonizing symptoms of withdrawal and why lay persons might not understand the extent of withdrawal\u2019s effects on an addict.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">From <em>Crane, </em>we derive the bedrock principle that, to have a meaningful opportunity to attack the credibility of his confession, a defendant must be able to present relevant testimony that will assist the jury in its evaluation of the confession\u2019s reliability. If a defendant has a recognized, diagnosed mental condition, of a type that could make him or her more vulnerable to giving a false confession, the defense has the right to present an expert to explain the mental condition and to explain how and why it could affect the confession\u2019s reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">This case illustrates the importance of such testimony. The State\u2019s case rests heavily, if not exclusively, on defendant\u2019s confession. The prosecutor stated at the <em>N.J.R.E. </em>104 hearing that the forensic evidence was inconclusive. The co-defendants have not implicated defendant in the crime, although one co-defendant pled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>guilty and received a forty-five year sentence. The trial judge noted, during the hearing, that many aspects of defendant\u2019s confession may present fodder for cross-examination of the police who conducted the interrogation. Those include contradictions between what defendant admitted he did to the victim and the forensic evidence found on her body, as well as the manner in which the police conducted the questioning. However, as defense counsel noted, without the expert\u2019s testimony about the physical and mental effects of heroin withdrawal, the defense would be hamstrung in explaining to the jury why defendant would admit to a crime he did not commit. <em>See Crane, supra, </em>476 <em>U.S. </em>at 689, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2146, 90 L.Ed.2d at 644.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">As in <em>King, </em>we agree that an expert may testify that the defendant\u2019s diagnosed mental problems made the defendant vulnerable to giving a false confession and had the capacity to affect the reliability of the defendant\u2019s confession. <em>King, supra, </em>387 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 537-39, 904 A.2d 808. In other words, the defendant\u2019s mental condition may provide an explanation, other than the truth, for the defendant\u2019s confession. In that connection, the expert may explain the nature and symptoms of the defendant\u2019s mental condition (in this ease, heroin addiction and withdrawal) and may explain how those symptoms could have affected defendant\u2019s responses during the interrogation. From our reading of <em>Rosales, </em>we conclude that the expert may not opine that the confession <em>was </em>unreliable, <em>was not </em>credible, or <em>was </em>false. Those issues are for the jury to decide. Moreover, the trial court should provide the jurors with an appropriate limiting instruction to guide their consideration of the expert\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">Finally, we comment on an additional, foundational issue. While an expert can testify to hearsay in explaining his opinion, <em>see N.J.R.E. </em>703(3), the jury cannot consider the included hearsay for its truth. Thus, a defendant may not place before the jury the facts critical to his defense by relying on included hearsay in his expert\u2019s opinion. In this case, there must be some legally competent evidence that defendant was, in fact, suffering from heroin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>withdrawal while the police were interrogating him. Otherwise, his expert\u2019s testimony would be irrelevant and a net opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\"><em>King </em>addressed the issue of included hearsay within a psychological expert\u2019s testimony, and our discussion there provides helpful guidance. We explained that an expert may testify to statements made to him by the defendant, in order to explain the expert\u2019s diagnosis. <em>King, supra, </em>387 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 548, 904 A.2d 808. However, the jury must be cautioned not to consider the defendant\u2019s statements for their truth. <em>Id. </em>at 549, 904 A.2d 808. The analysis in <em>King </em>is worth quoting at length:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-7\">Defendant\u2019s statements to the forensic psychiatrist made during the interviews present a different situation. Our courts have consistently held that a psychiatrist in a criminal ease may testify as to what a defendant told him or her if the expert relied on the statements in formulating an opinion about the defendant\u2019s mental or psychiatric condition, and such hearsay declarations \u201cconstituted a necessary element in the formulation of [the] opinion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-8\">Of course, these hearsay statements are not admitted for their truth, and the expert\u2019s testimony must be circumscribed by an appropriate limiting instruction. Moreover, if the psychiatrist\u2019s opinion hinges upon the truth of defendant\u2019s statement, the jury should be further instructed that the probative value of the psychiatrist\u2019s opinion will depend upon whether there is independent proof of the hearsay statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-9\">We are mindful of the trial court\u2019s concern about the potential for defendant to allow Dr. Harris to parrot and place before the jury defendant\u2019s version of what occurred during the interrogation, without the State\u2019s ability to cross-examine defendant. The trial court, however, erred in imposing a blanket prohibition that appears to bar testimony by Dr. Harris as to <em>any </em>statements made by defendant to him during the clinical interviews <em>pertaining to the interrogation. </em>With this limitation, we cannot perceive how Dr. Harris will be able to provide a factual basis for his opinions and present anything other than a net opinion, unworthy of any consideration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-10\">We believe a general rule of guidance is the wiser course in the posture of this case____[WJithin the guidelines of <em>N.J.R.E. </em>703 and the case law, Dr. Harris shall be permitted to testify as to those statements made to him by defendant during the clinical interviews pertaining to the interrogation that he relied on and were essential to his diagnosis of defendant\u2019s personality disorders and formulation of his medical opinion that these disorders are consistent with defendant\u2019s claim of false confession. Moreover, the information should be of a type typically relied upon in the psychiatric community in making such assessments and diagnoses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-13\"><em>[Id. </em>at 549-50, 904 A.2d 808 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-14\">In this case, the expert opined that aspects of defendant\u2019s physical conduct and appearance during the videotaped interroga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>tion were consistent with heroin withdrawal. The jury could observe that conduct for themselves by watching the video, and could accept or reject the expert\u2019s evaluation. The expert also relied on defendant\u2019s medical records from earlier years, which documented his long history of heroin addiction. Additionally, the expert considered the county jail\u2019s medical records, which included notations that, shortly before defendant confessed, he was treated with Librium, a drug used to blunt the effects of alcohol addiction. However, the expert also based his opinions on interviews with defendant and his family. The jury must be instructed that they cannot consider those interview statements for their truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">As in <em>King, </em>we leave to the trial judge the task of ruling on specific evidentiary issues that may arise during the expert\u2019s trial testimony or during in limine motions. In that regard, we note that the expert\u2019s testimony at the <em>Miranda </em>hearing may serve as a sort of \u201cdress rehearsal\u201d for the trial, without presenting the risk of jury confusion or prejudice. The judge can readily distinguish inadmissible hearsay from admissible evidence presented at that hearing, and the hearing may provide a more complete picture of how the defense intends to use this expert\u2019s testimony at the trial and what, if any, additional factual foundation the defense may present. Nothing in our opinion precludes the State from filing an in limine motion prior to the trial to address specific evidentiary issues relating to the expert\u2019s proposed trial testimony.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b75-11\"> <em>Miranda v.

That is a \"straw man\" argument, based on an inaccurate characterization of the expert's proposed testimony. On cross-examination, the expert explained that \"there is a body of literature that discusses the symptoms and how certain psychiatric disorders can cause a person to be vulnerable to giving ... false confessions but not necessarily saying that this ... psychiatric disorder causes false confessions.\u201d The expert then gave a lengthy explanation of the physical and mental effects of heroin withdrawal and how it could affect an addict\u2019s responses to questions. However, he also testified that he could not opine whether this defendant\u2019s confession was true or false. The State\u2019s argument on this point warrants no further discussion here. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b79-9\"> In <em>McIntosh v. State, </em>532 So.2d 1129, 1130 (Fla.App.1988), the court held that the defendant should have been permitted to present testimony that \"she was, during the confession, jonesing' or coming down from a high which impaired her ability to withstand pressure.\u201d The court did not specify whether the proposed testimony was from a lay or expert witness, but stated that excluding the evidence deprived the defendant of a \u201cmeaningful opportunity\u201d to challenge the confession\u2019s reliability and hence \"to present a complete defense.\u201d <em>Ibid.
