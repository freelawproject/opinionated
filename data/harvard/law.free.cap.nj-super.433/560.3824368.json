Daudelin retired from the Arson Investigation Unit (AIU) of Newark\u2019s Fire Department and later applied to the Division of State Police (Division) for a special permit authorizing certain retired law enforcement officers to carry handguns. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-6 <em>l </em>(l)-(4).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These special carry permits may be issued to retirees who either served in an enumerated law enforcement agency or served with an agency in another state and are \u201cqualified retired law enforcement offieer[s], as [that term is] used in the federal \u2018Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act of 2004\u2019 [ (LEOSA) ], Pub.L. No. 108-277, domiciled in this State.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-6 <em>1; In re Casaleggio, </em>420 <em>N.J.Super. </em>121, 128-29, 18 A.3d 1082 (App.Div.2011) (so interpreting subsection l\u2019s reference to LEOSA, 18 <em>U.S.C.S. </em>\u00a7 926C).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-20\">Another type of carry permit is available to any qualified person who can demonstrate a \u201cjustifiable need\u201d for carrying a handgun. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:58-4d. To acquire one, an applicant must show \u201c \u2018an urgent necessity ... for self-protection\u2019 \u201d based on \u201cspecific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>threats or previous attacks demonstrating a special danger to the applicant\u2019s life that cannot be avoided by other means.\u201d <em>In re Preis, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>564, 571, 573 A.2d 148 (1990) (quoting <em>Siccardi v. State, </em>59 <em>N.J. </em>545, 557, 284 A.2d 533 (1971)). Neither Wheeler nor Daudelin applied for that type of carry permit, because they concluded they could not show \u201cjustifiable need.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">The Division denied Wheeler\u2019s and Daudelin\u2019s application. Challenging the constitutionality of the carry permit laws, both requested a hearing in the Law Division. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-6 <em>l </em>(5). After consolidating the cases and taking testimony, the judge affirmed the denials.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">On appeal, the applicants acknowledge their ineligibility for either type of carry permit and renew and expand their constitutional challenges. The questions presented are: 1) whether the \u201cjustifiable need\u201d requirement of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:58-4d violates the Second Amendment; 2) whether subsection <em>l of N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-6 arbitrarily distinguishes between eligible retired officers and others; 3) whether distinctions between retired officers domiciled in New Jersey and elsewhere violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV, Section 2 \u2014 an issue not raised in the trial court; and 4) whether LEOSA would preempt these applicants\u2019 prosecution for possessing a handgun without a permit in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-5b \u2014 an issue not properly raised in the Law Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Because the facts are not in dispute and the questions turn on interpretation of statutes and the Constitution, we owe no deference to the judge\u2019s determinations. <em>Borough of Harvey Cedars v. Karan, </em>214 <em>N.J. </em>384, 401-02, 70 A.3d 524 (2013); <em>In re Liquidation of Integrity Ins. Co., </em>193 <em>N.J. </em>86, 94, 935 A.2d 1184 (2007); <em>Manalapan Realty, L.P. v. Twp. Comm. of Manalapan, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For the reasons that follow, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>conclude the applicants are not entitled to relief on any ground asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">II. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">Daudelin was assigned to Newark\u2019s AIU in 1984 and served in that unit for about sixteen years before retiring in 2000; he first applied for a special carry permit in April 2011. Wheeler was assigned to the AIU in 1997 and retired with no more than eleven years of service in 2008; he filed this application for a special permit in February 2011.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Both held leadership positions and retired in good standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">Acknowledging their ineligibility for special permits, they offered evidence to demonstrate that their exclusion from the list of eligible retirees is arbitrary. Active members of an AIU have powers equivalent to those of police officers only \u201cwhile engaged in the actual performance of arson investigation duties,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-7.1d, and may carry handguns only \u201cwhile either engaged in the actual performance of arson investigation duties or while actually on call to perform arson investigation duties <em>and </em>when specifically authorized ... to carry weapons.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-6a(8) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But these applicants were on duty or on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>call except when on vacation, and they intervened whenever they observed crimes in progress, even crimes unrelated to their duties, and they worked with officers from the police department, county prosecutor\u2019s office and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms when investigating arsons related to other crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">They also presented evidence of inconsistent application of the special carry permit law. Some AIU retirees had been issued special carry permits based on subsection l\u2019s reference to LEO-SA, but they received those permits prior to this court\u2019s decision in <em>Casaleggio.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Neither Wheeler nor Daudelin made any attempt to establish the \u201cjustifiable need\u201d necessary to obtain an ordinary carry permit. Instead, they argued that if retired officers, who have no police powers, can obtain a carry permit without showing \u201cjustifiable need,\u201d then no one should be required to make that showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">III. The Firearms Law</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">Discussion of the constitutional challenges to the \u201cjustifiable need\u201d component of the carry permit law requires an understanding of the role of \u201cjustifiable need\u201d in the \u201c\u2018careful grid\u2019 of regulatory provisions\u201d comprising our firearms law. <em>Preis, supra, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>at 568, 573 A.2d 148 (quoting <em>State v. Ingram, </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>489, 495 n. 1, 488 A.2d 545 (1985)). Accordingly, the importance of this component of that grid is best understood in context.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">The carry permit law is distinct from laws that provide enhanced punishment for persons who commit crimes with guns or other deadly weapons, which are also part of the careful grid. <em>Id. </em>at 568-69, 573 A.2d 148. As the discussion that follows demonstrates, the carry permit law is one of the regulatory provisions of the firearms laws designed to protect the public before any harm is caused. The regulatory provisions address the danger of serious injury inherent in the ownership and carrying of firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>A. The Purpose, Requirements, Narrow Scope and Role of the Carry Permit Law</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">1. The Purpose and Requirements</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">Some regulatory provisions of the firearms laws \u201ckeep firearms from all such persons whose possession would pose a threat to the public health, safety or welfare,\u201d under any circumstance. <em>Burton v. Sills, </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>86, 93, 248 A.2d 521 (1968), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>394 <em>U.S. </em>812, 89 <em>S.Ct. </em>1486, 22 L.Ed.2d 748 (1969). In order to lawfully acquire a handgun, rifle or shotgun, one must demonstrate that he or she is not disqualified by reason of youth, criminal record history, domestic violence restraining order or disability affecting one\u2019s ability to carry a firearm. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:58-3a-c (requiring prior authorization \u2014 a permit to purchase a handgun or a purchaser identification card for rifles and shotguns \u2014 and enumerating the disqualifying conditions).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">The carry permit law serves a different purpose \u2014 addressing the \u201cserious dangers of misuse and accidental use\u201d inherent even when the person carrying a handgun is law-abiding and responsible. <em>Siccardi, supra, </em>59 <em>N.J. </em>at 558, 284 A.2d 533 (construing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:151-44 <em>(L. </em>1966, c. 60, \u00a7 35, p. 501)). An applicant for a carry permit must demonstrate more than absence of a disqualifying condition. The applicant must show that he or she is \u201cthoroughly familiar with the safe handling and use of handguns\u201d <em>and </em>that he or she has \u201ca justifiable need to carry a handgun.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:58-4d. These two additional requirements make the carry permit \u201cthe most closely-regulated aspect of [this State\u2019s] gun-control laws.\u201d <em>Preis, supra, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>at 568-69, 573 A.2d 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">The additional requirements minimize the danger the carry permit law is intended to address. The showing of proficiency reduces the risk of mishandling. <em>Moore v. Madigan, </em>702 <em>F.</em>3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>933, 941 (7th Cir.2012) (noting the obvious menace when the untrained carry guns in public), <em>reh\u2019g en banc denied, </em>708 F.3d 901 (7th Cir.2013). And the demonstration of particularized need serves to limit \u201cwidespread handgun possession in the streets, somewhat reminiscent of frontier days, would not be at all in the public interest.\u201d <em>Siccardi, supra, </em>59 <em>N.J. </em>at 558, 284 A.2d 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">2. The Narrow Scope</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Although the carry permit is the most closely-regulated aspect of our firearms laws, it affects a very narrow range of conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">The core of the carry permit law is a broadly-stated prohibition against knowing possession of a handgun \u201cwithout first having obtained a permit to carry the same as provided in <em>N.J.S. </em>2C:58-4.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-5b(l). But the scope of that prohibition, and consequently the obligation to establish \u201cjustifiable need\u201d in order to carry and use a handgun, is greatly diminished by numerous statutory exceptions that make <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-5b inapplicable in a wide range of circumstances. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-6 (codifying the exceptions).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">As a practical matter, the exceptions make the prohibition against carrying a handgun applicable only in <em>public places. </em>We use the term \u201cpublic places\u201d throughout this opinion to mean places other than one\u2019s home, business premises, property, places where handguns are lawfully sold and repaired, and places where handguns may be lawfully used for training and practice or recreationally for hunting, competition and exhibition. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-6e, f, g. Because of the exceptions, one does not need a carry permit to keep, carry or use a handgun about one\u2019s home, business premises or land, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-6e, or while lawfully hunting or shooting at a range or in an authorized exhibition, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-6f(l)-(3), or while transporting a handgun, unloaded and secured, between those places and places where guns are sold or repaired. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:39-6e, f, g.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">In each of the instances covered by the foregoing exceptions, a lawful reason, or need, for having a handgun is obvious: keeping <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>or transporting a handgun for lawful use; using it in lawful defense of home, family and property; using it recreationally or for training where that conduct is lawful; and transporting it, secured, in connection with acquisition, maintenance or use for one of the lawful purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">There are additional exceptions that apply to certain persons carrying a loaded handgun in public places. Those eligible are designated by their employment. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-6a, b. Where those exceptions apply, the likely need for use of lawful defensive force is apparent \u2014 either because the persons or things the employee must secure are inherently likely to be of interest to those bent on crime, or because the job is to keep the peace, prevent crime, apprehend, secure or prosecute suspects, or supervise and secure those convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">The employment-based exceptions applicable to workers in the private sector are for guards employed by railway express companies, banks, public utilities transporting explosives, nuclear power plants or companies transporting prisoners pursuant to government contract. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-6c(5), a(10), c(8), c(15). Exempted government employees are members of the military on active duty, police and sheriffs\u2019 officers, prison and jail guards, parole officers, criminal investigators and prosecutors. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-6a(l)-(5), c(6), c(10)-(14), e(16).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">Generally, the carrying privileges afforded to these exempt employees are strictly tied to performance of duties warranting the arming of the employees. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-6a(10), c(5), e(8), c(15) (private sector); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-6a(1)-(2), a(6), a(7)(c), a(8), b(1), c(2), c(4), c(6), c(7) (public sector). The exceptions for some in the public sector are not limited to times when they are on duty or on call, but those officers have statutory duties and police powers not limited to performance of duty.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, the employment exemptions are tailored to need.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>Employment-based exemptions are also conditioned on demonstration of competence in handling firearms. Every exempt employee must successfully complete training and periodically re-qualify under standards set by the New Jersey\u2019s Police Training Commission (PTC). <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-6a, c (enumerating the exceptions); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-6j (requiring training and qualification). That condition minimizes the risk of misuse and accident.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">When the Legislature established the PTC in 1961, it recognized the need for better trained officers upon whom the public could rely. The Legislature determined that professional training for police was required \u201cto better protect the health, safety and welfare of its citizens,\u201d in this \u201cState <em>whose population is increasing in relation to its physical area, </em>and in a society where <em>greater reliance </em>on better law enforcement through higher standards of efficiency is of paramount need____\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17B-66; <em>L. </em>1961, <em>c. </em>56, \u00a7 1, p. 542, (emphasis added). This explanation demonstrates the Legislature\u2019s consistent focus on \u201cneed\u201d in addressing the dangers of carrying handguns in public places. In addition to regulating the carrying of handguns, it has made efforts to address conditions that could reasonably lead the public to perceive a need for being armed in public places.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">All of the foregoing demonstrates the limited, but important, role that the carry permit law has in the grid of New Jersey\u2019s firearms laws \u2014 protection of those in public places of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>densely populated State. Despite the apparent breadth of the statute criminalizing the possession of a handgun without first obtaining a carry permit, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-5b, because of the numerous exceptions available where a good reason for having a handgun is apparent, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-6, a carry permit is necessary only if one wants to have a handgun where it cannot be lawfully used to do anything but repel an unlawful attack. And where a person\u2019s employment gives reason to anticipate a need to use defensive force in places such as the highways, streets, sidewalks, alleys, parks and beaches of this densely populated State (where hunting and target shooting is not allowed), exceptions exempt those employees from the obligation to obtain a carry permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">3. The Similar Roles of Employment-Based Exemptions from the Carry Permit Law and the \u201cJustifiable Need\u201d Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">In the context of the grid of our firearms laws, the \u201cjustifiable need\u201d component of the carry permit law is best understood as accommodating, on a case-by-case basis, those who have a reason \u2014 one based on more than a generalized concern about the prevalence of crime \u2014 to anticipate a violent attack in a public place warranting lawful defensive use of a handgun. <em>Siccardi, supra, </em>59 <em>N.J. </em>at 557, 284 A.2d 533; <em>see, e.g., In re Application of\u201cX\u201d, </em>59 <em>N.J. </em>533, 534-35, 284 A.2d 530 (1971) (affirming denial of carry permit to a businessman because his \u201csituation [did] not differ materially from those confronting many businessmen\u201d and because he had not shown any \u201cspecial dangers to him\u201d). So viewed, carry permits available on a showing of \u201cjustifiable need\u201d serve the same purpose as the categorical employment-based exceptions, which allow those the Legislature has recognized as having jobs likely to require lawful use of a handgun to carry them in public places if adequately trained.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">There are other similarities between carry permits and the employment-based exemptions. Pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:58-4d, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>carry permit may be tailored to the need established by the applicant. A permit may \u201crestrict the applicant as to the types of handguns ... and for what purposes such handguns may be carried.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:58-4d. As previously noted, the employment-based exceptions are also tailored to need. For example, firefighters assigned to AIUs and charged with investigating suspicious fires and explosions, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-6a(8), have authority to carry handguns only while performing or being on call to perform those duties. In contrast, officers who have broader police powers even when off duty have equally broad carrying privileges. <em>See, e.g., N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-6a(7)(a); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:157-2.1 (officers of county or municipal police departments).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Moreover, consistent with the Legislature\u2019s attention to personal need, for example sport and defense of home, and need based on employment, for example guards and police officers, the obligation to show \u201cjustifiable need\u201d can be established in two ways \u2014 a particularized individual need or a particularized need related to employment. As previously noted, applicants for carry permits generally must show \u201c \u2018an urgent necessity ... for self-protection\u2019 \u201d by pointing to \u201cspecific threats or previous attacks demonstrating a special danger to the applicant\u2019s life that cannot be avoided by other means.\u201d <em>Preis, supra, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>at 571, 573 A.2d 148 (quoting <em>Siccardi, supra, </em>59 <em>N.J. </em>at 557, 284 A.2d 533). But carry permits are also available to individuals employed in businesses licensed by the State if they can show: \u201c(1) that ... in the course of performing statutorily \u2014 authorized duties, [they are] subject to a substantial threat of serious bodily harm; and (2) that carrying a handgun is necessary to reduce the threat of unjustifiable serious bodily harm to any person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 576-77, 573 A.2d 148; <em>see N.J.A.C. </em>13:54-2.4(d) (codifying the standards stated in <em>Preis).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The final similarity is related to the Legislature\u2019s focus on the risk inherent in the carrying of handguns in public. Both exempt employees and applicants for carry permits must acquire training necessary to minimize the risk that misuse and accidental use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>handguns poses to others. The PTC-approved training for exempt employees has been discussed above. The regulation adopted to give content to the showing of \u201cthorough familiarity with the safe handling of handguns\u201d that must be made by an applicant for a carry permit, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:58-4d, also requires comparable training in the lawful use as well as the proficient use of handguns. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:54-2.4(b) (1. firearms training substantially equivalent to that approved by the PTC as described in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-6j; 2. recent qualification scores; and 3. a passing score on a test measuring knowledge of laws \u201cgoverning the use of force\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">We do not minimize the significance of the \u201cjustifiable need\u201d requirement where it applies. Regardless of training and absence of a disqualifying condition, a well-trained and wholly law-abiding and responsible person cannot lawfully carry a firearm in a public place unless that person can demonstrate that he or she has \u201ca justifiable need to carry a handgun.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:58-4d. This important component of the law is unmistakably designed to prohibit the public carrying of firearms unless the person has a \u201cjustifiable need\u201d for being armed.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">4. The Role of Special Permits for Retired Police Officers</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">The role of special permits for designated retired law enforcement officers is less apparent. The Legislature\u2019s authorization of special carry permits for these retirees pursuant to subsection <em>l </em>of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-6 appreciably relaxes the \u201cjustifiable need\u201d standard. These special permits were first authorized in 1997. <em>L. </em>1997, c. 67, \u00a7 1 (adding subsection <em>l </em>to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-6). Before that all retired law enforcement officers, like others without police powers or an express statutory employment-based exemption, had to show \u201cjustifiable need\u201d to be authorized to carry a handgun in public places under one of the standards enunciated in <em>Preis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">The absence of a \u201cjustifiable need\u201d requirement for these statutorily designated retirees was intended. A statement accompanying the 1997 legislation states: \u201cRetired law enforcement officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>are afforded no special treatment under current law. In order to carry a handgun after retirement, a retired officer, just like any other citizen, must establish a \u2018justifiable need\u2019 to carry a handgun pursuant to <em>[N.J.S.A] </em>2C:58^4.\u201d <em>Assembly Law &amp; Public Safety Committee Statement to Assembly Committee Substitute for A. 1762, A 1834, A. 1834 </em>(May 13, 1996) (enacted as <em>L. </em>1997, c. 67, \u00a7 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Some basis for the special treatment can be inferred from the officers\u2019 pre-retirement duties, police powers and carrying privileges. Subsection <em>l </em>designates ten categories of retired law enforcement officers eligible for special permits. Eight of the ten are designated by reference to employment with state, interstate and local law enforcement agencies. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-6 <em>l. </em>Prior to retiring, full-time officers in the designated agencies had police powers that were not limited to the time or place of duty and their duties were not tied to investigation of narrow categories of crime, like the investigation of suspicious fires and explosions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-7.1d. As previously discussed, however, retirees who served in AIUs are ineligible, but they, like many other ineligible retirees, had carrying privileges while employed that were tied to actual performance of duties.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The alignment is not perfect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>because some retirees with broad authorization to carry weapons while employed are ineligible for a special permit. But the converse is not true; no retiree with limited authority to carry while employed is eligible.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">The two remaining categories of retirees eligible for special permits are those who were \u201cfull-time federal law enforcement officer[s]\u201d and those domiciled in this State who are eligible as a retiree who is \u201ca qualified retired law enforcement officer\u201d within the meaning of that term as it was defined in LEOSA when adopted in 2004. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-6 <em>l. </em>As these applicants were not federal officers and acknowledge their ineligibility under subsection l\u2019s reference to LEOSA, these categories have no relevance to them.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Two reasons for special permits for retirees consistent with the \u201cjustifiable need\u201d requirement are suggested in the legislative record developed by the congressional committee that released LEOSA. Those reasons are that: 1) arming retirees who are trained and experienced law enforcement officers is a means of preventing crime; and 2) such retirees and their families face a risk of retaliatory criminal violence to which others are not exposed. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 108-560, accompanying H.R. 218, 108th Congress 2d Session (then entitled the \u201cLaw Enforcement Officers Safety Act of 2003\u201d and adopted on July 22, 2004 as P.L. 108-277, the \u201cLaw Enforcement Officers Safety Act of 2004\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>It is unlikely that our Legislature was primarily focused on the public benefits of arming retired law enforcement officers. While private persons may lawfully use force to protect a third person from imminent harm threatened by one using unlawful force, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:3-5, they have limited authority to use force to effect an arrest. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:3-7. The Legislature likely focused on the risk of retaliation faced by these retirees \u2014 that threat distinguishes them from others. And the Legislature could have distinguished these retirees from other well-trained persons based on their experience in assessing street crime and the need for lawful force, on and off duty, prior to retirement.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">5. The Legislature\u2019s \u201cJustifiable Need\u201d Requirement is Consistent with the Lawful Defensive Use of Firearms</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The Legislature has determined that the presence of readily accessible handguns in public places of this densely populated State presents an inherent risk of serious injury from accident and misuse. The risk of accident and misuse in public places of this State where a carry permit is required is enhanced \u2014 if for no other reason than a handgun poses a greater danger in public than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>it would if left at home. <em>Moore, supra, </em>702 <em>F.</em>3d at 937. The use of force to repel an attack or a perceived threat of attack is not lawful if the actor negligently or recklessly creates a risk of injury, causes injury to a non-aggressor or causes injury based on an unreasonable perception of the necessity or lawfulness of the force. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-4a(l), b(l); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-la(l)-(2), b(l); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:3-4 to -5 (requiring a reasonable assessment of threat and its immediacy); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:3-9 (making justifications for the use of defensive force unavailable where the actor is mistaken about the law or recklessly or negligently injures a bystander).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">B. The History of the Carry Permit Law</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">We address the history of the carry permit law only because of the importance history has under the United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent interpretations of the Second Amendment, which we discuss in Part IV of this opinion. That history is discussed in both <em>Siccardi </em>and <em>Preis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">The first measure addressing the danger of carrying firearms was adopted in 1882, and it applied only to youngsters. <em>L. </em>1882, c. IV, \u00a7\u00a7 2-4; <em>Siccardi, supra, </em>59 <em>N.J. </em>at 553, 284 A.2d 533. The first carry permit law was enacted in 1905. <em>L. </em>1905, c. 172, \u00a7 43a, \u0440. 324. It prohibited possession of concealed weapons in public places by anyone who did not hold exempt employment or have a carry permit. <em>Ibid. </em>The 1905 law did not provide a standard for the issuance of carry permits; it left that to the discretion of the mayor or township committee. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">The Legislature first limited issuance of carry permits to those who could demonstrate \u201cneed\u201d in 1924, and at the same time it assigned final responsibility for assessing need to judges. <em>L. </em>1924, \u0441. 137, \u00a7 2, pp. 305-06. The Supreme Court has concluded that the Legislature\u2019s involvement of the judiciary signals the importance legislators place on \u201cthe dangers inherent in carrying handguns and the urgent necessity for their regulation.\u201d <em>Preis, supra, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>at 576, 573 A.2d 148; <em>see Siccardi, supra, </em>59 <em>N.J. </em>at 553, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>284 A.2d 533. Since 1924, all iterations of the carry permit law have continued those critical elements. <em>See, e.g., L. </em>1924, c. 137, \u00a7 1, p. 305; <em>L. </em>1966, c. 60, \u00a7 34, pp. 499-501 <em>(N.J.S.A </em>2A:151-41). Even when the Legislature extended the law to require carry permits for pistols and revolvers, whether carried openly or concealed, the Legislature left the need standard intact. <em>L. </em>1966, c. 60, \u00a7 34, pp. 499-501 <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2A151-41).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">The Legislature changed the label from \u201cneed\u201d to \u201cjustifiable need\u201d when it codified the criminal laws and the firearms laws in Title 2C. But the Legislature did not alter the substance of the standard as interpreted in <em>Siccardi. Preis, supra, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>at 570, 573 A.2d 148; <em>see Siccardi, supra, </em>59 <em>N.J. </em>at 557, 284 A.2d 533 (construing <em>L. </em>1966, c. 60, \u00a7 35, pp. 501-02 <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2A:151-44)); II Final Report of the New Jersey Criminal Law Revision Commission, <em>The New Jersey Penal Code: Commentary </em>\u00a7 2C:58-4 at 370 (1971) (noting the drafters\u2019 intention to continue to current law).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">In short, limiting the possession of handguns in public places to those who have a \u201cjustifiable need\u201d for carrying them is a longstanding measure and one long understood as essential to addressing the dangers of misuse and accidental use. As early as 1925, a three-judge panel considered a Second Amendment challenge to the 1924 law and rejected a defendant\u2019s claim that these measures impermissibly burdened his right. <em>State v. Angelo, </em>3 <em>N.J. Misc. </em>1014, 1014, 130 A. 458 (Sup.Ct.1925). The panel assumed, without discussion, that Amendment applied and afforded an individual right. The panel succinctly stated these reasons for concluding the law did not violate the Amendment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-7\">The right of a citizen to bear arms is not unrestricted. The state government, in the exercise of its police power, may provide such conditions precedent to the light to carry concealed weapons as the safety and welfare of the people of the state in its judgment require. The statute upon which the indictment was based is a valid exercise of the police power.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 1015, 130 A. 458.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>C. The Factual Justifications for the Carry Permit Law</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">The factual basis for the New Jersey Legislature\u2019s longstanding perception of the danger inherent in widespread handgun possession in public places was addressed in <em>Siccardi </em>and based on evidence presented in the Law Division. Because the Court discussed that evidence in <em>Siccardi, </em>there is no reason to provide more than a brief summary here. 59 <em>N.J. </em>at 549-53, 284 A.2d 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">The evidence included testimony from several chiefs of police departments in urban and suburban municipalities and from a representative of the New Jersey Division of State Police. None of the officers were aware of any instance in which a citizen had used a firearm to thwart an attack or successfully defend himself in a public place, and several officers were of the opinion that handguns had limited utility in preventing public attacks because such attacks are sudden, unexpected, brief and made at a time the attacker deems advantageous. <em>Id. </em>at 550-52, 284 A.2d 533. The Court also considered a report prepared for the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence (NCCPV), in which the authors concluded that there was no data establishing the value of firearms as a defense against attack on the street, but recognized that there was evidence that the ready accessibility of guns significantly increases the number of unpremeditated homicides and the seriousness of the injuries sustained in assaults. <em>Id. </em>at 552, 284 A.2d 533. The Court quoted a portion of the NCCPV\u2019s recommendations suggesting federal legislation encouraging states to limit handgun <em>ownership </em>\u201c \u2018to police officers and security guards, small businesses in high crime areas, and others with a special need for self-protection.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting Final Report, National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence, p. 181 (1969)). And, the Court cited numerous law review articles addressing gun control laws and their efficacy. <em>Id. </em>at 552-53, 284 A.2d 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">The Legislature also considered evidence before amending the carry permit law in 1966 to cover the open, as well as the concealed, carrying of pistols and revolvers. <em>See Assembly Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number><em>mittee on State Government, </em>Public Hearing on Assembly Bill A-165, \u201can Act concerning firearms and other dangerous weapons and revising, repealing and supplementing parts of the statutory law,\u201d Mar. 2, 1966. That evidence is not discussed in <em>Siccardi. </em>Although the hearing is fairly characterized as spirited, the proposed extension of the carry permit law to reach unconcealed handguns drew little comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The then Attorney General, Arthur J. Sills, advised that the F.B.I. Uniform Crime Reports for 1964 showed that \u201c96 per cent of the 225 police officers slain [between 1960 and 1964] were killed with firearms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8. The Attorney General also compared the rate at which homicides were committed with firearms in cities that did and did not have strict gun control laws. <em>Id. </em>at 11-12. In New York City, where the state gun control laws were, in the Attorney General\u2019s view, strict, \u201c[o]f the 637 homicides ... in 1964, firearms were used in 26 per cent of the cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11. In Texas, which in his view had very little gun control, \u201cfirearms were involved in 72 per cent of all murders in 1963 in Dallas.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The focus of the proponents and the opponents of the legislative reform was on new measures concerning acquisition, not the carrying of firearms. <em>Id. </em>at 2-7,18-20. The disputes centered on measures like finger-printing and record-keeping and aimed at keeping firearms from the irresponsible and violators of law. <em>Id. </em>at 2-7, 19-21. In the Attorney General\u2019s view those measures were the major thrust of the reform. <em>Id. </em>at 2, 7. With respect to carry permits, he simply noted that permits would be \u201crequired as under present law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">Secretary L. Arthur Burton spoke for a \u201cCitizens Committee for Firearms Legislation,\u201d which was comprised of \u201cfifteen individuals\u201d representing local and national associations that were then \u201cthe major sporting and shooting organizations in the State.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 17-18. Mr. Burton implicitly endorsed the prohibition against the public carrying of revolvers and pistols without a carry permit by noting his Committee\u2019s support for proposed restrictions on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>transporting loaded and uncased pistols and revolvers. <em>Id. </em>at 27. The only objection to carry permits he voiced were: 1) that the Bill, as then drafted, might be understood to require a carry permit for rifles and shotguns; and 2) that the obligation to \u201cdemonstrate familiarity with\u201d and \u201csufficient skill and knowledge\u201d of handguns was meaningless without prescribed standards. <em>Id. </em>at 21-22, 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Similarly, a member of the Executive Committee of the Directors of the National Rifle Association, Louis A. Benton, testified in opposition to some aspects of the proposed reform. He did not comment on carry permits or the prohibition against carrying a pistol or revolver openly without one. <em>Id. </em>at 54-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Another witness, the operator of a licensed detective agency, mentioned the \u201cneed\u201d component of the carry permit law, but he simply suggested addition of a standard for assessing the \u201cneed of the applicant,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 78A-79A, which the Court supplied in <em>Siccardi. </em>He also urged an amendment that would add a new exception \u2014 one he viewed as a trade off for the new limitation on carrying openly \u2014 for persons in \u201cfresh pursuit of a criminal, in the act of preventing a crime, defending [themselves] against a crime, and attempting to apprehend a criminal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 78A.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">For the most part, no change in the permit law was required to address the detective\u2019s concerns. As a matter of law, in \u201cthose rare and momentary circumstances where an individual arms himself spontaneously to meet an immediate danger,\u201d self-defense and defense of others are viable defenses to possession in violation of a regulatory offense, like the carry permit law. <em>State v. Harmon, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>189, 208-09, 516 A.2d 1047 (1986). In contrast, \u201cthe policies embodied in our gun control laws, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-3 and -5, [do] not allow self-defense as an excuse or justification to a charge of unlawful possession under a regulatory offense when a person arms himself prior to a danger becoming imminent.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(discussing cases decided under laws of the District of Columbia, Maryland, Tennessee and Texas reaching the same conclusion).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>D. Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Some might argue, as these applicants do, that the \u201cjustifiable need\u201d requirement is unnecessary to prevent the danger of misuse and accidental use inherent in the widespread carrying of handguns in public places of this densely populated State. In their view, limiting carry permits to law-abiding and responsible persons with adequate training is enough. But the wisdom of this policy choice involves a predictive judgment for the Legislative and Executive Branches to make in furtherance of one of the government\u2019s primary obligations \u2014 the safety of the public. <em>United States v. Salerno, </em>481 <em>U.S. </em>739, 745, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>2095, 2100, 95 L.Ed.2d 697, 707-08 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">The only question for us is whether conditioning the issuance of carry permits on a showing of \u201cjustifiable need\u201d is a step the Second Amendment allows. With the foundation for that inquiry now in place, we turn to consider the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">IY. The Second Amendment</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">A. The Claim Presented</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">These applicants argue that New Jersey\u2019s \u201cjustifiable need\u201d requirement makes carry permits \u201cunobtainable by all but a few applicants,\u201d rendering the right to use a handgun in lawful self-defense \u201cillusory\u201d and, thereby, violative of their Second Amendment right. The weight of authority is against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">New Jersey\u2019s law is far from unique. Hawaii,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Maryland,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Massachusetts,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> New York,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and Rhode Island<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> similarly condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>tion the carrying of handguns on a showing of particularized need.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Other courts have considered and, with the exception of one whose decision was reversed on appeal, uniformly rejected challenges to laws that condition the issuance of carry permits on an objective showing of a need different than that of the general populace. <em>Drake v.

The Narrow Holdings in <em>Heller </em>and <em>McDonald</em></p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">The questions before the Court in <em>Heller </em>and <em>McDonald </em>were narrow, and their holdings are as well. <em>Heller </em>involved challenges to the District of Columbia\u2019s laws effectively \u201cban[ning] the possession of handguns in the home,\u201d and <em>McDonald </em>involved challenges to \u201csimilar\u201d laws of the City of Chicago and one of its suburbs. <em>McDonald, supra, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 130 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3026, 177 L.Ed.2d at 903.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">Adopting the \u201coriginal understanding\u201d of the Second Amendment in <em>Heller, </em>the Court held that \u201cthe District\u2019s ban on handgun possession in the home violates the Second Amendment, as does its prohibition against rendering any lawful firearm in the home operable for the purpose of immediate self-defense.\u201d 554 <em>U.S. </em>at 635, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2821-22, 171 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 683-84. In <em>McDonald, </em>the Court held that the Second Amendment right \u201crecognized in <em>Heller </em>\u201d is applicable to the states and described it as \u201cthe right to possess a handgun <em>in the home </em>for purpose of self-defense.\u201d \u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at -, 130 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3050, 177 L.Ed.2d at 929 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-12\">The Supreme Court also linked the Amendment\u2019s protection to the home when explaining why the District\u2019s laws could not withstand scrutiny under any standard applied to enumerated rights. <em>Heller, supra, </em>554 <em>U.S. </em>at 628, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2817-18, 171 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 679. The Court reasoned that the home is the place \u201cwhere the need for defense of self, family, and property is most acute\u201d and that the District\u2019s laws made \u201cit impossible for citizens to use [handguns] for the <em>core </em>lawful purpose of self-defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 628-30, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2817-18, 171 L.Ed.2d at 679-80 (emphasis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>added) (quoted in part in <em>McDonald, supra, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 130 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3036, 177 L.Ed.2d at 914-15).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">2. The Broad Reasoning Supporting the Narrow Holdings in <em>Heller </em>and <em>McDonald</em></p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">Despite the narrow holdings, the Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Heller </em>and <em>McDonald </em>suggests that the Second Amendment\u2019s protection extends beyond the home. In considering the Amendment\u2019s text as it would have been understood by the voters approving it, the historical background, and the 19th century understanding of the Amendment\u2019s scope,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>id. </em>at 576-619, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2788-2812, 171 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d at 648-74, the Court discerned that the individual right protected is a right \u201cto possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation\u201d; the <em>\u201ccentral component\u201d </em>of which is \u201cself-defense\u201d; a right \u201cto bear arms for defensive purposes\u201d; and a right \u201cto use arms for self-defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 592, 599, 602, 672, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2797, 2801, 2803, 2811, 171 L.Ed.2d at 657, 662-63, 672; <em>see also id. </em>at 599, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2801, 171 L.Ed.2d at 662 (noting at the time the Amendment was adopted \u201cmost undoubtedly thought [the right] even more important for self-defense and hunting\u201d than for membership in the militia) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">In <em>McDonald, </em>the Court referred to Heller\u2019s broad reasoning. Indeed, in the opening paragraph Justice Alito states that the <em>Heller </em>Court held that the \u201cSecond Amendment protects the right to keep and bear arms for the purpose of self-defense.\u201d \u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 130 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3026, 177 L.Ed.2d at 903. Elsewhere Justice Alito stated, \u201cthe Second Amendment protects a personal right to keep and bear arms for lawful purposes, <em>most notably </em>for self-defense within the home.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 130 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3044, 177 L.Ed.2d at 922 (emphasis added); <em>cf. id. </em>at-, 130 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3050, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>177 L.Ed.2d at 929 (Justice Alito\u2019s narrower description of the \u201cright recognized in Hellerwhich is quoted above).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">3. The Threshold Question Raised by the Court\u2019s Narrow Holdings and Broader Reasoning</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Several courts considering challenges to laws that restrict the carrying of handguns outside the home have identified a threshold question \u2014 whether the Second Amendment as interpreted in <em>Heller </em>and <em>McDonald </em>protects any conduct in the public sphere. They either reached different conclusions or avoided the question by assuming the Amendment applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Declining to assign any greater significance to <em>Heller </em>and <em>McDonald </em>than the narrow holdings require, Maryland\u2019s High Court has upheld that State\u2019s law conditioning issuance of permits authorizing public carrying of handguns on a showing of \u201cgood and substantial reason\u201d on the ground that it has no application to conduct in the home. <em>Williams, supra, </em>417 <em>Md. </em>479, 10 A.3d at 1177 (noting that \u201c[i]f the Supreme Court, in this dicta, meant its holding to extend beyond home possession, it will need to say so more plainly\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">In contrast, focusing on the Court\u2019s broad reasoning in <em>Heller </em>and <em>McDonald, </em>the Seventh Circuit has concluded the right to \u201cbear arms for self-defense\u201d recognized in <em>Heller </em>is as important \u201coutside the home as inside.\u201d <em>Moore, supra, </em>702 <em>F.</em>3d at 935-36, 942. The majority concluded that Illinois\u2019 unique and absolute ban against carrying in public, applicable to all but law enforcement officers and guards, went too far. <em>Id. </em>at 941-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">Other courts, addressing carry permits issued only on a particularized showing of need to have one in public places for self-defense, have left the question unresolved. They have concluded that uncertainties about whether and how the Second Amendment right applies outside the home left by <em>Heller </em>and <em>McDonald </em>warrant caution. They have assumed there is a right to carry a handgun outside the home in the event of an encounter warranting its defensive use, and rejected challenges to these laws. These <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>courts have rejected the challenges on the ground that a law conditioning the issuance of a carry permit on a showing of need is not inconsistent with or does not impermissibly burden the right. <em>Drake, supra, </em>724 F.3d at 429-30, 433; <em>Woollard, supra, </em>712 F.3d at 874, 876; <em>Kachalsky, supra, </em>701 F.3d at 89, 93-94; <em>see also United States v. Masciandaro, </em>638 F.3d 458, 475 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>-, 132 <em>S.Ct. </em>756, 181 L.Ed.2d 482 (2011).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The majority in <em>Heller </em>recognized it was leaving many questions unresolved. Justice Scalia explained, this \u201cfirst in-depth examination of the Second Amendment,\u201d should not be \u201cexpect[ed] to clarify the entire field.\u201d <em>Heller, supra, </em>554 <em>U.S. </em>at 635, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2821, 171 L.Ed.2d at 683. The reasons for caution cut in both directions \u2014 a risk of extending the Second Amendment right beyond what the <em>Heller </em>Court intended, <em>United States v. Skoien, </em>614 F.3d 638, 640 (7th Cir.2010) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>-, 131 <em>S.Ct. </em>1674, 179 L.Ed.2d 645 (2011), and a risk of reading Heller\u2019s discussion of the limited nature of the right too broadly and thereby <em>improperly </em>limiting Heller\u2019s intended scope, <em>United States v. Marzzarella, </em>614 F.3d 85, 91 (3d Cir.2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>-, 131 <em>S.Ct. </em>958, 178 L.Ed.2d 790 (2011). We agree that the principle of \u201cconstitutional avoidance\u201d favors leaving constitutional issues that need not be decided for another day. <em>Masciandaro, supra, </em>638 F.3d at 475.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Based upon the broad reasoning of <em>Heller </em>and <em>McDonald, </em>we think the Second Amendment right to carry a handgun for the purpose of lawful self-defense exists or extends beyond the home. Nevertheless, we have no reason to decide that question. We are confident that New Jersey\u2019s \u201cjustifiable need\u201d standard would not impermissibly burden the right. We can reject this challenge to the carry permit law on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Our conclusion that the \u201cjustifiable need\u201d requirement is permissible rests on the Court\u2019s discussion of the limitations that are consistent with the original meaning of the Second Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">4. Limitations on the Right</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">As the Supreme Court explained, \u201cLike most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited.\u201d <em>Heller, supra, </em>554 <em>U.S. </em>at 626, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2816, 171 L.Ed.2d at 678. The Amendment\u2019s scope is defined by the limitations and the license taken together. The Second Amendment right and other \u201cConstitutional rights are enshrined with the scope they were understood to have when the people adopted them, whether or not future legislatures or (yes) even future judges think that scope too broad.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 634-35, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2821, 171 L.Ed.2d at 683. The Amendment\u2019s scope is a <em>\u201cproduct </em>of an interest balancing by the people,\u201d a balancing reflecting the limitations, as well as the protections, that were understood at the time of adoption \u2014 1791. <em>Id. </em>at 635, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2821, 171 L.Ed.2d at 683.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">The Court did not attempt to define the complete or entire \u201cproduct\u201d of the original interest balancing. Instead it explained, \u201c[w]hatever else [the Amendment] leaves to future evaluation, it surely elevates above all other interests the right of <em>law-abiding, responsible </em>citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 635, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2821, 171 L.Ed.2d at 683 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">The Court\u2019s description of the \u201cproduct\u201d of original balancing includes two categorical limitations on the Amendment\u2019s scope that the Court deemed part of the original meaning. The irresponsible and the non-law abiding are excluded from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>Amendment\u2019s protection, wherever they may be, even in the home. Indeed, the Court recognized the permissibility of these categorical exclusions of persons by including modern laws applicable to felons and the mentally ill in a partial listing of longstanding measures the Court declared to be \u201cpresumptively lawful.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 626-27 &amp; 627 n. 26, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2816-17, 171 L.Ed.2d at 678.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The Court identified other limitations similarly understood to be part of the pre-existing right. On its understanding of the original meaning, the <em>Heller </em>Court concluded that from the time preceding its adoption through the 19th century, the Second Amendment was <em>not </em>understood to be \u201ca right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.\u201d <em>Heller, supra, </em>554 <em>U.S. </em>at 626, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2816, 171 L.Ed.2d at 678, (quoted, in part, in <em>McDonald, </em>- <em>U.S. </em>at -, 130 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3047, 177 L.Ed.2d at 926).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">The Court went on to address limitations understood to leave some weapons, some manners of carrying them, and some purposes for carrying them outside the scope of the Amendment\u2019s prohibition. The conclusions the Court drew based on laws in place around 1791 provide some guidance for courts considering challenges to the modern-day laws. (We use the phrase \u201caround 1791\u201d as a shorthand for the years before and after 1791 that the Court deemed informative to the original understanding.)</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">With respect to \u201cbearable\u201d weapons, the Court concluded the Amendment protects those in common use at the time but not those \u201cunusual\u201d or \u201cdangerous\u201d weapons \u201cnot typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes.\u201d <em>Heller, supra, </em>554 <em>U.S. </em>at 625-27, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2816-17, 171 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 677-79. Thus, the protection was not understood to extend to the keeping, carrying or using of weapons that were deemed \u201cdangerous\u201d or \u201cunusual,\u201d in the sense that they were not typically used by the \u201claw-abiding\u201d and \u201cresponsible\u201d for \u201clawful purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">Importantly, however, the Court looked to modern-day preferences in weapons in addressing the District of Columbia\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>restrictions on handguns. Characterizing the claim \u201cthat only those arms in existence in the 18th century are protected\u201d as one \u201cbordering on the frivolous,\u201d the Court concluded that the Amendment\u2019s protection \u201cextends, prima facie\u201d to \u201call instruments that constitute bearable arms, even those that were not in existence at the time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 582, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2791-92, 171 L.Ed.2d at 651. In invalidating the District\u2019s laws effectively banning operable handguns from the home, the Court focused on the current popularity of handguns as the weapon of choice for self-defense. The Court did so with reference to evidence on the current popularity of handguns, not their popularity around 1791. <em>Id. </em>at 629-30, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2818-19, 171 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 680; <em>see id. </em>at 628, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2818, <em>171 L.Ed.2d </em>at 679 (quoting <em>Parker v. District of Columbia, </em>478 id 370, 400 (D.C.Cir.2007) (a case relying on Gary Kleck &amp; Marc Gertz, <em>Armed Resistance to Crime: The Prevalence and Nature of Self-Defense with a Gun, </em>86 J.Crim. L. &amp; Criminology 150, 182-83 (1995), which addresses modern-day preferences to support the assertion)). We take this to mean that present-day considerations are relevant to interpretation of the original understanding' \u2014 at least in this context of defining the class of bearable weapons that may be kept, carried and used.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">With respect to limitations on the purpose \u2014 in our view, something that is only understandable with reference to the uses or goals that are objects of the \u201cpurpose\u201d \u2014 the Court consistently referred to protected purposes as \u201clawful\u201d and not \u201cunlawful.\u201d In addition to the lawful defensive uses of weapons discussed in subsection 5 of this Part of our opinion, the Court identified no lawful purposes other than hunting and training. <em>Id. </em>at 604, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2804, <em>171 L.Ed.2d </em>at 665.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">The only unprotected purposes and uses the Court recognized were those in furtherance of crimes and the \u201cindiscreet firing of guns\u201d in one city on specified dates around New Year\u2019s, which the Court concluded would not have been applied to punish one who fired in self-defense and that, even if it had been, the minimal sanctions for violation would not deter one from acting in neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>sary self-defense. <em>Id. </em>at 632-33, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2820, 171 L.Ed.2d at 681-82.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Most pertinent here, the Court also provided examples of limitations on the \u201cmanner\u201d of carrying and using firearms in public places, originally understood to be part of the enshrined right. Immediately following its assertion about limitations on the manner and purposes of arming oneself that are part of the original meaning, the Court stated: \u201c[f]or example, the majority of the 19th century courts to consider the question held that prohibitions on carrying concealed weapons were lawful under the Second Amendment or state analogues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 626, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2816, 171 L.Ed.2d at 678; <em>see also Robertson v. Baldwin, </em>165 <em>U.S. </em>275, 281-82, 17 <em>S.Ct. </em>326, 329, 41 <em>L.Ed. </em>715, 717 (1897) (observing in <em>dicta </em>that \u201cthe right of the people to keep and bear arms ... is not infringed by laws prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">As previously noted, in the first quarter of the 20th century, a New Jersey court joined the courts rejecting a Second Amendment challenge to a concealed weapons ban, which applied absent a carry permit issued on a showing of need. <em>Angelo, supra, </em>3 <em>N.J. Misc. </em>at 1014-15, 130 <em>A. </em>458 (quoted in Part III, B above); <em>cf. Burton, supra, </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>at 100-06, 248 A.2d 521 (concluding the Amendment has no relevance to state laws \u2014 an interpretation now foreclosed by McDonald).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">We take the <em>Heller </em>Court\u2019s recognition of the acceptance of prohibitions against concealed carrying as an indication that regulation of the manner of carrying bearable arms in public places \u2014 at least the concealed carrying \u2014 was understood to be part of the right. In <em>Kachalsky, </em>the Second Circuit reached that conclusion after an extensive review of laws in place around 1791. 701 F.3d at 89-91, 94-96. One need not agree with that court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>analysis of every law discussed to agree with its conclusion that \u201cstate regulation of the use of firearms in public was \u2018enshrined withfin] the scope\u2019 of the Second Amendment when it was adopted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 96 (quoting <em>Heller, supra, </em>554 <em>U.S. </em>at 634, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2821, 171 L.Ed.2d at 683); <em>accord Drake, supra, </em>724 F.3d at 433 (concluding that the \u201c \u2018justifiable need\u2019 standard fits comfortably within the longstanding tradition of regulating the public carrying of weapons for self-defense\u201d); <em>Masciandaro, supra, </em>638 F.3d at 470 (observing that rights to firearms outside the home \u201chave always been more limited,\u201d because of the implications for public safety).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">The <em>Kachalsky </em>court\u2019s conclusion is also supported by <em>Heller. </em>The Supreme Court has made clear that there are permissible limitations other than those it expressly identified in <em>Heller </em>and <em>McDonald </em>as being within the Amendment\u2019s original meaning. In both opinions, the Court stressed that it should not be understood to \u201ccast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.\u201d <em>Heller, supra, </em>554 <em>U.S. </em>at 626-27, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2816-17, 171 L.Ed.2d at 678; <em>McDonald, supra, </em>- <em>U.S. </em>at-, 130 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3047, 177 L.Ed.2d at 926.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Pertinent to the \u201cjustifiable need\u201d component of the carry permit law, the Court\u2019s partial list approves absolute prohibitions of bearing firearms, without regard to the need to use defensive force, in certain public places that are \u201csensitive\u201d- \u2014 schools and government buildings. General prohibitions of that sort are not based on characteristics of the person carrying them. Thus, the Court\u2019s determination that bans on carrying in sensitive places are presumptively lawful had to be based on the Court\u2019s recognition that the Amendment was understood to allow the government to protect against dangers posed by any person possessing a firearm in these \u201csensitive\u201d public places, despite the obvious and absolute impact on the use of a firearm defensively in those places. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>Because of the importance the Court placed on the Amendment\u2019s original meaning, we conclude the Court must have deemed such regulation in \u201csensitive\u201d public places consistent with the original meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">True, laws like New York\u2019s, Maryland\u2019s and New Jersey\u2019s, which condition issuance of carry permits on a particularized showing of need have no precise models in laws in existence around 1791 or in the <em>Heller </em>Court\u2019s list of presumptively lawful measures. <em>See Kachalsky, supra, </em>701 F.3d at 90 n. 11, 91. But the <em>Heller </em>Court stressed that it intended its list to illustrate, not exhaustively define, the class of laws entitled to a presumption of validity. <em>Heller, supra, </em>554 <em>U.S. </em>at 627 n. 26, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2817, 171 L.Ed.2d at 678. As others have noted, the list is neither a \u201ctalismanic formula,\u201d <em>Kachalsky, supra, </em>701 F.3d at 90 n. 11, nor part of a \u201ccomprehensive code,\u201d <em>Skoien, supra, </em>614 F.3d at 640.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Moreover, <em>Heller </em>makes it clear that the role of legislatures did not end with the Amendment\u2019s adoption in 1791. As others have noted, Heller\u2019s partial listing of \u201cpresumptively lawful\u201d measures includes modern-day laws consistent with the original meaning that do not parrot laws in place around 1791. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>644 F.3d 12, 23-25 (1st Cir.) (noting that 20th century laws disqualifying felons, included in Heller\u2019s list of presumptively lawful laws, likely bear little resemblance to their historical predicates), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 <em>S.Ct. </em>1538, 182 L.Ed.2d 175 (2012); <em>see also id. </em>at 24 n. 13 (noting that the \u201chistorical pedigree of laws disarming those convicted of a crime is subject to substantial debate among scholars\u201d); <em>accord Skoien, supra, </em>614 F.3d at 640-41. Moreover, the plurality opinion in <em>McDonald </em>stated, \u201cincorporation [of the Second Amendment through the Due Process Clause] does not imperil every law regulating firearms,\u201d \u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at -, 130 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3047, 177 L.Ed.2d at 926, and it explained that incorporation \u201cby no means eliminates\u201d a state\u2019s \u201cability to devise solutions to social problems that suit local needs and values.\u201d \u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 130 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3046, 177 L.Ed.2d at 925.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>Taking the statements, the holdings and the Court\u2019s reasoning on the enshrined limitations together, we conclude that, since the Amendment\u2019s adoption, legislators have been permitted to address current problems through regulations not inconsistent with or directed at suppressing or effectively extinguishing the right. The Court suggested as much when it stressed that its invalidation of the District of Columbia\u2019s law making it impossible to use a handgun for self-defense in the home should not be understood to suggest \u201cthe invalidity of laws regulating the storage of firearms <em>to prevent accidents.\u201d Heller, supra, </em>554 <em>U.S. </em>at 632, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2820, 171 L.Ed.2d at 681 (emphasis added). The Court had not discussed any historical predicates for laws designed to prevent accidental discharge of a firearm in the home or included such measures in its illustrative list of presumptively lawful measures. We take this as an indication that despite the absence of any direct model in older laws, measures short of total bans designed to prevent accidental injuries with firearms are permissible, even in the home where the need for lawful defensive use is \u201cmost acute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Finally, <em>Heller\u2019s </em>closing passage must be understood to leave room for a continuing role for legislatures. There, the Court acknowledged the problem of \u201chandgun violence\u201d in this country and explained that the \u201censhrinement of constitutional rights\u201d takes some policy choices for dealing with gun violence \u201coff the table\u201d \u2014 \u201cinclud[ing] the [option of an] absolute prohibition of handguns held and used for self-defense in the home.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 636, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2822, 171 L.Ed.2d at 684. Nevertheless, the Court stressed that \u201c[t]he Constitution leaves ... a variety of tools for combating\u201d handgun violence \u201cincluding some measures regulating handguns.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Court left identification of the permissible tools for the future, without providing any specific guidance beyond a cross-reference to its partial listing of \u201cpresumptively lawful\u201d measures. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">5. The Standard of Scrutiny</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">For the purpose of resolving this Second Amendment challenge before us, we are assuming that the Second Amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>protects the right of law-abiding and responsible citizens (those protected by the Amendment under Heller), to carry a handgun (a firearm protected by the Amendment under Heller), in public places for lawful defensive use (the only protected purpose for carrying a handgun under <em>Heller </em>in public places where the obligation to show justifiable need pertains, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-5, -6). On those assumptions, we conclude that intermediate scrutiny is the proper measure of the validity of this component of New Jersey\u2019s carry permit law.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\"><em>Heller </em>strongly suggests that one of \u201cthe standards of scrutiny that [the Court has] applied to enumerated constitutional rights\u201d should be employed in determining whether a law regulating firearms goes too far. 554 <em>U.S. </em>at 628, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2851, 171 L.Ed.2d at 714. And the Court effectively narrowed the potentially applicable standards to strict and intermediate scrutiny by concluding that the rational basis test \u201ccould not be used to evaluate the extent to which a legislature may regulate a specific, enumerated right, be it freedom of speech, the guarantee against double jeopardy, the right to counsel, or the right to keep and bear arms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 628 n. 27, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2817, 171 L.Ed.2d at 679.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">With respect to the bases for selecting between strict and intermediate scrutiny, the <em>Heller </em>Court avoided that constitutional question by noting the District of Columbia laws at issue would not pass muster under either. 554 <em>U.S. </em>at 628-29, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2817-19, 171 L.Ed.2d at 679-80. Consequently, from <em>Heller, </em>we know little more than that a law will not pass intermediate or strict scrutiny if it effectively bans an \u201centire class of \u2018arms\u2019 that is overwhelmingly chosen by American society for ... lawful purposes\u201d \u2014 handguns\u2014and extends to the home, where the \u201cneed\u201d for use of lawful defensive force is \u201cmost acute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 628, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2817, 171 L.Ed.2d at 679. Those were the bases for the <em>Heller </em>Court\u2019s holding \u2014 that the District\u2019s law \u201cbanning from the home \u2018the most preferred firearms in the nation to keep and use for protection of one\u2019s home and family,\u2019 would fail constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>muster.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 628-29 n. 27, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2817-18, 171 L.Ed.2d at 679.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Each of the three federal courts of appeals that have scrutinized laws comparable to New Jersey\u2019s \u201cjustifiable need\u201d standard have determined that an \u201cintermediate\u201d level of scrutiny is appropriate. In selecting intermediate scrutiny, all three courts considered Heller\u2019s reference to the \u201ccore\u201d right of self-defense in the home. <em>Drake, supra, </em>724 F.3d at 429-30; <em>Woollard, supra, </em>712 <em>F.</em>3d at 876; <em>Kachalsky, supra, </em>701 F.3d at 93. Because we are assuming a right that extends beyond the home, we do not rely on anything special about the right in the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">We deem an intermediate level of scrutiny appropriate for laws restricting only conduct in public places, because restrictions on the right imposed in the interest of safety and order in public places have always been understood to be part of the Amendment\u2019s scope. <em>Kachalsky, supra, </em>701 F.3d at 96-97 (determining that state regulation of firearms in public was enshrined with the Amendment and favored intermediate scrutiny); <em>Woollard, supra, </em>712 F.3d at 876 (same, noting that \u201c \u2018outside the home, firearm rights have always been more limited, because public safety interests often outweigh individual interests in self-defense\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>Masciandaro, supra, </em>638 <em>F.</em>3d at 470)). After all, the <em>Heller </em>Court identified absolute bans against possession of firearms in some \u201csensitive\u201d public places as presumptively lawful and illustrated the limited nature of the right by noting the widespread acceptance of concealed carrying bans by 19th century courts. 554 <em>U.S. </em>at 626-27, 627 n. 26, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2816-17, 171 L.Ed.2d at 678.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">As the Fourth Circuit explained in <em>Masciandaro, supra, </em>638 F.3d at 470-71: \u201cOne of the principal [19th century] cases relied upon in <em>Heller </em>upheld a state concealed carrying ban after applying review of a decidedly less-than-strict nature. <em>See Nunn v. State, </em>1 <em>Ga. </em>243, 249 (1846).\u201d In <em>Nunn, </em>the court concluded,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-9\">a law which is merely intended to promote personal security, and to put down lawless aggression and violence, and to this end prohibits the wearing of certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>weapons in such a manner as is calculated to exert an unhappy influence upon the moral feelings of the wearer, by making him less regardful of the personal security of others, does not come in collision with the Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-5\">[1 <em>Ga. </em>at 249.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">In our view, the extent of the burden a law imposes on exercise of the right is also relevant to the degree of scrutiny. <em>Kachalsky, supra, </em>701 F.3d at 93; <em>Marzzarella, supra, </em>614 F.3d at 97. In <em>Moore, </em>the Seventh Circuit invalidated an Illinois law that imposed \u201ca flat ban on carrying ready to use guns outside the home.\u201d 702 F.3d at 937, 940-42. As we understand the decision, it is primarily based on the extremity of the burden. The majority noted that its decision rested not on \u201cdegrees of scrutiny\u201d but on the state\u2019s failure to \u201cjustify the most restrictive gun law of any of the 50 states,\u201d which went \u201ctoo far.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The court invalidated the law because Illinois should have but failed to show more than a \u201crational basis\u201d for concluding that its \u201cuniquely sweeping ban was justified by an increase in public safety.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 942.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">In the course of its decision, the <em>Moore </em>court referred to New York\u2019s proper cause requirement, noting that, unlike the Illinois law, it recognized that \u201cthe interest in self-defense extends outside the home.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 940. In staying its mandate to permit the legislature to draft a new law imposing \u201creasonable limitations, consistent with the public safety and the Second Amendment as interpreted in [its] opinion, on the carrying of guns in public,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 942, the court provided some guidance. Although the majority viewed the distinction between regulations applicable in the home and public places with some disapproval, <em>id. </em>at 941, it observed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>that other states \u201chave decided that a proper balance between the interest in self-defense and the dangers created by carrying guns in public is to limit the right to carry a gun to responsible persons rather than to ban public carriage altogether ____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 940. Thus, while the court did not say so, its description of a law that would pass muster does not suggest that it be drafted with an eye toward passing strict scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">We have not found any <em>post-Heller </em>decision in which a court concluded that a firearms law should be subjected to strict scrutiny. Even courts considering a new law extending the presumptively lawful categorical bar that applies to felons, applicable wherever the person may be, to include persons convicted of misdemeanors involving physical domestic violence, have applied a level of scrutiny less stringent than strict. The Seventh Circuit found no need to \u201cget more deeply into the \u2018levels of scrutiny\u2019 quagmire,\u201d because \u201cpreventing armed mayhem, is an important governmental objective\u201d and \u201clogic and data established] a substantial relation between [the law] and this objective.\u201d <em>Skoien, supra, </em>614 F.3d at 642; <em>accord Booker, supra, </em>644 <em>F.</em>3d at 25-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">Intermediate scrutiny is appropriate here. The \u201cjustifiable need\u201d component of the carry permit law does not target protected conduct. It is an effort to protect the public and accommodate those who have an objective reason to anticipate a need to use a gun in self-defense. The law targets the dangers of misuse and accidental use of handguns that unquestionably have serious, injurious consequences wholly outside the purview of self-defense. <em>N.J.S.A. 2C:3-4, </em>-5, -9. While comparisons with other enumerated, limited rights are strained because each right is enshrined with different understandings, it is important to recognize that the Second Amendment provides no more protection for unlawful uses of handguns than the First Amendment does for \u201cfighting words.\u201d <em>Heller, supra, </em>554 <em>U.S. </em>at 635, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2821-22, 171 L.Ed.2d at 683-84; <em>R.A.V. v. St. Paul, </em>505 <em>U.S. </em>377, 386, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>2538, 2545, 120 L.Ed.2d 305, 319-20 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>A handgun, like other bearable \u201carms,\u201d is a tool long understood to be equally useful for offensive as well as defensive and unlawful as well as lawful purposes. <em>See Heller, supra, </em>554 <em>U.S. </em>at 581, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2791, 171 L.Ed.2d at 651 (quoting accepted definitions of \u201carms\u201d around 1791). And where injury with a deadly weapon is inflicted with criminal recklessness or negligence, it is unlawful even if unintended. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-3, -4; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:3-9. Moreover, even if an accident does not rise to the level of recklessness or negligence, nothing in <em>Heller </em>suggests that accidental injury is within the scope of the Amendment\u2019s protection. Indeed, the Court stressed it was not suggesting that regulations concerning gun storage in the home to prevent accidents were outside the class of regulations the Amendment permits. <em>Heller, supra, </em>554 <em>U.S. </em>at 632, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2819-20, 171 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 681.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">In applying intermediate scrutiny to New Jersey\u2019s \u201cjustifiable need\u201d standard and the comparable laws of Maryland and New York, the federal courts of appeals have variously characterized the states\u2019 interests \u2014 public safety and crime prevention \u2014 as important, substantial and even compelling. <em>Woollard, supra, </em>712 F.3d at 882 (\u201csignificant\u201d); <em>Drake, supra, </em>724 F.3d at 437 (\u201csignificant, substantial and important\u201d); <em>Kachalsky, supra, </em>701 F.3d at 97 (\u201ccompelling\u201d). And they have concluded that the \u201cfit\u201d between the adequate governmental interest and the law need not be perfect but only \u201creasonable\u201d or \u201csubstantial.\u201d <em>Woollard, supra, </em>712 F.3d at 878 (\u201creasonable\u201d); <em>Drake, supra, </em>724 F.3d at 436-37 (\u201creasonable\u201d); <em>Kachalsky, supra, </em>701 F.3d at 97-98 (\u201csubstantially related to\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">In considering whether the fit between New Jersey\u2019s \u201cjustifiable need\u201d requirement and the law\u2019s purpose is reasonable, the Third Circuit also considered whether New Jersey\u2019s law burdened more conduct than \u201creasonably necessary\u201d to its substantial and important purpose. <em>Drake, supra, </em>724 <em>F.3d </em>at 436-37. The courts considering New York\u2019s and Maryland\u2019s comparable laws did not expressly address that aspect of the fit. <em>See generally Kachalsky, supra, </em>701 F.3d at 81; <em>Woollard, supra, </em>712 F.3d at 865.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>Notably, the federal courts of appeals addressing laws like New Jersey\u2019s have deemed it proper to defer to the state legislatures\u2019 predictive determinations. <em>Drake, supra, </em>724 F.3d at 438 (noting that restrictions subject to intermediate scrutiny can be justified \u201c \u2018by reference to studies and anecdotes,\u2019 \u201d and also by reference to \u201c\u2018history, consensus, and simple common sense\u2019\u201d) (quoting <em>IMS Health, Inc. v. Ayotte, </em>550 <em>F.</em>3d 42, 55 (1st Cir.2008), <em>abrogated on other grounds, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 <em>S.Ct. </em>2653, 180 L.Ed.2d 544 (2011)); <em>Kachalsky, supra, </em>701 F.3d at 99 (recognizing the existence of competing studies and data and observing, \u201cit is the legislature\u2019s job, not ours, to weigh conflicting evidence and make policy judgments\u201d); <em>see also Woollard, supra, </em>712 F.3d at 877, 881 (discussing statistical evidence presented and concluding that it was the legislature\u2019s job to weigh it).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">There is no question that New Jersey\u2019s \u201cjustifiable need\u201d requirement burdens a law-abiding, responsible and adequately trained person\u2019s right to carry a handgun in the event a need to use it in lawful defense arises. The standard we apply is fashioned to account for that admittedly significant burden on exercise of the right and for the fact that it is imposed only in public places, where restrictions on its exercise have always been understood to be part of the right. On the foregoing understandings and the guidance from the decisions of other courts addressing similar laws, we will defer to the predictive determinations made by our Legislature from 1882 until today. And we will consider whether the \u201cjustifiable need\u201d component is supported by a substantial and permissible government interest; whether the \u201cfit\u201d between that governmental interest and \u201cjustifiable need\u201d is substantial; and whether the law burdens no more conduct than is reasonably necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the law easily passes muster under that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">6. \u201cJustifiable Need\u201d Passes Muster</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">Without question, the New Jersey Legislature\u2019s reasons for the carry permit law are legitimate. \u201cThere is no doubt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>that preventing danger to the community is a legitimate regulatory goal.\u201d <em>Salerno, supra, </em>481 <em>U.S. </em>at 747, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2101, 95 L.Ed.2d at 709. As the New Jersey Supreme Court has determined, the Legislature conditioned the issuance of a carry permit based on need on its longstanding \u201caware[ness] of the dangers inherent in the carrying of handguns and the urgent necessity for their regulation,\u201d a necessity attributable to the \u201cserious dangers of misuse and accidental use.\u201d <em>Siccardi, supra, </em>59 <em>N.J. </em>at 553, 558, 284 A.2d 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">True, we do not have a record of the evidence concerning mishap and accidents with guns the Legislature considered prior to 1966 \u2014 when it prohibited youngsters from carrying firearms in 1882; when it prohibited concealed carrying of handguns without a permit in 1905; and when it first conditioned issuance of carry permits on a showing of need in 1924. It is reasonable to infer that the Legislature was acting on considerations and evidence similar to that considered by New York\u2019s Legislature when it adopted a carry permit law in 1911. <em>Kachalsky, supra, </em>701 F.3d at 97-98 (discussing the data).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">As discussed in Part III, B of this decision, in 1966 our Legislature and in 1971 our Supreme Court had significant evidence relevant to the risks posed by the widespread carrying of handguns. Thus, we know that the Legislature and the Court considered statistical and anecdotal evidence as well as the opinions of informed law enforcement officials and representatives of well-established and respected organizations promoting the legitimate and safe use of firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">The State at that time made a showing of the basis for the Legislature\u2019s predictive judgment that the \u201cjustifiable need\u201d component of our carry permit law would minimize the risk of serious injury resulting from misuse and accidents with handguns in public places of this densely populated State. This permissible government interest is substantial and significant. And there is a substantial fit between that interest in securing order and safety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>in public places and a law conditioning the issuance of carry permits on a showing of \u201cjustifiable need\u201d for carrying a handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">It is also clear that neither the goal nor the effort to achieve it by conditioning issuance of carry permits on need was questioned by the gun advocates who addressed the legislative committee in 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">The lack of controversy in 1966 is not surprising given the longstanding practice of regulating the carrying of firearms in this State and elsewhere. Apparently the commonsensical and logical consensus that \u201c[a] gun is a potential danger to more people if carried\u201d outside the home, <em>Moore, supra, </em>702 <em>F.3d </em>at 937, has long been as obvious as it is now. <em>See Drake, supra, </em>724 <em>F.</em>3d at 438 (noting the propriety of reliance on common sense, consensus and history).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\"><em>Heller </em>supports the conclusion that regulation of the carrying of handguns in public places, despite some impact on self-defense, has always been understood to be consistent with the scope of the limited right to bear arms. The reasoning of the 19th century state courts upholding laws regulating the carrying of certain weapons, which the <em>Heller </em>Court relied upon in discerning the individual nature of the right, was not consistent on all points. For example, in the extent to which the public interest could burden the individual right to arm oneself for self-defense in public places. <em>See Kachalsky, supra, </em>701 <em>F.</em>3d at 90-91. Although those courts disagreed on that point and others, including the relevance of militia membership and the applicability of the Second Amendment to the states, all but one recognized the permissibility of regulating the exercise of the individual right to arm oneself in the event of an occasion giving rise to a need to act defensively. <em>Bliss v. Commonwealth, </em>12 <em>Ky. </em>90, 92-93 (Ky.1822) (concluding that the right codified in that state\u2019s constitution, which expressly prohibited laws restricting the right, could not be restrained in any way to serve the public interest).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>More important here, those courts described the governmental interests that were understood to permit restriction of the right in public places. They described the permissible restriction as those: \u201cdictated by the safety of the people and the advancement of public morals,\u201d <em>State v. Reid, </em>1 <em>Ala. </em>612, 616 (Ala.1840); \u201cpassed to subserve the general good, so as not to infringe the right secured, and the necessary incidents to the exercise of such rights,\u201d <em>Fife v. State, </em>31 <em>Ark. </em>455, 460 (Ark.1876); intended \u201cto promote personal security, and to put down lawless aggression and violence,\u201d <em>Nunn, supra, </em>1 <em>Ga. </em>at 246; necessary \u201cto counteract a vicious state of society, growing out of the habit of carrying concealed weapons, and to prevent bloodshed and assassinations committed upon unsuspecting persons,\u201d <em>State v. Chandler, </em>5 <em>La. Ann. </em>489, 489-90 (La.1850); and \u201cconducive to the public peace, and the protection and safety of the community from lawless violence,\u201d <em>Andrews v. State, </em>50 <em>Tenn. </em>165, 187-88 (Tenn.1871). A court of this state reached the same conclusion in 1925. <em>Angelo, supra, </em>3 <em>N.J. Misc. </em>at 1014-15, 130 <em>A. </em>458 (recognizing that the Second Amendment right is a limited right and its exercise is subject to such conditions as the safety and welfare of the people require).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Thus, the New Jersey Legislature\u2019s longstanding recognition of the urgent necessity for regulating the carrying of handguns in public places is not new, unique or inconsistent with the right as interpreted in <em>Heller. </em>Such regulations, at least those falling short of extinguishing the right, were universally understood as consistent with the limited individual right during the period following the Second Amendment\u2019s adoption. <em>Kachalsky, supra, </em>701 F.3d at 96 (discussing New York\u2019s \u201cproper cause\u201d standard and the well-established tradition of regulations in public places enshrined with the right); <em>see Drake, supra, </em>724 F.3d at 432-34 (concluding, on similar reasoning, that the \u201cjustifiable need\u201d standard fits so \u201ccomfortably\u201d within the longstanding tradition as to qualify as presumptively lawful).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>There is no basis for suspecting that the carry permit law is hostile to the Second Amendment right. The goal of the New Jersey Legislature\u2019s commitment to meeting the urgent necessity of addressing violence in public places is demonstrated by its efforts to address the problem on several fronts. One example is the establishment of the PTC to better educate and train local, county and State law enforcement officers. That effort was undertaken to minimize the need for widespread carrying of handguns in public to fend off unlawful aggressive conduct, which poses a risk that is enhanced in densely populated public places.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">The carry permit law\u2019s training requirement is another example. Wherever the Legislature has authorized the carrying of handguns in public places \u2014 whether by employment-based exemption or carry permit \u2014 the Legislature has conditioned the license on adequate training and periodic re-qualification. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-6j, <em>l; N.J.S.A. </em>2C:58-4d. Proficiency is a \u201csensible]\u201d condition imposed on exercise of the right to minimize the risk of misuse and accident inherent in carrying handguns in public places. As others have observed, apparently as a matter of logic and common sense, \u201c[a] person who carries a gun in a public place but is not well trained in the use of firearms is a menace to himself and others.\u201d <em>Moore, supra, </em>702 F.3d at 941. That assessment entails a predictive determination that New Jersey\u2019s Legislature made long ago and is not questioned in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">The State does not deny that the \u201cjustifiable need\u201d requirement is designed to address the inherent danger of misuse and accidental use by keeping the number of handguns in public places down. Before the Third Circuit, the State argued: \u201c\u2018The [standard] provides a means to determine whether the increase in risk and danger borne by the public is justified by a demonstrated risk and danger borne to the person seeking to carry a handgun.\u2019 \u201d <em>Drake, supra, </em>724 <em>F.</em>3d at 437 (quoting Appellees\u2019 Brief 34). But as the Second Circuit noted in <em>Kachalsky, </em>this is not an \u201carbitrary\u201d basis for addressing the dangers to order and safety in public places comparable to limiting public possession to \u201cevery tenth citizen.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>701 F.3d at 98. Rather, it is an objective basis that is substantially related to the important interest in order and public safety and tailored to serve it by burdening as little conduct as is reasonably possible. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">New Jersey\u2019s carry permit allows the carrying of handguns in public places where carry permits are required, despite the inherent danger, only where the person has adequate training to minimize the risk to the extent that is possible, and only where there is a reason to conclude that doing otherwise would too heavily burden the individual right to use handguns lawfully \u2014 in those cases where the person has an objective reason to anticipate the need of using a handgun defensively that distinguishes the person from others.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">As discussed in Part III of this opinion, the apparent need to use a firearm for a lawful purpose is the feature that unifies what otherwise appears to be a rather complex list of exceptions to the carry permit law found in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-6. The \u201cjustifiable need\u201d requirement serves the same purpose as the employment-based exceptions, but does so on a case-by-case rather than a categorical basis. Thus, those who can show an objective reason \u2014 a reason other than a generalized concern about becoming a crime victim \u2014 to anticipate an attack necessitating the defensive use of a handgun can obtain a carry permit tailored to their showing of need.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">To view this limitation based on an objective showing of need as inconsistent with the Amendment would be to seriously misunderstand <em>Heller. </em>Assuming no categorical disqualification of the firearm or the person carrying it, the Amendment protects the right to bear arms for self-defense. As the <em>Heller </em>Court implicitly recognized in noting the \u201cneed\u201d for lawful use of defensive force in the home, the right to use lawful defensive force has always been tied to need.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">Lawful uses of defensive force are, and historically have been, inextricably intertwined with the existence of an objectively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>reasonable perception of the need to defend oneself against an immediate threat of serious harm from an unlawful use of force. As our Court of Errors and Appeals explained long ago, \u201c[t]he \u2018right of self-defense has always been regarded as founded on necessity____\u2019 \u201d <em>Brown v. State, </em>62 <em>N.J.L. </em>666, 708, 42 <em>A. </em>811 (E. <em>&amp; </em>A.1899) (quoting <em>1 Edward Hyde East, A Treatise of the Pleas of the Crown, </em>293 (1803)). It is a right to protect oneself \u201c \u2018from such serious bodily harm as would give him a reasonable apprehension that his life was in immediate danger.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>3 Sir William Oldnall Russell, A Treatise on Crimes and Misdemeanors </em>208 (1809)). As <em>Kaehalsky </em>recognizes, there is no right of self-defense until the necessitating circumstance presents itself. 701 F.3d at 100; <em>see also Harmon, supra, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>at 208-09, 516 A.2d 1047 (discussed in Part III, C).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">In upholding laws conditioning issuance of carry permits on need, the Second, Third and Fourth Circuits have recognized: that the laws limit the ability to arm one\u2019s self for the purpose of self-defense; that there is presently conflicting data on the danger and benefits of widespread carrying of handguns in public places; and that the laws burden but do not absolutely bar the conduct. <em>Drake, supra, </em>724 F.3d at 439; <em>Woollard, supra, </em>712 F.3d at 880-81; Ka<em>chalsky, supra, </em>701 F.3d at 98-100. Each of those courts found the state\u2019s interest sufficiently important and the fit between the need-based standard and the interest in order and safety in public places adequate to pass muster under the intermediate level of scrutiny they applied. The Third Circuit went further and determined that the conditioning of carry permits on \u201cjustifiable need\u201d did not burden more conduct than reasonably necessary to serve the State\u2019s purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">We see absolutely no basis for reaching a different conclusion here. As interpreted in <em>Heller, </em>the Second Amendment protects lawful, not unlawful uses of firearms. In the public places where a carry permit is required under the laws of this State, the only lawful use of a handgun is lawful self-defense. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>our view, \u201cjustifiable need\u201d accommodates that right in a manner that is wholly compatible with the right of self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The Amendment does not protect conduct resulting in unlawful injury just because the injury is inflicted with a protected weapon. Where the result of an accidental use or misuse of defensive force is injury to someone who is not posing an immediate threat of unlawful use of injurious force, the injurious conduct, if rising to the level of criminal recklessness or negligence, is an unlawful infliction of injury, whether or not the shooter intended to injure. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-4a(1), b(1); <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:12-1a(2), b(3)-(4); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:3-4, -5, -9.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">The risk of reckless and negligent injury is minimized but not eliminated with training, even with training like that required in New Jersey, which requires that the applicant demonstrate knowledge of the law as well as proficiency in the handling of a gun. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:54-2.4; <em>see generally Woollard, supra, </em>712 F.3d at 879-80 (discussing increased risks when the carrying of handguns in public places is widespread, identified by Maryland, which included escalation of force in confrontations and the confusion generated when multiple parties in a confrontation are armed). Unanticipated confrontations require split-second assessments under stressful circumstances. <em>See Siccardi, supra, </em>59 <em>N.J. </em>at 551-52, 284 A.2d 533 (noting law enforcement officer\u2019s claim that an attack happens so quickly that in order to use a concealed weapon the victim does not have much time); <em>see also Governor\u2019s Reconsideration and Recommendation Statement, </em>Assembly No. 940, <em>L. </em>1982, c. 154 (discussed in Part III, A, 2 above).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">It is true that the \u201cjustifiable need\u201d requirement does not accommodate the interest in use of a handgun defensively to fend off a random attack in a public place. But that is also true of random attacks that occur in \u201csensitive\u201d public places where laws banning possession of firearms are, under <em>Heller, </em>presumptively lawful. While the \u201cjustifiable need\u201d requirement has implications beyond schools and government buddings, one who has an objec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>tive reason to anticipate an unavoidable attack can obtain a carry-permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">The question comes down to whether New Jersey law, in excluding an accommodation for random attacks in public, has burdened the right of self-defense too much. Given the limited nature of this enumerated right, restricted as it has always been by reasonable regulations addressing the carrying of firearms in public places (adopted in the interest of public order and safety), we do not think the Amendment requires New Jersey to allow every law-abiding, responsible and trained person to carry a handgun in public absent \u201cjustifiable need.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">The Legislature, long ago, made the predictive judgment that the widespread carrying of handguns in public places where a carry permit is required would not be consistent with public safety because of the inherent danger it poses. Other state legislatures have made the same determination. And we cannot conceive of any action the Legislature could take to address that inherent danger in a manner more accommodating to the right to bear arms in public for lawful self-defense. The alternative to requiring a showing of \u201cjustifiable need\u201d is widespread carrying of handguns, which would not address the problem at all. <em>Siccardi, supra, </em>59 <em>N.J. </em>at 558, 284 A.2d 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">In <em>McDonald, </em>the plurality indicated that states are not deprived of their ability, within the Amendment\u2019s limits, \u201cto devise solutions to social problems that suit local needs and values.\u201d<em>U.S. </em>at-, 130 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3046, 177 L.Ed.2d at 925. We cannot conclude that the Amendment or the Court\u2019s recent decisions require this State to dismantle its statutory scheme addressing the risks of misuse and accidental use in public places devised long ago and developed over many years. This scheme is crafted to burden the exercise of the right to use handguns for lawful purposes as little as possible, without abandoning this effort to maintain order and safety in public places.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>There is one final argument that must be addressed, which was not raised in <em>Drake. </em>These applicants argue that in excepting certain retired officers from making a showing of \u201cjustifiable need\u201d to carry a handgun, the Legislature has undermined the substantiality of its objective. Admittedly, the argument has some facial appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">In Part III, A, 4 of this opinion, we discussed the distinctions between the pre-retirement duties and carrying privileges of retirees who are eligible and ineligible for these special permits. Only those who served full-time and regularly in designated law enforcement agencies and had broad police powers and unlimited carrying privileges are eligible. As previously discussed, AIU officers work for the fire department, and have limited carrying privileges, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-6a(8), and police powers, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-7.1d.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">In Part III, A, 4, we also discuss that Congress, in adopting LEOSA, recognized that retired officers face dangers of retaliation that are different than those faced by others and that, by virtue of experience and training, they are better able than others to address them. While the quality of Congress\u2019 predictive judgment is not readily apparent, we cannot conclude that the New Jersey Legislature was so far off the mark in relieving retirees from full-time and regular service as police officers of the obligation of showing \u201cjustifiable need\u201d or that its determination undermines the substantiality of the governmental interest in otherwise limiting the right to carry firearms in public places to those private persons who demonstrate \u201cjustifiable need.\u201d The fact that the Legislature has determined that retirees who served full-time in jobs that warranted their possession of firearms at all times, whether or not on duty, have a reason for needing a handgun that carries over into retirement is not a reason to view the \u201cjustifiable need\u201d requirement with a different lens. Presumably, it is a matter the Legislature and Executive will continue to consider as the scope of the Second Amendment right, as inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>preted in <em>Heller </em>and made applicable to the states in <em>McDonald, </em>is clarified.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">V. Equal Protection</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">We turn to consider the applicants\u2019 claim under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. It rests upon the applicants\u2019 objection to distinctions the Legislature has drawn between retired law enforcement officers who are and who are not eligible for special permits to carry handguns under subsection <em>l </em>of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">The Equal Protection Clause prohibits states from \u201cdenying] to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d <em>U.S. Const, </em>amend. XIV, \u00a7 1. \u201c[A]bsent an impact on a fundamental right or targeting of a suspect class, a statute [withstands an equal protection challenge] \u2018so long as it bears a rational relation to some legitimate end.\u2019 \u201d <em>Trautmann ex rel. Trautmann v. Christie, </em>211 <em>N.J. </em>300, 304, 48 A.3d 1005 (2012) (quoting <em>Romer v. Evans, </em>517 <em>U.S. </em>620, 631, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>1620, 1626, 134 L.Ed.2d 855, 865 (1996)). Statutory classifications that are not based on a suspect classification and statutes that do not implicate exercise of fundamental rights are deemed impermissible only when the law\u2019s objectives are not legitimate or the relationship between the permissible goal and classification is so attenuated as to be arbitrary or irrational. <em>City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., </em>473 <em>U.S. </em>432, 446-7, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>3249, 3258, 87 <em>L.Ed.3d </em>313, 324 (1985); <em>Doe v. Poritz, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>1, 92, 662 A.2d 367 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">These applicants do not contend that the distinctions drawn in subsection <em>l </em>are subject to scrutiny under a standard stricter than the rational basis test. Nor could they. Where a Second Amendment challenge fails and there is no suspect classification involved, as is the case here, a claim that others similarly situated are treated differently is reviewed only for rational basis. In <em>Kwong v. Bloomberg, </em>723 F.3d 160, 170 n. 19 (2d Cir.2013), the court considered a Second Amendment challenge to a residential handgun licensing fee, subjected the fee to intermediate scrutiny <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>under the Second Amendment, and concluded it passed muster. The court concluded that in that circumstance the Equal Protection challenge to the fee required no more than rational basis review because the Second Amendment \u201canalysis sufficiently\u201d protected that right. <em>Id. </em>at 170 (citing <em>Nat\u2019l Rifle Ass\u2019n of Am. v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms &amp; Explosives, </em>700 F.3d 185, 211-12 (5th Cir.2012); <em>Hightower v. City of Boston, </em>693 F.3d 61, 83 (1st Cir.2012); <em>Nordyke v.

Accordingly, this objection, based on the fact that some retired officers are not obligated to make that showing, is properly reviewed to discern whether there is a rational basis for the distinction. The basis for the distinction is discussed in Part III, A, 4. Unlike the eligible retirees, these retirees had only limited statutory carrying privileges and statutorily limited police powers while employed. Accordingly, their position is different than that of the eligible officers. <em>See Governor\u2019s Reconsideration and Recommendation Statement, </em>Senate No. 1480, <em>L. </em>1985, c. 150 (discussed in Part III, A, 4 of this opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">Given the difference in the work experience, statutory police powers, and statutory carrying privileges which are the bases for issuance of these special permits available without a showing of \u201cjustifiable need,\u201d the Legislature could have reasonably concluded that retirees who served broader law enforcement roles while employed, as a group, face a greater risk of retaliatory violence following retirement than those whose statutory responsibilities were limited to investigating arson, suspicious fires and explosions. The fact that these applicants may have exercised carrying privileges and dealt with crimes related to arsons under investigation or detected during the course of their work, does not make the classification arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>The applicants also contend that they each qualify for a special permit as a \u201cqualified retired law enforcement officer, as [that term] is used in the federal Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act of 2004 [ (LEOSA) ], Pub.L. 108-277\u201d and are treated differently than those retirees who are eligible on that basis, having served elsewhere and moved to New Jersey after retiring. <em>See Casaleggio, supra, </em>420 <em>N.J.Super. </em>121, 128-29, 18 A.3d 1082 (so interpreting the statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">The difficulty here is that neither applicant meets the definition of \u201cqualified retired law enforcement officer, as [that term] is used in the federal Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act of 2004 [ (LEOSA) ], Pub.L. 108-277.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>LEOSA has been amended since 2004, and these applicants rely on LEOSA\u2019s current definition of the term \u201cqualified retired law enforcement officer.\u201d That reliance is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Based on our review of the history of this State\u2019s well-established record of closely guarding carry permits and subsection l\u2019s careful enumeration of eligible officers, we are certain that the Legislature would not intend courts to construe subsection l\u2019s reference to LEOSA to encompass any and all expansions of LEOSA\u2019s definition of qualified retired law enforcement officer that Congress might deem fit to adopt. <em>See generally In the Matter of Commitment of Edward S., </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>118, 133-36, 570 A.2d 917 (1990) (discussing interpretation of statutes incorporating a specific provision of law and concluding that the significance of the subsequent amendments to the incorporated law is a question of the Legislature\u2019s intent).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">Congress has expanded the scope of LEOSA in ways that are inconsistent with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-6 <em>l. Compare </em>108 Pub.L. No. 277 (\u00a7 926C(c)(l),(3)(A)) (defining qualified retired law enforcement officer to mean an individual who \u201cbefore such retirement, was regularly employed as a law enforcement officer for an aggregate of [fifteen] years or more\u201d) <em>with </em>Pub.L. No. 111-272 (no longer limiting the definition to those \u201cregularly employed as law enforcement officers\u201d and reducing the necessary years of aggregate service from fifteen years or more to \u201c[ten] years or more\u201d); <em>and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number><em>with N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-6 <em>l </em>(limiting these special carry permits to retired officers who \u201cregularly\u201d served as a law enforcement officer before retiring from a designated law enforcement agency).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Under LEOSA as initially adopted, fifteen years of service as a law enforcement officer was required. Pub.L. No. 108-277, \u00a7 9260(c)(3). Daudelin had fifteen years of service in the AIU. Wheeler did not. But Daudelin did not have the photographic identification card required to meet LEOSA\u2019s definition. He had photographic identification cards depicting him as a retired \u201cpolice captain\u201d and an \u201carson captain\u201d issued by the Newark Police Department, but pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-7.1aj AIUs are established within a City\u2019s fire department.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Thus, he did not have an identification card \u201cissued by the agency from which [he] retired from service.\u201d Pub.L.

Privileges and Immunities</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">The applicants also contend that subsection <em>l </em>of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-6 violates the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV, Section 2, Clause 1 of the United States Constitution. Their claim is premised on the fact that subsection <em>l </em>makes special permits to carry available to retired officers domiciled in New Jersey qualified under LEOSA, but not to retired officers domiciled elsewhere. This issue was not raised in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">The Clause applies only to those \u201cprivileges\u201d and \u201cimmunities\u201d bearing upon the vitality of the Nation as a single entity with respect to which \u201cthe State [must] treat all citizens, resident and nonresident, equally.\u201d <em>Baldwin v.

It is also axiomatic that \u201c[e]very inquiry under the Privileges and Immunities Clause \u2018must ... be conducted with due regard for the principle that the States should have considerable leeway in analyzing local evils and in prescribing appropriate cures.\u2019 \u201d <em>United Bldg. &amp; Constr.

Determinations about issuance of permits to carry handguns in public places are certainly a matter involving the analysis of local ills and cures.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Because this claim was not raised in the trial court and because these officers are not in any event \u201cqualified retired law enforcement officers\u201d within the meaning of that term incorporated in <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:39-6 <em>l, </em>we would ordinarily decline to consider the point not raised in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">In this case, there is an additional reason. The record is inadequate to permit evaluation of the State\u2019s justification for any differential treatment of retired officers domiciled in and outside of New Jersey. <em>See, e.g., United Bldg. &amp; Constr.

For that reason, deviation from our general practice of declining to consider issues raised for the first time on appeal would be inappropriate. <em>Nieder v. Royal Indem. Ins. Co., </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>229, 234, 300 A.2d 142 (1973). Accordingly, we do not address the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">VII. Preemption</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">The applicants raise an additional issue that requires only limited discussion. They contend that they cannot be prosecuted for violating <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-5b because they are \u201cqualified retired law enforcement officer[s]\u201d within the meaning of LEOSA. As we understand their argument, the claim is that LEOSA precludes their prosecution pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-5b for possessing a firearm without a permit to carry. In this circumstance, where the claim is not dependent upon a state law incorporating LEO-SA\u2019s definition as stated in a specific iteration of that statute, current federal law applies. There is dicta supporting the applicants\u2019 position in published opinions. <em>See Johnson, supra, </em>709 F.Supp.2d at 187 (indicating that LEOSA \u201conly demonstrates an intent to bar the criminal prosecution of retired law enforcement officers who carry concealed firearms in interstate commerce\u201d); <em>Casaleggio, supra, </em>420 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 128, 18 A.3d 1082 (citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number><em>Johnson </em>for that proposition and noting that LEOSA has a limited purpose).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Nevertheless, the question of whether these applicants would be subject to prosecution for violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-5b if they were to carry handguns without having obtained permits in accordance with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:58-4 is not properly before us. The disappointed applicants did not file a complaint for a declaratory judgment in the trial court. That is the vehicle available for a person wishing to ascertain whether a proposed course of conduct violates the criminal law. <em>See Keuper v. Wilson, </em>111 <em>N.J.Super. </em>502, 506, 268 A.2d 760 (Ch.Div.1970) (noting that \u201c[t]he Uniform Declaratory Judgments Law has been increasingly used in this State to obtain a determination of the legality of a particular course of action rather than pursuing the course of action and risking criminal prosecution\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Because neither applicant has been charged with a crime and neither sought a declaratory judgment, their potential criminal liability is not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b599-21\"> Subsection <em>l </em>is italicized to distinguish the lowercase letter \"1\u201d from the numeral <em>\"1.\u201d</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b600-8\"> The Attorney General participated in the Law Division but, regrettably, declined to participate here.
