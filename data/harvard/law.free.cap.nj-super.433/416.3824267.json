The resulting award required, in part, that police officers \u201cshall make contributions toward health insurance coverage in the amount of 1.5% of base salary\u201d pursuant to <em>L. </em>2010, c. 2. Defendant interpreted base salary as an officer\u2019s base pensionable salary and made deductions accordingly. Plaintiffs initiated this action, contending that \u201cbase salary\u201d meant base contractual salary and excluded additional items of compensation such as longevity, educational incentives, and night and detective differentials. The trial judge agreed with plaintiffs and entered judgment in their favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Although base salary was not defined in either the statute or the award, it was defined in a subsequent statute that was applicable to the award here. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-16.7. In the absence of any statement to the contrary, we assume the arbitrator used the term \u201cbase salary\u201d as directed by the Legislature. Therefore, and for the reasons that follow, we agree with defendant\u2019s interpretation of the interest arbitration award and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">On February 8, 2010, the Legislature introduced Senate Bill Numbers 2, 3, and 4, which were passed and signed into law on March 22, 2010. The three bills implemented some of the recommendations of the <em>Joint Legislative Committee on Public Employ</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number><em>ee Benefits Reform, Final Report </em>(Dec. 1, 2006) (Pinal Report),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which was created to identify \u201cproposals that will terminate abuses of the pension systems and control the cost of providing public employee retirement, health care and other benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1; <em>see also Commc\u2019ns Workers of Am. v. State of N.J., Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>421 <em>N.J.Super. </em>75, 83, 22 A.3d 170 (Law Div.2011). The law at issue here, which provided changes to the health benefits program, was introduced as S. 3, enacted as <em>L. </em>2010, c. 2, and codified as amended at <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:10-21. The two other bills provided changes to public pension benefits (S. 2, enacted as <em>L. </em>2010, c. 1), and employee benefits (S. 4, enacted as <em>L. </em>2010, c. 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">In the Final Report, the Committee noted that its investigation of \u201chealth benefits issues revealed a system plagued by the skyrocketing costs of health care that have dramatically increased the cost of health benefits for both current and retired public employees.\u201d <em>Final Report, supra, </em>at 57. The Committee recommended forty-one reforms to public employee pensions, health care benefits, and other employee benefits, which it found were long \u201coverdue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2-5. With regard to health care costs, the Committee recommended that the Legislature require all active public employees and future retirees to pay some portion of the cost of their health insurance premiums. <em>Id. </em>at 113-18. The resulting legislation was \u201cdesigned to improve the fiscal strength of State and local governments, reduce taxpayer burdens, and ensure the health and pension systems remain viable for current and future employees.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Commc\u2019ns Workers of Am., supra, </em>421 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 83, 22 A.3d 170.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number><em>L. </em>2010, c. 2, added subsection (b) to <em>N.J.S.A </em>40A:10-21. As amended, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:10-21(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-5\">Commencing on the effective date [May 21, 2010] of <em>P.L. </em>2010, <em>c. </em>2 and upon the expiration of any applicable binding collective negotiations agreement in force on that effective date, employees of an employer shall pay 1.5 percent of base salary, through the withholding of the contribution from the pay, salary or other compensation, for health care benefits coverage provided pursuant to <em>N.J.S. </em>40AU0-17, notwithstanding any other amount that may be required additionally pursuant to subsection a. of this section for such coverage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">\u201cBase salary\u201d is not defined under the statute. Adding to the resulting ambiguity is the fact that the employee\u2019s contribution is made \u201cthrough the withholding of the contribution from the <em>pay, salary or other compensation.\u201d N.J.S.A </em>40A:10-21(b) (emphasis added). No administrative regulations defining the term \u201cbase salary\u201d were promulgated under the amended statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">However, guidelines were published by the State Department of the Treasury, Division of Pensions and Benefits (DPB), and the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs, Division of Local Government Services (DLGS) to be provided to the affected groups. DLGS was established in the Department of Community Affairs under the Local Government Supervision Act (1947), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27BB-1 to -23, and exercises regulatory and supervisory powers over local governments. It is authorized to \u201cassist local government in the solution of its problems, and plan and guide needed readjustments for effective local self-government.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:27BB-6. To this end, the Director of DLGS may provide instruction to local government units through Local Finance Notices (LFNs). <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:30-1.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">DLGS issued LFN 2010-12 to provide \u201cguidance for complying with\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:10-21(b) to local units, such as defendant, that provide non-State Health Benefits Program (SHBP) coverage. LFN 2010-12 highlighted important elements of the law and included Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) in which it defined \u201cbase salary\u201d as the \u201csalary on which pension contribution ... is based.\u201d This definition was consistent with the definition of base <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>salary in a statewide informal guideline issued by the DPB for the administration of SHBP.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Defendant sought to comply with the dictates of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:10-21 by following LFN 2010-12. Accordingly, it deducted 1.5% of base pensionable salary from all its employees\u2019 pay as their contribution toward their health benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">Prior to the enactment of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:10-21(b), plaintiffs and defendant were parties to two separate CNAs, which governed the terms of employment of all member police officers, including salary ranges by step and rank, and percentage increases for longevity. Officers assigned as detectives received an annual $2000 \u201cdetective differential\u201d that was \u201cpayable bi-weekly in addition to their base pay.\u201d An officer who worked the night shift received a five percent \u201cnight differential,\u201d as part of his or her \u201cregular base salary,\u201d and an officer who completed eighteen years of service received an annual \u201cbase salary increase\u201d of $2000. As part of his or her \u201cregular salary,\u201d an officer received an \u201ceducation incentive reimbursement\u201d in the amount of $22.50 for each credit hour earned toward a degree or certificate. Officers also received periodic compensation for overtime, court attendance, rescheduled duty tours, clothing and equipment allowances, and off-duty assignments. Under the agreement, officers paid deductibles for medical care, but did not contribute toward the cost of their health insurance benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">Because the parties were unable to negotiate successor agreements, their CNAs expired on July 31, 2008, and they submitted to compulsory interest arbitration pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-16 with New Jersey Public Employment Relations Commission (PERC). Hearings were conducted by an arbitrator in October 2009. On February 17, 2011, the arbitrator issued an Interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>Arbitration Decision and Award, which established the terms of the CNAs between the parties for August 1, 2008, to July 31, 2012. The arbitration award set a new salary schedule and modified the longevity schedule, but continued the provisions of the prior agreements regarding educational incentives, and night and detective differentials.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The arbitration award recognized the applicability of the amendment to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:10-21. Noting that neither party \u201cmade a proposal regarding employee co-payments toward health insurance,\u201d the arbitrator nevertheless took \u201cofficial notice of an act by the New Jersey Legislature requiring the payment of 1.5% of base salary towards health insurance effective May 21, 2010.\u201d Accordingly, the award included the following language in Article 31:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2c\">Pursuant to <em>P.L. </em>2010, c. 2, unit employees shall make contributions toward health insurance coverage in the amount of 1.5% of base salary. This level of employee contribution shall be inclusive of, rather than in addition to, any statutory obligation towards an employee\u2019s requirement to make contributions toward the payment of health insurance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Neither party filed an appeal of the award to PERC.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">After the arbitrator\u2019s award was issued, defendant began withholding 1.5% of each police officer\u2019s pensionable salary, retroactive to the effective date of the statute. Defendant calculated pensionable salary as base salary wages plus additional items of compensation, including longevity, educational incentives, and night and detective differentials, but not overtime pay. Plaintiffs filed a verified complaint to confirm the February 17, 2011, compulsory interest arbitration award pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-16, challenging defendant\u2019s calculation of base salary, as well as an order to show cause for summary action pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:67-1. Defendant filed an answer and counterclaim, alleging that it had withheld 1.5% of each employee\u2019s \u201cpensionable salary\u201d in accord with LFN 2010-12. Defendant also sought modification or correction of the arbitrator\u2019s award to clarify that \u201cit shall withhold 1.5% of pensionable salary in conformance with <em>P.L. </em>2010, c. 2____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">The trial court held that defendant could not assert a counterclaim to \u201cmodify the award\u201d because it failed to appeal the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>arbitrator\u2019s decision to PERC and because defendant failed to establish grounds for such modification pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:24-9. The court found the award was \u201cstill subject to confirmation ... as written on its face.\u201d The court concluded that the \u201cclear and common meaning of the term \u2018base salary<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in <em>P.L. </em>2010, c. 2\u201d excluded \u201cadditional payments or allowances ... such as overtime pay, educational incentives, detective and night differentials, and longevity pay.\u201d The court entered final judgment, ordering defendant to \u201cimmediately adjust the deductions taken from its police employees\u2019 wages to reflect a deduction of 1.5% of \u2018base salary\u2019 for health contributions, excluding from \u2018base salary\u2019 such benefits as longevity, overtime, educational incentives, and night and detective pay differentials.\u201d The judge also ordered defendant to refund the amounts in excess of that definition previously deducted from police officers\u2019 salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The judge later issued an order that granted a stay as to retroactive excess deductions, but denied a stay of the prospective deductions. After defendant filed a notice of appeal, we granted defendant\u2019s motion for a stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Defendant argues that the trial court erred in interpreting the term \u201cbase salary\u201d as meaning base contractual salary, rather than \u201cbase pensionable salary,\u201d and thereby improperly excluded such additional items of compensation as educational incentives, detective and night differentials, and longevity pay from the calculation of base salary. Amici DLGS, DPB, and the State League of Municipalities support defendant\u2019s position. Amici New Jersey State Firefighters\u2019 Mutual Benevolent Association (FMBA) and New Jersey Policemen\u2019s Benevolent Association support plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of base salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">The judgment, which enforced an arbitration award pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-19, turned upon the trial judge\u2019s interpretation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>the term \u201cbase salary\u201d in the arbitration award and, in effect, as used in <em>N.J.S.A </em>40A:10-21(b). When construing a law, a reviewing court conducts \u201ca de novo review\u201d and does not \u201caccord any special deference to a trial court\u2019s interpretation.\u201d <em>US Bank, N.A. v. Hough, </em>210 <em>N.J. </em>187, 198, 42 A.3d 870 (2012). <em>See Manalapan Realty, L.P. v. Twp. Comm. of Manalapan, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">We first review the nature of the award that was the subject of interpretation by the trial court and now, in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Compulsory interest arbitration, which is governed by the \u201cPolice and Fire Public Interest Arbitration Reform Act\u201d (the Reform Act), <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:13A-14(a) to -19, provides a mechanism for the speedy resolution of collective negotiation disputes between police and fire departments and their employers. <em>Hillsdale PBA Local 207 v. Borough of Hillsdale, </em>137 <em>N.J. </em>71, 80, 644 A.2d 564 (1994). Arbitration conducted pursuant to the Reform Act is subject to a statutorily mandated procedure. The arbitrator must \u201cdecide the dispute based on a reasonable determination of the issues, giving due weight to [enumerated statutory factors] that are judged relevant for the resolution of the specific dispute.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-16(g); <em>see also In re City of Camden, </em>429 <em>N.J.Super. </em>309, 325, 58 A.3d 1186 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>215 <em>N.J. </em>485, 73 A.3d 511 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">The arbitrator\u2019s decision is final and binding upon the parties. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-16(f)(5). There is, however, a procedure for appealing the decision to PERC. <em>See ibid. </em>Although none of the parties appealed, they were permitted to seek enforcement of the decision in the Superior Court. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-19. In our view, the relief sought by defendant was not a modification of the award but rather, a clarification that use of the term \u201cbase salary\u201d in the award was consistent with applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>c.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">The new Article 31 in the award explicitly referred to <em>L. </em>2010, <em>c. </em>2, reciting the requirement that employees contribute 1.5% of their \u201cbase salary\u201d toward the cost of their health insurance. Therefore, to understand the meaning of \u201cbase salary\u201d within the award, we must determine the meaning of that term in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">The court\u2019s \u201ctask in statutory interpretation is to determine and effectuate the Legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>Bosland v. Warnock Dodge, Inc., </em>197 <em>N.J. </em>543, 553, 964 A.2d 741 (2009). Courts \u201clook first to the plain language of the statute, seeking further guidance only to the extent that the Legislature\u2019s intent cannot be derived from the words that it has chosen.\u201d <em>McGovern v. Rutgers, </em>211 <em>N.J. </em>94, 108, 47 A.3d 724 (2012) (quoting <em>Bosland, supra, </em>197 <em>N.J. </em>at 553, 964 A.2d 741).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">As noted, \u201cbase salary\u201d is not defined in the statute itself or in any administrative regulation promulgated to implement the statute. Moreover, it is susceptible to multiple interpretations. \u201cSalary\u201d has been defined as \u201cmonies received by a person on a fixed and continuous basis, i.e., normally paid in regular periodic intervals in specific regular amounts.\u201d <em>Koribanics v. Bd. of Educ. of Clifton, </em>48 <em>N.J. </em>1, 6, 222 A.2d 87 (1966); <em>Wilson v. Bd. of Trs. of Police and Firemen\u2019s Ret. Sys., </em>322 <em>N.J.Super. </em>477, 481, 731 A.2d 513 (App.Div.1998); <em>see Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1454 (9th ed. 2009) (defining salary \u201c[a]s an agreed compensation for services ... usually paid at regular intervals on a yearly basis\u201d); <em>but see Webster\u2019s II New College Dictionary </em>92 (1995) (\u201cdefining base pay\u201d as \u201c[a]n amount or a rate of compensation for a specified job or activity, excluding any other payments or allowances\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">We therefore turn to \u201cextrinsic evidence from which [we] hope[ ] to glean the Legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>Klumb v. Bd. of Educ. of Manalapan-Englishtown Reg\u2019l High Sch. Dist., </em>199 <em>N.J. </em>14, 24, 970 A.2d 354 (2009) (citing <em>Bedford v. Riello, </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>210, 222, 948 A.2d 1272 (2008)). \u201cWhen a statute is subject to more than one plausible reading,\u201d the court\u2019s \u201crole is \u2018to effectuate the legislative intent in light of the language used and the objects sought to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>achieved.\u2019 \u201d <em>Velazquez v. Jiminez, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>240, 256, 798 A.2d 51 (2002) (quoting <em>State v.

N.J. Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Prot., </em>202 <em>N.J. </em>533, 541, 998 A.2d 450 (2010). As we have noted, the enactment here was part of a comprehensive legislative effort to control costs by making changes to public employees\u2019 pension benefits, health benefits programs, and other benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">In addition, we have the benefit of other legislative action, enacted by the same legislative body in the same year as <em>L. </em>2010, c. 2, which also served the legislative goal of controlling costs associated with public employees compensation and benefits. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-16.7<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> amended the provisions of the Reform Act applicable to compulsory interest arbitration involving police and firefighters, the arbitration that led to the award here. It imposed a two percent \u201ccap\u201d on police and firefighter arbitration awards issued from January 1, 2011 to April 1, 2014, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-16.9.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In addition, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-16.7(a) pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>vides the definition for \u201cbase salary\u201d to be used in police and firefighter arbitrations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-4\">\u201cBase salary\u201d means the salary provided pursuant to a salary guide or table and any amount provided pursuant to a salary increment, including any amount provided for longevity or length of service.

Had he failed to comply with this statutory mandate, the award would be subject to being vacated. In the absence of any affirmative statement by the arbitrator to the contrary, we assume the arbitration award used the term \u201cbase salary\u201d as directed by the Legislature in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-16.7(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>We also note that, months before the award was rendered, DLGS issued LFN 2010-12 and sent it to all public employers to provide guidance for complying with <em>L. </em>2010, c. 2. The FAQs in LFN 2010-12 advised, \u201c \u2018base salary\u2019 on which the 1.5% contribution is calculated\u201d is the \u201csalary on which pension contribution ... is based.\u201d This definition was consistent with that contained in the guidelines published by DPB, also prior to the award, to assist public employers in complying with <em>L. </em>2010, c. 2, regarding SHBP and the School Employees Health Benefits Program.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">The guidelines issued by DLGS were informal in nature and not the equivalent of an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute it is empowered to enforce, which would warrant our \u201csubstantial deference.\u201d <em>See Klumb, supra, </em>199 <em>N.J. </em>at 24-25, 970 A.2d 354; <em>Baylor v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., </em>235 <em>N.J.Super. </em>22, 37, 561 A.2d 618 (App.Div.1989) (Petrella, P.J.A.D., dissenting), <em>aff'd, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>286, 604 A.2d 110 (1990). Still, the guidelines merit our consideration because they represent the practical interpretation of the statute by the agency charged with instructing local governmental units on how they were to comply with the new law. <em>Id. </em>at 36-37, 561 A.2d 618.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">The Legislature did not disavow the interpretation adopted by DLGS and DPB. Generally, \u201cthe fact that the Legislature has not acted in response to an agency\u2019s interpretation ... is \u2018granted great weight as evidence of its conformity with the legislative intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Klumb, supra, </em>199 <em>N.J. </em>at 24-25, 970 A.2d 354 (quoting <em>Malone v. Fender, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>129, 137, 402 A.2d 240 (1979)). That conformity is evident by the Legislature\u2019s action in enacting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-16.7 after the guidelines were issued and effectively adopting the same definition of base salary for use in police and firefighter arbitration. It is, therefore, reasonable to infer that the arbitrator was aware of the applicable guidelines from DLGS as well as the statute that governed the arbitration here and acted in conformity therewith.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>The orders dated October 12 and November 3, 2011, are reversed because the arbitration award must be enforced consistent with the definition of \u201cbase salary\u201d contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-16.7(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
