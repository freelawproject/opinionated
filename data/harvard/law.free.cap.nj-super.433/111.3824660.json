Following the commencement of divorce proceedings, plaintiff Barbara Minkowitz and defendant Ron Israeli agreed to forgo judicial determination of all financial issues in favor of binding arbitration and agreed all custody and parenting time issues would be reviewed in non-binding arbitration. The parties consented to engage a single arbitrator and a jointly chosen forensic accounting expert. After the arbitrator met with them, but prior to the commencement of arbitration proceedings, the parties opted to engage in settlement discussions and mediation to narrow the issues for final determination. As matters were resolved, written documents incorporating the parties\u2019 understanding were prepared. After more than one year had elapsed and a majority of their disagreements were settled without commencement of an arbitration hearing, plaintiff retained new counsel, who sought the underlying documentation supporting the financial agreements. The request was declined and, thereafter, plaintiff moved before the arbitrator for release of the documents. He barred release and counsel re-filed the requests before the Family Part. The Family Part judge generally denied the motions and ultimately confirmed the \u201carbitration awards\u201d as final judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">On appeal, plaintiff challenges five separate orders confirming arbitration awards. She maintains each must be set aside under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:23B-23 or, alternatively, requests the final judgment of divorce be vacated, pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:50-1. Plaintiff argues procedural violations, the arbitrator\u2019s bias and substantive errors caused an unconscionable result, which cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Following our review, we affirm the orders confirming the settlement agreements reached by the parties. However, we conclude once the arbitrator functioned as a mediator, he may not then conduct arbitration hearings. Consequently, we vacate those orders confirming substantive arbitration awards issued subsequent to the parties\u2019 execution of the mediated agreements. The matter is remanded to the Family Part for the parties to select a new arbitrator, who will conduct a binding arbitration hearing on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>any remaining financial disagreements. We also conclude under the terms of the parties\u2019 arbitration agreement, plaintiff has an entitlement to the requested documentation, the provision of which shall be addressed by the new arbitrator, once appointed.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Plaintiff filed her complaint for divorce on March 18, 2008, after fourteen years of marriage. The parties have two children who are now teenagers.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">The parties executed an agreement engaging a designated arbitrator, to \u201carbitrate the matter\u201d and \u201crender a written opinion incorporating his findings and conclusions of law in support of the award[.]\u201d The arbitration agreement provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-9\">1. The issues to be arbitrated shall be identified by the parties and placed on the record prior to the commencement of any hearing. The record will further reflect those issues that are being submitted to nonbinding, as distinguished from binding, arbitration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-10\">7. The Arbitrator shall have the power to issue subpoenas and to order depositions or other discovery in accordance with the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:23B-17.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-11\">8. The [Arbitrator shall have the power to order equitable remedies, if appropriate, unless the parties agree otherwise, in writing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-12\">10. Unless waived by the parties, in writing, the Arbitrator shall render a written opinion incorporating his findings and conclusions of law in support of the award.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-13\">13. The Agreement shall be subject to the Arbitration Aetr,] ... <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A23B-1 to \u201432[ ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-15\">Attached to the three-page arbitration agreement was a two-page document, which the parties also signed, entitled \u201cSTATEMENT OF RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF ARBITRATING PERSONS.\u201d Among the rights listed was \u201c[airbitrating [plersons have the right to be provided copies of all documents presented to the [arbitrator by their spouse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>The parties and their respective counsel also executed a consent order, filed with the Family Part, memorializing the agreement to arbitrate. The order reiterated those issues submitted to binding and non-binding arbitration; recited the designated arbitrator and payment of his retainer; and allocated the party\u2019s respective obligations for future payment of arbitration fees and costs. Finally, the order directed the arbitrator to schedule a \u201cpreliminary [c]ase Management [e]onferenee with the parties and the [cjourtappointed accountant\u201d and, concurrently, set \u201ca case management date ... with the court for ... September 3, 2008.\u201d The parties mutually stipulated and the court subsequently appointed Seymour Rubin of Rubin-Goertz &amp; Company as their \u201cjoint forensic accounting\u201d expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Although the arbitrator had been appointed and met with the parties, they filed a joint application before the Family Part seeking a protective order, which prescribed \u201c[ejonfidential Material\u201d could be disclosed only to the parties, their attorneys, their attorneys\u2019 respective staff, Rubin, the arbitrator, and the court. The protective order filed on January 27, 2009, defined \u201cconfidential material\u201d as \u201cinformation pertaining to ... parties and/or all entities\u201d listed on an attached schedule, which included the parties\u2019 business interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The arbitrator met with the parties and their attorneys in August 2008. Thereafter, counsel and the parties\u2019 respective accountants, but not the parties themselves, conferenced to review Rubin\u2019s financial evaluations. The parties chose to defer commencement of arbitration, pending efforts to settle some disputes. The parties, their counsel, Rubin, and at times, the arbitrator discussed their respective positions and submitted documentation. Rubin would offer a recommendation regarding resolution, and, if the parties accepted, a written agreement would be prepared. Following this process, the parties executed four agreements in 2009, which we collectively refer to as the 2009 agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">The first of the 2009 agreements, reached in February 2009, was presented to the Family Part via a consent order. The April <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>1, 2009 order simply stated: \u201cThe [ajrbitration [cjonsent [ojrder as to [ejquitable [djistribution of [mjedical [pjractices, attached hereto, is hereby incorporated herein and made a part hereof[,J and shall have the full force and effect of an [ojrder of this [cjourt.\u201d The \u201carbitration consent order\u201d included the Superior Court caption, but was signed by the arbitrator, the parties and counsel, and provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-6\">Bach party on the recommendation of the joint forensic accounting expert ... Rubin ... and after discussions with their respective counsel agree that he and she shall waive any right, title and/or interest ... in the medical practice of the other party and each party shall retain their own respective medical praetdce(s) free and clear of any claim by the other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">The \u201carbitration consent order\u201d also stated it \u201cshall be incorporated into any [pjroperty [sjettlement [ajgreement and/or [\u00a1Judgment of [djivorce entered into by the parties and the [cjourt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">Informal discussions continued with an eye toward resolving the parties\u2019 respective claims for equitable distribution. On July 8, 2009, the parties executed their second agreement, a \u201cMEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING,\u201d which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-9\">This memorandum ... shall describe the outline of an Agreement that was reached between the parties ... after mediation with the assistance of ... \u201cthe [a]rbitrator\u201d and Seymour Rubin, C.P.A.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-10\">It is understood that this Memorandum shall be binding with respect to the issues recited herein, although a formal Agreement will be prepared and subsequently executed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-11\">This Memorandum is the result of many months of negotiations and many conferences with [the arbitrator] and Mr. Rubin. The parties are entering into this Memorandum freely and voluntarily after conferring with their attorneys and anyone else with whom they wish to confer. The parties agree that this Memorandum represents a fair compromise of the issues. They acknowledge that by entering into this Memorandum, they are waiving their rights to participate in Arbitration hearings and waive the right to have the issues set forth in this Memorandum decided by the Arbitrator.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-12\">In this agreement, the parties restated the confidentiality of the financial disclosures; mutually waived alimony, and fixed child support; divided household furnishings, disposed and distributed various realty, retirement assets, stock and bank accounts, divided other joint assets; agreed to \u201cpay their own counsel fees[,J\u201d \u201cequally share\u201d the fees of the arbitrator and Rubin; and waived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>present and future claims for \u201cprior, present or future claims\u201d against one another. In the event of any further disputes, the memorandum required \u201cwritten presentations from each attorney\u201d to be submitted to the arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Defendant\u2019s counsel prepared a draft of a proposed property settlement agreement (PSA), purportedly memorializing the parties\u2019 agreements reached on the identified issues. However, a disagreement regarding the value and disposition of the former marital home occurred, which was resolved consensually in a three-page handwritten \u201cAmendment to Memorandum of Understanding\u201d dated September 22, 2009, the parties\u2019 third agreement. Next, a conference call, conducted by the arbitrator, settled 2008 tax issues, the terms of which were included in a memorandum of agreement dated October 15, 2009, which represents the fourth agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Plaintiff hired co-counsel to assist in drafting and finalizing the PSA. She corresponded with Rubin explaining her role and requesting a meeting \u201cto review his forensic findings,\u201d which served as the underpinnings of the parties\u2019 agreements. Defendant objected, claiming all matters were settled, except for relatively minor financial concerns. In a series of letters, Rubin consulted the arbitrator, who advised against his meeting with co-counsel, absent a formal application. On behalf of plaintiff, co-counsel wrote to the arbitrator requesting Rubin be instructed to meet with her and plaintiff \u201cto review the financial information and compilation of forensic information and analyses\u201d prepared by him. The arbitrator denied plaintiff\u2019s request to meet with Rubin in a letter dated November 23,2009, advising:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-7\">Prior to the execution of the [m]emorandum of [understanding and the [a]mendment thereto, Mr. Eubin spent many hours discussing the financial and property issues with [plaintiffs original counsel, plaintiff] and her accountant (as he did with [defendant\u2019s counsel, defendant] and his accountant)____[Plaintiffs original counsel] and your client\u2019s accountant should be able to explain the reasons why the issues recited in both agreements were resolved to the satisfaction of both parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-9\">Mr. Eubin has already reviewed his forensic findings in great detail with [plaintiffs original counsel, plaintiff] and her accountant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>At this point, plaintiffs original counsel filed an application before the Family Part to substitute co-counsel as plaintiffs representative and requested he be relieved. Plaintiff then moved before the Family Part for an order requiring Rubin\u2019s production of all evaluations of the parties\u2019 respective incomes and/or cash flow prepared \u201cin accordance with the [protective [c]onsent [o]rder entered in this matter.\u201d On the return date, substituted counsel, now acting as plaintiffs attorney, challenged the lack of disclosure provided to her and argued the 2009 agreements were \u201cinvalid.\u201d The Family Part judge dismissed the motion stating, \u201c[t]he parties ha[d] previously agreed that all financial aspects [we]re subject to binding arbitration. Any application seeking to modify this agreement must be made to the agreed upon arbitrator.\u201d Later that afternoon, the parties reached a settlement on custody and parenting time, which was placed on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">A consent dual judgment of divorce (JOD) was filed on March 8, 2010. The JOD specifically referenced and incorporated the parties\u2019 custody and parenting time agreement, set forth a timeline for resolving remaining financial issues, and noted any subsequent confirmed arbitration awards would be incorporated into the JOD, nunc pro tunc. Finally, plaintiffs demand for the production of financial documents was referred to the arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">As provided in the JOD, plaintiff filed a motion before the arbitrator, using the Family Part caption, seeking his recusal, or alternatively, requiring production of Rubin\u2019s financial documents, including reports regarding the parties\u2019 respective incomes and/or cash flow. Plaintiffs supporting certification inferred bias, stating the arbitrator had acted as both mediator and arbitrator throughout the proceeding. She also explained her need to obtain copies of Rubin\u2019s underlying documentation and attached a certification from her accountant, asserting the meeting with Rubin did not allow sufficient time to review the calculations or the underlying documentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">Defendant opposed plaintiffs requests and filed a cross-motion for payment of attorney\u2019s fees. He included certifications from his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>accountant, who refuted the characterization of the Rubin meetings. Rubin also filed a certification challenging facts asserted by plaintiff. He avowed the conference resulting in the agreement to distribute the medical practices lasted more than two-and-one-half hours, during which he presented \u201ca detailed analysis of the federal income tax returns for the calendar years 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006 as filed jointly by [the parties].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">An April 27, 2010 arbitration hearing addressed the issues raised in the cross-motions. In his decision, later incorporated in a May 25, 2010 award, the arbitrator denied plaintiffs application for recusal, explaining: \u201cMy role ... was to make recommendations, when requested, on the various financial issues____At no time did I assume the role of mediator. I did not participate in the discussions of the financial information.\u201d The arbitrator rejected plaintiffs contention she was denied sufficient information to knowledgeably make the decisions set forth in the 2009 agreements, quoting extensively from correspondence sent by her former counsel. The arbitrator also drew an adverse inference because plaintiff had not included a certification from former counsel, who the arbitrator found interacted directly with Rubin and participated in the conferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">Plaintiff returned to the Family Part seeking to set aside the May 25, 2010 arbitration order, requesting the same relief denied by the arbitrator. Defendant opposed plaintiffs motion in all respects and moved to disqualify counsel, confirm the May 25, 2010 arbitration order, and finalize outstanding issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">On July 16, 2010, the trial court entered an order summarily denying plaintiffs motion in its entirety, denying defendant\u2019s cross-motion to disqualify counsel and confirming the May 25, 2010 arbitration decision. Plaintiff moved for reconsideration, which was summarily denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">The parties returned to arbitration. In a November 10, 2010 proceeding conducted by the arbitrator, the parties agreed to a proposed allocation of debits and credits as computed by Rubin. Also, Rubin testified as to his proposed net distribution of assets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>based on the 2009 agreements. The arbitrator stopped plaintiffs cross-examination of Rubin, when he determined she attempted to open the issues resolved by the 2009 agreements. During these proceedings, defendant requested a reduction in the amount of his child support, claiming plaintiff no longer incurred child care and counseling costs. Plaintiff objected, asserting defendant failed to show any change of circumstances because the underlying calculation of the child support award and his current income were not disclosed. Finalization of the issue was adjourned pending additional submissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">On December 10, 2010, for the first time, Rubin agreed to meet with plaintiff, her counsel, her accountant and Thomas Hoberman, plaintiffs newly hired forensic accounting expert. Following the meeting Hoberman prepared a report, challenging Rubin\u2019s findings regarding plaintiffs projected 2008 income and identifying errors in his analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">The arbitrator corresponded with the parties, who had not complied with his directions for further submissions. More specifically, neither party had filed proposed resolutions regarding the outstanding property issues, and defendant had not submitted information supporting his child support modification request. Shortly thereafter, plaintiff renewed her demand for the arbitrator to recuse himself, this time claiming he engaged in ex parte communications with Rubin, in violation of <em>Rule </em>SiS-Sle).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">In a decision letter, the arbitrator provided a procedure for distributing personalty, noting neither party provided proof of value. He denied plaintiffs request to set aside the 2009 agreements, stating his \u201ccommunications with Mr. Rubin have been limited to scheduling issues and most recently to correct a factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>error[.]\u201d The arbitrator noted defendant had withdrawn his child support modification request; however, he ordered each party to address the basis for the award\u2019s deviation from the child support guidelines. Defendant responded; plaintiff renewed her request to set aside the 2009 agreements. The arbitrator, after reading certifications, made \u201ccredibility determinations\u201d and adopted defendant\u2019s explanation of the calculation of the amount of support, Rubin\u2019s recommendation for proposed credits and allocation of debts. In doing so, the arbitrator again drew an adverse inference from plaintiffs omission of the certification of prior counsel regarding his participation in the Rubin conferences. The arbitrator relied on prior counsel\u2019s correspondence sent on behalf of plaintiff, wherein the parties relinquished \u201cany equitable distribution claims against their respective practices only.\u201d The arbitrator again reserved finalization of the allocation of fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Rubin submitted a certification supporting the calculation of child support, reporting he met with the parties and their attorneys in the arbitrator\u2019s office on June 24, 2009 (the arbitrator was not present). At that time, Rubin made adjustments to the income figures supplied by the parties\u2019 accountants, calculating plaintiffs and defendant\u2019s 2008 incomes. Rubin found defendant\u2019s annual salary from all sources exceeded plaintiffs by less than $5000. Rubin attached the schedules he had prepared and discussed with the parties at that conference. The schedules were used to fix defendant\u2019s child support obligation and promote the mutual waiver of alimony. Plaintiff again requested the 2009 agreements be voided and discovery reopened based on Hoberman\u2019s March 2, 2011 letter, which rebutted Rubin\u2019s methodology used to calculate plaintiffs projected 2008 income. After correcting what he asserted were errors, Hoberman concluded plaintiffs projected 2008 income would be less than half the sum Rubin calculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">On March 17, 2011, the arbitrator entered an arbitration order incorporating the parties\u2019 2009 agreements, Rubin\u2019s spreadsheets calculating debits and credits, and the income schedules Rubin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>prepared supporting the calculation of child support, all of which were attached to the order. The order also directed \u201cthe final [arbitration [a]wards/[d]ecision shall be incorporated into an [a]mended [JOD], effective nunc pro tunc to February 4, 2010.\u201d The arbitrator reserved determination of any allocation of counsel, expert, and arbitration fees, pending further submissions by the parties. A subsequent agreement resolved distribution of personal property which also was incorporated in the JOD.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Plaintiff continued to press her request to vacate the 2009 agreements along with the arbitration orders. Relying on the certification of defendant\u2019s ex-fianc\u00e9e, Jamie Silverman, plaintiff believed Rubin was not objective and had been aiding defendant. Silverman certified defendant \u201cadvised\u201d he actually earned almost twice the sum Rubin had calculated and frequently spoke with Rubin, whom he allegedly referred to as \u201cUncle Seymour.\u201d Further, Silverman reportedly overheard a telephone conversation between defendant and Rubin, after which defendant informed her Rubin \u201cwas going to make sure everything was \u2018taken care of.... [A] little birdie told me Seymour got it covered.\u2019 \u201d Plaintiff sought to subpoena records of Rubin\u2019s telephone communications with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">Defendant opposed the application and cross-moved for an order requiring plaintiff to \u201cpay 100 percent of the counsel fees and costs incurred by ... defendant for having to respond.\u201d Rubin also submitted a certification denying plaintiffs allegations of bias, refuting the suggestion he merely accepted defendant\u2019s assertions. He explained \u201c[defendant] supplied voluminous credit card information to me for the five years preceding the date of the complaint!.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">The arbitrator issued a decision on July 1, 2011. He found Silverman \u201c[wa]s not completely objective!,]\u201d given her recent break-up with defendant, whereas Rubin was \u201cselected as a neutral accountant by both parties[,]\u201d had \u201cno apparent dog in the race,\u201d and had as many private conversations with plaintiff as with defendant. The arbitrator rejected plaintiffs claims and reserved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>his decision on defendant\u2019s fee request. Plaintiff subsequently moved for reconsideration, relying on certifications from plaintiffs accountant and Hoberman. Defendant opposed the request and reasserted his demand for payment of his fees. The arbitrator denied plaintiffs motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">In a separate submission the arbitrator addressed the allocation of fees. Finding \u201cboth parties have the income, ability and financial resources to pay counsel and expert fees and the costs of arbitration!,]\u201d the arbitrator held each party responsible for his and her own fees, as well as \u201c50% of the arbitration fees incurred ... and 50% of Mr. Rubin\u2019s fees ... as of December 1, 2009.\u201d However, as for fees incurred after December 1, 2009, the arbitrator found plaintiff \u201cconducted her ... litigation in bad faith\u201d and repeatedly asserted unreasonable positions, which warranted an award to defendant in order to protect him from the costs of unnecessary litigation. The arbitrator allocated $37,000 of Rubin\u2019s post-December 1, 2009 fees to plaintiff, and $9,281.25 to defendant. Further, he awarded defendant $50,000 for his attorney\u2019s work after December 1, 2009, to be paid by plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Defendant moved before the Family Part to confirm the March 17, 2011 arbitration award. Plaintiff cross-moved to vacate the award and all underlying agreements that were incorporated therein. She further requested to terminate services by the arbitrator and Rubin, to reopen discovery, and to select a new arbitrator and expert to \u201ccommence de novo arbitration of all financial issues!.]\u201d The judge granted defendant\u2019s motion to confirm the March 17, 2011 award and denied plaintiffs cross-motion in a November 30, 2011 order. A separate motion to confirm the arbitrator\u2019s August 11, 2011 fee award was filed and granted, over plaintiffs objection. In a November 30, 2011 order, the judge also declined plaintiffs motion to stay enforcement pending her appeal and denied defendant\u2019s motion for an additional fee award.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">On appeal, plaintiff requests we reverse the orders by the court confirming the May 25, 2010, March 17, 2011, and August 11, 2011 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>awards by the arbitrator, whom she maintains committed misconduct, displayed partiality, and exceeded the scope of arbitral authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Neither party contests the consensual agreement to submit all financial disputes to binding arbitration. The record supports the parties clearly opted out of judicial review of their matrimonial matter in favor of arbitration. The proceeding\u2019s emphasis on confidentiality, coupled with defendant\u2019s resistance to release of income information, suggest a motive to maintain financial secrecy.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">On appeal, plaintiff seeks to vacate the arbitration awards and the orders confirming them, emphasizing procedural defects during proceedings conducted by the arbitrator infected the fundamental fairness of the process and resulted in an unconscionable outcome. Before we examine plaintiffs challenges, we need to consider the arbitral forum choice, governed by the Revised Uniform Arbitration Act (the Act), <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:23B-1 to -32.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">\u201cIn New Jersey, arbitration ... is a favored means of dispute resolution.\u201d <em>Hojnowski v. Vans Skate Park, </em>187 <em>N.J. </em>323, 342, 901 A.2d 381 (2006). It is well-settled that New Jersey\u2019s strong public policy favors settlement of disputes through arbitration. <em>Id. </em>at 343, 901 A.2d 381; <em>see also Block v. Plosia, </em>390 <em>N.J.Super. </em>543, 551, 916 A.2d 475 (App.Div.2007) (stating the Act \u201ccontinues our state\u2019s long-standing policy to favor voluntary arbitration as a means of dispute resolution\u201d). Increasingly, parties elect \u201cto side step the judicial process\u201d and enter arbitration agreements in a myriad of areas other than labor-management disputes. <em>Fawzy v.

Faherty, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>99, 477 A.2d 1257 (1984). In <em>Faherty, </em>the question considered was the enforceability of an arbitration clause in a separation agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 105, 477 A.2d 1257. The Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-5\">It is fair and reasonable that parties who have agreed to be bound by arbitration in a formal, written separation agreement should be so bound. Rather than frowning on arbitration of alimony disputes, public policy supports it. We recognize that in many cases arbitration of matrimonial disputes may offer an effective alternative method of dispute resolution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\"><em>[Faherty, supra, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>at 107, 477 A.2d 1257.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">A significant advantage of arbitration, likely the controlling motivation in this matter, is \u201cthe opportunity for resolution of sensitive matters in a private and informal forum,\u201d rather than presentation of the matter in the public arena of an open courtroom. <em>Id. </em>at 107-08, 477 A.2d 1257. The Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-8\">arbitration conducted in a less formal atmosphere, often in a shorter time span than a trial, and always with a fact-finder of the parties\u2019 own choosing, is often far less antagonistic and nasty than typical courthouse litigation.

From the judiciary\u2019s perspective, once parties contract for binding arbitration, all that remains is the possible need to: enforce orders or subpoena issued by the arbitrator, which have been ignored, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:23B-17(g); confirm the arbitration award, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:23B-22; correct or modify an award, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:23B-24, and in very limited circumstances, vacate an award <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:23B-23.

She contends the 2009 agreements were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>not the product of arbitration and, therefore, should be set aside. Further, she maintains the arbitrator exceeded his powers by acting as both mediator and arbitrator, presided over issues not subject to arbitration, and exercised undue means in repeatedly denying plaintiff access to \u201crelevant financial documents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Defendant counters, stating plaintiffs request to vacate was filed beyond the 120-day window set forth in <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:23B-23b. We need not address defendant\u2019s procedural challenge, in light of the fact that the March 17, 2011 arbitration award was not a final, conclusive determination of all issues concluding the arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">This case unraveled because the parties agreed to arbitration, then chose to do something else. That said, we analyze what actually occurred resulting in the 2009 agreements and whether our intervention is warranted. Even though the process employed was not an arbitration hearing as envisioned by the Act or as agreed by the parties, we conclude the procedures were not fundamentally unfair, the process was not infirm, and the 2009 agreements need not be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">Regarding the first agreement to distribute the medical practice, the arbitrator did not participate in the settlement discussions; Rubin had the lead role. The parties tunneled information to him, he made recommendations, the parties\u2019 attorneys and experts asked questions, and a decision to accept, modify or reject the recommendations was individually made. Plaintiff never states she and her original attorney did not discuss these issues, or claims she was deprived of the ability to consider documentation prior to reaching the February 2009 agreement. Rather, her complaint is the documents were not kept by her original attorney and, therefore, were not available to substituted counsel.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Plaintiff also complains that when she sought subsequent review of the financial information regarding the business interests she was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>denied access. We find the process employed did not violate the Act and plaintiffs challenges are insufficient to vacate the agreement dividing the medical practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Although parties contract to arbitrate, settlement negotiations are not foreclosed by the Act. <em>See, e.g., N.J.S.A. </em>2A:23B-15a (authorizing an arbitrator to hold conferences with the parties to the arbitration proceeding before the hearing). Indeed, New Jersey courts have found that the \u201c \u2018[settlement of litigation ranks high in [the] public policy\u2019 \u201d of this State. <em>Puder v. Buechel, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>428, 437, 874 A.2d 534 (2005) (quoting <em>Nolan ex rel. Nolan v. Lee Ho, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>465, 472, 577 A.2d 143 (1990) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) (alterations in original)). We have held, \u201cso long as the parties acknowledge that the agreement was reached voluntarily and is for them, at least, fair and equitable\u201d it should be enforced. <em>Lerner v. Laufer, </em>359 <em>N.J.Super. </em>201, 217, 819 A.2d 471 (App.Div.2003). \u201cAdvancing that public policy is imperative ... where matrimonial proceedings have increasingly overwhelmed the docket.\u201d <em>Puder, supra, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>at 430, 874 A.2d 534; <em>see also Davidson v. Davidson, </em>194 <em>N.J.Super. </em>547, 550, 477 A.2d 423 (Ch.1984) (\u201cWith more divorces being granted now than in history, and with filings on the rise, fair, reasonable, equitable and, to the extent possible, conclusive settlements must be reached, or the inexorable and inordinate passage of time from initiation of suit to final trial will be absolutely devastating[.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Plaintiffs suggestion she was uninformed is rejected as this record contains no evidence to show her decision dividing the medical practice was not made with full knowledge or was the result of coercion. Plaintiff is a highly educated, successful, professional businesswoman. The parties were married for fourteen years, and, even if some of defendant\u2019s enterprises were founded late in the marital relationship, their existence was disclosed and plaintiff was able to gain necessary information regarding these entities. The circumstances here reflect no disparity in bargaining power between plaintiff and defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>Moreover, plaintiffs agreement, guided by the advice of her independently chosen legal counsel and aided by her individual accountant, was made after reflection on alternatives. In fact, the record shows that immediately following plaintiffs initial acceptance of Rubin\u2019s recommendation, her accountant and attorney repudiated assent, asserting errors were found in Rubin\u2019s calculations. Following further review, plaintiff withdrew her objection and reaffirmed her agreement to be bound, accepting through counsel, the distribution as fair and equitable. The record supports plaintiffs decision was reasoned, voluntary and deliberate, making it a binding contract between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">These same reasons uphold the memorandum of understanding reached on July 8, 2009, along with its amendments dated September 22, 2009, and October 15, 2009. These detailed documents, fully executed by the parties and counsel, were not the product of arbitration, but mediation. Following our review, we find no basis to set them aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">Certainly, mediation, although a form of alternate dispute resolution, differs from binding arbitration, which raises the next question posed by plaintiff: can parties who agree to proceed in binding arbitration change the process to mediation? We conclude they can. Even though the parties contracted to pursue \u201cbinding arbitration,\u201d their change of course to utilize mediation will not invalidate their settlement agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">Mediation is governed by the Uniform Mediation Act (UMA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:23C-1 to -13, <em>R. </em>1:40-4, and <em>R. </em>l:40-5(b). Similar to arbitration, mediation provides an alternate, more informal forum than litigation, allowing confidential and candid exchange of information between the parties and the mediator to aid the parties\u2019 efforts in reaching an accord on disputes. Mediated agreements, like other contracts, must be knowingly and voluntarily reached. A settlement agreement, reached in mediation, which is incorporated into an executed, signed written agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>is enforceable. <em>Willingboro Mall, Ltd. v. 240/242 Franklin Ave., L.L.C., </em>215 <em>N.J. </em>242, 250-51, 263, 71 A.3d 888 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">The July 8, 2009 memorandum of understanding executed by the parties is direct and expressly states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-6\">This Memorandum between [the parties] shall describe the outline of an Agreement that was reached between the parties on July 8, 2009 after mediation with the assistance of [the arbitrator] and [Rubin].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-7\">This Memorandum is the result of many months of negotiations and many conferences with [the arbitrator] and Mr. Rubin. The parties are entering into this Memorandum freely and voluntarily after conferring with their attorneys and anyone else with whom they wish to confer. The parties agree that this Memorandum represents a fair compromise of the issues. They acknowledge that by entering into this Memorandum they are waiving their rights to participate in [the] Arbitration hearing and waive the right to have the issues set forth in this Memorandum decided by the Arbitrator.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">The amendment further provides \u201cthe parties agree to the foregoing freely and voluntarily.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">Despite her protests, plaintiff offers no evidence to repudiate these pronouncements. Nothing supports the failure of the parties to exchange necessary information. <em>See R. </em>1:40-5(b)(3) (\u201cIn mediation of economic aspects of family actions, parties are required to provide accurate and complete information to the mediator and to each other, including but not limited to tax returns, Case Information Statements, and appraisal reports.\u201d). Also, the mediation agreement satisfies the prerequisites for enforcement as the terms were incorporated into a written document signed and distributed to all parties. <em>Willingboro Mall, supra, </em>215 <em>N.J. </em>at 263, 71 A.3d 888. Our review of this record unearths no basis to undo the consensual 2009 agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">We also reject plaintiffs claims of legal insufficiency. Although we agree, for example, the child support agreement omitted a baseline determination, that fact may cause future proof problems if modification is sought, but it alone would not void the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>Plaintiff points to Hoberman\u2019s analysis of her projected 2008 income to suggest the alimony and child support provisions in the 2009 agreements must be vacated. We conclude if plaintiffs projected income were inaccurate, standing alone that fact is insufficient to vacate the July 8, 2009 agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">First, the support award was not simply a guidelines calculation. Necessary information required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-23a, includes not only plaintiffs income, but also defendant\u2019s income, the children\u2019s needs, and other funds available, including any income or assets of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Second, the support calculation did not stand alone as the agreement as a whole integrated settlement of both support and various equitable distribution issues. Often these matters are \u201cinterrelated\u201d amidst compromise of parties\u2019 myriad economic concerns. <em>Lehr v. Afflitto, </em>382 <em>N.J.Super. </em>376, 396, 889 A.2d 462 (App.Div.2006). <em>See also Lynn v. Lynn, </em>165 <em>N.J.Super. </em>328, 342, 398 A.2d 141 (App.Div.) (noting the necessary interrelationship between property distribution, alimony and child support), <em>certif. denied, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>52, 404 A.2d 1152 (1979). \u201c[T]he termination of a marriage involves an \u2018economic mosaic\u2019 comprised of equitable distribution, alimony and child support and ... these financial components interface.\u201d <em>Koelble v. Koelble, </em>261 <em>N.J.Super. </em>190, 192, 618 A.2d 377 (App.Div.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">Third, plaintiffs argument does not explain how Hoberman\u2019s conclusions affect the final overall result. Hoberman refuted Rubin\u2019s inclusion of certain items in the 2008 income projections, but he did not specify plaintiffs actual reported 2008 income or compare it to Rubin\u2019s projected computations.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">Fourth, even if Rubin\u2019s calculations of plaintiffs income were wrong, it is well established that significant changes in circumstances warrant review and potential modification of a child support award. <em>Lepis v. Lepis, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>139, 145, 416 A.2d 45 (1980). Therefore, were plaintiff to prove such a change along with the children\u2019s needs, the support amount could be altered.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>As a result of our review, we decline to vacate the 2009 agreements, finding unfounded plaintiffs claims that the procedures followed to reach them were defective or her acceptance unreliable. As noted, the parties agreed to mediate and conduct settlement discussions, rather than commence an arbitration hearing. That procedure is permissible and the agreements are enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">We turn to plaintiffs next challenge asserting the arbitrator\u2019s change of role to a facilitator of a mediated agreement obviated his ability to thereafter proceed as an arbitrator. Plaintiff argues the arbitrator \u201ccommitted misconduct and exceeded his powers by acting as both a mediator and an arbitrator.\u201d She further explains the arbitrator aided mediation of the disputes, then, when she sought underlying documentation, he \u201cenforced the [agreements] that he had written [as a mediator] as if they were the result of an actual arbitration,\u201d converting the result to a binding arbitration award. This is an issue of first impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">Our review considers the compatibility of the same party assuming the role of mediator and arbitrator. Mediation and arbitration both allow for resolution of disputes outside the court process, and the hallmark of a mediator and an arbitrator is neutrality. <em>See R. </em>1:40 \u2014 2(1)(a)(1) (defining arbitration as \u201c[a] process by which each party and/or its counsel presents its case to a neutral third party, who then renders a specific award\u201d). Nevertheless, we conclude the differences in the roles of these two types of dispute resolution professionals necessitate that a mediator, who may become privy to party confidences in guiding disputants to a mediated resolution, cannot thereafter retain the appearance of a neutral factfinder necessary to conduct a binding arbitration proceeding. Consequently, absent the parties\u2019 agreement, an arbitrator appointed under the Act may not assume the role of mediator and, thereafter, resume the role of arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>Mediation is included as a \u201cFacilitative Process[,]\u201d which is defined as \u201ca process by which a mediator facilitates communication between parties in an effort to promote settlement without imposition of the mediator\u2019s own judgment regarding the issues in dispute.\u201d <em>R. </em>1:40 \u2014 2(c). \u201cA mediator, although neutral, often takes an active role in promoting candid dialogue by identifying issues [and] encouraging parties to accommodate each other[\u2019s] interests.\u201d <em>Lehr, supra, </em>382 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 394, 889 A.2d 462 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted) (alteration in original); <em>see also </em>James R. Coben &amp; Peter N. Thompson, \u201cDisputing Irony: A Systematic Look at Litigation About Mediation,\u201d 11 <em>Harv. Negot. L. Rev. </em>43 (\u201c \u2018As a facilitator, a mediator is not tasked with reaching a final decision in a matter, but rather instills trust and confidence of the participants in the mediation process, allowing them to resolve their differences.\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>V.J.L. v. Red, </em>39 P.3d 1110, 1113 n. 3 (Wyo.2002))).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Mediations are not conducted under oath, do not follow traditional rules of evidence, and are not limited to developing the facts. Admittedly, mediation encourages confidential disclosures to the mediator, whose training is designed to utilize these confidential positions to aid the parties to evaluate their positions, promote understanding of the other side\u2019s position, and reach a consensus. These confidences are \u201cinsured only if the participants trust that information conveyed to the mediator will remain in confidence.\u201d <em>Lehr, supra, </em>382 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 395, 889 A.2d 462. \u201cMediation communications, which \u2018would not exist but for the settlement attempt,\u2019 are made by parties \u2018without the expectation that they will later be bound by them.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Williams, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>432, 447, 877 A.2d 1258 (2005) (quoting Michael L. Prigoff, <em>Toward Candor or Chaos: The Case of Confidentiality in Mediation, </em>12 <em>Seton Hall Legis. J. </em>2, 13 (1988)). \u201cSuccessful mediation, with its emphasis on conciliation, depends on confidentiality perhaps more than any other form of [alternate dispute resolution].\u201d <em>Williams, supra, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>at 447, 877 A.2d 1258 (citation omitted). \u201cIndeed, mediation stands in stark contrast to formal adjudication, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>and [ ] arbitration, in which the avowed goal is to uncover and present evidence of claims and defenses in an adversarial setting.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">On the other hand, an arbitrator\u2019s role is evaluative, requiring the parties to present their evidence for a final determination. <em>See R. </em>1:40-2(b)(2) (defining \u201cEvaluative Process\u201d to include \u201cNeutral Fact Finding: A process by which a neutral, agreed upon by the parties, investigates and analyzes a dispute involving complex or technical issues, and who then makes nonbinding findings and recommendations.\u201d). Arbitrators essentially weigh evidence, assess credibility, and apply the law when determining whether a party has proven his or her request for relief. <em>See </em>Lela P. Love, <em>Symposium: The Top Ten Reasons Why Mediators Should Not Evaluate, </em>24 <em>Fla. St. U.L.Rev. </em>937, 938 (1997). An arbitrator makes a final decision, which binds the parties. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2A:23B-1 (defining an \u201carbitrator\u201d as \u201can individual appointed ... to render an award ... in a controversy that is subject to an agreement to arbitrate\u201d). Thus, \u201carbitrators should conduct the proceedings in an evenhanded manner and treat all parties with equality and fairness at all stages of the proceedings.\u201d <em>Barcon, supra, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>at 190, 430 A.2d 214 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Toward this end, the Act vests arbitrators with broad discretion over discovery and other procedural matters to \u201cconduct an arbitration in such manner as the arbitrator considers appropriate for a fair and expeditious disposition of the proceeding. The authority conferred upon the arbitrator includes the power to hold conferences with the parties ... before the hearing[.]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:23B-15a. The statute\u2019s broad conferral of authority \u201cdoes not require any particular procedures, mandate discovery, compel the maintenance of a record, command a statement by the arbitrator regarding his findings and conclusions, or an expression of the reasons why he reached the result that he did[,]\u201d unless expressly required under the parties\u2019 arbitration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>agreement. <em>Johnson v. Johnson, </em>204 <em>N.J. </em>529, 546, 9 A.3d 1003 (2010) (citing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:23B-1 to -32).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">While we recognize the Act envisions a need for flexibility to meet a wide variety of situations presented in arbitration proceedings, we are not persuaded the Act intended an appointed arbitrator may first assume the role of mediator then switch back to conduct final arbitration hearings. As noted, an effective mediator gains each party\u2019s confidence and offers advice to steer them toward settlement. Those confidential communications gained in mediation are precluded from being considered in a court contest, <em>Isaacson v. Isaacson, </em>348 <em>N.J.Super. </em>560, 577, 792 A.2d 525 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>364, 807 A.2d 195 (2002), and would similarly be precluded from consideration in an arbitration hearing. <em>See also Willingboro Mall, supra, </em>215 <em>N.J. </em>at 245 (\u201cCommunications made during the course of a mediation are generally privileged and therefore inadmissible in another proceeding.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">In researching this issue, we found limited discussion of the subject. Initially, we are aware <em>Rule </em>l:40-2(d) identifies as a \u201cHybrid Process\u201d of complementary dispute resolution \u201c[m]ediation-arbitration,\u201d which it defined as \u201c[a] process by which, after an initial mediation, unresolved issues are then arbitrated.\u201d The rule does not address whether the same party may perform both functions or whether issues attempted to be mediated may then be arbitrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">In <em>Isaacson, </em>we discussed the efficacy of assuming the dual role of custody mediator and guardians ad litem (GAL), examining the applicable court rules governing appointments of custody and parenting time mediators, <em>R. </em>1:40-5(a) and GALs, <em>R. </em>5:8B. We noted <em>Rule </em>1:40-5(c) specifies a custody and parenting time mediator may not subsequently act as an evaluator in the proceeding or make any recommendation to the court respecting the issues. <em>Isaacson, supra, </em>348 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 577, 792 A.2d 525. We concluded \u201c[a] practical reading of the rules and common sense preclude[d] the [possible] dual role of mediator and GAL.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>575, 792 A.2d 525. We find <em>Isaacson\u2019s </em>distinction between an evaluative versus faeilitative role helpful.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Canon IV.H of the Code of Ethics for Arbitrators in Commercial Disputes, approved by the American Bar Association and the American Arbitration Association, states \u201can arbitrator should not be present or otherwise participate in the settlement discussions unless requested to do so by all parties. An arbitrator should not exert pressure on any party to settle.\u201d This guideline is also directed to the evaluator-facilitator dichotomy. Despite the code\u2019s applicability to commercial matters, such a concern certainly exists and may even be heightened in the arbitration of an emotionally charged matrimonial matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">We uncovered one regulatory provision presumably suggesting an appointed arbitrator may mediate or assist the parties to reach a settlement during compulsory interest arbitration to resolve collective bargaining disputes between police and fire departments and their employees. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>19:16-5.7(c). However, upon examination of the statutory authority governing the regulation, we find a marked distinction between the two proceedings, as the statute requires: \u201cAny mediation or factfinding invoked pursuant to ... this section shall terminate immediately upon the filing of a petition for arbitration.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-16(b)(2). Again, the distinction between the roles of the facilitator in a mediation and the factfinder in an arbitration is important.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">Based on our review of the distinctly different proceedings of arbitration and mediation, we conclude the positions of arbitrator and mediator are in conflict. An arbitrator must \u201cmaintain \u2018broad public confidence in the integrity and fairness of the [arbitration] process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Barcon, supra, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>at 190, 430 A.2d 214 (quoting Holtzmann, <em>The First Code of Ethics for Arbitrators in Commercial Disputes, </em>33 <em>The Business Lawyer </em>309, 312 (1977)). If the same person acts as a mediator, obtains party confidences or offers opinions on the issues in dispute, a conflict arises were he or she to then switch roles to act as an arbitrator, making the final call. We find the need for an arbitrator\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>complete objectivity bears heavily on the integrity of the arbitration process. This concern becomes even more problematic when arbitrating matrimonial disputes between already suspicious adverse parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">In the family law context, we could envision parties agreeing in writing to allow one person to perform these roles regarding separate issues; for example, mediation of custody matters and arbitration of financial issues. However, this should be the parties\u2019 choice. Absent a specific agreement clearly defining and accepting the complementary dispute resolution professional\u2019s roles, dual roles are to be avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">It is advisable for parties to exhaust all applicable dispute resolution alternatives, including settlement conferences and mediation before undertaking arbitration. Once these available courses are exhausted and arbitration is chosen, the arbitrator should promptly commence hearings and resolve matters expeditiously.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">In this matter, the arbitrator disavowed any mediation role, suggesting he merely performed conferencing. The record supports the arbitrator\u2019s position regarding the agreement dividing the parties\u2019 medical practices. Unfortunately, however, we cannot reach that same conclusion in light of the unequivocal introductory paragraph contained in the July 8, 2009 memorandum of understanding, which is described as \u201can Agreement that was reached between the parties ... after mediation with the assistance of [the arbitrator and Rubin].\u201d The agreement\u2019s terms place the arbitrator in the role of moving the parties toward compromise in mediation. We will not infer that the written document is inartful or accept the suggestion the arbitrator merely brought to bear his informed judgment in order to reach a fair solution. Rather, we can only conclude the agreement means what it says: it is a product of mediation reached with the assistance of both the arbitrator and Rubin.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">Based on our determination, absent the parties\u2019 contract to the contrary, once a neutral assumes the role of mediator, he or she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>may not assume the role of arbitrator. Therefore, any \u201carbitration awards\u201d based on the arbitrator\u2019s finding, entered following the 2009 mediated agreements must be set aside. After guiding mediation, the arbitrator could no longer proceed, and by doing so here, he exceeded his powers. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:23B-23a(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Applying this holding to the entered arbitration awards, we reach the following conclusions. The November 30, 2011 Family Division order confirming the August 11, 2011 arbitration order adjudicating the award of counsel fees and costs is vacated. Next, examining the March 17, 2011 arbitration award, paragraph (1) adopts Rubin\u2019s allocation of credits and disposition of marital assets, which the parties agreed to accept. Although reached during arbitration after the 2009 mediations, the provisions adopt a settlement agreement and were not the product of the arbitrator\u2019s determination. Paragraphs (2) through (5) entered the parties\u2019 2009 agreements as final. For the reasons set forth earlier in our opinion upholding the parties\u2019 2009 agreements, these provisions need not be disturbed. Paragraph (7), like paragraph (1), included a post-mediation agreement for a credit due plaintiff, not an arbitration award and may stand. Paragraphs (6), (8), (10) through (13) are procedural provisions, which also need not be set aside. Only paragraph (9) of the March 17, 2001 arbitration award, addressing the underlying calculation of child support, represents a post-mediation award made by the arbitrator, which must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">The Family Division\u2019s August 19, 2011 order, which confirmed the March 17, 2011 arbitration award is vacated, to the extent the order confirmed paragraph (9) of the arbitration award. However, we need not set aside confirmation provisions incorporating the parties\u2019 2009 agreements into the JOD.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">Also, we vacate the provisions in the July 16, and September 23, 2010 Family Part\u2019s orders confirming the arbitrator\u2019s awards that conflict with the provisions of this opinion. Specifically, the provisions adopting the arbitrator\u2019s denial of plaintiffs document requests and confirm the May 25, 2010 arbitration decision, excepting, however, those provisions regarding the 2009 agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>The matter is remanded to the Family Part for the sole purpose of supervising the parties\u2019 selection of a new arbitrator, to conduct arbitration proceedings under the Act to determine unresolved financial issues, that are not otherwise covered by their mediated and other settlement agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">The final issue for discussion centers on plaintiffs request for financial disclosure following the execution of the 2009 agreements. We are at a loss to understand why this request was met with such resistance, in light of the express terms of the arbitration agreement and the parties\u2019 protective order.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">The record contains no agreement to limit copying or review of the other side\u2019s financial disclosures rendered to Rubin. Rather, the documents governing arbitration gave plaintiff the absolute right to copy all relevant information. Specifically, the appended statement of rights of arbitrating parties included \u201cthe right to be provided copies of all documents presented to the [arbitrator by their spouse.\u201d Further, the protective order allowed the documents to be reviewed by the parties along with their counsel and experts. Allowing review of the documents would not have caused incessant delay, but rather would have allowed substituted counsel the opportunity to become informed.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">A concern often arises that post-settlement remorse may motivate a party to retract a valid agreement. However, such tactics can effectively be thwarted through sanctions or an award of attorney\u2019s fees for frivolous conduct. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>2A:23B-21 (affording arbitrator\u2019s authority to award exemplary relief and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees). Further, the request could have been temporally conditioned, and payment for Rubin\u2019s time could have been allocated solely to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">Defendant relies on our decision in <em>Manger, </em>to suggest an arbitrator\u2019s discovery decisions must be upheld. Certain discovery limitations must be made in \u201cthe interest of making the hearing \u2018fair, expeditious, and cost effective!.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Manger, supra, </em>417 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 376, 9 A.3d 1081 (quoting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:23B-17c). In <em>Manger, </em>we reviewed defendant\u2019s claim of misconduct alleging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>the arbitrator improperly denied submission of expert evaluations of the parties\u2019 business. <em>Id. </em>at 374, 9 A.3d 1081. We found no basis to disturb the arbitrator\u2019s award, upholding \u201cthe arbitrator\u2019s broad authority to conduct the proceeding!)]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 377, 9 A.3d 1081. However, the facts in <em>Manger </em>are distinguishable. The arbitrator in that ease had determined to follow pre-arbitration orders that were entered by the Family Part, which included a deadline for submission of expert evaluations. <em>Id. </em>at 373, 9 A.3d 1081.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-5\">Consistent with her authority to \u201cconduct an arbitration in such manner as the arbitrator considers appropriate for a fair and expeditious disposition of the proceeding,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:23B-15(a), the arbitrator could have ignored or revised the orders entered in the trial court. On the other hand, the arbitrator could apply any and all orders previously entered in the trial court and fashion new discovery and case management orders for the arbitration proceeding. Here, the arbitrator exercised her broad authority to follow the latter course.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 376, 9 A.3d 1081.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">More important, \u201cthe arbitrator provided an opportunity for each party to identify and exchange the documents on which they intended to rely at the hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 377, 9 A.3d 1081.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">Here, although there was some review of documentation, Rubin and the parties\u2019 counsel apparently had not retained the considered information. When plaintiffs substituted counsel sought to gain background for the underlying agreements, the arbitrator denied the request and restrained Rubin from further discussion of those issues with substituted counsel. As a result of these determinations, substituted counsel faced an untenable and even suspicious situation, precluding her from providing informed advice to her client and prompting repeated motions to reopen discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">A court may vacate an arbitration award when it is procured by undue means or resulted from an arbitrator exceeding his designated powers. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:24-8a. The judicial inquiry must consider more than whether a mere mistake occurred. <em>Tretina, supra, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>at 356-57, 640 A.2d 788 (quotation marks and citation omitted). Rather, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABz\">formulation requires that the arbitrator[ ] must have clearly intended to decide according to law, must have clearly mistaken the legal rule, and that mistake must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>appear on the face of the award. In addition, the error, to be fatal, must result in a failure of intent or be so gross as to suggest fraud or misconduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 357, 640 A.2d 788 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">Although we agree the arbitrator properly determined discovery would not be reopened, we cannot similarly uphold the order precluding plaintiff from obtaining documents to which she was unquestionably entitled. The contract to arbitrate specifically granted plaintiff this right and nothing reflects she waived that right. Barring substituted counsel from this information represents an egregious remaking of the arbitration contract, which cannot stand. The Family Part\u2019s order confirming this determination must also be vacated. Once appointed, the new arbitrator shall consider plaintiffs document requests, in light of our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">To the extent plaintiff has presented arguments not specifically addressed in our opinion, we reject them as lacking sufficient merit to warrant discussion. <em>R. </em>2:3 \u2014 11(e)(1)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">We close with these observations. Arbitration, particularly binding arbitration, must be purposefully chosen, and the parameters must be designated in a contract between the parties. If binding arbitration is selected as the forum for resolution of disputes, a litigant cannot jump back and forth between the court and the arbitral forum. By its very nature, arbitration does not permit such a hybrid system. Further, arbitration \u201cshould be a fast and inexpensive way to achieve final resolution of ... disputes and not merely a way-station on route to the courthouse,\u201d <em>Borough of E. Rutherford, supra, </em>213 <em>N.J. </em>at 201, 61 A.3d 941 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Attempts to return to the court, except to confirm the final arbitration award, are at odds with this objective.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">In the matter at bar, the parties\u2019 contract concisely defined matters to be addressed in arbitration, yet from commencement, the Family Part maintained involvement such as scheduling case management and entertaining a motion for a protective order, both of which fall directly within the adjudicatory responsibilities of the arbitrator. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:23B-17e. More<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>over, the parties held a mistaken belief that court intervention was permitted to check the decisions of the arbitrator. This is untenable. The Act\u2019s provisions are unmistakable: once binding arbitration is chosen and the arbitrator(s) named, the court is no longer involved in reviewing or determining the substantive issues. The court\u2019s role is circumscribed to confirm a final arbitration award, correct obvious errors, and consider whether the award should be vacated, <em>only </em>when one of the limited bases set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:23B-23 has occurred. The piecemeal approach demonstrated here prolonged the final result and eliminated the main benefit of arbitration, \u201cto provide an effective, expedient, and fair resolution of disputes[.]\u201d <em>Fawzy, swpra, </em>199 <em>N.J. </em>at 470, 973 A.2d 347 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Finally, had the parties actually followed the path of binding arbitration, the need for a PSA would be obviated because an issued arbitration award would be confirmed by court order assuring compliance. No separate agreement memorializing the order is needed. Insistence upon preparation of a PSA appears to result from habit, not necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Lastly, we do not mean to suggest parties who seek to arbitrate disputes should abandon all hope of amicable resolution. We urge parties to exhaust possible settlement alternatives prior to contracting for arbitration. If arbitration is accepted, parameters for settlement discussions should be set by the arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">In summary, the parties\u2019 agreements dated February, (incorporated by a Family Part order dated April 1), July 8, September 22, and October 15, 2009 are valid and enforceable. The custody and parenting time consent order reached on February 4, 2010 also is not challenged and remains unchanged. Consequently, the March 8, 2010 JOD as originally filed need not be disturbed because it adopts the 2009 agreements reached and finalized the custody agreement. The JOD further accepts the parties\u2019 agreed allocation of debits and credits. The arbitration record suggests this issue was also settled, not resolved by orders following an arbitra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>tion hearing. That resolution, occurring after the arbitrator\u2019s disqualification, stands on its own as a voluntary agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">We vacate the trial court\u2019s November 30, 2011 confirmation of the August 11, 2011 arbitration award, allocating attorney\u2019s fees and costs as it was rendered following what we have identified arbitrators\u2019 unauthorized action.
