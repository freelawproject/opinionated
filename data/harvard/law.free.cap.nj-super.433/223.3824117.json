This is FFHD\u2019s second challenge to the construction of a 230 kV/12.5 kV electrical substation by Jersey Central Power &amp; Light (JCP &amp; L) in Tewksbury Township. The substation was built to address repeated power outages in Tewksbury caused by an increased demand for electricity. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Previously, FFHD appealed from a final determination of the Board of Public Utilities (BPU or the Board) that found the substation necessary and authorized JCP &amp; L to proceed with construction of the substation. We briefly summarize the facts and conclusions set forth in our unpublished opinion, <em>In re Appeal of Jersey Cent. Power &amp; Light Co., </em>No. A-2150-09, 2011 <em>WL </em>446046 (App.Div. Feb. 10, 2011) <em>(In re JCP &amp; L), certif. denied, </em>207 <em>N.J. </em>65, 22 A.3d 974 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">JCP &amp; L filed an application with Tewksbury\u2019s Land Use Board (TLUB) seeking preliminary and site plan approval and certain variances required for the construction of the substation. TLUB denied the application in December 2008 and, thereafter, issued a resolution memorializing its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">In January 2009, JCP &amp; L filed a petition with BPU pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-19, seeking authorization to construct the substation, notwithstanding TLUB\u2019s denial of its application. BPU found the substation necessary, noting that residential customers in the area increased by thirty-percent between 1999 and 2006, resulting in twenty-percent overloads during peak periods, and that the substation as planned and placed would help to ensure adequate voltage levels. On September 14,2009, the Board issued a Decision and Order authorizing JCP &amp; L to construct, install and operate the substation.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">In its appeal from that decision, FFHD argued that BPU\u2019s decision should be reversed because it: gave insufficient weight to TLUB\u2019s decision and analysis in reviewing JCP &amp; L\u2019s appeal; should have deferred to the analysis and determination of TLUB in its evaluation of the effect of the proposed substation on the community zone plan; failed to adequately analyze the safety issues while granting relief; failed to adequately analyze the economic impact of the proposed substation on the property values of the adjacent homes and the historic district; and failed to sufficiently examine the alternative site analysis provided by JCP &amp; L.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>We rejected these arguments, concluding that BPU undertook the analysis required by <em>In re Pub. Serv. Elec. &amp; Gas Co., </em>35 <em>N.J. </em>358, 173 A.2d 233 (1961), and that there was sufficient credible evidence to support the Board\u2019s findings and decision. <em>In re JCP &amp; L, supra, </em>at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">The substation has now been built on property that lies within JCP &amp; L\u2019s existing right-of-way, under the transmission lines carrying 230 kV of electricity from Chester to Glen Gardner that were in place. The property is also within a residential zone in Tewksbury\u2019s Lower Fairmount National Historic District, as well as in the Preservation Area established by the Highlands Water Protection and Planning Act (the Highlands Act), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:20-1 to -35; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:20-7(b). In this appeal, FFHD challenges the final agency decision of DEP to grant JCP &amp; L an exemption from the Highlands Act for the substation.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">In October 2007, JCP &amp; L applied to DEP\u2019s Division of Watershed Management for a Highlands Applicability Determination (HAD), <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:38-2.4, that the substation was exempt from the Highlands Act. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:20-28(a)(11) provides an exemption \u201cfrom the provisions of this act, the regional master plan, any rules or regulations adopted by the Department of Environmental Protection pursuant to this act, or any amendments ...\u201d for</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAb\">the routine maintenance and operations, rehabilitation, preservation, reconstruction, repaii-, or upgrade of public utility lines, rights of way, or systems, by a public utility, provided that the activity is consistent with the goals and purposes of this aet[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-6\"><em>See also N.J.A.C. </em>7:38-2.3(a)(11) (Exemption # 11). DEP issued the HAD in November 2008, determining that the substation fell within this exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">FFHD sought to challenge the exemption by requesting a third-party administrative hearing in the Office of Administrative Law. The DEP Commissioner denied FFHD\u2019s request, but stayed the exemption and remanded the matter to the Division of Watershed Management to \u201cdetermine whether the exemption [was] appropriate, and to issue a written articulation of appropriate findings concerning its final decision[.]\u201d DEP directed that the amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>decision would be effective upon issuance, with time limits for administrative hearings or appeals to run from the date of issuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Pursuant to this referral, the Division of Watershed Management issued an Amended HAD, dated July 15, 2009, in which it explicitly deferred to BPU for the determination as to the necessity of the substation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-7\">JCP &amp; L is a public utility regulated by [BPU]. JCP <em>&amp; </em>L maintains a Tariff for Service with BPU, which requires that JCP &amp; L maintain regular and uninterrupted electric service to its customers. The Department does not have the expertise to assess statements concerning the need to expand existing electrical systems, and defers to the BPU or other appropriate agency, to make a final determination in this regard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">Accordingly, DEP accepted JCP &amp; L\u2019s representations regarding necessity for the purposes of the application subject to its review and concluded that, \u201cto minimize the amount of construction, disturbance, and environmental impact on Highlands resources, the substation must be located as near as possible to the 230 kV line.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">The Amended HAD then addressed the suitability of the site:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-10\">The proposed site is located within Tewksbury Township\u2019s Lower Fairmont [sic] National Historic District. An existing 230 kilovolt (kV) transmission line (JCP &amp; L\u2019s existing Chester-to-Glen Gardner Transmission Line) already traverses the northern portion of the property. Immediately adjacent to the subject property are two existing transmission towers, each approximately 150 feet tall and one telecommunication structure. Residential properties abut the project location on three sides, but the homes themselves are more than 300 feet away from the proposed substation, in compliance with the 300-foot fire safety buffer for electrical substations set by the Department of Community Affairs and JCP &amp; L.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-11\">Noting that the range of possible locations for the substation was limited by service reliability issues, the Amended HAD went on to discuss its evaluation of the nine sites along the 230 kV high tension line that could support the proposed substation. Each of the sites had \u201cmultiple environmental and cultural features of concern.\u201d Six of the sites were within a historic area and the remaining three were either Green Acres parcels or Preserved Farmland, which eliminated them from consideration. DEP observed that \u201cnone of the lots would require less impact for access <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>and construction of the substation [than the proposed site], and many of the lots evaluated would require more disturbance.\u201d After the sites with more conflicts than the proposed site were eliminated, there were two possible alternative sites, neither of which were \u201cclearly preferred from a resource protection perspective over the selected site.\u201d DEP concluded that \u201cno alternative site exists that has fewer conflicts with Highlands resources than the selected site.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">DEP noted that JCP &amp; L made efforts to decrease the impact from the substation. It reduced the number of transformers, \u201celiminated all proposed disturbance to freshwater wetlands and minimized the disturbance of wetlands transition areas and Highlands open water buffers.\u201d DEP also observed that, in addition to reducing the disturbance caused by the substation, JCP &amp; L proposed to lessen the aesthetic impact of the substation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-5\">Lastly, JCP <em>&amp; </em>L proposes to include landscaping effective at screening the substation from adjacent properties and roads, thereby reducing the project\u2019s impact on scenic resources and the Fairmont [sic] Historic District.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">The Amended HAD concluded that \u201cthe projeet/activity is exempt from the permitting requirements of the Highlands Act pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:20 \u2014 28(a)(ll) and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:38-2.3[.]\u201d This conclusion was made subject to conditions that DEP deemed \u201cnecessary for the project to achieve consistency with the goals of the Highlands Act[,]\u201d including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-7\">1. Prior to construction, JCP &amp; L shall submit to the Highlands Council for review and approval an extensive landscape plan, using native plant species, to screen the substation from adjacent homes and roadways and complement the character of the existing historic distinct. <em>Failure to implement the approved landscape plan shall constitute a violation of this exemption and the Highlands Act.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-8\">2. This exemption is limited to the replacement or rehabilitation or upgrade of existing infrastructure and does not authorize any extension of new public infrastructure in the Highlands Preservation Area. These improvements shall serve existing development except for development that is exempt from the permitting requirements of the Act or the subject of court order. <em>Should the BPU determine in writing that the system upgrade described is not necessary, this exemption shall be null and void from the date of that determination.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-9\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Although both paragraphs describe \u201cconditions\u201d to the determination that the project fell within the exemption, DEP identified different requirements for JCP &amp; L to satisfy as to each and different consequences for a failure to meet those requirements. As for the landscape plan, JCP &amp; L was required to submit a landscape plan for review and approval. The exemption was not contingent upon approval of the landscape plan and, in the event JCP &amp; L failed to implement an \u201capproved landscape plan,\u201d the failure constituted a violation of the exemption and the Highlands Act, but did not nullify the exemption. In contrast, a failure to secure BPU approval rendered the exemption \u201cnull and void\u201d as of the date BPU issued a written determination that the system upgrade is not necessary. These conditions were set in July 2009 and, in September 2009, BPU rendered the final agency decision that was the subject of FFHD\u2019s prior unsuccessful appeal, concluding that the substation was necessary. Thus, the only applicable condition<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which, if unsatisfied, would nullify DEP\u2019s conclusion, was met within two months of the Amended HAD.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">FFHD appealed the Amended HAD, once again seeking an adjudicatory hearing. DEP rejected FFHD\u2019s request for an adjudicatory hearing, citing lack of standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">JCP <em>&amp; </em>L submitted a revised landscape plan to the Highlands Council in December 2009. Because the plan was subject to height restrictions, it could not completely screen the substation\u2019s nineteen-foot transformer unit and sixty-five-foot tower poles or the wires connecting to the 230 kV transmission lines.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">In June 2010, the Highlands Council submitted its review of the landscape plan to DEP. Although the scope of the review required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>by DEP appeared limited to consideration of the elements identified in the plan, i.e., a plan that used \u201cnative plant species, to screen the substation from adjacent homes and roadways and complement the character of the existing historic distriet[,]\u201d the review conducted by the Highlands Council was more extensive. The Council assessed the plan to determine whether it was \u201cconsistent with the goals and purposes of\u2019 the Highlands Act and the Regional Master Plan (RMP), and subjected it to the standards applicable to a Highlands Preservation Area Approval set forth in <em>N.J.AC. </em>7:38-3.10. The Council concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-5\">[T]he Landscape Plan submitted by JCP &amp; L will not adequately \u201cscreen the substation from adjacent homes and roadways and complement the character of the existing historic district\u201d as required by NJDEP\u2019s conditional HAD and is also not consistent with the goals and purposes of the Highlands Act. Accordingly, the Highlands Council does not approve the submitted Landscape Plan. It is the recommendation of Highlands Council that the submitted Landscape Plan be found to not satisfy the condition of the NJDEP exemption # 11 and that the proposal is not consistent with the goals and purposes of the Highlands Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">By letter dated February 4, 2011, DEP issued its \u201creview and final decision\u201d regarding the substation. DEP noted that the Highlands Council did not approve JCP &amp; L\u2019s landscape plan and then addressed the Highlands Council\u2019s \u201crecommend[ation] that the submitted Landscape Plan be found to not satisfy the condition of Exemption #11 and that the proposal is not consistent with the goals and purposes of the Highlands Act.\u201d The final decision letter clarified that the request for review of the landscape plan did not include a request that the Highlands Council analyze the applicability of the exemption:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-7\">While Condition 1 of the July 15, 2009 \u201cAmended Decision\u201d required JCP &amp; L to submit an \u201cextensive\u201d Landscape Plan to the Highlands Council for review and approval, it was not the Department\u2019s intent to delegate its authority to make a final determination on JCP &amp; L\u2019s compliance with the amended HAD or any HAD condition to the Highlands Council.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXK\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>DEP\u2019s final decision then reviewed the basis for its determination that the exemption applied. It had focused on the fact that, by providing exemption provisions, \u201cthe Legislature determined it was appropriate to enable certain activities and developments in the Highlands Area to proceed without the permitting review by the Department otherwise required\u201d under the Highlands Act. Quoting Exemption # 11, the letter stated, \u201cThe Department previously decided that the proposed JCP &amp; L substation, which the Board of Public Utilities determined to be necessary and on a site acceptable for utility purposes, qualifies under Exemption # 11 as an upgrade to a public utility system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">In the final decision letter, DEP also took issue with the standard the Highlands Council had applied in rejecting JCP &amp; L\u2019s landscape plan. It noted that Condition 1 of the Amended HAD had looked \u201cfor minimization and not elimination of adverse impacts.\u201d Rather than evaluate minimization, DEP observed that the Highlands Council imposed \u201cthe additional requirement that \u2018effective\u2019 screening and \u2018adequate\u2019 blocking of views must be accomplished.\u201d DEP noted that, as a practical matter and for safety reasons, the landscape plan could not screen the tower pole and connections to the existing transmission lines from view, and stated, \u201cThe Department is aware of no legal authority or government practice in New Jersey that requires a public utility to screen a 65 foot utility tower from view.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">The final decision letter summarized DEP\u2019s conclusion as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-7\">[T]he Department finds that the Landscape Plan meets the condition required in the July 15, 2009 \u201cAmended Decision\u201d to the previously issued November 6, 2008 HAD, which found the proposed project exempt under Exemption # 11 of the Highlands Water Protection and Planning Act. Further, the Department has determined that JCP &amp; L has satisfied condition # 1 of the aforementioned Amended Decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>In this appeal, FFHD argues that DEP\u2019s final decision was wrong as a matter of law because the substation was not a \u201croutine upgrade\u201d of a public utility system. In the alternative, FFHD argues that the decision was arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">JCP &amp; L argues that the appeal is moot, since the substation has already been built. \u201cAn issue is \u2018moot\u2019 when the decision sought in a matter, when rendered, can have no practical effect on the existing controversy.\u201d <em>Greenfield v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Corrs., </em>382 <em>N.J.Super. </em>254, 257-58, 888 A.2d 507 (App.Div.2006). However, an appeal will not be moot when \u201ca party still suffers from the adverse consequences ... caused by [the prior] proceeding[.]\u201d <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs, v. A.P., </em>408 <em>N.J.Super. </em>252, 262, 974 A.2d 466 (App.Div.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted), <em>certif. denied, </em>201 <em>N.J. </em>153, 988 A.2d 1176 (2010). Here, the \u201cadverse consequences\u201d persist as long as the substation exists and presumably could be reversed if the substation were demolished. We therefore decline to dismiss the appeal as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">DEP and JCP &amp; L also argue that FFHD\u2019s challenge to the Amended HAD is barred as untimely. They contend that the Amended HAD was a final agency decision and, therefore, FFHD had to appeal that decision \u2018\u2018within 45 days from the date of service of the decision or notice of the action taken.\u201d <em>R. </em>2:4-l(b). They submit that the appeal is only timely with regard to DEP\u2019s February 4,2011 decision. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">The Amended HAD contained certain characteristics of a final agency decision, i.e., adequate factual and legal conclusions, <em>see In re CAFRA Permit No. 87-0959-5, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>287, 299, 704 A.2d 1261 (1997); and provided notice of the right to seek an adjudicatory hearing, <em>see De Nike v. Bd. of Trs., </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>430, 435, 170 A.2d 12 (1961). However, \u201can agency action does not become final until all avenues of internal administrative review have been exhausted.\u201d <em>Bouie v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Cmty. Affairs, </em>407 <em>N.J.Super. </em>518, 527, 972 A.2d 401 (App.Div.2009). The Amended HAD <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>directed JCP &amp; L to seek the Council\u2019s approval of the landscape plan <em>\u201cprior to construction.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Thus, although DEP determined that the substation fit within Exemption # 11, the Amended HAD made clear that construction could not commence until the Council ruled on the project. It was not until DEP issued its final decision, reaffirming its determination regarding the application of the exemption and concluding that the conditions in the Amended HAD were satisfied, that the agency decision became final. We therefore turn to the merits of FFHD\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The scope of our review in an appeal from a final decision of an administrative agency is limited. <em>Circus Liquors, Inc. v. Governing Body of Middletown Twp., </em>199 <em>N.J. </em>1, 9, 970 A.2d 347 (2009). We must sustain the agency\u2019s action in the absence of a \u201c \u2018clear showing\u2019 that it is arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable, or that it lacks fair support in the recordf.]\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Furthermore, an appellate court may not substitute its judgment for the fact-finding of an administrative agency. <em>Campbell v. N.J. Racing Comm\u2019n, </em>169 <em>N.J. </em>579, 587, 781 A.2d 1035 (2001). \u2018\u201cIf the Appellate Division is satisfied after its review that the evidence and the inferences to be drawn therefrom support the agency head\u2019s decision, then it must affirm even if the court feels that it would have reached a different result itself.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Clowes v. Terminix Inti, Inc., </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>575, 588, 538 A.2d 794 (1988)). However, as to questions of law,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKP\">wo are in no way bound by an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute or its determination of a strictly legal issue, particularly when that interpretation is inaccurate or contrary to legislative objectives!!.] Like all matters of law, we apply <em>de novo </em>review to an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute or case law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-6\"><em>[Russo v. Bd. of Trs., Police &amp; Firemen\u2019s Ret Sys., </em>206 <em>N.J. </em>14, 27, 17 A.3d 801 (2011) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">Moreover, pertinent to our review here, any exemption from a comprehensive legislative \u201cpolicy designed to protect environmental interests\u201d must be \u201cstrictly construed.\u201d <em>M. Alfieri Co., Inc. v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Envtl.

FFHD contends that the $5 million construction project is not merely a \u201croutine upgrade\u201d within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:20-28(a)(ll) and that the project is not consistent with the goals and purposes of the Act. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">In support of its argument, FFHD notes that Exemption # 11 is one of only two of the statutory exemptions which require \u201cthat the activity is consistent with the goals and purposes of [the] act[.]\u201d As FFHD points out, those objectives include to \u201cpreserve farmland and historic sites and other historic resources[,]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>13:20-10(b)(4); and to \u201cprohibit or limit to the maximum extent possible construction or development which is incompatible with preservation of this unique area[,]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:20-10(b)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">At the outset, we note that the substation project did not entail new development or the taking of any farmland or historic sites. The activity associated with the project relevant to the goals highlighted by FFHD is the construction of the substation itself. And, even if the construction were deemed to be \u201cincompatible with preservation,\u201d the objective does not require outright prohibition. By its language, the objective is also served by \u201climit[ing the activity] to the maximum extent possible[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">Turning to the language of the Amended HAD, the conditions attached specify that the exemption was designed to \u201cserve existing development.\u201d The exemption explicitly \u201cdoes not authorize any extension of new public infrastructure in the Highlands Preservation Area\u201d and \u201cis limited to the replacement or rehabilitation or upgrade of existing infrastructure[.]\u201d The exemption was, therefore, carefully circumscribed to meet the failed electricity needs of residents in the Preservation Area while \u201climitfing] to the maximum extent possible\u201d the construction necessary for that objective. We therefore reject FFHD\u2019s argument that the exemption as applied to the substation project is not consistent with the goals and purposes of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>FFHD also argues that the substation project did not qualify as a \u201croutine ... upgrade of public utility lines, rights-of-way, or systems\u201d under the exemption. It contends that the magnitude of the project here, costing $5 million, and including a nineteen-foot transformer, a thirty-five-foot-tall bus system, electrical control cabinets, switching devices and towers approximately sixty-five feet tall, is inconsistent with a routine upgrade. In response, DEP contends that FFHD distorts the meaning of the exemption language; that the Legislature intended the word \u201croutine\u201d to modify \u201cmaintenance and operations\u201d and not the other exempted activities, i.e., \u201crehabilitation, preservation, reconstruction, repair, or upgrade of public utility lines, rights of way, or systems, by a public utility!.]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:20 \u2014 28(a)(ll). Neither \u201croutine\u201d nor \u201cupgrade\u201d are defined in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The Amended HAD observed that JCP &amp; L\u2019s Tariff for Service with BPU requires that it \u201cmaintain regular and uninterrupted electric service to its customers.\u201d As we observed in FFHD\u2019s prior appeal, BPU determined that the proposed substation \u201cis necessary to provide safe, adequate and reliable electrical service in the Tewksbury area\u201d and \u201cis necessary for the service, convenience and welfare of the public!]\u201d <em>In re JCP &amp; L, supra, </em>at 7. Given JCP &amp; L\u2019s obligation and BPU\u2019s findings, it appears clear that, even if the exemption is interpreted as requiring that an upgrade be \u201croutine,\u201d a project that is limited to what is necessary to satisfy JCP &amp; L\u2019s duty to provide \u201cregular and uninterrupted electric service to its customers\u201d falls within the exemption intended by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">FFHD also argues that DEP\u2019s decision was arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable, in part because it failed to give appropriate deference to the Highland Council\u2019s recommendation. Again, we do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">Pursuant to its enabling statute, DEP is charged with the responsibility to \u201cformulate comprehensive policies for the conservation of the natural resources of the State, the promotion of environmental protection and the prevention of pollution of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>environment of the State.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>13:1D-9; <em>In re Adoption of N.J.A.C. 7:15-5.24(b), </em>420 <em>N.J.Super. </em>552, 574, 22 A.3d 94 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>208 <em>N.J. </em>597, 34 A.3d 779 (2011). Regulations applicable to the statutory exemptions were, in fact, adopted by DEP. <em>N.J.AC. </em>7:38-2.3. As we have discussed, DEP did not intend to delegate that function to the Highlands Council here and noted that the Council exceeded its mandate in issuing a \u201crecommendation\u201d that the exemption did not apply. DEP was not required to defer to that recommendation in the face of countervailing evidence that established the applicability of the exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b259-9\">A third condition nullified the determination \"if changes are made to the project that would increase the scope or area disturbed by the project or result in a change in the use or change the method of wastewater treatment; or if the information submitted to obtain this determination from the Department is later determined to be inaccurate.\u201d There has been no allegation that there was such a change to the project or that inaccurate information was submitted to the Department.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b260-8\"> As noted, the Highlands Council\u2019s analysis included a review of the landscape plan to determine whether it was consistent with the goals and purposes of the Highlands Act and the RMP. The Amended HAD rejected such an analysis, stating, \"compliance with the resource policies, goals, objectives, programs and requirements of the RMP, is not inherent or required in order to be determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>exempt from the Highlands Act.\u201d This conclusion is supported by the statutory language. Although <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:20-28(a)(ll) requires the activity to be \u201cconsistent with the goals and purposes of this act[,]\u201d it does not require the activity to be consistent with the RMP to qualify as an exemption.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
