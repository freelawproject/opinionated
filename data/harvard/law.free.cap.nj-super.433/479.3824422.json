Because we conclude that application of the exclusionary rule is not required in the unusual circumstances of this case, we reverse on the State\u2019s appeal. We affirm on defendant\u2019s appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">The suppression issue is novel and arises from the following scenario. On December 16, 2010, defendant was involved in a one-car accident in which his vehicle struck a utility pole and his two passengers were injured. After defendant failed the roadside sobriety tests, the West Deptford police arrested him at about 2:30 a.m., on suspicion of driving while intoxicated (DWI). They transported defendant to police headquarters, where they read him his Miranda<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> rights and he invoked his right to counsel. The police later transported defendant to a local hospital. At 4:16 a.m., hospital personnel drew a blood sample at the request of the police.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The requesting police officer, defendant, and a hospital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>nurse each signed a Certif\u00edcate of Request to Withdraw a Specimen, although defendant signed the form two minutes after the blood was drawn. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>2A:62A-11.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">At the time of the accident in 2010, New Jersey law permitted the police to obtain a blood sample without first obtaining a warrant, so long as they had probable cause to believe that the driver was intoxicated.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That principle, derived from <em>Schmerber v. California, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>757, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908 (1966), was based on the presumed exigency created by the dissipation of alcohol levels in the bloodstream, and was clearly stated in opinions of our Supreme Court. For example, in <em>State v. Dyal, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>229, 478 A.2d 390 (1984), the Court observed: \u201cA drunken driver arrested by police with probable cause to believe he is intoxicated has no federal constitutional right to prevent the involuntary taking of a blood sample. Of course, the sample should be taken in a medically acceptable manner at a hospital or other suitable health care facility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 238, 478 A.2d 390 (citing <em>Schmerber, supra, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>at 771-72, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1836, 16 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 920). The issue in <em>Dyal </em>was whether the police could obtain the results of hospital blood tests drawn for purposes of medical treatment; however, part of the Court\u2019s reasoning was that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>police had the right to obtain a blood sample from the driver. <em>Dyal, supra, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>at 231, 238-39, 478 A.2d 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Several subsequent Appellate Division decisions likewise read <em>Schmerber </em>as holding that a warrant was not required. <em>See, e.g., State v. Burns, </em>159 <em>N.J.Super. </em>539, 544, 388 A.2d 987 (App.Div.1978) (\u201c[C]onsent is not required to the taking of a blood sample, but the taking of such sample must be done in a medically acceptable manner and environment and without force or violence or the threat of same.\u201d); <em>State v. Woomer, </em>196 <em>N.J.Super. </em>583, 586, 483 A.2d 837 (App.Div.1984) (\u201c[A] blood sample may be taken involuntarily [from a suspected drunk driver] and no consent is required.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">In <em>State v. Ravotto, </em>169 <em>N.J. </em>227, 231-33, 777 A.2d 301 (2001), the Court held that the police used excessive force in obtaining a blood sample from a drunk driving suspect who was terrified of needles. However, the Court reaffirmed that the police did not need a warrant to obtain the blood test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-8\">Our holding is not to be understood as suggesting that the police had to acquire a warrant before obtaining a blood sample from defendant or that they acted in an unreasonable manner in seeking treatment for him at the hospital. Because defendant\u2019s ear was found overturned and his behavior demonstrated obvious signs of intoxication, probable cause existed for the police to seek evidence of defendant\u2019s blood alcohol content level. Moreover, consistent with <em>Schw,erber </em>and our analogous case law, the dissipating nature of the alcohol content in defendant\u2019s blood presented an exigency that required prompt action by the police. Under those conditions, a warrantless search was justified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 250, 777 A.2d 301 (citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">These rulings were also reflected in Guidelines issued by the Attorney General to county and municipal prosecutors.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In pertinent part, the Guidelines advised that \u201c[a] defendant has no right to refuse to allow blood to be drawn as long as the police or law enforcement officer has probable cause to believe that the blood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>sample will contain evidence of alcohol and/or drugs.\u201d <em>Attorney General Guidelinefs]: Prosecution of DWI &amp; Refusal Violations, </em>at 9 (Jan. 24, 2005); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2a (requiring the Attorney General to promulgate guidelines).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Consequently, when the police obtained the warrantless blood sample from Adkins, they acted pursuant to well-established legal precedent in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">However, years later, the United States Supreme Court clarified <em>Schmerber </em>\u2014 and dramatically changed the legal landscape in New Jersey and many other states-by holding that there was no per se rule of exigency in drunk driving cases, and that the need to obtain a search warrant before taking a blood sample was to be determined on a ease by case basis. <em>Missouri v. McNeely, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 133 <em>S.Ct. </em>1552, 1563, 185 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>696, 709 (2013); <em>see id. </em>at n. 2, 133 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1558 n. 2, 185 L.Ed.2d at 704 n. 2. Further, under well-settled federal precedent, the Supreme Court\u2019s construction of the Fourth Amendment must be given pipeline retroactivity. <em>Griffith v. Kentucky, </em>479 <em>U.S. </em>314, 328, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>708, 716, 93 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>649, 661 (1987) (\u201cWe therefore hold that a new rule for the conduct of criminal prosecutions is to be applied retroactively to all cases, state or federal, pending on direct review or not yet final, with no exception for cases in which the new rule constitutes a \u2018clear break\u2019 with the past.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">However, when applied in the federal courts, <em>McNeely </em>would not result in suppression of the blood evidence obtained here, because the United States Supreme Court will not apply the exclusionary rule as a remedy where the police conducted a search in good faith reliance on binding legal precedent in the jurisdiction where the search occurred. <em>See Davis v. United States, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>-, -, 131 <em>S.Ct. </em>2419, 2434, 180 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>285, 302 (2011).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>In <em>Davis, </em>the Court clarified that the retroactivity rule announced in <em>Griffith </em>did not necessarily require application of the exclusionary rule as a remedy where the Court announced a new search and seizure rule. <em>Davis, supra, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 131 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2431, 180 L.Ed.2d at 298-99. \u201c[T]he retroactive application of a new rule of substantive Fourth Amendment law <em>raises </em>the question whether a suppression remedy applies; it does not answer that question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 131 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2431, 180 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\"><em>Davis </em>addressed searches conducted prior to <em>Arizona v. Gant, </em>556 <em>U.S. </em>332, 129 <em>S.Ct. </em>1710, 173 L.Ed.2d 485 (2009), a case holding that police could not automatically search the passenger compartment of a vehicle whenever an occupant was arrested. <em>Davis, supra, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at \u2014 \u2014&gt; 131 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2424-25, 180 L.Ed.2d at 291-92. Recognizing that its prior holding in <em>New York v. Belton, </em>453 <em>U.S. </em>454, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>2860, 69 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>768 (1981), had been widely understood as permitting such searches, the Court concluded that the exclusionary rule was not an appropriate remedy for <em>pre-Gant </em>searches. <em>Davis, supra, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 131 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2428-29, 180 L.Ed.2d at 295-97. The Court reasoned that, where the police acted in reliance on established legal precedent, suppressing evidence would not serve the purpose of the exclusionary rule to deter lawless police conduct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-10\">The question in this case is whether to apply the exclusionary rule when the police conduct a search in objectively reasonable reliance on binding judicial precedent. ... The search incident to Davis\u2019s arrest in this case followed the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s <em>[United States </em>v.] <em>Gonzalez </em>[71 F.3d 819 (11th Cir.1996) ], precedent to the letter. Although the search turned out to be unconstitutional under <em>Gant, </em>all agree that the officers\u2019 conduct was in strict compliance with then-binding Circuit law and was not culpable in any way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-11\">Under our exclusionary-rule precedents, this acknowledged absence of police culpability dooms Davis\u2019s claim. Police practices trigger the harsh sanction of exclusion only when they are deliberate enough to yield \u201cmeaningful]\u201d deterrence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>and culpable enough to be \u201cworth the price paid by the justice system.\u201d The conduct of the officers here was neither of these things. The officers who conducted the search did not violate Davis\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights deliberately, recklessly, or with gross negligence. Nor does this ease involve any \u201crecurring or systemic negligence\u201d on the part of law enforcement. The police acted in strict compliance with binding precedent, and their behavior was not wrongful. Unless the exclusionary rule is to become a strict-liability regime, it can have no application in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-5\">About all that exclusion would deter in this case is conscientious police work. Responsible law-enforcement officers will take care to learn \u201cwhat is required of them\u201d under Fourth Amendment precedent and will conform their conduct to these rules. But by the same token, when binding appellate precedent specifically <em>authorizes </em>a particular police practice, well-trained officers will and should use that tool to fulfill their crime-detection and public-safety responsibilities. An officer who conducts a search in reliance on binding appellate precedent does no more than \u201c\u2018ae[t] as a reasonable officer would and should act\u2019\u201d under the circumstances. The deterrent effect of exclusion in such a case can only be to discourage the officer from \u201c \u2018doling] his duty.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-6\">That is not the kind of deterrence the exclusionary rule seeks to foster____ Evidence obtained during a search conducted in reasonable reliance on binding precedent is not subject to the exclusionary rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-8\"><em>[Ibid, </em>(citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">In New Jersey, new State constitutional search and seizure rules ordinarily are applied prospectively. \u201cIn cases where the new rule is an exclusionary rule, meant solely to deter illegal police conduct, the new rule is virtually never given retroactive effect. The reason is that the deterrent purposes of such a rule would not be advanced by applying it to past misconduct.\u201d <em>State v. Burstein, </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>394, 406, 427 A.2d 525 (1981); <em>see also State v. Earls, </em>214 <em>N.J. </em>564, 590, 70 A.3d 630 (2013); <em>State v. Purnell, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>44, 54, 735 A.2d 513 (1999); <em>State v. Knight, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>233, 251, 678 A.2d 642 (1996); <em>State v. Young, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>132, 140-41, 432 A.2d 874 (1981); <em>State v. McCann, </em>391 <em>N.J.Super. </em>542, 555, 919 A.2d 136 (App.Div.2007); <em>State v. Skidmore, </em>253 <em>N.J.Super. </em>227, 236, 601 A.2d 729 (App.Div.1992). Had <em>McNeely </em>been decided by the New Jersey Supreme Court in construing our State Constitution, it would not have been applied retroactively\u2014 thus reaching the same result as in the federal system but by a different route.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>The Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>State v. Earls </em>does not compel a different result here. In <em>Earls, </em>the Court gave the defendant the benefit of its ruling that, under the New Jersey Constitution, \u201cpolice must obtain a warrant based on a showing of probable cause, or qualify for an exception to the warrant requirement, to obtain tracking information through the use of a cell phone.\u201d <em>Earls, supra, </em>214 <em>N.J. </em>at 588, 70 A.3d 630. The Court recognized that the holding was novel and law enforcement officers could not have anticipated it. <em>Id. </em>at 589, 70 A.3d 630. The Court also acknowledged that \u201cdeterrence is rarely a basis to apply a new rale retroactively,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 590, 70 A.3d 630 (citing <em>Knight, supra), </em>and that retroactive application would substantially disrupt the administration of justice. <em>Id. </em>at 591, 70 A.3d 630. In that context, the Court applied the rale \u201cto defendant Earls and future cases only.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Ibid.; see also State v. Henderson, </em>208 <em>N.J. </em>208, 302, 27 A.3d 872 (2011). Unlike <em>Earls, </em>in this case defendant\u2019s appeal did not result in a new interpretation of our State Constitution, which might justify giving him the benefit of the new rule; rather, he simply invoked newly-decided federal case law which, in the federal court system, would not benefit him. <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>In our view, the real issue here is whether, given the federal retroactivity requirement, we should, as the State argues, apply an approach analogous to that set forth in <em>Davis, </em>or whether, as defendant argues, the result here is dictated by <em>State v. Novembrino, </em>105 <em>N.J. 95, </em>157-59, 519 A.2d 820 (1987), which rejected a \u201cgood faith\u201d exception to the application of the exclusionary rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">In <em>Novembrino, </em>our Court, in construing the State Constitution, declined to follow the rule announced in <em>United States v. Leon, </em>468 <em>U.S. </em>897, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984). <em>Leon </em>held that the exclusionary rule would not apply where the police acted in objectively reasonable reliance on a facially valid search warrant, which was issued by a judge but was \u201cultimately found to be unsupported by probable cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 900, 922, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3409, 3420, 82 L.Ed.2d at 684, 698.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In adopting what it characterized as a \u201cgood-faith exception for searches conducted pursuant to warrants,\u201d the <em>Leon </em>Court reasoned that \u201cthe marginal or nonexistent benefits produced by suppressing evidence obtained in objectively reasonable reliance on a subsequently invalidated search warrant cannot justify the substantial costs of exclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 924, 922, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3420-21, 82 L.Ed.2d at 698-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">In declining to adopt the good faith rule, under the auspices of the New Jersey Constitution,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> our Court characterized <em>Leon </em>as solely concerned with deterring unlawful police conduct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-7\">The major premise of the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Leon </em>is that the exclusionary rule is not required by the fourth amendment but rather operates as \u201c \u2018a judicially created remedy designed to safeguard Fourth Amendment rights generally through its deterrent effect, rather than a personal constitutional right of the person aggrieved.\u2019 \u201d The opinion observes that in view of the rule\u2019s function as a deterrent of police misconduct, its application in particular cases \u201cmust be resolved by weighing the costs and benefits of preventing the use in the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>inherently trustworthy tangible evidence obtained in reliance on a search warrant issued by a detached and neutral magistrate that ultimately is found to be defective.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-6\">The majority, after citing examples of the Court\u2019s prior application of the cost-benefit analysis to the exclusionary rule, concluded that there is little likelihood that the exclusion of evidence obtained pursuant to a subsequently invalidated search warrant will have a deterrent effect on law-enforcement officers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-7\"><em>[Novembrino, supra, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>at 140-41, 519 A.2d 820 (citations omitted).J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">Our Court disagreed with <em>Leon, </em>emphasizing the critical constitutional significance of the probable cause standard. <em>Id. </em>at 107-08, 519 A.2d 820. Indeed, much of the opinion is devoted to a discussion of the probable cause standard and its central importance to the warrant requirement. <em>Id. </em>at 105-22, 519 A.2d 820. The Court also observed that the defects in the <em>Novembrino </em>warrant probably resulted from the hurried actions of an inexperienced police officer. <em>Id. </em>at 129, 519 A.2d 820. The Court concluded that suppressing evidence seized pursuant to invalid warrants would safeguard the integrity of the process by which warrants are sought and issued. \u201cOur view that the good-faith exception will ultimately reduce respect for and compliance with the probable-cause standard that we have steadfastly enforced persuades us that there is a strong state interest that would be disserved by adopting the <em>Leon </em>rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 154, 519 A.2d 820.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">Our Court also took a broader view of the purpose of the exclusionary rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-10\">Our concern ... is with the Constitution and with the basic and fundamental guarantees that that document was intended to afford to all our citizens, particularly in times of public ferment. In our view, the citizen\u2019s right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures conducted without probable cause is just such a fundamental principle, to be preserved and protected with vigilance. In our tripartite system of separate governmental powers, the primary responsibility for its preservation is that of the judiciary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-11\">The exclusionary rule, by virtue of its consistent application over the past twenty-five years, has become an integral element of our state-constitutional guarantee that search warrants will not issue without probable cause. Its function is not merely to deter police misconduct. The rule also serves as the indispensable mechanism for vindicating the constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches. Because we believe that the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule adopted in <em>Leon </em>would tend to undermine the constitutionally-guaranteed standard of probable cause, and in the process disrupt the highly effective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>procedures employed by our criminal justice system to accommodate that constitutional guarantee without impairing law enforcement, we decline to recognize a good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-5\"><em>[Id. </em>at 156-58, 519 A.2d 820 (footnote omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">As an intermediate appellate court we are, of course, bound by <em>Novembrino. </em>However, we do not believe that <em>Novembrino </em>applies to the very different circumstances of this ease, which has nothing to do with invalid warrants or unlawful police activity. In reaching that conclusion, we note that in very limited circumstances, the Court has signaled that application of the exclusionary rule may not always be appropriate where applying the rule would not serve its well-understood purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">In <em>State v. Harris, </em>211 <em>N.J. </em>566, 50 A.3d 15 (2012), the Court declined to order the suppression of an illegal handgun seized during a search authorized by a warrant properly issued pursuant to the Prevention of Domestic Violence Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-17 to - 35. Unlike a warrant issued for a criminal investigation, a domestic violence warrant need not be issued on probable cause. However, the Court reasoned that the gun was discovered and seized during a \u201cspecial needs search,\u201d conducted to protect a victim of domestic violence and not for the purpose of uncovering evidence of crime. <em>Id. </em>at 584, 50 A.3d 15. Ordinarily, the fruits of such a search may be admissible in a subsequent criminal prosecution, so long as the search was conducted pursuant to a valid domestic violence warrant and was not a mere pretext to uncover criminal evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 585-86, 50 A.3d 15 (citing <em>State v. Dispoto, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>108, 123, 913 A.2d 791 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">In declining to apply the exclusionary rule, however, the Court further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-9\">It is also appropriate to consider the purpose that undergirds the exclusionary rule. Almost inevitably, whether as the result of mistake, inadvertence, ignorance, or overzealousness, police can come into possession of evidence bearing on criminal activity without having complied perfectly with the constitutional requirement of probable cause. In response to this reality, courts have crafted the exclusionary rule, under which evidence seized illegally is suppressed. <em>United States v. Calan</em>dra, 414 <em>U.S. </em>338, 347-48, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>613, 619-20, 38 L.Ed.2d 561, 571 (1974); <em>Handy, supra, </em>206 <em>N.J. </em>at 45-46 [18 A.3d 179]. The purpose of the rale is two-fold: 1) to assure that the law does not provide an incentive for police misconduct and 2) to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>protect judicial integrity. <em>Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 <em>U.S. </em>643, 655-59, 81 <em>S.Ct. 1684, </em>1692-94, 6 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d 1081, 1090-92 (1961); <em>Elkins v. United States, </em>364 <em>U.S. </em>206, 216-17, 80 <em>S.Ct. </em>1437, 1444, 4 L.Ed.2d 1669, 1677 (1960). <em>Here, there was no misconduct of any sort, no mistake in executing the warrant, and no disregard of its requirements. Consequently, to apply the exclusionary rule in this context would not further any of its purposes. </em>We reach this conclusion in this limited, particular context, and we should not be understood at this juncture as retreating from our earlier rejection of the good faith exception. <em>State v. Novembrino, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>95, 157-58 [519 A.2d 820] (1987).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-6\"><em>[Harris, supra, </em>211 <em>N.J. </em>at 590, 50 A.3d 15 (emphasis added) (citing <em>State v. Handy, </em>206 <em>N.J. </em>39, 45-46,18 A.3d 179 (2011)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">The above-quoted language is readily applicable to this case. Like <em>Harris, </em>and unlike <em>Novembrino, </em>here there was no mistake by the police, good faith or otherwise. At the time of the search, their conduct was lawful under well-established case law in this State. <em>See also State v. Domicz, </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>285, 295-96, 907 A.2d 395 (2006) (declining to characterize a thermal scan as \u201cunlawful conduct\u201d by the police, when at the time of the scan, most courts that had considered the issue had held that a thermal scan was not a \u201csearch\u201d). The police were not acting pursuant to an invalidly-issued warrant which they mistakenly thought was valid. Nor was there any unreasonable or improper conduct by another State law enforcement employee involved in the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">This case is not like <em>State v. Handy, </em>where a police dispatcher negligently and inaccurately informed an officer that there was an outstanding warrant for the defendant. <em>Handy, supra, </em>206 <em>N.J. </em>at 41-42, 18 A.3d 179. Handy was arrested, and a search incident to the arrest yielded contraband. <em>Id. </em>at 42, 18 A.3d 179. The Court distinguished prior federal cases involving \u201can attenuated clerical error in a database upon which police officials reasonably relied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52, 18 A.3d 179. Instead, the Court found that the dispatcher was \u201can active participant\u201d in the chain of events leading to the defendant\u2019s arrest. <em>Id. </em>at 47-48, 18 A.3d 179. The Court concluded that suppression \u201cwould have important deterrent value, would underscore the need for training of officers and dispatchers to focus on detail, and would serve to assure that our own constitutional guarantees are given full effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52, 18 A.3d 179. <em>Cf. State v. Pitcher, </em>379 <em>N.J.Super. </em>308, 311, 878 A.2d 8 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>(App.Div.2005) (declining to suppress evidence where the police officer stopped defendant\u2019s ear based on a computer check of Motor Vehicle records, which inaccurately indicated that the car\u2019s owner had a suspended license).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\"><em>Handy </em>is not on point because, at the time the police obtained the blood sample in this case, they were conducting themselves in a manner sanctioned by decades of precedent from our Supreme Court. No amount of additional police training would have deterred the search in this case, because the police were following the law as it existed at the time. As in <em>Harris, </em>suppressing the evidence would not serve the purpose of the exclusionary rule to prevent illegal police conduct. Nor would admitting the evidence involve the judiciary in what <em>Handy </em>described as \u201c \u2018the taint of partnership in official lawlessness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Handy, supra, </em>206 <em>N.J. </em>at 45, 18 A.3d 179 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">While it could be argued that suppression would, in some abstract sense, vindicate defendant\u2019s state and federal constitutional right against illegal searches, it would do so at a cost our Court has not always found justifiable. Retroactivity analysis implicitly recognizes that, where retrospective application of a new rule of law will inflict major disruption on the criminal justice system, some defendants will not get the benefit of the new rule even if it implicates constitutional rights. Thus, in declining to give retroactive application to new search and seizure rulings\u2014 and to various other criminal law rulings, <em>see, e.g., Henderson, supra, </em>208 <em>N.J. </em>at 302, 27 A.3d 872 \u2014 the Court necessarily deprives some defendants of an avenue to vindicate newly-recognized rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">In the very narrow circumstances presented here, we conclude that <em>Harris </em>and by analogy, <em>Davis, </em>signal the correct path to our decision. We recognize that there are doctrinal differences between the reasoning in <em>Davis </em>and in <em>Harris. </em>For example, <em>Davis </em>rested in part on the good faith exception articulated in <em>Leon, </em>which our Court rejected in <em>Novembrino. </em>But at the heart of both opinions is the same core of common sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>\u201cIn this case, the State does not seek to admit the fruits of unlawful police conduct since the police fully complied with the law in effect at the time they acted.\u201d <em>Skidmore, supra, </em>253 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 237, 601 A.2d 729.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Consequently, application of the exclusionary rule here would not serve the rule\u2019s principal purposes articulated by our Court. It would not deter unlawful police conduct, and it would not meaningfully safeguard the integrity of our judicial process. It is one thing for our courts to eschew involvement in admitting evidence seized unlawfully. It is another thing entirely to exclude evidence seized in conformity with the law as it existed at the time of the seizure. Consequently, we reverse the trial court\u2019s order suppressing the blood evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">In reaching this conclusion, we emphasize the unusual circumstances of this case, where (a) the United States Supreme Court issued a new search and seizure rule that was more restrictive than existing precedent from our Supreme Court; (b) at the time the search was conducted, it was authorized by settled precedent from our Supreme Court; and (c) had the new rule been issued by our Supreme Court as an interpretation of the New Jersey Constitution, it would not have been applied retroactively.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-7\">[At the direction of the court pursuant to R. l:36-2(a), the discussion addressing the defendant\u2019s appeal in Part II has been omitted from the published version of the opinion.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b509-11\"> These back-to-back appeals have been consolidated for purposes ol\u2019 this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b509-12\"> <em>Miranda </em>v.

Hence, it is not clear whether an approximately two-hour hiatus, between the time of defendant's arrest and the time the blood was drawn, was attributable to delay in taking him to the hospital or delay experienced at the hospital.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b510-6\"> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:62A-11 is part of a statute that grants civil and criminal immunity to medical personnel who draw blood samples at the request of a law enforcement officer. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:62A-10(a), -10(b). The statute further provides, in pertinent part: \u201cAny person taking a specimen pursuant to [this statute] shall, upon request, furnish to any law enforcement agency a certificate stating that the specimen was taken pursuant to ... this act and in a medically acceptable manner.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:62A-11. After reviewing the certificate in this case, we conclude that it was not intended to establish a suspect\u2019s consent to a warrantless search, but rather was intended to satisfy the immunity statute and establish the chain of custody of the blood sample. The State has waived any claim of Fourth-Amendment consent, and for purposes of this opinion it is irrelevant that defendant signed the form after the blood was drawn.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b510-7\"> Before the trial court, as on this appeal, defendant did not contest that the police had probable cause to seek a blood test. Because he was the driver in a one-car accident and failed the roadside sobriety tests, probable cause would appear self-evident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b511-11\"> In this context, we recall our Court's recent admonition in <em>State v.

Under federal Fifth Amendment principles, \u201cthe coercive taint of the initial interrogation had not dissipated\u201d when defendant made his later incriminating statements to the police, and, therefore, those statements were deemed \u201cnot voluntary.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>No such considerations apply to the blood evidence here, which cannot be regarded as tainted or unreliable by virtue of the warrantless manner in which the police obtained it.
