INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Health and Safety Code section 1418.8 ( section 1418.8 ) sets forth procedures to be followed for nursing home residents who lack capacity to make their own health care decisions. Most of the affected residents are elderly, many are poor, and all may be described as \"unbefriended\" in the sense they are without family members, friends or other legal surrogates to make health care decisions for them. The statute requires an interdisciplinary team (IDT) approach to decisionmaking for these residents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform (CANHR), a nonprofit entity advocating for the rights of nursing home patients, together with a nursing home resident and a taxpayer (collectively, petitioners), challenged the constitutionality of section 1418.8 under the California Constitution by a petition for writ of mandate against the Director of the Department of Public Health (Department), a position now held by Dr. Karen Smith (Director).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The superior court issued an order holding section 1418.8 unconstitutional in three respects, one on its face and two as applied: It held the statute (1) on\n   its face, violates due process under the California Constitution by failing to require notice to residents of a physician's predicate determinations that the patient lacks capacity, has no surrogate decisionmaker, needs a recommended medical intervention, and has a right to judicial review; (2) was never intended to authorize IDT decisionmaking for administration of antipsychotic medication, and it violates due process, as applied, when used to authorize such drugs; and (3) violates the patient's privacy rights and is unconstitutional as applied to decisions regarding end of life withdrawal of care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The court entered judgment accordingly, issuing a writ of mandate that prohibited enforcement of the statute in the absence of notice to the affected resident; prohibited use of the statute to administer antipsychotics; and prohibited use of the statute in end of life decisions, subject to several exceptions, including an exception for transfer to hospice care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Both parties appealed. The Director claims the statute is constitutional in all respects, and petitioners argue it is unconstitutional in additional particulars beyond those enjoined. Petitioners take the position, ultimately, that the statute should be declared unconstitutional in its entirety and that we should forbid its enforcement categorically, leaving the Legislature to begin again trying to solve the problem of how to provide for the medical needs of incapacitated, unbefriended nursing home residents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We see merit to much of the superior court's analysis concluding that\n   section 1418.8 is constitutionally deficient, but agree with enough of the Director's position to convince us that the proper course is to construe the statute to uphold its constitutionality rather than enjoin its enforcement and use. We shall therefore reverse and remand with directions to enter a modified judgment requiring nursing homes utilizing section 1418.8 to adopt and adhere to additional procedures we have concluded are necessary to preserve its constitutionality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    A. History and Purpose of Section 1418.8\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   When it was enacted in 1992, section 1418.8 was intended to give skilled nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   a means of decisionmaking\n   for incapacitated residents without someone \"with legal authority to make\" health care decisions on his or her \"behalf\" ( \u00a7 1418.8, subd. (a) ), including \"day-to-day medical treatment decisions ... on an on-going basis,\" which were difficult to secure using the pre-existing legal methods. (Stats. 1992, ch. 1303, \u00a7 1(b), p. 6327.) A decision by Division Five of this district, which we will discuss in detail below, also observed that section 1418.8 \"applies only to the relatively nonintrusive and routine, ongoing medical intervention[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Rains v. Belsh\u00e9\n   </em>\n   (1995)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2406165\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/32/157/#p186\">\n    32 Cal.App.4th 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 186,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20185\">\n    38 Cal.Rptr.2d 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Rains\n   </em>\n   ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Before the statute's enactment, capacity decisions were made in superior court on a petition to determine capacity to make health care decisions. ( Prob. Code, \u00a7 3200 et seq. ) \"A petition may be filed to determine that a patient lacks the capacity to make a health care decision concerning specified treatment for an existing or continuing condition, and further for an order authorizing a designated person to make a health care decision on behalf of the patient.\" ( Prob. Code, \u00a7 3201, subd. (b).) A petition may also seek a finding by the court that the patient has such capacity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , subds. (a), (c).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In enacting section 1418.8, the Legislature sought to provide a decisionmaking alternative when recommended medical procedures require informed consent. (See\n   <em>\n    Cobbs v. Grant\n   </em>\n   (1972)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2321912\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-3d/8/229/#p244\">\n    8 Cal.3d 229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 244-245,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=104%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20505\">\n    104 Cal.Rptr. 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=502%20P.2d%201\">\n    502 P.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [informed consent required when there is a known risk of death or serious bodily harm as a result of a recommended treatment].) As described in\n   <em>\n    Rains\n   </em>\n   , section 1418.8 addresses a \"very difficult and perplexing problem: how to provide nonemergency but necessary and appropriate medical treatment, frequently of an ongoing nature, to nursing home patients who lack capacity to consent thereto because of incompetence, and who have no surrogate or substitute decision maker with legal authority to consent for them.\" (\n   <em>\n    Rains\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 32 Cal.App.4th at p. 166,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20185\">\n    38 Cal.Rptr.2d 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , fn. omitted; see\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 178,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20185\">\n    38 Cal.Rptr.2d 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [\"continuing and significant dilemma\"].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   To address this \"legal conundrum of long standing\" (\n   <em>\n    Rains\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 32 Cal.App.4th at p. 166,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20185\">\n    38 Cal.Rptr.2d 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), section 1418.8-utilizing what is described as a \"team approach to assessment and care planning\"-authorizes an IDT composed of health professionals and other skilled staff from the nursing home, along with a \"patient representative,\" \"where practicable,\" to review and authorize medical treatment. ( \u00a7 1418.8, subd. (e) ; see\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20185\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , subds. (e) [\"[t]he interdisciplinary team shall oversee the care of the resident\"], (e)(3) [\"[t]o determine the desires of the resident, the interdisciplinary team shall interview the\n   patient, review the patient's medical records, and consult with family members or friends\"], (g) [required reviews by \"interdisciplinary team\" of prescribed medical intervention], (h) [review by \"interdisciplinary team\" within a week of any emergency intervention resulting in \"physical or chemical restraints\"].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In establishing a \"team\" decisionmaking approach, the Legislature recognized that the existing mechanisms for court authorization of medical treatments for such patients under provisions of the Probate Code were slow and inadequate, and therefore could interfere with residents' ability to receive timely medical care: \"(b) The current system is not adequate to deal with the legal, ethical, and practical issues that are involved in making health care decisions for incapacitated skilled nursing facility or intermediate care facility residents who lack surrogate decisionmakers. Existing Probate Code procedures, including public conservatorship, are inconsistently interpreted and applied, cumbersome, and sometimes unavailable for use in situations in which day-to-day medical treatment decisions must be made on an on-going basis. [\u00b6] (c) Therefore, it is the intent of the Legislature to identify a procedure to secure, to the greatest extent possible, health care decisionmakers for skilled nursing facility or intermediate care facility residents who lack the capacity to make these decisions and who also lack a surrogate health care decisionmaker.\" (Stats. 1992, ch. 1303, \u00a7 1, pp. 6326-6327.) Indeed,\n   <em>\n    Rains\n   </em>\n   spoke of a \"delay of two to six months frequently necessary to secure a ruling on a petition authorizing treatment under Probate Code section 3201.\" (\n   <em>\n    Rains\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 32 Cal.App.4th at p. 166,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20185\">\n    38 Cal.Rptr.2d 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Summary of the Provisions of Section 1418.8\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Under section 1418.8, if a resident's \"attending physician and surgeon\" determines that a resident lacks capacity to provide informed consent to a proposed treatment, and determines there is no person with legal authority to make the treatment decision on the resident's behalf, the physician is then required to inform the facility of these determinations, and an IDT must be convened to review and authorize the proposed treatment. ( \u00a7 1418.8, subds. (a) - (e).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Section 1418.8 sets out standards by which the attending physician must determine a resident's decisionmaking capacity and the absence of any authorized surrogate decisionmaker. To make such determinations, the physician must interview the resident, review the resident's medical records, and consult with facility staff and family members and friends of the resident, if identified. ( \u00a7 1418.8, subds. (b) &amp; (c).) A resident lacks health care decisionmaking capacity if he or she \"is unable to understand the nature and consequences of the proposed medical intervention, including its risks and\n   benefits, or is unable to express a preference regarding the intervention.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , subd. (b); see also Prob. Code, \u00a7 4609.) The absence of any person with legal authority to make treatment decisions on a resident's behalf may be\n   found if there is no \"person designated under a valid Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care, a guardian, a conservator,\" or any \"next of kin\" ( \u00a7 1418.8, subd. (c) ) available and willing to \"take full responsibility\" for such decisions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , subd. (f).) The physician's determinations regarding incapacity and the lack of a surrogate decisionmaker, and the \"basis for those determinations,\" must be documented in the resident's medical record. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , subd. (\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   An IDT at the facility must then \"conduct [a] ... review of the prescribed medical intervention prior to the administration of the medical intervention.\" ( \u00a7 1418.8, subd. (e).) The IDT must include \"the resident's attending physician, a registered professional nurse with responsibility for the resident, other appropriate staff in disciplines as determined by the resident's needs, and, where practicable, a patient representative.\" (\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   ) We note, however, the only\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   participants are the attending physician (who is often the medical director of the nursing home) and a nurse (employed by the nursing home). (\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   ) The patient representative may be a \"family member or friend of the resident who is unable to take full responsibility for the health care decisions of the resident,\" or any \"other person authorized by state or federal law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ( \u00a7 1418.8, subd. (f).) The medical records documenting the attending physician's determinations that the resident lacks capacity to provide informed consent and lacks a surrogate decisionmaker must be made available to the patient representative, if the resident has one. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , subd. (\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   ).) There is no requirement that the same records be made available to the resident. For patients without a representative, as is often the case, no one receives the information intended for the resident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The IDT, in reviewing a proposed treatment decision, must consider each of the following: (1) The \"physician's assessment of the resident's condition\"; (2) \"The reason for the proposed use of the medical intervention\"; (3) The \"desires of the resident,\" based on a patient interview, medical records review, and consultation with any identified family or friends; (4) The \"type of medical intervention to be used in the resident's care\"; (5) \"The probable impact on the resident's condition, with and without the use of the medical intervention\"; (6) \"Reasonable alternative medical interventions considered or utilized and reasons for their discontinuance or inappropriateness.\" ( \u00a7 1418.8, subd. (e)(1)-(6).) Any treatment initiated pursuant to section 1418.8 must be done \"in accordance with acceptable standards of practice.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , subd. (d).) The IDT must reevaluate the treatment \"at least quarterly or upon a\n   significant change in the resident's medical condition.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , subd. (g).) Though the statute makes no mention of the IDT reviewing capacity determinations, the Department presented evidence that IDT's can and do review capacity determinations made by attending physicians. Petitioners argue section 1418.8 does not authorize such in-house review of capacity and surrogacy decisions, and they claim the superior court erred in adopting the Department's interpretation that the statute allows the IDT to review those predicate decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In the event of an emergency, the facility may administer treatment ordered by a physician for the resident, including applying \"physical or chemical restraints,\" without prior IDT approval. ( \u00a7 1418.8, subd. (h).) Generally speaking, \"chemical restraints\" are antipsychotic medications. (See Cal. Code Regs., tit. 22, \u00a7 72018 [a chemical restraint is \"a drug used to control behavior and used in a manner not required to treat the patient's medical symptoms\"].) If physical or chemical restraints are applied, the IDT must meet \"within one week of the emergency for an evaluation of the medical intervention.\" ( \u00a7 1418.8, subd. (h).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Section 1418.8 preserves the right of a resident \"to seek appropriate judicial relief to review the decision to provide the medical intervention.\" ( \u00a7 1418.8, subd. (j).) Under that provision, \"affected persons or their representatives, such as a friend, public guardian, or other concerned person or entity, are afforded an avenue by which they may obtain 'appropriate judicial relief,' including a temporary restraining order and other injunctive relief prior to treatment, thereby satisfying due process principles.\" (\n   <em>\n    Rains\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 32 Cal.App.4th at p. 185,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20185\">\n    38 Cal.Rptr.2d 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)

The History of This Lawsuit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   CANHR is, and has been since 1983, a statewide nonprofit organization dedicated to improving the choices, care and quality of life for California's\n   long-term care consumers. Through direct advocacy, community education, legislation and litigation, CANHR has sought to educate and support nursing home residents and their advocates regarding their legal rights and remedies and to create a united voice for long-term care reform and humane alternatives to institutionalization. The superior court found CANHR had public interest standing to pursue the causes of action raised in this case, and we agree. (\n   <em>\n    Save the Plastic Bag Coalition v.

Just 20 days later, she was examined by another physician who found: \"This resident has the capacity to understand and make decisions.\" Nevertheless, the incapacity determination remained in effect for nine months. Gloria A. never received notice of the physician's determination, of his finding that she had no surrogate to make health care decisions for her, of the treatment and restrictions he recommended, or of her right to judicial review of his decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Nothing in section 1418.8 expressly requires such notice. Gloria A. learned she had been declared incapacitated only because she tried to go on a picnic with another resident and her sister, and she was not allowed to leave the facility based on her doctor's orders and his finding of\n   incapacity. Gloria A. believed she was competent and was told by her social worker she was competent. Gloria A. was later given antipsychotic medication, though she hated it and never consented to it, at the decision of an IDT. Because of her supposed incapacity, she also lost control over her finances. Gloria A. died four months after the petition was filed in superior court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Petitioner Anthony Chicotel is a taxpayer who challenges the expenditure of tax money in enforcing section 1418.8, which he claims is unconstitutional. (See\n   <em>\n    Vasquez v.

In January 2015, the petitioners filed the operative first amended petition alleging the same causes of action, but adding Chicotel as a petitioner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Superior Court's Order and Judgment and the Issues on Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In response to petitioners' motion for writ of mandate, declaratory relief, and injunction, the superior court issued its order in June 2015 granting, in part, and denying, in part, a writ of mandate, and entered judgment accordingly on January 27, 2016. The superior court ruled that section 1418.8 is facially unconstitutional under the state due process clause ( Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 7 ) and enjoined its use on grounds that the statute does not require adequate notification in writing to a nursing home resident regarding (1) the physician's determination of incapacity; (2) the physician's determination that there is no surrogate decisionmaker; (3) the medical intervention prescribed by the physician and the referral to the IDT for decisionmaking regarding the treatment; and (4) the availability of judicial review of any such decisions made by the physician or the IDT. The superior court did not hold such notice was required prior to an incapacity decision being made by the physician, but presumably notice would be required before the IDT made a decision on the recommended treatment. The superior court did not specify that the medical intervention could not be implemented until after the capacity decision was reviewed by the court if the resident sought judicial review, but that requirement is implicit in the \" 'opportunity to be heard' \" at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.

The Director suggests, even if we find the statute constitutionally wanting, we should not declare it unenforceable, but rather should read into it a notice requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The superior court also held that section 1418.8, as applied, violates residents' state constitutional autonomy privacy rights without due process insofar as it has been used to authorize administration of antipsychotic medications without notice and an opportunity to be heard, and without a judicial determination of incapacity or any form of review by a neutral decisionmaker. Petitioners presented evidence, amplified by their supporting amici curiae, suggesting that antipsychotics are administered to nursing home residents for off-label use far too often, not to treat patients' mental health problems, but to make patients more compliant. To avoid an interpretation that it deemed unconstitutional, the superior court held the statute was never meant to apply and does not apply to the administration of antipsychotics. The Director contends the statute is not constitutionally infirm, and claims its text and legislative history support its application to the administration of antipsychotic drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The superior court also held the statute violates the patient's constitutional privacy rights when applied to decisions to withdraw life-sustaining treatment and end life. The Director argues the superior court should not even have reached this issue based on lack of state action and because the issue is not ripe and any opinion on the subject is merely advisory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In addition to supporting the superior court's conclusions about the aspects of the statute deemed unconstitutional or unenforceable except on specified conditions, petitioners, in their cross-appeal, argue section 1418.8 is unconstitutional in the following additional ways, which were rejected by the superior court: (1) the notice required by the superior court must be given\n   <em>\n    prior to\n   </em>\n   the incapacity determination, with a meaningful opportunity to oppose that determination separately from or instead of the after-the-fact judicial review provided by the statute; (2) the capacity decision must be made by a judicial officer, rather than a doctor; (3) an attending physician must not be allowed to act as decisionmaker for capacity determinations (and must not be allowed to serve on the IDT) because he or she is non-neutral; (4) legal counsel or a counsel substitute must be afforded the resident as a matter of due process; and (5) the statute cannot be read as allowing the IDT to review capacity and surrogacy decisions, which leaves patients without recourse except by filing in superior court, which their poor health prevents them from doing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Finally, the superior court's determination that section 1418.8 could not be used for end of life decisions was subject to four exceptions, each of which petitioners claim is inconsistent with the statute and the state Constitution, namely (a) decisions implementing a patient's wish to end life; (b) decisions carrying out a patient's instructions; (c) decisions to decline patient instructions for ineffective care or care contrary to generally accepted medical standards; and (d) decisions to initiate hospice care. Petitioners contend those\n   exceptions are too expansive and unconstitutionally undermine the superior court's\n   broader conclusion that section 1418.8 may not be used for end of life decisions. The court granted the requested writ of mandate in part, conditionally enjoining the enforcement of section 1418.8.

SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Notice and Opportunity to be Heard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Employing independent review, we conclude, as did the superior court, that the statute would be unconstitutional on its face under the due process clause of article I, section 7 of the California Constitution if it failed to require notice to the nursing home resident that he or she has been found to lack decisionmaking capacity and that a surrogate decisionmaker is unavailable-the two findings which serve to take decisionmaking authority out of the hands of the resident-before a recommended medical intervention may be initiated. But to preserve section 1418.8's constitutionality, we construe the statute to require such notice rather than prohibit its enforcement, as the superior court did. We also conclude that the requisite notice\n   may be given immediately after the incapacity and lack-of-surrogacy determinations are made but must be given before a recommended medical intervention may be initiated. The notice must be given both orally and in writing to ensure its effectiveness, and the written notice must be given not only to the affected nursing home resident but to at least one other competent person whose interests are aligned with those of the resident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   We agree with the superior court that, as a matter of due process, before treatment is begun a resident is entitled to a meaningful opportunity to be heard in opposition to the determinations of incapacity and unavailability of a surrogate, as well as to a recommended medical intervention. Thus, the required notice must advise the resident of the fact that determinations of incapacity and absence of a surrogate have been made, of any proposed treatment decided\n   upon by the IDT, and of his or her right to seek judicial review. The statute already provides for judicial review ( \u00a7 1418.8, subd. (j) ), which allows for a neutral judge's decision, representation by counsel ( Prob. Code, \u00a7 3205 ), and a full evidentiary hearing for those patients aggrieved by the incapacity or lack-of-surrogacy decisions or who object to the treatment recommendation. Because medical urgency may not allow for judicial review before a treatment decision must be undertaken, we conclude, in those exigent circumstances-so long as pretreatment notice is given-the statute complies with minimal due process demands by giving the patient an opportunity to be heard during the IDT process itself. The full accoutrements of judicial process, with a right to counsel, are not constitutionally mandated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Mandatory Inclusion of Independent Patient Representative on IDT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Patients subject to section 1418.8 presumably cannot competently speak for themselves, to anyone, in making their desires and intentions known. The practical reality, then, is that the Legislature has set up a process the objective of which is to discern, by the best approximation possible, what those desires and intentions would be if the patient could communicate effectively. No process designed to achieve that end could be perfect, but we think the one the Legislature has chosen here-which is based on a model of collaborative decisionmaking in which a number of different perspectives are represented-satisfies due process. We believe an essential feature of the IDT process that saves it from constitutional infirmity in non-emergency circumstances is the inclusion on the IDT of a patient representative who is independent of the nursing home staff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Although the statute provides for a patient representative to participate on the IDT \"where practicable,\" we give that phrase a narrow reading so that a patient representative must be appointed for every nursing home\n   resident determined to be decisionally incapacitated and without a surrogate decisionmaker under section 1418.8, subdivision (a). We view the role of the patient representative as so crucial to the functioning and constitutionality of the statute that if the patient has no family or friends willing to serve on the IDT, the nursing home must find another person unaffiliated with the nursing home to serve as patient representative for each person subject to the IDT decisionmaking procedure. Only in the case of an urgent medical emergency may an IDT act without the patient representative's participation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Administration of Antipsychotic Medication\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   We reject petitioners' first as-applied challenge urging that section 1418.8 be voided to the extent it allows, in non-emergency circumstances, the administration of antipsychotic drugs to nursing home residents without judicial authorization. We conclude, here too as a matter of statutory construction, that section 1418.8 may be employed in making decisions relating to administration of antipsychotic medications, and that, so construed, the statute does not violate the patient's privacy or due process rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Section 1418.8, subdivision (h), expressly authorizes \"chemical restraints\"-which usually means antipsychotics-to be administered in emergency situations. We see no reason why prescriptions for use of antipsychotics for an ongoing psychosis could not also be prescribed through the IDT process in non-emergency circumstances. While we condemn the use of\n   antipsychotics for purposes of ongoing patient control, which we are told has been a problem in the past in nursing homes, we believe the Department's strict enforcement of the network of federal and state statutes and regulations constraining the prescription of such drugs in nursing homes is sufficient to prevent continuing abuse. If the Department is failing to carry out its enforcement obligations in policing the use of antipsychotic medications by nursing homes, that is a matter which should be addressed in a case presenting the issue for decision on an appropriate record. We do not have such a record here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    D. End of Life Decisionmaking\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Finally, we reject petitioner's second as-applied challenge that categorically, under no circumstances, may section 1418.8 be applied to what the parties call end of life decisionmaking, a phrase that, on the record presented here, we understand to mean any decision to impose or change a physician order for life sustaining treatment (POLST) or any decision to provide hospice care to a terminally ill patient. So long as constitutionally required notice is given, as outlined above, and so long as the IDT includes an independent patient representative, as further outlined above, we think that\n   use of the IDT decisionmaking process for these kinds of end of life decisions adequately safeguards the constitutionally protected right of an incapacitated nursing home resident to refuse medical treatment. The superior court appears to have recognized as much, building into the injunction four exceptions designed to cover various aspects of end of life decisionmaking. Because we conclude there is no constitutional infirmity with the use of section 1418.8 for the specific kinds of end of life decisionmaking presented on this record, we have no occasion to address the need for any of these exceptions or whether it is even appropriate to characterize them as exceptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Although we hold that section 1418.8 passes constitutional muster when used for some specific types of end of life decisionmaking, we emphasize what we do not hold. Because, in some circumstances, a decision to cease life-sustaining care will require the intervention of a neutral, judicial decisionmaker under either\n   <em>\n    Conservatorship of Wendland\n   </em>\n   (2001)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"456816\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/26/519/\">\n    26 Cal.4th 519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=110%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20412\">\n    110 Cal.Rptr.2d 412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20P.3d%20151\">\n    28 P.3d 151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Wendland\n   </em>\n   ) (conscious but incapacitated patients) or\n   <em>\n    Conservatorship of Drabick\n   </em>\n   (1988)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6038756\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-3d/200/185/\">\n    200 Cal.App.3d 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=245%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20840\">\n    245 Cal.Rptr. 840\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Drabick\n   </em>\n   ) (unconscious patients)-cases which involve withdrawal of life support-we anticipate that, somewhere, a line must be drawn between on the one hand cessation of curative care for a decisionally incapacitated person without a surrogate (for whom the IDT may act), and on the other hand, withdrawal of life support (for whom resort to the judicial process would be necessary). But we have no occasion to address that issue here. Drawing the appropriate line involves a myriad of medical and other circumstances that we cannot begin to predict based on the limited record before us, so we simply note this outer boundary to constitutionally proper use of the IDT process, without reaching it in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Although section 1418.8 may be directly implemented by nursing homes, the Department is responsible for oversight, inspection and surveying nursing homes to enforce the statute's implementation.

Moreover, not only are petitioners mounting a challenge to a statutory scheme enacted by the state Legislature, but nursing homes are, in effect, performing the state's obligations under the\n   <em>\n    parens patriae\n   </em>\n   doctrine, which requires the state to care for its most vulnerable residents who cannot care for themselves.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (See\n   <em>\n    Qawi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 32 Cal.4th at p. 15,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20780\">\n    7 Cal.Rptr.3d 780\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20P.3d%20224\">\n    81 P.3d 224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) If, by failure of enforcement-which is what was alleged and impliedly found here-the Director has placed the state's imprimatur on the nursing homes' challenged conduct, then that is also a sufficient ground to extend due process protection to nursing home patients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   We think the superior court was right to conclude that, looking at the statute literally, as written, section 1418.8 fails to meet due process requirements under article I, section 7, subdivision (a) of the California Constitution. A declaration of incapacity subjects the nursing home resident to grievous loss and must be accompanied by due process protections. Petitioners have presented evidence in this case that a declaration of incapacity not only deprives the nursing home resident of decisionmaking power over his or her own health care, but may result in loss of control over finances and freedom of movement. The superior court's findings amply support its determination that, as illustrated by Gloria A.'s circumstances, section 1418.8, on its face, is constitutionally deficient. In fact, in one critical respect-a patient's right to notice of entitlement to a patient representative on the IDT-we conclude the superior court's due process analysis did not go far enough.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Construing Section 1418.8 to Save it From Constitutional Infirmity\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Presented with a petition for a writ of mandate seeking both declaratory and injunctive relief, the superior court elected to proceed by injunction. In prohibiting enforcement of section 1418.8 \"to the extent that said section does not require\" constitutionally required notice, the superior\n   court recognized that nursing home residents who have been determined to lack decisional capacity are unlikely to understand or be able to act on such notice. It considered the privacy rights at stake to be so fundamental and the consequences of erroneous deprivation so potentially harmful to the patient, that\n   state standards of due process require, at a minimum, written notice of the four listed categories of information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   While we agree in principle with the superior court's due process analysis, we think the proper remedial approach here is to preserve the statute's constitutionality by interpretation, not to prohibit its enforcement by injunction. Legislation comes to us clothed with a presumption of validity, and when dealing with a challenge to a statute, whether facial or as applied, our mission is, \"wherever possible, ...

We draw a different conclusion, on a different rationale. In our view, the Legislature built section 1418.8 on a preexisting foundation of patient protections that it expected would be necessary for the implementation of the statute. Rather than \"undermine\" petitioners' due process claim, we think this legal backdrop confirms that the Legislature understood and intended there were certain bedrock procedural minima on which it was establishing a new scheme. The gravity of the interests at stake outside the context of \"routine, day-to-day\" medical decisionmaking convinces us that-at least with respect to notice and an opportunity to be heard-this assumed procedural foundation is not just statutory and regulatory, but constitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Faced with the choice of voiding a statute or reading it to include procedural protections to avoid constitutional infirmity, courts have often chosen the route of savings-by-interpretation.

Without mandated notice of these matters to patients, in our view, the respect for personal autonomy that it is the central objective of section 1418.8 to protect is essentially meaningless. As the superior court explained, \"[t]o the extent ... patients [covered by section 1418.8 ] are competent enough to want to challenge ... determinations\" made for and about them, \"notice and opportunity may allow them to keep their decision-making capacity, or designate someone of their own choosing, instead of placing such decisions in the hands of a team of strangers.\" At stake, fundamentally, is the right of individual dignity. \"If, in fact, the patient lacks capacity,\" the superior court pointed out, \"then the patient will likely be unable to understand the nature of these determinations or to seek review,\" but at least \"will have been afforded his or her due process rights.\" We take the same view, but rather than bar enforcement of section 1418.8 because it makes no express provision for notice and an opportunity to be heard, we imply these requisites as a matter of statutory\n   interpretation and constitutional imperative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Adequacy of Notice\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Although we conclude the superior court's due process analysis was correct, in some respects it did not go far enough. Beyond requiring written notice of certain kinds of information, for example, the court did not expound on what \"adequate notice\" means in this context. When notice is required, it must be reasonably calculated to give actual notice to the person affected. (\n   <em>\n    Rasooly v.

We are concerned here with effective notice, that is, notice that will result in communication to the resident, if possible. If notice is to be effective in these circumstances, it must be given in writing as well as orally. This seems only marginally more burdensome than oral notice alone and is much more likely to lead to the patient's understanding of his or her own predicament because (1) it may be referred to repeatedly for increased comprehension, and (2) it may be shown to a friend, relative, nursing home staff member, or local ombudsman\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   for a simpler or fuller explanation of what the writing seeks to convey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   But requiring notice to affected residents, by itself, is not sufficient.

The patient representative or the local ombudsman provided for in section 1418.8, subdivisions (e) and (f) could, for instance, receive such notice on the patient's behalf. Anyone empowered by the Probate Code to pursue judicial relief for the resident, even if they are not available to serve as a surrogate decisionmaker, might suffice. (See also Prob.

On this point, we think more is required than the holding in\n   <em>\n    Rains\n   </em>\n   demands. As noted, section 1418.8, subdivision (e), provides for the participation of a patient representative on the IDT \"where practicable.\" The Legislature defined \"patient representative\" broadly: \"A patient representative may include a family member or friend of the resident who is unable to take full responsibility for the health care\n   decisions of the resident, but who has agreed to serve on the interdisciplinary team, or other person authorized by state or federal law.\" ( \u00a7 1418.8, subd.

(e).) Although the patient representative's consent is required as part of the IDT, his or her vote on the team is but part of the required consensus; holding that the patient representative alone could control decisionmaking would be tantamount to making the representative the surrogate decisionmaker for the resident, though he or she\n   has not qualified for or is unwilling to assume that status and may not have been chosen by the resident. A patient representative is defined, in part, as a family member or friend who is \"unable to take full responsibility\" for making the resident's health care decisions ( \u00a7 1418.8, subd. (f) ) and therefore does not perform the role of a surrogate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Because the threshold determination triggering the need for an IDT requires that there be no one \"with legal authority to make\" health care decisions on the patient's \"behalf,\" we understand the patient's representative designated to serve on the IDT as something different from a surrogate decisionmaker. ( \u00a7 1418.8, subd. (a).) Where a patient, although incompetent to make medical decisions, nonetheless is able to articulate coherent ideas about his or her current circumstances, it is the task of the patient representative to bring that information into the IDT's decisionmaking process. Viewed in that light, the role of the patient representative on the IDT is to take responsibility for understanding and articulating the best approximation possible of the patient's perspective. In effect, as we read the statute, the Legislature has provided for virtual representation through the IDT as a body, not actual representation through the patient representative as an agent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   It may be that, as a practical matter, the patient representative is the member of the IDT whose perspective comes the closest to being a stand-in for the patient-and perhaps is the one most likely to dissent, since it is the decision of the attending physician that is under review by the IDT. Nevertheless, we do not view the role of the patient representative as a proxy for the patient, in the sense of an advocate or an agent who takes guidance or instruction from a client or principal. The context here, a setting in which the patient cannot express his or her informed decision to anyone, makes that impossible. Where the patient's attitudes and personal background are not known, the patient representative provides, at minimum, the perspective of an individual unaffiliated with the nursing home, who can be vigilant as to when judicial intervention is required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   As the IDT member uniquely responsible for presenting the patient's perspective, the patient representative's role on the IDT is essential. Despite the crucial function performed by the patient representative, the statutory language \"where practicable\" ( \u00a7 1418.8, subd. (e) )-if given a broad reading-would severely undervalue the right to have such a person involved in the IDT's decisionmaking process. We consider it necessary to have a patient representative participate on\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   IDT as\n   an element of due process. \"Where practicable\" does not mean \"where convenient\" or \"where someone happens to step forward.\" The statute imposes upon the nursing home an affirmative duty to investigate who might serve as patient representative, and if no family or friend is available, the nursing home must designate some person not\n   employed by the nursing home-and thus independent of nursing home staff-to act as patient representative.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   As\n   <em>\n    Rains\n   </em>\n   held, the phrase \"where practicable\" allows the IDT to proceed without a patient representative only in \"exigent circumstances\" when the urgency of the patient's medical needs will not allow for the patient representative's participation. (\n   <em>\n    Rains\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 32 Cal.App.4th at pp. 166-167,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20185\">\n    38 Cal.Rptr.2d 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Nursing homes may not use the \"where practicable\" language as an escape valve to avoid participation by a patient representative. A patient representative should be designated for each resident determined to be decisionally incapacitated as soon as that determination is made. Where no appropriate friend or family member is identified, the nursing home must enlist the local ombudsman, public guardian, or equivalent county officers to serve. (See Prob. Code, \u00a7 3203.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   It is clear to us, as it was to the panel in\n   <em>\n    Rains\n   </em>\n   , that the Legislature intended to give nursing home residents something as close as possible to a voice on any IDT convened to make a determination about the resident's health care, and that voice was to be communicated through a \"patient representative.\" ( \u00a7 1418.8, subd. (e).) Because the resident has a statutory\n   <em>\n    right\n   </em>\n   to the participation of a patient representative in the IDT process, the notice that we require in parts IV.D.2. and IV.D.3.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , must include notice of that right. Only through vigorous enforcement of the right to have a patient representative serve on the IDT may the resident's due process rights under our state Constitution be protected and effectuated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   5.\n   <em>\n    Timing Considerations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   a. Timing of Notice\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Petitioners' cross-appeal presents the question whether the due process clause of the state Constitution requires more than the relief the superior court provided, whether it requires notice of the proposed declaration of incapacity\n   <em>\n    prior to\n   </em>\n   the physician making the capacity decision, and likewise requires notice of the proposed lack of surrogate finding before that finding is made. (See\n   <em>\n    Goldberg v. Kelly\n   </em>\n   (1970)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12052726\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/254/#p261\">\n    397 U.S. 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 261, 264-265,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12052726\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/254/#p261\">\n    90 S.Ct. 1011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12052726\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/254/#p261\">\n    25 L.Ed.2d 287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [requiring hearing before termination of welfare benefits, rather than after].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Petitioners' argument is that without\n   <em>\n    prior\n   </em>\n   notice, the right to oppose these decisions in court afterward is ineffective, in part because it would reverse the burden of proof. (Cf.\n   <em>\n    Doe v. Gallinot\n   </em>\n   (9th Cir. 1981)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1192147\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/657/1017/#p1022\">\n    657 F.2d 1017\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1022.) They also posit the patients' feeble health and limited intellectual capacity are obstacles to filing a petition in court challenging the attending physician's incapacity determination. Petitioners also contend that notice must be accompanied by an opportunity to oppose\n   the incapacity decision\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   it is made. They insist such a hearing must provide residents with the usual accompaniments to an adversarial hearing, including the resident's right to counsel or a counsel substitute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   We must reject petitioners' contentions as to timing as being beyond the minimum requirements of due process. We can agree with them that giving notice before a capacity decision is made would maximize protection of the patient's constitutional rights, and providing for a process more closely resembling an adjudication might increase that protection still further, but the question is whether the Legislature is required to provide that degree of protection as a matter of constitutional imperative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Goldberg v. Kelly\n   </em>\n   the Supreme Court's concern about the impact on individuals affected by the state action necessitated a pre-termination hearing for welfare recipients, for they would suffer a grievous loss if their benefits were cut off while awaiting the post-termination hearing afforded by the state. ( 397 U.S. at pp. 260-264,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12052726\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/254/#p261\">\n    90 S.Ct. 1011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) The difference in circumstances makes it far more likely here that the treatment delays that would accompany a hearing prior to the capacity determination would work to the serious harm of nursing home residents needing immediate medical intervention. (\n   <em>\n    Rains\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 32 Cal.App.4th at pp. 181-182,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20185\">\n    38 Cal.Rptr.2d 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) The very point of enacting section 1418.8 in 1992 was to establish a fair but streamlined procedure to be used in cases of incapacitated residents without family or friends to make health care decisions on their behalf. To require, as a matter of due process, all the features of a judicial proceeding would undermine the fundamental purpose of the statute, which was to avoid the complications and delays inherent in the judicial procedure established by Probate Code section 3200 et seq.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Timing constraints make petitioners' proposed procedure infeasible. Notice immediately following a doctor's determination of incapacity, with an opportunity for judicial review before treatment begins, satisfies due process. Although the statute provides no opportunity for the resident to oppose the incapacity decision before it is made, and no administrative review procedure separate from the IDT, it does allow for judicial review of the incapacity and surrogacy decisions. This complies with the requirements of due process. The statute presupposes the patient needs a medical procedure or prescription,\n   presumably on a relatively short timetable. ( \u00a7 1418.8, subd. (a).) There is no requirement for a standalone capacity determination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   When the capacity determination is made contemporaneously with a treatment recommendation, the patient's needs generally will not allow for an adjudicative hearing in every case. Nor must we presume that every recommended procedure or every incapacity finding will be opposed by the resident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The Director's amici argue that a ruling by this court requiring a judicial determination in each case, as a matter of course, would result in lengthy delays, and patients would go without needed medicine or medical procedures, resulting in suffering and possible death while waiting for a court ruling on capacity. Especially if antipsychotics cannot be prescribed by an IDT, they predict more nursing home patients\n   will end up in mental hospitals. Additionally, more nursing home patients would have to be admitted to hospitals or urgent care facilities because their health problems would turn into emergencies while awaiting judicial action. Ultimately, the Director argues, nursing homes may refuse to accept patients subject to decisionmaking under section 1418.8 because they may believe they would be unable to tend to the patient's medical needs timely and responsibly. Hence, the Director and her amici predict, if we were to agree with petitioners' arguments, this most vulnerable population would run the risk of being confined to acute care facilities or hospitals or left without a viable means of securing medical care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Petitioners clarify that a full-blown judicial proceeding such as that involved in Probate Code section 3201 is unnecessary, but rather the Constitution would be satisfied by an administrative board or a hearing procedure presided over expeditiously, such as the administrative hearings put into operation by the Legislature following the decision in\n   <em>\n    Riese v. St. Mary's Hospital &amp; Medical Center\n   </em>\n   (1987)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4444905\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-3d/209/1303/#p1318\">\n    209 Cal.App.3d 1303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1318,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=271%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20199\">\n    271 Cal.Rptr. 199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (See Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 5332.) Such a hearing, they suggest, could be conducted by \"a court-appointed commissioner or referee, or a court-appointed hearing officer\" ( Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 5334, subd. (c) ), and therefore need not be made by a judge. This added protection, in our view, would dispense with the IDT structure altogether. Petitioners want to throw out the baby with the bath. Nothing so drastic is required. Pitted against the argument that time is of the essence in medical decisions, the preference for prior notice and an opportunity to resist the determination before it is made must give way to efficacy of the proposed intervention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   b. Timing of Recommended Medical Interventions\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   As we view the statute, there is an opportunity to be heard in court upon a petition under Probate Code section 3201 if the collaborative model of decisionmaking results in deadlock (i.e., if anyone on the IDT disagrees with the incapacity or lack of surrogacy determinations or the proposed treatment). Petitioners point out that, for incapacitated persons, providing for a remedy in superior court is unrealistic and impractical due to their physical and mental health challenges. Because individuals other than the patient may initiate such proceedings ( Prob. Code, \u00a7 3203 ), and because the procedure employed on judicial review would include appointment of counsel for the resident ( Prob. Code, \u00a7 3205 ), we see no lack of due process in the procedure provided, so long as the implementation of the proposed treatment is delayed until after any judicial challenge has been decided (with the exception of cases of emergency).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The opportunity to be heard must be provided at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner. (\n   <em>\n    Goldberg v. Kelly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 397 U.S. at p. 267,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12052726\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/254/#p261\">\n    90 S.Ct. 1011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Armstrong v.

Unless implementation of the physician's recommended treatment is postponed until after a collaborative decision has been made by the IDT or judicial review has been completed, the medical procedure may have already been completed before the patient may realistically oppose the incapacity determination and the proposed medical intervention in court. This is why we conclude that, except in emergencies, to give nursing home residents a meaningful opportunity to be heard, the IDT's decision on implementing treatment must be postponed until after notice has been given, and the treatment may not begin until\n   after the resident has had an opportunity to seek judicial review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Section 1418.8, subdivision (e) provides that the IDT must \"review ... the prescribed medical intervention\" before it is implemented. There is no language in section 1418.8 either specifically authorizing or specifically prohibiting the IDT from reviewing capacity determinations, but the Director presented evidence in the superior court that IDT's can and do review capacity and surrogacy determinations, as well as medical treatments. This, she claims, is part of reviewing the patient's overall \"condition\" as prescribed in section 1418.8, subdivision (e)(1). Adopting that construction of the statute, we find the IDT process serves as a more expeditious, and constitutionally sound, alternative to judicial review, so long as a patient representative is included on the IDT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

(\n   <em>\n    Qawi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 32 Cal.4th at p. 17,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20780\">\n    7 Cal.Rptr.3d 780\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20P.3d%20224\">\n    81 P.3d 224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Because section 1418.8 places that decision in a physician's hands, petitioners contend it violates the resident's privacy rights under article I, section 1 of the California Constitution. Even worse, they point out, the decision under section 1418.8, subdivision (a) rests with the attending physician, whom they consider a non-neutral party,\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   who also participates on the IDT ( \u00a7 1418.8, subd. (e) ), which they contend deprives the patient of a neutral decisionmaker in violation of due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Petitioners suggest, because section 1418.8 lacks a judicial determination of incapacity as part of its procedure, the statute violates California's privacy guarantee. ( Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 1.) They contend the superior court's declaration of unconstitutionality of section 1418.8 did not go far enough because it did not declare a determination of incapacity by a treating physician was unconstitutional. In response, the Director claims the entire procedure described in section 1418.8 calls for the making of medical decisions, not legal decisions. She finds some support in\n   <em>\n    Washington v. Harper\n   </em>\n   , where the Supreme Court took no issue with the lack of a judicial hearing as to the need for antipsychotic medication because it considered such matters best assessed by medical professionals.

A person may become incompetent by reasons best\n   explained medically. The legal conclusion is therefore based at least in part on medical evidence, subject to a standardized definition of incapacity in section 1418.8, subdivision (b), which supplies some safeguard against arbitrariness and\n   caprice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   The determination of decisional capacity is, to be sure, increasingly recognized as a complicated undertaking, especially in patients with dementia.

In this statutory setting, the physician's decision regarding capacity is guided by objective standards and requires an investigation regarding possible surrogacy and patient wishes.

If an objection is raised, the incapacity decision must be made by a court. ( Cal. Code Regs., tit. 22, \u00a7 72527, subd.

With statutory guidance on how to conduct a fair and thorough investigation aimed at identifying a surrogate decisionmaker ( \u00a7 1418.8, subd. (c) ), treating physicians may be entrusted with making a determination following such an investigation. Our state Constitution offers no impediment on this ground, and the IDT process offers a meaningful review, followed by judicial review if the patient or his or her representative continues to resist a finding of no surrogate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Facial Challenge: Additional Due Process Claims on Petitioners' Cross-Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Petitioners argue, largely on the basis of\n   <em>\n    Washington v.

In formulating their objections to section 1418.8, petitioners attempt to convert\n   the particular features of one institution's policy described in\n   <em>\n    Washington v. Harper\n   </em>\n   into absolute minimum requirements for a panel of nonjudicial decisionmakers to pass constitutional muster in making medical decisions. Though the prison policy in\n   <em>\n    Washington v. Harper\n   </em>\n   was held to comply with federal due process, the Supreme Court in that case made no pretense of setting forth minimum standards for precise emulation by other institutions. ( 494 U.S. at pp. 228-236,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5046\" index=\"222\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/494/210/#p221\">\n    110 S.Ct. 1028\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) We must examine only whether the procedures established by our state Legislature for medical treatment of nursing home residents comport with minimum due process standards of the state Constitution. ( Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Seeking a procedure more protective of patients' rights, petitioners suggest (1) the prescribing physician must not be allowed to participate on the IDT, (2) a patient should be provided with counsel or a counsel substitute in the determination of incapacity, and (3) the IDT is not allowed to review capacity and surrogacy decisions. Petitioners thereby attempt to engraft onto the statute an adversarial process, presided over by a judge, with two sides, each represented by counsel, taking opposing positions and entrusting resolution of their disagreement to a neutral judicial officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   We have already rejected petitioners' first argument for the reasons stated in parts IV.E.2 &amp; IV.E.3.,\n   <em>\n    ante.\n   </em>\n   Petitioners' third point we resolve by holding that an IDT does have the authority to review an attending physician's capacity and surrogacy decisions. Given the requirement that it review medical interventions quarterly ( \u00a7 1418.8, subd. (g) ) and the fact that capacity fluctuates, the IDT presumably will revisit the incapacity determination at the time of its quarterly reviews. The Director presented evidence that the statute has been construed to allow the IDT that power, and we adopt that interpretation as consistent with, though not compelled by, the statutory language. We find no due process violation in the Legislature's choice to provide nursing home residents with an informal, collaborative decisionmaking process for determining medication needs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Nor are we persuaded that nursing home residents facing an incapacity determination must be provided with some form of legal representation. Here again petitioners presuppose that a resident perceived to lack decisional capacity must have input before the capacity determination is made. We have determined that notice after the determination, coupled with the availability of judicial review, satisfies due process. If the resident or someone on his or her behalf ( Prob. Code, \u00a7 3203 ) were to challenge the incapacity determination through a petition under Probate Code section 3201, counsel would be appointed at that stage. ( Prob. Code, \u00a7 3205.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Given our holdings that the IDT process does not itself offend the Constitution and that IDT's may reconsider the attending physician's determination of incapacity, we reject the notion that legal counsel must be appointed to help deal with that issue, whenever it arises. The Legislature sought to eliminate from the process the time-consuming and adversarial nature that the\n   participation of attorneys tends to entail. Instead, it provided that residents would have a patient representative serve on an IDT. ( \u00a7 1418.8, subds. (e), (f).) The inclusion of a patient representative in a collaborative decisionmaking process, as we have explained, is enough to satisfy due process in this context. (See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Washington v.

For this reason, authorities often seek to medicate prisoners and others under their control, and those subject to such medication often object.

(See\n   <em>\n    Rains\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 32 Cal.App.4th at p. 186,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"235\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20185\">\n    38 Cal.Rptr.2d 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Health and Safety Code section 1418.9 specifically authorizes the prescription of antipsychotics to a nursing home patient after seeking the consent of the resident and notifying \"an interested family member,\" and so long as the resident does not object. ( Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 1418.9, subds. (a), (b) &amp; (d).) That provision is evidently intended for patients not subject to IDT decisionmaking under section 1418.8. The population subject to IDT decisionmaking often would have no \"interested family member\" and so no notice would go out on their behalf. Once again, a third party should also receive notice on behalf of the resident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   The Director and her amici point out the broad purposes of section 1418.8, namely to \"secure, to the greatest extent possible, health care decisionmakers\" for unrepresented residents lacking decisionmaking capacity \"to ensure that the medical needs of nursing facility residents are met even in the absence of a surrogate health care decisionmaker.\" (Stats. 1992, ch. 1303, \u00a7 1(c), p. 6327.) They claim the protections\n   built into section 1418.8, together with other protections in the regulatory environment, are sufficient to satisfy the residents' constitutional rights to autonomy privacy and due process. They also point out that more modern atypical antipsychotics have fewer side effects and are now frequently used in nursing homes because they can be administered orally instead of by injection. (\n   <em>\n    Qawi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 32 Cal.4th at p. 15,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"236\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20780\">\n    7 Cal.Rptr.3d 780\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"237\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20P.3d%20224\">\n    81 P.3d 224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) These newer medications are also controversial for use in institutional settings, however, because administration requires patient cooperation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Qawi\n   </em>\n   , at p. 15,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"238\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20780\">\n    7 Cal.Rptr.3d 780\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"239\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20P.3d%20224\">\n    81 P.3d 224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Petitioners and their amici tell a decidedly different tale. They begin with the fact that the \"attending physician and surgeon\" referenced in section 1418.8 is frequently the nursing home's medical director. The attending physician is, at any rate, usually assigned to the resident, not chosen\n   freely by the resident. (\n   <em>\n    In re Conroy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 486 A.2d at p 1237.) As the medical director, the attending physician has a financial interest in medicating patients with antipsychotics: by medicating them into a more complacent state, whether in their best medical interests or not, the nursing home can manage the facility's population with fewer employees, thus increasing the facility's profit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Studies have shown that residents of nursing homes tend to be overmedicated with antipsychotics. (E.g., Alice F. Bonner,\n   <em>\n    Rationales That Providers and Family Members Cited for the Use of Antipsychotic Medications in Nursing Home Residents with Dementia\n   </em>\n   (2015) 63 J. Am. Geriatrics Soc'y. 302, 302; Jan Goodwin,\n   <em>\n    Antipsychotics Overprescribed in Nursing Homes\n   </em>\n   , AARP BULLETIN (July/Aug. 2014) &lt; https://www.aarp.org/health/drugs-supplements/info-2014/antipsychotics-overprescribed.html&gt; [as of July 22, 2019].) This is a special concern not only because of the severe side effects ordinarily associated with these drugs, but because the effects are much more detrimental in elderly patients (Prakash S. Masand,\n   <em>\n    Side Effects of Antipsychotics in the Elderly\n   </em>\n   (2000) 61 J. Clinical Psychiatry 43, 43), and those over age 65 make up nearly 85 percent of the population in nursing homes nationwide. (&lt; https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_03/sr03_038.pdf&gt;, p. 35 [as of July 22, 2019].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   The Director argues, however, that such problems have been recognized and addressed, and abuse of antipsychotics in nursing homes has sharply declined in recent years. Current data indicate that as of\n   the fourth quarter of 2018, antipsychotic use has been reduced to 11.1 percent of California nursing home residents, a 48.5 percent reduction since 2011. (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS),\n   <em>\n    National Partnership to Improve Dementia Care in Nursing Homes: Antipsychotic Medication Use Data Report, Quarterly Prevalence of Antipsychotic Use for Long-Stay Residents, States\n   </em>\n   (April 2019) &lt;\n   <em>\n    https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Provider-Enrollment-and-Certification/SurveyCertificationGenInfo/Downloads/Antipsychotic-Medication-Use-Data-Report.pdf\n   </em>\n   &gt; [as of July 22, 2019].) This represents the fourth lowest prevalence of use among the 50 states. (\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   ) The statewide prevalence of 11.1 percent is well below the national average of 14.6 percent. (\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   ) Thus, the Director argues, past abuse provides no legitimate reason for declaring nursing home residents to have special due process protections in the administration of antipsychotics, where the regulatory system already rigorously controls the use of antipsychotics in nursing homes. As for the risks involved with antipsychotics, the Director points out that other common medications, such as insulin and blood thinners, are riskier and have been connected with far more adverse events and deaths than antipsychotics.\n   3.\n   <em>\n    The Regulatory Environment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Through the Nursing Home Reform Act, which applies to almost all California nursing homes,\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   and its implementing regulations, the federal government has sought to reduce over-prescription of psychotherapeutic drugs by explicitly limiting their use in nursing homes. The law expressly provides that psychopharmacologic drugs may be administered to nursing home residents only on the orders of a physician as part of a written plan of care \"designed to eliminate or modify the symptoms for which the drugs are prescribed,\" and only if, at least annually, an \"independent, external consultant reviews the appropriateness of the drug plan of each resident receiving such drugs.\" ( 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395i-3(c)(1)(D).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   The law also provides that nursing home residents have a right to be free from \"chemical restraints imposed for purposes of discipline or convenience and not required to treat the resident's medical symptoms.\" ( 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395i-3(c)(1)(A)(ii).) Such restraints may only be imposed \"to ensure the physical safety of the resident or other residents,\" and \"only upon the written order of a physician that specifies the duration and circumstances under which the restraints are to be used,\" except in emergencies. (\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   \"The information material to a decision concerning the administration of a psychotherapeutic drug or physical restraint, or the prolonged use of a device that may lead to the inability of the patient to regain use of a normal bodily function shall include at least the following: [\u00b6] (1) The reason for the treatment and the nature and seriousness of the patient's illness. [\u00b6] (2) The nature of the procedures to be used in the proposed treatment including their probable frequency and duration. [\u00b6] (3) The probable degree and duration (temporary or permanent) of improvement or remission, expected with or without\n   such treatment. [\u00b6] (4) The nature, degree, duration and probability of the side effects and significant risks, commonly known by the health professions.

(a)(5).)\n   Under federal regulations, facilities must ensure that antipsychotic drug therapy is not given to residents who have not previously used psychotropic drugs \"unless the medication is necessary to treat a specific condition as diagnosed and documented in the clinical record,\" and they must give residents \"gradual dose reductions, and behavioral interventions, unless clinically contraindicated, in an effort to discontinue these drugs.\" (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"240\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20483.45\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3), (e)(1) &amp; (e)(2).)

She nevertheless appeals the superior court's order requiring judicial approval of such prescriptions, arguing (1) the legislative history of section 1418.8 shows it was intended to allow the IDT procedure for prescription of antipsychotics; (2) no restrictions on such use of the statute are mentioned in the statute itself; and (3) due to efforts by the Department and other agencies over the past few years, prescriptions of antipsychotics in nursing homes have declined by more than 48 percent in California. (See part IV.G.2,\n   <em>\n    ante.\n   </em>\n   ) The Department argues that without availability of the IDT procedure, patients who need antipsychotics will not get them in a timely manner and will suffer distress and possibly transfer to an acute care or psychiatric facility as a result. The Department has never condoned or encouraged the abuse of antipsychotics in nursing homes, so far as we can tell from the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    The Legal Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   <em>\n    Rains\n   </em>\n   did not discuss the administration of antipsychotic drugs to nursing home patients found incompetent under section 1418.8. The only inferential reference to antipsychotic drugs in section 1418.8 itself is the authorization of \"chemical restraints\" in an emergency, without a prior IDT determination to administer such restraints.

If such \"chemical restraints\" are used, an IDT must be convened within one week thereafter to evaluate that use. ( \u00a7 1418.8, subd. (h).) Petitioners argue that the IDT process cannot be used to prescribe antipsychotics due to the statute's lack of procedural safeguards required as a matter of due process.

Petitioners suggest that the severe side effects of antipsychotics renders them non-routine and extremely intrusive, therefore meriting special protection for nursing home residents. We find no language in the statute to support the interpretation that it applies only to routine medical interventions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   <em>\n    Rains\n   </em>\n   relied on language in the preamble to section 1418.8 suggesting it was required to make sure nursing homes could secure substituted consent to meet their patients' medical needs, including \"day-to-day medical treatment decisions ... on an on-going basis,\" which were difficult to secure using the pre-existing legal methods. (Stats. 1992, ch. 1303, \u00a7 1(b), p. 6327.) The preamble, by our reading, does not limit section 1418.8's application to those \"day-to-day\" decisions, however. Although the conception of\n   section 1418.8 the\n   <em>\n    Rains\n   </em>\n   court adopted in passing on the issue of facial constitutionality appears to be predicated on an understanding that the preamble may be read as, in effect, a limitation on the reach of the statute, this case requires us to confront the question in a specific setting, as applied. While we otherwise agree with the\n   <em>\n    Rains\n   </em>\n   holding, on this specific point we do not. (\n   <em>\n    People v.

Giving the operative statutory text its plain meaning, as we must, we conclude that section 1418.8 was drafted with breadth enough to cover antipsychotic medications, even though their effects on patients is anything but \"routine.\" In an apparent effort to fit the case within\n   <em>\n    Rains\n   </em>\n   , the Director asserts, to the contrary, that the administration of antipsychotic drugs is \"routine\" in nursing homes. Finding no support for this position, the superior court rejected the argument that administering antipsychotics could accurately be characterized as \"nonintrusive and routine, ongoing\" care. It was justified in doing so, but even if administration of antipsychotic drugs in nursing homes is \"routine\" in the sense that it is common, as several amicus briefs suggest, we find the issue to be beside the point because we do not view section 1418.8 to be limited to \"routine\" medical interventions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   The superior court held, \"Patients in skilled nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities are entitled to no [fewer] rights than mentally ill patients and prisoners, and therefore are either entitled to procedural safeguards consisting of either a judicial finding of incompetency as in\n   <em>\n    Qawi\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Keyhea\n   </em>\n   , or some type of independent review process of the attending physician's recommendation to administer antipsychotic drugs along with notice and opportunity to be heard as in\n   <em>\n    Washington\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    v. Harper\n   </em>\n   ].\" Because section 1418.8 does not provide such procedural safeguards, the court found the Department's application of section 1418.8 permitting patients to be treated with antipsychotic drugs under this statutory procedure would violate these patients' due process rights. In order to avoid this unconstitutional result, the superior court construed section 1418.8 as simply not applying to administration of antipsychotic medications: \"Since section 1418.8 was not intended to permit administration of antipsychotic drugs, compliance with the procedures set forth in Probate Code section 3200 et seq. would still be required, except in emergency situations.\" We cannot accept this construction of the statute, as further explained below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   6.\n   <em>\n    As a Matter of Due Process, Residents are Entitled to No Greater Rights in the Prescription of Antipsychotic Medications than in Any Other Prescription\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   We see no textual reason for excepting antipsychotic medications from the procedure established in section 1418.8, and no mode of constitutional analysis requires us to read it that way. The same due process safeguards found to be required in the inherently coercive context of involuntary commitments are not required here.

For incapacitated nursing home residents section 1418.8 provides an approximation of informed consent, while for prisoners and MDOs informed consent is disregarded altogether. A higher level of due process scrutiny is self-evidently necessary in that setting. We must examine section 1418.8 as it comes to\n   us, bearing in mind that \" 'due process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.' \" (\n   <em>\n    People v.

The situation here is that of individuals, often elderly and poor, who have been determined by their doctors to lack the capacity to make their own medical decisions, who have no advance directive, no conservator, no surrogate decisionmaker, and no next of kin or other family or friends to speak up for them. As a premise to application of the statute, we will often know nothing about their wishes in the circumstances. Their privacy and self-determination interests,\n   while remaining precious, are somewhat diminished by their very physical and mental condition. The nursing home has a strong and often urgent interest in getting these patients their medications, including antipsychotic medications if necessary to treat a medical condition (and not used for patient control). As described above, the statutory and regulatory framework now in place sets clear limitations on the use of psychotherapeutic drugs. If the Director implements the law as written, the kind of abuse that has been described to us should not occur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   We admit to alarm at the descriptions of rampant abuse of antipsychotic medications that are contained in the amicus curiae briefs filed on behalf of the petitioners, as well as petitioners' somewhat anecdotal evidence submitted to the trial court. We anticipate that the changes we have mandated as a matter of due process-written notice to the resident and at least one additional supportive person, an opportunity to oppose treatment and capacity determinations in the IDT process by mandatory participation of a patient representative, and the opportunity for a judicial decision via judicial remedies authorized by section 1418.8, subdivision (j) -will help to prevent future abuse of antipsychotics in nursing homes. Those changes, together with vigilant enforcement of existing laws and regulations, should offer protection to nursing home patients, while not requiring judicial intervention in every prescription of antipsychotic medication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   <strong>\n    H.

The injunction issued upon an order granting petitioners' request for a writ of mandate on their eighth cause of action, which attacks the use of section 1418.8 \"for treatments or discontinuation thereof\n   <em>\n    which would result in death\n   </em>\n   , such as, but not limited to[,] do not resuscitate, comfort care or discontinuation of treatment, or for POLST orders.\" (Italics added.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   Petitioners contend section 1418.8 must not be used to end the lives of nursing home residents, and to the extent it has been so used, it violates due process and the California constitutional privacy guarantee. ( Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 7.) In 1993, a memo describing the implementation of the relatively new section 1418.8 was written by the Department of Health Services'\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   Licensing and Certification branch and sent to District Administrators throughout the state. The memo included a \"Question and Answer\" sheet which posed, as one potential question, whether section 1418.8 could be used to withdraw or withhold life-sustaining treatment. It then answered the question: \"No. H &amp; S Code, Section 1418.8, authorizes the IDT to make decisions regarding medical interventions.\n   <em>\n    Since withdrawing or withholding life sustaining treatments are not medical interventions, this statute does not authorize the IDT to make these decisions on behalf of residents.\n   </em>\n   \" (Italics added.) But the Director now takes the position, as she did in the superior court, that while section 1418.8 is not designed for decisions to withdraw or withhold life-sustaining treatments, it may be used for some end of life decisions, such as the use of DNR orders directing that medically intrusive and painful resuscitative life-saving procedures not be used, or that terminally ill patients be sent to hospice care.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Director urges us, however, not to reach the merits of the issue because the superior court's order was an advisory opinion, because the review of that order raises issue that are not yet ripe for\n   decision, and because the court improperly attributed actions by nursing homes to state action by the Department. If we reach the merits, the Director urges us to preserve an exception\n   for referral to hospice care, which she argues is not an \"end of life decision.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Justiciability\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   We reject the contention that any review of the superior court's ruling on the use of section 1418.8 for end of life decisionmaking is nonjusticiable on any of the grounds the Director advances. The superior court made specific factual findings about the practices of IDT's in making end of life decisions, and in doing so ruled on a concrete, live controversy that placed in doubt the constitutionality of section 1418.8 and its ongoing applicability-or inapplicability, as the case may be-to thousands of nursing home residents across the state. The test for ripeness requires us to consider not only whether the issue presented is appropriate for judicial resolution, but any hardships that may result if we refuse to decide the issue now. CAHF, as an intervenor in the superior court, estimated that 15 percent of the nursing home residents covered by section 1418.8 (900 to 1,800 residents) currently receive hospice or palliative care through the section 1418.8 process. Even if we thought the issue might be unripe (and we do not), the risk of grave consequences to a significant number of Californians would nevertheless move us to answer the questions posed now.

Section 1418.8 may not be a perfect solution to the difficult and nearly insoluble problem of providing for informed consent to medical treatment on behalf of decisionally incapacitated residents of nursing homes who are without family or friends to speak for them, but it was our Legislature's choice. While petitioners have done much in this case to expose the imperfections of the statutory scheme the Legislature enacted, it is our duty to uphold the challenged statute if it can be done in a manner that is consistent with constitutional imperatives. That is what we have done.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   <strong>\n    V. THE APPROPRIATE FORM OF RELIEF\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   As we read the Superior Court's judgment, it granted a writ of traditional mandate and issued equitable relief in the form\n   of an injunction. That is\n   understandable, since injunctive relief was among the remedies the petitioners requested in their prayer for relief. (First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate, Declaratory Relief and Injunction, filed January 15, 2015, at p. 38, \u00b6 5 [requesting that the court \"[e]njoin [the Department] from permitting the use of Section 1418.8 by all California skilled nursing and intermediate care facilities\"].) They had grounds to do so. Even though \" ' \"[a] traditional writ of mandate under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 is a method for\n   <em>\n    compelling\n   </em>\n   a public entity to perform a legal and usually ministerial duty\" ' \" (\n   <em>\n    Lippman v.

But we have focused instead on petitioners' request for declaratory relief, which is another form of relief that may be issued in a mandamus proceeding. (\n   <em>\n    Leahey v.

Not only is this remedial approach, in our view, more consistent with avoiding invalidation of statutes on constitutional grounds where reasonably possible, but it is also significant that we deal here with matters of administrative enforcement. Because \"[m]andamus will not lie to control an exercise of discretion, i.e., to compel an official to exercise discretion in a particular manner\" (\n   <em>\n    California Hospital Assn. v.

For example, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is not indicated in cases of cardiac or respiratory arrest of certain frail, terminally ill patients where CPR is highly likely to be medically ineffective and to cause broken ribs and other complications for the very small percentage of such individuals who survive the initial arrest.

We agree with the Director that it is not properly so characterized. To the contrary, it is most often a choice in favor of comfort and quality of life over unbearable pain. Essentially, hospice care \"recognizes that the impending death of an individual warrants a change in the focus from curative care to palliative care for relief of pain and for symptom management.\" (Medicare Program, FY 2017 Hospice Wage Index and Payment Rate Update and Hospice Quality Reporting Requirements, 81 Fed.Reg. 52144, 52145 (Aug. 5, 2016) (Medicare Program Update); see 48 Fed.Reg. 56008, 56008 (Dec. 16, 1983).)

These statutes and regulations prohibit transfer to hospice absent two physicians' determinations that the patient is terminally ill with a life expectancy of six months or less.

For such Medicare beneficiaries, hospice care is a benefit under Medicare Part A. (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395d(a)(4).) Under Medicare, however, the patient must be notified of \"the palliative rather than curative nature of hospice care, as it relates to the individual's terminal illness.\" (\n    <extracted-citation index=\"381\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20418.24\">\n     42 C.F.R. \u00a7 418.24\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(2).)
