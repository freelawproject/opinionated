A few objects are inherently deadly weapons. Others, including a box cutter, are deadly weapons only if used in a way that makes them deadly weapons. Here, the trial court erroneously permitted the jury to consider the box cutter an inherently deadly weapon. It presented the jury with two possible theories of guilt: (1) that the box cutter was inherently deadly, and (2) that defendant used the box cutter in a deadly way. The first of these theories was erroneous under the facts. A box cutter is, as a matter of law, not inherently deadly. The second theory was correct. We must decide what standard of review applies to this error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We conclude the usual \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" standard of review established in\n   <em>\n    Chapman v.

On this record, applying this standard, we conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the error\n   was harmless.

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court of Appeal opinion summarized the facts. \"In October 2016, defendant approached a woman working at a lunch truck parked in downtown Los Angeles. He told her that he found her attractive and asked her for her phone number; she declined, explaining that she was married with children. On October 22, 2016, defendant approached the woman's husband, who owned the food truck. Defendant asked, 'Where's your wife?' Defendant then told the man that he wanted to 'fuck' his wife because she was 'very hot' and 'had a big ass and all of that.' When the man turned away to remove his apron, defendant pulled a box cutter out of his pocket and extended the blade; from three or four feet away, defendant thrust the blade at the man at waist level, saying, 'I'll kill you.' Two nearby police officers on horses intervened and arrested defendant.\" (\n   <em>\n    People v.

(\u00a7 12022, subd. (b)(1).) The case went to a jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The court instructed the jury that, for the assault charge, the People had to prove the following: \"The defendant did an act with a deadly weapon other than a firearm that by\n   its nature would directly and probably result in the application of force to say [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] person; the defendant did that act willfully; when the defendant acted, he was aware of facts that would lead a reasonable person to realize that his act by its nature would directly and probably result in the application of force to someone; and when the defendant acted, he had the present ability to apply force with a deadly weapon other than a firearm to a person.\" (See CALCRIM No. 875.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The court defined \"a deadly weapon\" as \"any object, instrument, or weapon that is inherently deadly or one that is used in such a way that it is capable of causing and likely to cause death or ... great bodily injury.\" (See CALCRIM No. 875.) Regarding the weapon enhancement, the court instructed that \"a deadly or dangerous weapon is any object, instrument, or weapon that is inherently dangerous, ... or one that is used in such a way that it is capable of causing or likely to cause death or great bodily injury. In\n   deciding whether an object is a deadly weapon, consider all of the surrounding circumstances including when and where the object was possessed and any other evidence that indicates whether the object would be used for a dangerous rather than a harmless purpose.\" (See CALCRIM No. 3145.) The court did not define what \"inherently\" deadly or dangerous meant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In his opening argument to the jury, the prosecutor argued that the box cutter was a \"deadly weapon\" because \"[i]f used in a way to cause harm, it would cause harm.\" Emphasizing the word \"probably,\" defense counsel argued that defendant's act would not probably result in the application of force to the victim. Defense counsel did not specifically discuss whether the box cutter was a deadly weapon. In his closing argument, the prosecutor argued that the box cutter was an \"inherently deadly weapon,\" noting that \"you wouldn't want your children playing with\" it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The jury convicted defendant of both counts and found the weapon allegation true. The court sentenced defendant to prison, and he appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Court of Appeal affirmed the conviction for making a criminal threat. But it reversed the conviction of assault with a deadly weapon and the true finding on the weapon allegation. It found that the trial court erroneously permitted the jury to find the box cutter to be an inherently deadly weapon. It believed the error required it to reverse the conviction \" 'absent a basis in the record to find that the verdict was actually based on a valid ground,' \" which \"exists only when the jury has '\n   <em>\n    actually\n   </em>\n   ' relied upon the valid theory.\" (\n   <em>\n    Aledamat\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 20 Cal.App.5th at p. 1153,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514288\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/229/771/#p1151\">\n    229 Cal.Rptr.3d 771\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)

In both\n   <em>\n    Chiu\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   , we examined the record and found that it affirmatively showed the jury might have based its verdict on the invalid theory.

It is clear the error did not contribute to the verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The argument that the error was prejudicial supposes that, under the instructions, the jury would believe there were two separate ways it could find the box cutter to have been a deadly weapon. The first method would be simply to find it was inherently deadly without considering any of the surrounding circumstances. The second method would be to consider how defendant used it. Technically, this is correct. The court used the disjunctive \"or,\" which, out of context, would seem to permit such separation. In context, however, it is unlikely the jury would so view the instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The instruction referred to an object that is \"inherently deadly or one that is used in such a way that it is capable of causing and likely to cause death\n   or ... great bodily injury.\" This juxtaposition at\n   least indicates what the \"inherently deadly\" language was driving at. Additionally, the jury was also instructed: \"In deciding whether an object is a deadly weapon, consider all of the surrounding circumstances including when and where the object was possessed and any other evidence that indicates whether the object would be used for a dangerous rather than a harmless purpose.\" This part of the instruction suggested the question was unitary, that is, that the jury had to consider all of the circumstances in deciding whether the object was a deadly weapon,\n   <em>\n    either\n   </em>\n   inherently\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   as used. The jury would likely view the \"inherently deadly\" language in light of this additional instruction that it had to consider all of the circumstances. Given this additional instruction, it seems unlikely the jury would simply view the box cutter as inherently deadly without considering the circumstances, including how defendant used it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The arguments of counsel support this conclusion. At one point, the prosecutor stated that the box cutter was inherently deadly because \"you wouldn't want your children playing with\" it, without further explaining the term. But no one ever suggested to the jury that there were two separate ways it could decide whether the box cutter was a deadly weapon. Defense counsel argued that defendant did not use the box cutter in a way that would probably result in the application of force, that is, that defendant did not assault the victim at all-an argument the jury necessarily rejected when it found defendant guilty of that crime. But counsel never argued that, if he did assault the victim with the box cutter, the box cutter was not a\n   deadly weapon. Although defense counsel did not expressly concede that the box cutter was a deadly weapon, he did not contest the point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Contesting the point would have been futile based on the record here. A box cutter is not inherently deadly because it is not\n   <em>\n    designed\n   </em>\n   for that purpose. But if used to assault someone, i.e., used as a\n   <em>\n    weapon\n   </em>\n   , a box cutter\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   potentially deadly even if not designed for that purpose.

Counsel could readily believe it would be pointless for him to argue that even if (contrary to the argument counsel did make) the jury found defendant assaulted the victim with the box cutter, it was not a deadly weapon. This is particularly so in light of defendant's statement, \"I'll kill you.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   A nonexclusive way the error can be found harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, one that \"work[ed] well\" in\n   <em>\n    Chun\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 45 Cal.4th at page 1205,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=91%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20106\">\n    91 Cal.Rptr.3d 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=203%20P.3d%20425\">\n    203 P.3d 425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and\n   that also works well here, is the test derived from Justice Scalia's concurring opinion in\n   <em>\n    California v.

Here, under the instructions, the jury necessarily found the following: (1) defendant did an act with a deadly weapon (either inherently or as used) that by its nature would directly and probably result in the application of force; (2) defendant was aware of facts that would lead a reasonable person to realize\n   that his act by its nature would directly and probably result in the application of force to someone; and (3) defendant had the present ability to apply force with a deadly weapon to a person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Additionally, the jury must have considered the term \"inherently deadly\" to mean\n   <em>\n    something\n   </em>\n   . As the\n   <em>\n    Stutelberg\n   </em>\n   court explained, the theoretical risk is that, because the court did not define the term, the jury might have applied its common understanding to find the box cutter deadly because it is sharp and used for cutting.

The Instructions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   As this case demonstrates, the standard instructions on assault with a deadly weapon and use of a deadly and dangerous weapon are problematic. (See CALCRIM Nos. 875, 3145.) They do not define what is an inherently deadly weapon. Worse, without modification, they provide the jury with the \"inherently deadly\" theory even in those cases (i.e., most of them) in which the weapon is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   inherently deadly as a matter of law. We suggest the instructions be modified to avoid these problems in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In most cases, the inherently deadly language is inapplicable, for most objects are not inherently deadly even if they may be used in a way that\n   makes them deadly. The inherently deadly language is also generally unnecessary. For the most part, those objects that are designed for use as a deadly\n   weapon will be also used in a way that makes them deadly weapons.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the standard instruction might be improved by simply deleting any reference in the usual case to inherently deadly weapons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   But because, under current law, some objects, such as dirks and blackjacks,\n   <em>\n    are\n   </em>\n   inherently deadly, instructing on that theory might be appropriate in some cases. (But see fn. 5.) If the prosecution believes the weapon used in a given case is inherently deadly, and it believes modifying the instruction would be useful, it may request the court to add that theory of the case to the instructions. On such a request, the court should consider whether the evidence would support a finding that the weapon is inherently deadly. If so, the court would have discretion to instruct on that theory. If it does so, however, it should also define what is meant by inherently deadly, i.e., an object that is\n   <em>\n    designed\n   </em>\n   for use as a deadly weapon. (See\n   <em>\n    People v.

Justice Cu\u00e9llar's concurring and dissenting opinion carefully explains why we cannot be confident beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury in this case found the box cutter to be a deadly\n   weapon on a valid legal theory. In particular, the trial court's own equivocation and the prosecutor's repeated conflation of the deadly-weapon and force requirements in closing argument could well have misled the jury. (Conc. &amp; dis. opn. of Cu\u00e9llar, J.,\n   <em>\n    post\n   </em>\n   , 251 Cal.Rptr.3d at pp. 388-389, 447 P.3d at pp. 292-293.) Because of these confusing statements, and because the trial court erred in providing the \"inherently deadly\" instruction to the jury, the jury may have convicted defendant for conduct that does not constitute the crime of assault with a deadly weapon. Although the jury \"must have considered the term 'inherently deadly' to mean\n   <em>\n    something\n   </em>\n   \" (maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , 251 Cal.Rptr.3d at p. 384, 447 P.3d at p. 288), it is quite possible that the jury understood \"inherently deadly\" to mean that the box cutter itself was readily capable of causing deadly harm, without finding that defendant in fact used the box cutter in a manner likely to cause death or great bodily injury. Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Concurring and Dissenting Opinion by Justice Cu\u00e9llar\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In our constitutional system the right to trial by jury means \"the jury, rather than the judge, reach[es] the requisite finding of 'guilty.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Sullivan v.

Because virtually all forms of harmless error review risk infringing on \"the jury's factfinding role and affect[ing] the jury's deliberative process in ways that are, strictly speaking, not readily calculable,\" courts performing harmless error review are walking a tightrope - where they must weigh how an error affected the proceedings without displacing the jury as finder of fact.

The result, unfortunately, is an error of our own -- one hardly harmless to the defendant in this case. With respect, I dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   To find Yazan Aledamat guilty of assault with a deadly weapon, the jury had to decide not only that he had the box cutter in his hand, but that he used it as a deadly weapon. The trial judge issued form instructions from CALCRIM No. 875, which provides that the prosecution must prove:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   (1) that the defendant did an act with a deadly weapon other than a firearm that by its nature would directly and probably result in the application of force to a person;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   (2) that the defendant did that act willfully;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   (3) that when the defendant acted, he was aware of facts that would lead a reasonable person to realize that his act by its nature would directly and probably result in the application of force to someone; and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   (4) that when the defendant acted, he had the present ability to apply force with a deadly weapon other than a firearm. ( CALCRIM No. 875.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Here's what's also covered by those jury instructions: to \"apply force\" means \"to touch in a harmful or offensive manner,\" which can include \"the slightest touching\" if done in a rude or angry way. As long as\n   the prosecution can prove the defendant's act would\n   <em>\n    probably\n   </em>\n   result in the application of force, it is not required to prove \"that the defendant actually touched someone.\" (\n   CALCRIM No. 875\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   ) A deadly weapon other than a firearm, moreover, \"is any object, instrument, or weapon that is inherently deadly or one that is used in such a way that it is capable of causing and likely to cause death or great bodily injury.\" (\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   ) Great bodily injury, in turn, \"means\n   significant or substantial physical injury. It is injury that is greater than minor or moderate harm.\" (\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Presented to the jury during trial, these instructions permit the jury to conclude a box cutter can be a deadly weapon. But to reach that conclusion, a jury must find the box cutter is either \"inherently deadly\" or was \"used in such a way that it is capable of causing and likely to cause death or great bodily injury.\" ( CALCRIM No. 875.) Yet as the majority explains, this instruction is incorrect, at least in this case: as a matter of law, a box cutter is not inherently deadly. (Maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , 251 Cal.Rptr.3d at p. 376, 447 P.3d at pp. 281-282.) It is, however, capable of causing death or great bodily injury and, depending on how it is used, may even be\n   <em>\n    likely\n   </em>\n   to cause death or great bodily injury. (\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   ) So for a proper conviction of assault with a deadly weapon on these facts, the jury would have needed to rely on the second prong of the deadly weapon definition - the legally valid theory in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The majority plays up that there's more than \"one way\" (maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , 251 Cal.Rptr.3d at pp. 382, 383-384, 447 P.3d at pp. 286-287, 288) a reviewing court can conclude \" 'beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not contribute to the verdict' \" (\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at p. 382, 447 P.3d at p. 286, quoting\n   <em>\n    Chun\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 45 Cal.4th at p. 1201,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"220\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=91%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20106\">\n    91 Cal.Rptr.3d 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=203%20P.3d%20425\">\n    203 P.3d 425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

Indeed, its primary quarrel is with the very notion that the instruction was error, let alone prejudicial error. (Maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , 251 Cal.Rptr.3d at pp. 382-383, 447 P.3d at p. 287.) It argues, in essence, that the jury \"likely\" understood the term \"inherently deadly\" to mean something approximating the correct instruction - \"capable of and likely to\n   cause great bodily injury.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 382, 383, 447 P.3d at pp. 287, 287.) That is, a jury is \"unlikely\" to find the disjunctive \"or\" - \"inherently\n   deadly\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   ... capable of causing and likely to cause\" great bodily injury ( CALCRIM No. 875, italics added) - to present two alternatives. (Maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , 251 Cal.Rptr.3d at pp. 382-383, 447 P.3d at pp. 287-288.) Instead, the majority says, the jury will understand \"inherently deadly\" to be defined by the words surrounding it, notwithstanding the disjunctive. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 382-383, 447 P.3d at p. 287 [explaining the \"juxtaposition\" of the words \"at least indicates what the 'inherently deadly' language was driving at\"];\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 384, 447 P.3d at p. 288 [\"[T]he jury must have considered the term 'inherently deadly' to mean\n   <em>\n    something\n   </em>\n   \"].) In other words, if the jury doesn't understand that \"inherently deadly\" is a shortcut, it will hold the prosecution to roughly the same standard that the correct instruction does.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Three problems mar this argument. First, it is pure conjecture. Nothing in the record\n   suggests, let alone compels us to conclude, that the jury read the instructions in the way the majority speculates. It is just as likely - and more consistent with principles of English usage - that the \"juxtaposition\" of two disjunctive clauses suggests just that (maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , 251 Cal.Rptr.3d at pp. 382-383, 447 P.3d at p. 287): They are juxtaposed because they are distinct. One does not define the other, in whole or in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Second, the argument is at odds with the majority's characterization of the instructions as \"problematic\" and its suggestion that they be \"modified to avoid these problems in the future.\" (Maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , 251 Cal.Rptr.3d at p. 384, 447 P.3d at p. 288.) Why alter anything if, as the majority implies, jurors can more or less figure it out on their own? (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 384, 447 P.3d at p. 288 [citing\n   <em>\n    People v.

(Indeed, jurors can guess approximate meanings for most legal principles and elements, from robbery to \"deadly weapon\"; I imagine the majority would not suggest we dispense with those instructions out of an abiding belief that common sense will suffice.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Third - and perhaps most importantly - in this case there is evidence not only that the jury may have misunderstood the task before it, but that it was affirmatively (though inadvertently) misled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The confusion began when the judge instructed the jury on the elements. On beginning to read the definition of great bodily injury - and before reaching the definition of a deadly weapon - the judge stopped, said the jury \"[didn't] need that definition\" and asked the jury to cross it out. The jurors affirmed that they had crossed out the definition. Moving on to the deadly weapon instruction, the judge realized the definition of \"great bodily injury\" was relevant. He stopped, had a short exchange on the record with counsel,\n   told the jury to ignore their earlier strike-through of the definition - \"And despite the fact I told you to cross it out, I [now] want you to consider it. Okay? If you want to write it in, you can.\" - and allowed the jury a brief break. He then recited the criminal threat instructions without revisiting the remainder of the deadly weapon instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The majority highlights a feature of the jury instructions. The jury was instructed to consider \"all of the surrounding circumstances\" in deciding whether an object is a deadly weapon - \" 'including when and where the object was possessed and any other evidence that indicates whether the object would be used for a dangerous rather than a harmless purpose.' \" (Maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , 251 Cal.Rptr.3d at p. 383, 447 P.3d at p. 287.) \"Given this additional instruction,\" the majority writes, \"it seems unlikely the jury would simply view the box cutter as\n   inherently deadly without considering the circumstances, including how the defendant used it.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 383, 447 P.3d at p. 287.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   But the additional instruction didn't apply to the assault charge. The judge read it in instructing the jury on the deadly weapon enhancement, and expressly said it became relevant only if the jury \"[found] the defendant guilty of the crimes charged in counts 1 and 2.\" What's more, during deliberations the jury asked the court \"how to deal with the issue of the allegation, the deadly or dangerous weapon allegation.\" It is far from obvious that the jury understood its obligation to make a finding on the deadliness of the box cutter. (See\n   <em>\n    Canizales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 7 Cal.5th at p. 617,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515645\" index=\"231\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/248/370/#p616\">\n    248 Cal.Rptr.3d 370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515645\" index=\"232\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/248/370/#p616\">\n    442 P.3d 686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [noting that the jury requested a readback of testimony that \"suggests the jurors at one point were focused on testimony that would have supported the [defense] theory\"].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   There's more. In closing arguments the prosecutor exacerbated this confusion, suggesting that the mere existence of the box cutter was sufficient to satisfy the deadly weapon allegation: \"You don't have to actually inflict injury on the person. What [Aledamat] did was sufficient; he committed a crime, a crime of assault with a deadly weapon.\n   <em>\n    And the added allegation is that he used a box cutter\n   </em>\n   .\" (Italics added.) She then conflated the deadly weapon and force requirements, saying, \"Ladies and gentlemen, you wouldn't want your children using a box cutter, would you? This is a deadly weapon. If\n   used in a way to cause harm, it would cause harm. It's not whether he did cause harm; it's could he; could he have caused harm with that box cutter? The answer: Absolutely.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   That statement is wrong. Mangling the recitation of the applicable deadly weapon instruction, the prosecutor's statement confuses the minimal force requirement with the requirement that Aledamat have used the box cutter in a way \"likely to cause death or great bodily injury.\" ( CALCRIM No. 875.) Nevertheless, the majority charges that defense counsel failed to \"contest the\n   point\" (maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , 251 Cal.Rptr.3d at p. 383, 447 P.3d at pp. 287-288) - seemingly recognizing that\n   <em>\n    Neder\n   </em>\n   compels an inquiry of whether the mistaken instruction was contested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   True: We and the United States Supreme Court have said that \"removing an element of the crime from the jury's consideration\" can be harmless \"where the defendant concedes or admits that element.\" (\n   <em>\n    People v.

That burden \"is not relieved by a defendant's tactical decision not to contest an essential element of the offense.\" (\n   <em>\n    Estelle v.

Moreover still, where the defense contested Aledamat's slightest application of force, it defies logic that the defense would not also contest an element predicated - at least in this case - on an even greater application of force. It is at the very least inconsistent with what we have previously required. (See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Merritt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 2 Cal.5th at p. 824,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513450\" index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/216/265/\">\n    216 Cal.Rptr.3d 265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513450\" index=\"247\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/216/265/\">\n    392 P.3d 421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [finding the defense conceded that a robbery occurred when counsel\n   said there was \"no question these people were robbed, okay.

It's by definition the reason this law was created\n   </em>\n   .\" (Italics added.) By that time, there was no opportunity for defense counsel to \"contest\" the point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   It's quite plausible that the jury took the prosecutor at her parting words: the box cutter is \"inherently a deadly weapon\" and \"by definition the reason this law\" - assault with a deadly weapon - \"was created.\" The majority all but acknowledges the only possible understanding of these words, noting that \"no one ever suggested to the jury that there were two separate ways it could decide whether the box cutter was a deadly weapon.\" (Maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , 251 Cal.Rptr.3d at p. 383, 447 P.3d at p. 287.) That's true. The prosecutor suggested only one method of finding the\n   box cutter was a deadly weapon, and that method was incorrect as a matter of law. That the defense spent so little time discussing the element - which, again, was not its burden to disprove - further risked letting the case pivot on the prosecutor's easy reassurance that \"inherently deadly\" was, in essence, just a matter of common sense - what objects you wouldn't let your children play with.

We further held that \"the extent of actual injury or lack of injury\" is relevant, in that it may \"suggest that the nature of the object or the way it was used was not capable of producing or likely to produce death or serious harm.\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515156\" index=\"279\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/241/543/\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Against that backdrop, here is what the jury heard in Aledamat's trial: Aledamat approached a food truck in downtown Los Angeles and made crude remarks about the truck owner's wife. The owner, standing on the sidewalk, reacted in shock, and removed his apron. From approximately three or four feet away, Aledamat took a step back, pulled from his right pocket a box cutter, blade extended - how far it extended, how large it was, or whether it was locked in its casing, no one explained - and \"thrust\" or \"pointed\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   it from his waist towards the owner, saying, \"I'll kill you.\" It was clear that Aledamat had moved his arm toward the truck owner. But there was no indication that Aledamat jabbed the box cutter at the owner, or that he flailed his arms around or advanced as though to cut him. Naturally, the owner jerked back. The jury heard nothing about what the owner was wearing or how close the box cutter actually got to his clothing or body. The box cutter did not touch him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   A police officer approached on horse and noticed Aledamat was holding the box cutter in his right hand \"in a forward direction, about waistline.\" The officer said Aledamat was not lunging; he was \"just holding\" the box cutter. When Aledamat saw the officer, he retracted the box cutter and placed it back in his pocket. The truck\n   owner reported to the police that Aledamat had \"pulled a knife\" on him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   On these facts, it may well have been reasonable for the jury to convict Aledamat of using the box cutter in a way \"capable of causing and likely to cause death or great bodily injury,\" where \"great bodily injury,\" in turn, is\n   \"significant or substantial.\" ( CALCRIM No. 875.) Aledamat did, after all, say, \"I'll kill you\" while wielding a sharp blade. But \"our task in analyzing the prejudice from the instructional error is [to determine] whether any rational fact finder\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   have come to the\n   <em>\n    opposite\n   </em>\n   conclusion.\" (\n   <em>\n    Mil\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   53 Cal.4th at p. 418,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"280\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=135%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20339\">\n    135 Cal.Rptr.3d 339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"281\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=266%20P.3d%201030\">\n    266 P.3d 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , first italics added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Even a brief survey of the evidence presented at trial reveals that the answer is yes. The People admitted in rebuttal that Aledamat had not \"lunged\" at the victim; he had \"thrust\" the box cutter out from his waist from a distance of several feet. (Cf.\n   <em>\n    B.M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 6 Cal.5th at p. 536,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515156\" index=\"282\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/241/543/\">\n    241 Cal.Rptr.3d 543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515156\" index=\"283\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/241/543/\">\n    431 P.3d 1180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [defendant used the knife only on the victim's legs, which were covered in a blanket, and did not attempt to use the knife on any exposed or vulnerable part of the victim's body].) The jury received no information about how far the blade was extended, whether the blade was locked - such that it would have stayed protruded had it made contact with the victim - or whether, at the time, it was spring-operated to snap back into its casing. (Cf.\n   <em>\n    People v.
