J.\n </opinion>\n <p id=\"p-22\">\n  This case concerns the relationship between prosecutors' constitutional duty to disclose\n  information to criminal defendants and a statutory scheme that restricts prosecutors' access to some of that information.\n  A prosecutor in a criminal case must disclose to the defense certain evidence that is favorable to the accused.\n  (\n  <em>\n   Brady v. Maryland\n  </em>\n  (1963)\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n   373 U.S. 83\n  </extracted-citation>\n  ,\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n   83 S.Ct. 1194\n  </extracted-citation>\n  ,\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n   10 L.Ed.2d 215\n  </extracted-citation>\n  (\n  <em>\n   Brady\n  </em>\n  ).) This duty sometimes requires disclosure of evidence that will impeach a law enforcement officer's testimony. (\n  <em>\n   Giglio v. United States\n  </em>\n  (1972)\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11721534\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/405/150/#p154\">\n   405 U.S. 150\n  </extracted-citation>\n  , 154-155,\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11721534\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/405/150/#p154\">\n   92 S.Ct. 763\n  </extracted-citation>\n  ,\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11721534\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/405/150/#p154\">\n   31 L.Ed.2d 104\n  </extracted-citation>\n  (\n  <em>\n   Giglio\n  </em>\n  ).) Such disclosure may be required even if the prosecutor is not personally aware that the evidence exists. (\n  <em>\n   Kyles v. Whitley\n  </em>\n  (1995)\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339057\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/419/#p437\">\n   514 U.S. 419\n  </extracted-citation>\n  , 437,\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339057\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/419/#p437\">\n   115 S.Ct. 1555\n  </extracted-citation>\n  ,\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339057\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/419/#p437\">\n   131 L.Ed.2d 490\n  </extracted-citation>\n  (\n  <em>\n   Kyles\n  </em>\n  ).) Because the duty to disclose may sweep more broadly than the prosecutor's personal knowledge, the duty carries with it an obligation to \"learn of any favorable evidence known to the others acting on the government's behalf in the case, including the police.\" (\n  <em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339057\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/419/#p437\">\n    Ibid.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </em>\n  )\n </p>\n <opinion id=\"p-23\">\n  The so-called\n  <em>\n   Pitchess\n  </em>\n  statutes, however, restrict a prosecutor's ability to learn of and disclose certain information regarding law enforcement officers. (See\n  <em>\n   Pitchess v.

Most notably, Penal Code section 832.7 renders confidential certain personnel records and records of citizens' complaints, as well as information \"obtained from\" those records. ( Pen. Code, \u00a7 832.7, subd. (a) ( section 832.7(a) ).) Upon a motion showing good cause, a litigant may obtain a court's in camera inspection of the confidential information and, possibly, win the information's disclosure. But the less reason there is to believe that an officer has engaged in misconduct, the harder it is to show good cause.\n </opinion>\n <attorneys id=\"p-24\">\n  In part to address this issue, some law enforcement agencies have created so-called\n  <em>\n   Brady\n  </em>\n  lists. These lists enumerate officers whom the agencies have identified as having potential exculpatory or impeachment information in their personnel files - evidence which may need to be disclosed to the defense under\n  <em>\n   Brady\n  </em>\n  and its progeny. (See\n  <em>\n   Brady\n  </em>\n  ,\n  <em>\n   supra\n  </em>\n  , 373 U.S. at p. 87,\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n   83 S.Ct. 1194\n  </extracted-citation>\n  .) Disclosure of the fact that an officer is on a\n  <em>\n   Brady\n  </em>\n  list both signals that it may be appropriate to file a motion seeking in camera inspection and helps to establish good cause for that inspection. We recently described this\n  <em>\n   Brady\n  </em>\n  -alert practice as \"laudabl[e].\" (\n  <em>\n   Johnson\n  </em>\n  ,\n  <em>\n   supra\n  </em>\n  , 61 Cal.4th at p. 721,\n  <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=206%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20606\">\n   206 Cal.Rptr.3d 606\n  </extracted-citation>\n  ,\n  <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=377%20P.3d%20847\">\n   377 P.3d 847\n  </extracted-citation>\n  .)\n </attorneys>\n <opinion id=\"p-25\">\n  Petitioner in this case is the Association for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs. The Association obtained a preliminary injunction preventing the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department from disclosing the identity of deputies on the Department's\n  <em>\n   Brady\n  </em>\n  list. The injunction included an exception, permitting disclosure to prosecutors when a deputy is a potential witness in a pending prosecution. The Court of Appeal held that the exception is impermissible under the\n  <em>\n   Pitchess\n  </em>\n  statutes. We granted review to decide the following question: \"When a law enforcement\n  agency creates an internal\n  <em>\n   Brady\n  </em>\n  list [citation], and a peace officer on that list is a potential witness in a pending criminal prosecution, may the agency disclose to the prosecution (a) the name and identifying number of the officer and (b) that the officer may have relevant exonerating or impeaching material in [that officer's] confidential personnel file ...?\" We conclude that the\n  <em>\n   Pitchess\n  </em>\n  statutes permit such disclosure.\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The\n    <em>\n     Brady\n    </em>\n    List\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In late 2016, the Association counted among its members approximately 7,800 deputy sheriffs. The Department sent a letter to roughly 300 of those deputies, informing them that a review of \"individual employees' personnel records\" had \"identified potential exculpatory or impeachment\n   information in your personnel file.\" Among other things, the letter served to \"remind\" deputies \"about the existence of this material.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   According to the letter, \"[e]xamples of performance deficiencies\" that qualify as potential\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   material \"include, but are not limited to, founded administrative investigations involving violations of\" any of nearly a dozen sections of the Department's Manual of Policy and Procedures. Those sections concern:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   (1) \"Immoral Conduct\"; (2) \"Bribes, Rewards, Loans, Gifts, Favors\"; (3) \"Misappropriation of Property\"; (4) \"Tampering with Evidence\"; (5) \"False Statements\"; (6) \"Failure to make Statements and/or Making False Statements During Departmental Internal Investigations\"; (7) \"Obstructing an Investigation/Influencing a Witness\"; (8) \"False Information in Records\"; (9) \"Policy of Equality - Discriminatory Harassment\"; (10) \"Unreasonable Force\"; and (11) \"Family Violence.\" Notwithstanding the letter's claim that such violations were mere \"[e]xamples of performance deficiencies\" that might justify inclusion on the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   list, other materials in the record suggest that the letter was only sent to deputies understood to have violated at least one of those enumerated policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The letter further advised deputies that, \"in order to comply with our constitutional obligations,\" the Department is \"required to provide the names of employees with potential exculpatory or impeachment material in their personnel file to the District Attorney and other prosecutorial agencies where the employee may be called as a witness.\" Later correspondence indicated that the deputy's employee number might also be provided. Consistent with that later correspondence, however, the initial letter stressed that \"no portion of an investigation or contents of your file will be turned over to either the prosecution or the defense absent a court order.\" Deputies were also afforded an opportunity to object to their inclusion on the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   list, by informing the\n   Department that \"the deputy did not have a founded administrative investigation finding on one of the above policy violations\" or that \"any such founded investigation had been overturned in a settlement agreement or pursuant to an appeal.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Trial Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As relevant here, the Association filed a petition for writ of mandate and a complaint seeking preliminary and permanent injunctive relief. It sought to prevent the Department from disclosing the identity of deputies on the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   list absent compliance with\n   <em>\n    Pitchess\n   </em>\n   procedures. The Department agreed to postpone disclosure until the court ruled on the request for a preliminary injunction. (\n   <em>\n    Association for Los Angeles Deputy\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sheriffs v.

It agreed with the Association that the identity of peace officers on the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   list was confidential under the\n   <em>\n    Pitchess\n   </em>\n   statutes because the list linked officers to disciplinary action reflected in their personnel records. The court further agreed that\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   did not authorize disclosure of the list at the Department's discretion, unconnected to any criminal case. Over the Association's objection, however, the court ruled that the Department was \"\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   ... enjoined from disclosing the fact that an individual Deputy Sheriff is listed on the Sheriff's Department's 'Brady List' when a\n   criminal prosecution is pending and the Deputy Sheriff at issue is involved in the pending prosecution as a potential witness.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Court of Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Association petitioned the Court of Appeal for a writ of mandate and requested an immediate stay. The court granted the stay request, effectively expanding the trial court's injunction to prevent disclosure of officer identities (outside of the\n   <em>\n    Pitchess\n   </em>\n   process) without regard to whether a prosecution was pending. After issuing an order to show cause, a divided panel of the Court of Appeal granted the writ petition in pertinent part.

Echoing the trial court, the\n   Court of Appeal reasoned that \"[n]otifying an outside agency, even a prosecutor's office, that a deputy has an administratively founded allegation of misconduct ... cannot be characterized as\n   anything other than disclosing information obtained from the peace officer's personnel file.\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513694\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/221/51/#p421\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at p. 435,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513694\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/221/51/#p421\">\n    221 Cal.Rptr.3d 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) The appellate court did not agree, however, that disclosure could be made whenever an officer on the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   list was a potential witness in a pending case. The court thus ordered the trial court \"to strike from the injunction any language\" permitting disclosure of \"the identity of any individual deputy on the ...\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   list to any individual or entity outside the [Department], even if the deputy is a witness in a pending criminal prosecution, absent a properly filed, heard, and granted\n   <em>\n    Pitchess\n   </em>\n   motion, accompanied by a corresponding court order.\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513694\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/221/51/#p421\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at p. 448,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513694\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/221/51/#p421\">\n    221 Cal.Rptr.3d 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Justice Grimes dissented in pertinent part.

As discussed below, these principles point toward two main conclusions. First, the Department's\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   list is confidential to the extent it was derived from confidential records.

The plain text of the amended statute excludes certain information from the confidentiality afforded by section 832.7(a). As amended, subdivision (a) applies \"[e]xcept as provided in subdivision (b).\" Subdivision (b) declares in turn that, \"[n]otwithstanding ... any other law,\" certain \"peace officer or custodial officer personnel records and records maintained by any state or local agency\n   <em>\n    shall not be confidential\n   </em>\n   and shall be made available for public inspection pursuant to the California Public Records Act.\" ( Pen. Code, \u00a7 832.7, subd. (b)(1), italics added.) It follows that if subdivision (b) deems records \"not ... confidential,\" they are not \"confidential\" under subdivision (a). And if records are \"not ... confidential\" because of subdivision (b), it would be nonsensical to conclude that subdivision (a) renders \"information obtained from\" those nonconfidential records \"confidential.\" Thus, if subdivision (b) deems a record nonconfidential, the record, or information obtained from it, is not confidential.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Senate Bill 1421 deems three types of records nonconfidential. First, records \"relating to the report, investigation, or findings\" of an incident in which an officer (i) discharged a firearm at a person or (ii) used force against\n   a person resulting in death or great bodily injury. ( Pen. Code, \u00a7 832.7, subd. (b)(1)(A).) Second, records \"relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency\"\n   that an officer \"engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public.\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=165%20P.3d%20488\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 832.7, subd. (b)(1)(B)(i).) And third, \"[a]ny record relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence.\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=165%20P.3d%20488\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 832.7, subd.

Any portion of a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   list based on these types of records is not confidential, and section 832.7(a) does not restrict dissemination of such information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   It is true that Senate Bill 1421 does not \"affect the discovery or disclosure of information contained in a peace or custodial officer's personnel file pursuant to Section 1043 of the Evidence Code.\" (\n   Pen. Code, \u00a7 832.7, subd. (g).) Nor does it \"supersede or affect the criminal discovery process outlined in Chapter 10 (commencing with [Evidence Code] Section 1054) of Title 6 of Part 2, or the admissibility of personnel records pursuant to subdivision (a), which codifies the court decision in\n   <em>\n    Pitchess v.

It may be that Senate Bill 1421 does not expand the set of information that a criminal defendant is entitled to receive through the\n   <em>\n    Pitchess\n   </em>\n   process, an issue on which we need take no position here. For present purposes, it is enough to say that even if Senate Bill 1421 does not increase the amount of information that a defendant can\n   <em>\n    compel\n   </em>\n   an agency to disclose, the bill, by making certain records nonconfidential, reduces the amount of information that agencies are\n   <em>\n    forbidden\n   </em>\n   from disclosing voluntarily.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   We do not suggest that nonconfidential records must be fully disclosed, at any time, under the California Public Records Act. As amended, Penal Code section 832.7 contemplates that it may be appropriate for an agency to redact records (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=522%20P.2d%20305\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 832.7, subd.

(b)(7) ). Moreover, separate and apart from any confidentiality, Penal Code section 832.7, subdivision (b)(8) instructs that \"[a] record of a civilian complaint, or the investigations, findings, or dispositions of that complaint, shall not be released pursuant to this section if the complaint is frivolous, as defined in Section 128.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure, or if the complaint is unfounded.\" Thus, our conclusion that records described in section 832.7(b) are not \"confidential\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   ( \u00a7 832.7(a) ) does not mean that they are invariably open for public inspection over the agency's objection.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   With this revised statutory scheme in mind, we turn to the question whether the Department's\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   list is confidential.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <em>\n    3. The record does not support a conclusion that the\n   </em>\n   Brady\n   <em>\n    list is nonconfidential\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Putting subdivision (b) aside, there is no serious question that the Department reviewed \"the personnel records of peace officers\" when creating the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   list. ( \u00a7 832.7(a).) The parties do not dispute that the deputies included on the\n   list are \"peace officers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   ) Nor is there any doubt that the Department created its list by reviewing \"the personnel records of\" those officers. (\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   ) The Department's initial letter to deputies explained that they were being contacted because a review of \"personnel records\" \"identified potential exculpatory or impeachment information in your personnel file.\" Later correspondence clarified that deputies were contacted \"due to a prior FOUNDED allegation of misconduct involving the Manual of Policies and Procedures (MPP), i.e.[,] a sustained finding that reflects moral turpitude, untruthfulness, or bias.\" This phrasing appears to refer to the statutory definition of \" '[s]ustained,' \" which \"means a final determination ..., following an investigation ... that the actions of the peace officer or custodial officer were found to violate law or department policy.\" ( Pen. Code, \u00a7 832.8, subd. (b) ; see also\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=522%20P.2d%20305\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 832.8, subd. (c) [\" 'Unfounded' means that an investigation clearly establishes that the allegation is not true\"].) Given this record, we have no reason to doubt that the Department created the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   list by reviewing, at the least, personnel records \"relating to ... [\u00b6] ... [e]mployee ... discipline.\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=522%20P.2d%20305\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 832.8, subd. (a)(4) [defining personnel records].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   This conclusion entails another: The identities of officers on the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   list constitute \"information obtained from\" \"the personnel records of peace officers.\" ( \u00a7 832.7(a).) The\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   list is a catalog of officers with a particular kind of discipline-related information in their personnel file. It was derived from information in those files. It follows that, barring the applicability of an exception, the\n   <em>\n    Pitchess\n   </em>\n   statutes render confidential the identities of officers on the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   list. To\n   hold otherwise would mean that section 832.7(a) affords the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   list no protection at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   An amicus curiae brief contends that the phrase \"information obtained from these records\" ( \u00a7 832.7(a) ) \"could reasonably be interpreted to refer\n   only to information in the records, and not to the mere fact that certain information may exist.\" Thus, the argument continues, the Department's \"generic\" notification that \" 'there may be\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   material in the officer's personnel records,' \" is not a disclosure of \"information obtained from\" the records ( \u00a7 832.7(a) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   We disagree. Based on the Department's explanation of how the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   list at issue in this case was assembled (see\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , pt. I.A), the Department's disclosure that there \"may\" be\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   material in an officer's personnel records is, in effect, a disclosure that the officer\n   <em>\n    has\n   </em>\n   been found to have committed misconduct. This is not a \"generic\" disclosure merely because the misconduct could have been one of several kinds of misconduct, nor because evidence of the misconduct might not be \"material\" within the meaning of\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   in a particular case. (Cf.\n   <em>\n    Copley Press\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   39 Cal.4th at p. 1297,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20183\">\n    48 Cal.Rptr.3d 183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=141%20P.3d%20288\">\n    141 P.3d 288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [ section 832.7(a) \"is designed to protect, among other things, 'the identity of officers' subject to complaints\"].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Moreover, information is no less \"obtained from\" confidential records merely because it is abstracted before it is disclosed. As relevant here, Penal Code Section 832.7, subdivision (d) instructs that, \"notwithstanding\" the confidentiality created by subdivision (a), \"a department or agency that employs peace or custodial officers may disseminate data regarding the number, type, or disposition of complaints (sustained, not sustained, exonerated, or unfounded) made against its officers if that information is in a form which does not identify the individuals involved.\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=141%20P.3d%20288\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 832.7, subd. (d).) This exception would be unnecessary if providing information\n   <em>\n    about\n   </em>\n   confidential records categorically fell outside of the \"information obtained from\" provision. ( \u00a7 832.7(a).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In light of Senate Bill 1421, however, some of the records reviewed by the Department may not be confidential. (See, e.g., Pen. Code, \u00a7 832.7, subd. (b)(1)(C).) If the records are not confidential, then information \"obtained from\" those records is also not confidential. The record on appeal in this case was not developed with Senate Bill 1421 in mind. Given the many grounds that may have given rise to a deputy's inclusion on the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   list, we cannot say that the list was derived entirely from records rendered nonconfidential by Senate Bill 1421.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Nor can we say that a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   list that includes both confidential and\n   nonconfidential information melds into a single, nonconfidential whole. It is true that when a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   list includes both confidential information and nonconfidential information, an officer's presence on the list does not necessarily communicate confidential information about that officer. In such a situation, one cannot infer from the officer's presence on the list that there is impeachment information in the officer's confidential records. (Cf.\n   <em>\n    Long Beach\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 59 Cal.4th at p. 73,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=172%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%2056\">\n    172 Cal.Rptr.3d 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=325%20P.3d%20460\">\n    325 P.3d 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [\"disclosing the names of officers involved in various shootings\" was permissible, as it \"would not imply that those shootings resulted in disciplinary action against the officers, and it would not link those names to any confidential personnel matters or other protected information\"];\n   <em>\n    Commission on POST\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 42 Cal.4th at p. 299,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=64%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20661\">\n    64 Cal.Rptr.3d 661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=165%20P.3d%20462\">\n    165 P.3d 462\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [names and employment dates of officers not confidential, in part because that information \"does not involve the identification of an individual as the officer involved in an incident that was the subject of a complaint or disciplinary investigation\"].) But this argument reflects too narrow a view of the confidentiality afforded by the\n   <em>\n    Pitchess\n   </em>\n   statutes. When a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   list is created based on review of confidential records, information is still unambiguously \"obtained from\" those records. ( \u00a7 832.7(a).) It would be odd indeed to conclude that the Legislature intended to sacrifice the confidentiality of one officer's records\n   merely because the officer was listed alongside others whose records were not confidential.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Further, because this argument focuses on whether someone can infer information about confidential records from the fact that an officer is on the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   list, it appears to require one of two dubious approaches. It could be that disclosure of the fact that an officer is on the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   list is permissible so long as the list is not based entirely on confidential information. That, after all, would be enough to sever the inference that if an officer is on the list, there must be evidence of discipline in the officer's confidential file. But if that is correct, then a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   list may be created based on almost entirely confidential information, plus one officer whose misconduct is not confidential. We doubt the Legislature intended that result. Alternatively, it might be necessary to determine whether there is a sufficient mix of confidential and nonconfidential information such that it is genuinely unclear on what basis an officer was included on the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   list. But that line seems challenging to administer - and, again, unmoored from the statutory text, which concerns \"information obtained from\" confidential records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Because we cannot say that the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   list at issue in this case is entirely nonconfidential,\n   and because partial nonconfidentiality would not strip the remainder of the list of its confidential status, we next consider whether the Department may disclose confidential information on its\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   list to prosecutors.\n   <strong>\n    B. The Department May Share Even Confidential Portions of Its\n    <em>\n     Brady\n    </em>\n    List with Prosecutors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Our conclusion that portions of the Department's\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   list may be confidential raises the further question whether sharing alerts based on such information with prosecutors would be a violation of confidentiality. We conclude that the confidentiality created by the\n   <em>\n    Pitchess\n   </em>\n   statutes does not forbid the limited disclosure to prosecutors at issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <em>\n    1.

Regardless, any limitation on \"disclos[ure]\" raises essentially the same question as deeming information \"confidential\" ( \u00a7 832.7(a) ): With whom, if anyone, may the Department share confidential information?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The statutory text alone provides no clear answer to this question. \"In common usage, confidentiality is not limited to complete anonymity or secrecy.

So, for example, it is hard to imagine that the term \"confidential\" would categorically forbid one employee of a custodian of records, tasked with maintaining personnel files, from sharing those records with another employee assigned to the same task. Put differently, deeming information \"confidential\" creates insiders (with whom information may be shared) and outsiders (with whom sharing information might be an impermissible disclosure). The text of the\n   <em>\n    Pitchess\n   </em>\n   statutes does not clearly indicate that prosecutors are outsiders, forbidden from receiving confidential\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   alerts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Viewing the\n   <em>\n    Pitchess\n   </em>\n   statutes \"against the larger background of the prosecution's [\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   ] obligation\" (\n   <em>\n    Mooc\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 26 Cal.4th at p. 1225,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=114%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20482\">\n    114 Cal.Rptr.2d 482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20P.3d%2021\">\n    36 P.3d 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), we instead conclude that the\n   Department may provide prosecutors with the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   alerts at issue here without violating confidentiality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   There can be no serious doubt that confidential personnel records may contain\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   material. An officer may provide important testimony in a criminal prosecution. Confidential personnel records may cast doubt on that officer's veracity. Such records can constitute material impeachment evidence. (See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Giglio,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11721534\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/405/150/#p154\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , 405 U.S. at pp. 154-155,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11721534\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/405/150/#p154\">\n    92 S.Ct. 763\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)

In this context, construing the\n   <em>\n    Pitchess\n   </em>\n   statutes to cut off the flow of information from law enforcement personnel to prosecutors would be anathema to\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   compliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Indeed, to interpret \"confidential\" as forbidding the sharing of information with prosecutors would do more than forbid the formal\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   list-and-alert practice at issue here. Even without formal procedures, conscientious prosecutors have conferred with law enforcement agencies to identify confidential files that may contain impeachment material. (See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 61 Cal.4th at p. 707,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=206%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20606\">\n    206 Cal.Rptr.3d 606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=377%20P.3d%20847\">\n    377 P.3d 847\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [agency created\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   list in the face of \" 'unnecessary paperwork and personnel costs' \" caused by \" '[r]epetitive requests by the District Attorney that the [Police] Department check employee personnel files of Department employees who may be witnesses\"].) If \"confidential\" prevents formal procedures for sharing information with prosecutors, it prevents informal tips as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Of course, no one suggests that the\n   <em>\n    Pitchess\n   </em>\n   statutes completely prevent prosecutors from accessing confidential personnel records. Section 832.7(a) includes an exception for \"investigations ... concerning the conduct of peace officers or custodial officers ... conducted by ... a district attorney's office,\n   or the Attorney General's office.\" And prosecutors may file\n   <em>\n    Pitchess\n   </em>\n   motions as appropriate. But the \"investigations\" exception ( \u00a7 832.7(a) ) does not apply merely because \"[a] police officer\" is \"a witness in a criminal case\" (\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 61 Cal.4th at p. 714,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=206%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20606\">\n    206 Cal.Rptr.3d 606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=377%20P.3d%20847\">\n    377 P.3d 847\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). And although the showing required for a\n   <em>\n    Pitchess\n   </em>\n   motion to trigger in camera review \"is not high\" (\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , at p. 720,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=206%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20606\">\n    206 Cal.Rptr.3d 606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=377%20P.3d%20847\">\n    377 P.3d 847\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), neither is it imaginary. Without\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   alerts, prosecutors may be unaware that a\n   <em>\n    Pitchess\n   </em>\n   motion should be filed - and such a motion, if filed, may not succeed. Thus, interpreting the\n   <em>\n    Pitchess\n   </em>\n   statutes to prohibit\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   alerts would pose a substantial threat to\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   compliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   It would also put deputies in a precarious position. The Fourteenth Amendment underlying\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   imposes obligations on states and their agents - not just, derivatively, on prosecutors. Law enforcement personnel are required to share\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   material with the prosecution. (See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Carrillo v.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    County of Los Angeles\n   </em>\n   (9th Cir. 2015)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4331866\" index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/798/1210/\">\n    798 F.3d 1210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1219-1223 &amp; fn. 12.) The harder it is for prosecutors to access\n   that material, the greater the need for deputies to volunteer it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The Association's contrary view that \"\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   relates only to the prosecutor\" and that \"\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   ... does not impose obligations on\n   law enforcement\" is distressing and wrong. The prosecution may bear ultimate responsibility for ensuring that necessary disclosures are made to the defense (see\n   <em>\n    In re Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 17 Cal.4th at p. 881,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=72%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20698\">\n    72 Cal.Rptr.2d 698\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=952%20P.2d%20715\">\n    952 P.2d 715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), but that does not mean law enforcement personnel have no role to play. This is not to imply that\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   alerts are a constitutionally required means of ensuring\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   compliance; only that disclosure of\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   material is required, and that\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   alerts help to ensure satisfaction of that requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The Association further disputes that confidential personnel records may contain\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   material. It argues that \"when a law enforcement agency maintains information about a peace officer in [the officer's] personnel file, it is acting in an administrative, not an investigative, capacity, and such information is not within the purview of the prosecutor's duty under\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   .\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   This argument rests on a logical error. To be sure, although the federal Constitution imposes a duty on states to afford defendants a fair trial, a prosecutor is not responsible for disclosing all information known to any part of a state. Instead, if an \"agency ... has no connection to the investigation or prosecution of the criminal charge against the defendant,\" the agency is not part of \"the prosecution team,\" and \"the prosecutor does not have the duty to search for or to disclose\" \"information possessed by [that] agency.\" (\n   <em>\n    In re Steele\n   </em>\n   (2004)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"801068\" index=\"219\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/32/682/#p697\">\n    32 Cal.4th 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 697,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"220\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20536\">\n    10 Cal.Rptr.3d 536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=85%20P.3d%20444\">\n    85 P.3d 444\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) But it does not follow that information in an officer's confidential personnel file categorically falls outside the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   duty to disclose. Even if one assumes\n   that a law enforcement agency is not a member of the prosecution team when acting in its capacity as a custodian of records - a proposition\n   <em>\n    Steele\n   </em>\n   does not establish - it may be that others, who clearly are on the prosecution team, are aware of the existence and content of those records. A prosecutor, for example, may know from a prior\n   <em>\n    Pitchess\n   </em>\n   motion that a confidential file contains\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   information regarding an officer involved in a pending prosecution. Moreover, the correspondence sent to deputies in this case served to \"remind\" them about information in their records, reflecting the fact that an officer will often (if not always) be aware of the contents of the officer's own confidential file. Thus, even assuming that custodians are not necessarily part of the prosecution team, it does not follow that confidential personnel records are categorically unknown to the members of that team.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The Association also suggests that confidential records fall outside the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   duty to disclose because that duty extends only \"to information\n   <em>\n    obtained during\n   </em>\n   an investigation about a criminal matter against a defendant.\" (Italics added.) This, too, is mistaken. What matters for\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   purposes is what the prosecution team knows, not how the prosecution team knows it. Suppose, for example, that a prosecutor is personally aware (based on an earlier case) that a key witness in a pending prosecution is a habitual liar who has been repeatedly convicted of perjury. To say that the prosecutor need not disclose that information\n   merely because it was not \"obtained during\" investigation of the defendant's case would be irreconcilable with the right to a fair trial underlying\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   ; it would \"cast[ ] the prosecutor in the role of an architect of a proceeding that does not comport with standards of justice.\" (\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 373 U.S. at p. 88,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"222\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    83 S.Ct. 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; cf.\n   <em>\n    City of San Jose\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 5 Cal.4th at p. 57,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%2073\">\n    19 Cal.Rptr.2d 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=850%20P.2d%20621\">\n    850 P.2d 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [noting People's concession that\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   required disclosure, to defendants charged with battery on police officers, of the fact that an officer had been disciplined pursuant to a complaint of excessive force].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   To be clear, we do not suggest that permitting\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   alerts completely resolves the tension between\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   and the\n   <em>\n    Pitchess\n   </em>\n   statutes.

This exception indicates that the Legislature considered the range of situations in which prosecutorial need justifies direct access to peace officer personnel records, and it decided that those situations should be limited to 'investigations or proceedings concerning the conduct of peace officers or custodial officers' [citation], and does not extend to this context.\" (\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , at pp. 713-714,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"231\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=206%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20606\">\n    206 Cal.Rptr.3d 606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"232\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=377%20P.3d%20847\">\n    377 P.3d 847\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   We acknowledge the argument that this analysis applies to\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   alerts.\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   alerts communicate information obtained from confidential records. That information, like the underlying records, is \"confidential.\" ( \u00a7 832.7(a).) And nothing in section 832.7(a) - including the investigations exception - explicitly declares that different kinds of confidential information should be treated differently.

(See\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"245\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=377%20P.3d%20847\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at pp. 713-714,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=206%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20606\">\n    206 Cal.Rptr.3d 606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"247\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=377%20P.3d%20847\">\n    377 P.3d 847\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) But an exception aimed at\n   <em>\n    investigations\n   </em>\n   need not imply anything about whether\n   <em>\n    investigators\n   </em>\n   can view confidential material; for example, the exception could concern prosecutors' ability to share information with others when an investigation is ongoing. Moreover, even if the investigations exception does imply that prosecutors lack unlimited access to confidential records during\n   ordinary criminal cases, the exception could be understood to set a floor on prosecutorial access, rather than, as in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , a ceiling. We need not embrace either of these interpretations to conclude that\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   's approach is not compelled by the statutory text - and should not be reflexively extended without considering \"defendants' due process rights.\" (\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , at p. 714,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"248\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=206%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20606\">\n    206 Cal.Rptr.3d 606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"249\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=377%20P.3d%20847\">\n    377 P.3d 847\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In any event, even if the investigations exception is the only basis on which prosecutors may directly access underlying confidential records without a\n   <em>\n    Pitchess\n   </em>\n   motion, it does not follow that the Department is forbidden to transmit the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   alerts at issue in this case. The\n   <em>\n    Pitchess\n   </em>\n   statutes reflect a balance between \"a litigant's discovery interest\" and \"an officer's confidentiality interest.\" (\n   <em>\n    Stiglitz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 60 Cal.4th at p. 639,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"250\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=181%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%201\">\n    181 Cal.Rptr.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"251\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=339%20P.3d%20295\">\n    339 P.3d 295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Although the statutes may shield the fact that an officer has been disciplined from disclosure to the public at large, the mere fact of discipline, disclosed merely to prosecutors, raises less significant privacy concerns than the underlying records at issue in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   For these reasons, we decline to extend\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   's conclusion regarding \"direct access to peace officer personnel records\" to forbid the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   alerts at issue here.

The Department may share this limited information, for the limited purpose of ensuring\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   compliance, with the limited class of persons (i.e., prosecutors) with a particularized need to know. (See\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , pt. III.A.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION AND DISPOSITION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The question presented in this case concerns whether the Department may share confidential\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   alerts with prosecutors. We do not address\n   whether it would violate confidentiality for a prosecutor to share an alert with the defense. (See\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 61 Cal.4th at p. 722,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"254\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=206%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20606\">\n    206 Cal.Rptr.3d 606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"255\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=377%20P.3d%20847\">\n    377 P.3d 847\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) And because this case concerns only\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   alerts, it provides no occasion to revisit whether prosecutors may directly access underlying records, or perhaps a subset of those records. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7 832.8, subd. (a)(4) [\"discipline\"], (5).) To resolve the question presented, it is enough to hold that the Department does not violate section 832.7(a) by sharing with prosecutors the fact that an officer, who is a potential witness in a pending criminal prosecution, may have relevant exonerating or impeaching material in that officer's confidential personnel file.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal and remand the matter for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   We Concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   CHIN, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   CORRIGAN, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   LIU, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   CU\u00c9LLAR, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   KRUGER, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   GROBAN, J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    The Association sought relief against several other individuals or entities, including then-Sheriff Jim McDonnell and the County of Los Angeles.
