The trust was executed without consuming the trust property, and there are no words in the instrument that passes the fee in the property to the trustee on the death of the trustors; nor is there named any person, thing, or use witli sufficient certainty for them or it to take under said instrument the surplus of the property after the execution of the express trust.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-14\">The instrument consists of the following substantial parts:</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-15\">1.

All the rents and proceeds of sale arising from the renting or selling of any of said real estate herein conveyed, after payment of the taxes assessed thereon, insurance premiums, and expenses of management, shall be used by the said party of the second part (Bremond). for the support and maintenance of the said parties of the first part (trustors) during their lives; on the death of either of said parties of the first part, then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>said receipts are to be used for the support and maintenance of the survivor of the said parties of the first part; upon the decease of the survivor of the said parties of the first part, then the said party of the second part, the said Eugene Bremond, is to make such disposition of the real and personal property of herein conveyed to him as there be in his possession, as to him may seem best.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-5\">4. There is then appended as part of the instrument a full power of attorney from them to the trustee to act in the premises, in order, as they say, \u201c to better secure their support and maintenance.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-6\">5. In the next year, 1888, Elizabeth Limerick died, and her husband soon followed her.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-7\">6. Bremond, the trustee, after the death of his trustors, gave away to the Catholic Church in Austin the property which is embraced in this suit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-8\">7. The trustors had no children; appellants being of the collateral blood.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-9\">8. Those who claim to be the heirs of Joseph Limerick bring this suit, and were demurred out of court on the ground that the petition failed to show an interest in the property, because the fee had gone into Eugene Bremond on the making and delivery of writing herein before set out, and which is here subjected to construction by the court.

The trust declared in the instrument was that the rents or proceeds of sale should be applied to support Limerick and wife and the survivor of them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b224-11\">7. The instrument, after declaring the trust, proceeds: \u201cUpon the decease of the said parties of the first part, then the said party of the second part, the said Eugene Bremond, is to make such disposition of the real and personal property herein conveyed to him as then be in his possession as to him may seem best.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b224-13\">8.

They declare against this instrument, and say that it conveys no title to Eugene Bremond, the immediate vendor of appellee.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"AuRM\">Delivered October 19, 1892.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">A demurrer was addressed to the petition, which was sustained by the court, and judgment thereupon rendered, from which this appeal is prosecuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">The evident reason why the court sustained the demurrer was, that it regarded the instrument as a conveyance from Joseph Limerick and his wife to Bremond, and vested the property sued for in him.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">The sole question that we consider is whether the court erred in sustaining the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">We do not think that the instrument is of that uncertain and indefinite character of trust that the courts will decline to give effect to. But we are in doubt as to the meaning and legal effect of the instrument as operative as a conveyance, or whether testamentary \"in character.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">It partakes of the nature of a purchase of the remainder after the life-estate has terminated, and has some of the elements of a conveyance of bargain and sale, and also some of its features suggest that its purpose was testamentary.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">In construing the instrument we are to look to the intention of its makers, and when it is possible such information should be gathered from the face of the instrument; but when the instrument is uncertain in meaning, and its language ambiguous or of doubtful construction, resort should be had to the surrounding facts and circumstances that tend to show the meaning and purpose of the makers in executing the instrument. Evidence for this purpose was admissible under the pleadings, and the meaning of the instrument being doubtful and uncertain, the court should have heard evidence of such facts and circumstances connected with its execution as would tend, not to contradict the terms of the instrument, but to explain its purpose and meaning, in order to arrive at the intent of the makers.
