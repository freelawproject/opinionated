Cross-Examination of Witness. \u2014 A plaintiff testified for himself upon a second trial in an action for personal injuries inflicted by a train running upon him when driving a wagon and crossing the track. He made a materially different statement from that made on the former trial as to the distance the train was from the crossing when he noticed its approach. On cross-examination it was reversible error to refuse the following question: \u201c Have you not made a different statement in your testimony on this trial as to the distance the train was from you when you first saw it, from the statements you made in your testimony on the former trials of this case, by reason of the Supreme Court having reversed the case and you having seen the grounds upon which the case was reversed ?\u201d The witness had admitted having read the opinion of the Supreme Court holding him guilty of contributory negligence upon his own testimony as to the distance the train was from him when he saw it.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b740-14\">2. Verdict \u2014 Personal Injuries. \u2014 In a railway collision plaintiff had his leg broken, thigh and ankle injured, was confined from injuries eleven months in hospital, crutches were necessary for a year longer, and permanent lameness remained. <em>Held, </em>a verdict for $7250 is not excessive.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b740-15\">Appeal from Bexar.

The plaintiff having testified that his statement on this trial was different from his statement on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>former trials of this case as to the distance the train was from him when he first saw it, and having in answer to the question, \u201c Have you read the opinion of the Supreme Court reversing this case?\u201d said, \u201c Yes, I have,\u201d the court erred in not permitting defendant\u2019s counsel to ask the plaintiff the following question: \u201c Have you not made a different statement in your testimony on this trial as to the distance the train was from you when you first saw it, from the statements you made in your testimony on the former trials of this case, by reason of the Supreme Court having reversed the case and you having seen the grounds upon which the case was reversed ? \u2019 \u2019 because said question was legitimate for the purpose of showing plaintiff\u2019s motive in making such different statements, and thereby to discredit his testimony. 39 Am. and Eng.

The effect of such evidence would be to show the motive of appellee in changing his evidence to be that he was not guilty of the act denounced by the Supreme Court as fatal to his right- of recovery. And it would be a legitimate inference that the jury might consider with other facts in the case that his purpose in testifying differently was to make a case that would meet the objections of the decision rendered in reversing the former judgment. It would be also admissible as a fact or circumstance tending to discredit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>the appellee, to be considered by the jury for what it may be worth. We think the evidence was admissible.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"A0o\">Delivered December 21, 1892.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">There is no merit in the remaining assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">The facts of this case are in several essentials different from those developed in the former trial, and we can not say that the evidence shows that appellee was guilty of contributory negligence, and will not disturb the verdict for this reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">As to the\u00b0point that the verdict is excessive, that has been settled adversely to the contention of appellant by the judgment of the Supreme - Court in the first appeal of this case. 72 Texas, 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">For the error in refusing to permit appellant\u2019s counsel to ask the appellee the question as heretofore stated, upon the trial, we reverse the judgment and remand the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
