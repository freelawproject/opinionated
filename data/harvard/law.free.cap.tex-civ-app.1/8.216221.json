The plea plainly sought to vary the written instruments sued on, by proof of parol contemporaneous agreement.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"AP0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Delivered October 11, 1892.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">By those instruments appellant agreed that the railway company would pay the amounts specified in them, and that if the company failed to do so, appellee would.
