Other creditors, by attachment, contested the validity of the assignment. <em>Held, </em>that the fact that the trustee could sell in the usual course of trade does not operate as a fraud upon the creditors not preferred; as it is apparent that a prompt disposition of all the goods would not have satisfied the preferred creditors.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b728-14\">Appeal from McLennan.

Evans, Clark &amp; Bolinger, </em>and <em>John L. Dyer, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AI0\">1. Eaton, Guinan &amp; Co., being bona fide indebted to the persons and firms named in the deed of trust, and intending thereby to secure such creditors in the payment of their debts, had the legal right to secure them by said deed of trust, and this irrespective of the question of the solvency or insolvency of said Eaton, Guinan <em>&amp; </em>Co. at the time of executing said deed of trust. Wagon Works v. Tidball, 59 Texas, 292; Stiles v. Hill, Fontaine &amp; Co., 62 Texas, 429; Jackson v. Harby, 65 Texas, 713; Watterman v. Silberberg, 67 Texas, 101; Haas v. Kraus, 75 Texas, 109; Hudson v. Milling Co., 79 Texas, 404.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b734-7\">2. The provision in the deed of trust conferring the power on the trustee to sell a sufficient amount of the goods in the usual course of trade, for cash, to pay the secured indebtedness, when it is conceded to be a wholesale stock, and when a limit for three months for a sale in such manner is provided for, does not make the deed on its face, and from this circumstance alone, fraudulent as to creditors. Jackson v. Harby, 65 Texas, 714; Haas v. Kraus, 75 Texas, 108.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b734-9\">3. Where a deed of trust secures a conceded valid debt to a creditor or creditors, the fact that a discretionary power is conferred on the trustee by the terms of the instrument as to a sale of the property can not have the effect to delay and hinder other creditors, for the reason the property conveyed is subject to legal process, notwithstanding the deed of trust, upon paying off such bona fide debts secured, and there can be imputed to such transaction no claim that it delays and hinders creditors. In such cases, if the value of the property is greater than the secured debt, and if such secured debt is bona fide, then the property in the hands of the trustee is subject to legal process at once, subject only to the first lien holder\u2019.s rights.

Possession of the property named in the deed of trust from Eaton, Guinan &amp; Co. to John F. Marshall having been taken by said Marshall, for the purpose of paying conceded valid and bona fide claims of said Eaton, Guinan &amp; Co., constituted a pledge of said property in Marshall\u2019s hands for the payment of the debts named in the deed of trust, and therefore said property was not subject to be taken from Marshall\u2019s possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>on plaintiff\u2019s attachment without the payment of said debts for which said property stood pledged.

Marshall, on a stock of goods, wares, and merchandise, and said firm and its members being at the time of the execution and delivery of said deed wholly insolvent, and having no other property out of which plaintiffs could make their debts, and said deed of trust providing that said Marshall should sell said goods in the usual course of trade for three months, and until requested in writing by a majority in interest of the creditors secured by the deed of trust, and it not appearing that said creditors or any of them ever accepted said deed of trust, the same was void, because, in connection with the uncontroverted facts, the effect of the same was to hinder, delay, and defraud their creditors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>It is apparent that John F. Marshall, the trustee, accepted the terms of the trust, and in the absence of a repudiation of its terms by the beneficiaries, his acceptance will enure to their benefit. Bew. on Assign., 5 ed., 400, 401, 402; 1 Jones on Mort., 4 ed., sec. 88; Wallis v. Beauchamp, 15 Texas, 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">The main question in the case presented by appellant is, that as the deed of trust requires the trustee to sell the merchandise in the usual course of trade, its effect is to hinder, delay, and defraud other creditors, and for this reason the instrument, upon its face, should be held void, taken in connection with the fact that Eaton, Guinan <em>&amp; </em>Co. were insolvent at the time of its execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">It is a well established principle of law that a debtor in failing circumstances may secure and prefer \u00e1 bona fide debt of his creditors, although the effect of such preference would be to hinder and delay other creditors. The limitation imposed by law upon this right prevents the debtor from transferring to the creditor more property than is reasonably sufficient to satisfy the debt, and denies the creditor the right to give the debtor a moneyed consideration for the property in addition to his debt. In such cases, and in others that may be mentioned, the effect of such transactions would be to give the creditor the right to control and dispose of property not necessary to the payment of his debt, and to place the debtor in a position to hinder, delay, and defraud his creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">The court can not determine from the face of the instrument that it will have the effect of defrauding other creditors. That can only be ascertained from the facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-9\">If it be true that the debtor has transferred to the trustee all of his property for the benefit of the preferred creditors, and the property is less in value than the debts secured, and the instrument permits a sale in due course of trade or otherwise, we fail to see how such fact is calculated to hinder and delay and defraud other creditors. It is true that the effect of such a transaction would be to hinder and delay, and possibly defeat, the claims of the unsecured creditors; but this is successfully answered by the law permitting an insolvent debtor to prefer a creditor when no advantage or benefit results to the debtor by such transaction, or the creditor gets no more than his debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-10\">In appellant\u2019s assignment of error it is admitted that \u201cEaton, Guinan 6 Co., and each and all the members thereof, were at the time of making said deed of trust wholly insolvent, and had no other property than that levied upon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-12\">It is seen from the facts that the value of the property as levied upon by the writs of attachment in the several cases mentioned in the findings of fact is much less than the amount of the debts secured by the terms of the deed of trust. Under the facts, we do not see how the fact that the trustee can sell in the usual course of trade operates as a fraud upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>appellant, as it is apparent that a disposition of all of the goods is not sufficient to satisfy the claims of the preferred creditors.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"AhO\">Delivered December 14, 1892.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">We find no error in the record, and affirm the judgment of the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">Motion for rehearing refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
