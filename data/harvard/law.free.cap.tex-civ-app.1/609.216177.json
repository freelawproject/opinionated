Russell was vitalized as a grant and made binding on the State from the issuance thereof. Gen. Laws 1883, p. 38; Bates v. Bacon, 66 Texas, 348; Blum v.

That this certificate was located on the land in controversy and patent was issued to said Russell on the 20th day of September, 1873. Appellants\u2019 petition also showed that said William J. Russell died on the 5th day of November, 1881, and that they are his heirs, and they seek to recover of defendants, who are alleged to be trespassers, the land so patented.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"Agj\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>Delivered December 13, 1892.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">The court below sustained a general demurrer to appellants\u2019 petition, holding, as we infer from the briefs of counsel, that the land having been patented to William J. Russell himself, and he being dead at the time of the passage of the Act of 1883, his heirs would have no claim to the land under said act. As an original proposition, the proper construction of this act would present questions of considerable difficulty; but since the decision of this case in the court below our Supreme Court has fully construed this statute, and, as we think correctly, held in such cases the heirs would be entitled to the land. Ralston v. Skerrett, 82 Texas, 486; also opinion of Commission of Appeals in same case, 17 S. W. Rep., 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">The judgment of the court below will therefore be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
