Four other men,\n   including Latrele Neal, were also in Ellison's car. Before the car came to a stop in the driveway, an SUV driven by Jesse Cornejo slowly drove past Ellison's house; the SUV's front and backseat passengers, Adam Cornejo and Isaac Vasquez, opened fire on Ellison's car.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Neal managed to return fire with Ellison's gun before the SUV drove away. About 20 bullets were exchanged between the vehicles. Bullets also struck Ellison's house. Ellison was the only casualty. After crashing the SUV while being pursued\n   by law enforcement, Adam, Jesse, and Isaac were taken into custody a short time later. Each was a Norte\u00f1o gang member. Isaac was 16 years old with a developmental disability; Adam and Jesse were 17 and 18 years old, respectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Adam, Jesse, and Isaac were tried together and convicted by jury of one count of second-degree murder (Pen.Code, \u00a7 187, Count One),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   four counts of attempted murder (\u00a7\u00a7 664/187, Counts Two, Three, Four, and Five), and one count of shooting at an inhabited dwelling (\u00a7 246, Count Six). Jesse was also convicted of one count of driving in willful or wanton disregard for safety while fleeing from a pursuing peace officer. (Veh.Code, \u00a7 2800.2, subd. (a), Count Seven.) With respect to the murder, the jury found the offense was committed by means of shooting a firearm from a motor vehicle at another person outside the vehicle with the intent to inflict great bodily injury. (\u00a7 190, subd. (d).) The jury also found the crimes were committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal street gang with the specific intent to promote, further, or assist in any criminal conduct by gang members. (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b).) Various firearm enhancement allegations were also found to be true. (\u00a7\u00a7 12022.53, subds. (c), (d), (e)(1), 12022.5, subd. (a).) The trial court sentenced Adam and Isaac to serve an aggregate indeterminate prison term of 120 years to life plus a consecutive determinate term of 9 years 4 months. Jesse was sentenced to serve the same indeterminate term of 120 years to life plus a consecutive determinate term of 10 years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendants appeal. The following contentions are made by each defendant: (1) the evidence was insufficient to establish the \"criminal street gang\" requirement of the gang enhancements because there is no evidence Sacramento Norte\u00f1o subsets are part of the larger Norte\u00f1o organization; (2) the trial court prejudicially erred and violated defendants' constitutional right of confrontation by admitting expert gang testimony concerning the basis for the expert's conclusions they were active Norte\u00f1o gang members; (3) the trial court prejudicially erred by allowing expert testimony that defendants probably fired first because Ellison would not have wanted to attract trouble to his\n   home; (4) the trial court prejudicially erred and violated defendants' constitutional right to due process by excluding evidence they claim indicated Ellison had returned to a gang lifestyle, which they argue was critical to their self-defense claim; (5) the trial court prejudicially erred and further violated defendants' constitutional rights by providing the jury with a different instruction on causation than that contained in bracketed portions of CALCRIM No. 520 ; and (6) their respective abstracts of judgment must be modified to reflect the victim restitution order is a joint and several obligation. Adam and Isaac also assert: (7) the trial court's imposition of a sentence that is the functional equivalent of life without parole (LWOP) amounts to cruel and unusual punishment. Finally, Isaac contends: (8) the trial court prejudicially erred and violated his constitutional rights by allowing one of the detectives in the case to convey a misleading portion of Isaac's statement to police; and (9) the cumulative effect of the foregoing assertions of error requires reversal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Following oral argument, our Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    People v. Prunty\n   </em>\n   (2015)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12454510\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/62/59/\">\n    62 Cal.4th 59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=192%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20309\">\n    192 Cal.Rptr.3d 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=355%20P.3d%20480\">\n    355 P.3d 480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Prunty\n   </em>\n   ), which squarely addresses the first contention listed above. We requested supplemental briefing on the new\n   case. Having reviewed this briefing, we conclude\n   <em>\n    Prunty\n   </em>\n   requires reversal of the gang enhancement findings (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)) as to all defendants. Also, because each defendant was found to qualify for vicarious firearm enhancements under section 12022.53, subdivision (e)(1), which requires violation of section 186.22, subdivision (b), as an element of that enhancement, we must reverse these vicarious firearm enhancements as to all defendants as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We disagree with the remaining contentions raised by all defendants, except for the conceded point that their respective abstracts of judgment should reflect the victim restitution order is a joint and several obligation. Specifically, the challenged expert \"basis\" evidence did not violate defendants' constitutional right of confrontation. Nor did the trial court err by allowing expert testimony that defendants probably fired first because Ellison would not have wanted to attract trouble to his home. Defendants' contention that the trial court prejudicially erred and violated their constitutional right to due process by excluding evidence of Ellison's return to an active gang lifestyle is forfeited. Nor were their respective counsel ineffective for failing to preserve the issue for review. We also reject defendants' claim the trial court prejudicially erred and violated their constitutional rights by providing the jury with a different instruction on causation than that contained in a bracketed portion of CALCRIM No. 520. While the instruction provided was erroneous in two respects, the error was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Turning to the Eighth Amendment claim raised by Adam and Isaac, we concluded in our original opinion that remand for a new sentencing hearing\n   was required because it was unclear whether the trial court properly considered all mitigating circumstances attendant in each juvenile offender's life, including but not limited to chronological age at the time of the crime and physical and mental development, before sentencing them to serve the functional equivalent of life without parole (LWOP). In so concluding, we rejected the Attorney General's argument Senate Bill No. 260 (2013-2014 Reg. Sess.; codified as \u00a7 3051 of the Penal Code ; Stats.2013, ch. 312, \u00a7 4 (SB 260)), which became effective January 1, 2014, rendered resentencing unnecessary because, under newly-enacted section 3051, Adam and Isaac will be afforded a meaningful opportunity for parole \"during [their] 25th year of incarceration\" (\u00a7 3051, subd. (b)(3) ), i.e., within their natural life expectancies. We granted rehearing on this issue in light of certain language contained in\n   <em>\n    Montgomery v. Louisiana\n   </em>\n   (2016) 577 U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601432\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/718/\">\n    136 S.Ct. 718\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601432\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/718/\">\n    193 L.Ed.2d 599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   ), decided after our decision was issued. After receiving supplemental briefing on the issue, for reasons explained below, we now conclude\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   does not alter our analysis. Remand is still required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Finally, the remaining claims brought by Isaac alone also fail. The trial court did not prejudicially err or violate his constitutional rights by allowing one of the detectives to convey a portion of his statement to police. Nor does the cumulative effect of the foregoing assertions of error require reversal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Accordingly, with respect to Adam and Isaac, we reverse the gang enhancement and vicarious firearm enhancement findings, otherwise affirm their convictions and enhancement findings, and remand the matter to the trial court for resentencing; following the new sentencing hearing, their respective abstracts of judgment shall reflect that any victim restitution order imposed by the trial court is a joint and several obligation. With respect to Jesse,\n   we reverse the gang enhancement and vicarious firearm enhancement findings, modify the judgment to strike these enhancements, and affirm the modified judgment. The trial court is directed to amend Jesse's abstract of judgment to reflect the modifications and to indicate the victim restitution order already imposed is a joint and several obligation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On the afternoon of January 19, 2011, Ellison left his home to go to the store. He drove his wife's Ford Taurus and brought along three other men, including Neal, who sat in the back of the car directly behind Ellison. On the way to the store, Ellison picked up another man, who was walking to Ellison's house, and then continued on to the store. Ellison, a former gang member, had a .40-caliber handgun in the car's center console. According to his wife, he bought the gun for protection. Having recently testified against another gang member in exchange for being released from jail, Ellison had\n   received threats and was concerned about retaliation for being a \"snitch.\" Neal was aware of the threats. He was also aware Ellison had a gun in the center console.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   When Ellison and his companions returned from the store, they turned onto Ellison's street and noticed two vehicles approaching from the opposite direction. The first vehicle was a small car. The second vehicle was a Ford Explorer containing the defendants in this case. In order to pull into his driveway, which was on the left side of the street, Ellison turned between the two vehicles. Around this time, Neal noticed the occupants of the Explorer were giving them \"hard looks\" and said: \"[W]ho is them muggin' us?\" Before Ellison was able to put the car in park, Neal opened his door and started to step out to \"figure out who was in them cars.\" As he did so, the Explorer stopped in front of Ellison's house and the front and backseat passengers, Adam and Isaac, opened fire with semi-automatic handguns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Neal managed to \"jump back in the car\" before the first shots were fired. Multiple bullets struck the Taurus, shattering the rear window. When someone in the car said, \"shoot back,\" Neal grabbed Ellison's handgun from the center console, fired one round through the \"busted out\" back window, and then got out of the car and continued firing at the Explorer until he \"couldn't shoot no more.\" Neal fired at least six rounds. However, it does not appear any of Neal's shots struck the Explorer. Shots fired by Adam and Isaac were far more accurate. Combined, they fired at least 14 rounds, hitting both the Taurus and Ellison's home multiple times. One bullet struck Ellison in the upper back as he leaned forward in the driver's seat, traveled through his neck and head, and lodged in his brain. Death from this gunshot wound came within a matter of minutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After Adam and Isaac finished firing upon Ellison and his companions, the Explorer drove away. The Taurus's remaining passengers got out of the car. Neal \"took off running\" with Ellison's gun because he was afraid of being arrested for being a felon in possession of a firearm. Ellison's wife, Jettiemarie Boyd, who witnessed the shooting from outside her neighbor's home, ran to her husband. During the shooting, the Taurus had continued forward into the garage door. The tires were still spinning when Boyd reached the car. She put the car in park, removed the keys from the ignition, and tended to her husband. Boyd's mother and various neighbors also came out to check on Ellison, who was \"slumped over the steering wheel\" with \"blood ... coming\n   out of his neck, running down his chest.\" He died before law enforcement and medical personnel arrived on the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A description of the Explorer and the shooters was given to police at the scene and relayed over the radio to nearby patrol cars. The vehicle was\n   located a short time later, not far from the crime scene. When a traffic stop was initiated, Jesse led officers on a high-speed chase, reaching speeds of 85 miles per hour, before crashing the Explorer in an intersection. Defendants then attempted to flee on foot; each was taken into custody. During the chase, two handguns were thrown from the Explorer. Police recovered a 10-millimeter handgun along the chase route. Eight 10-millimeter casings found at the scene appeared to have been fired by this gun. A magazine for a 9-millimeter handgun and several unfired 9-millimeter rounds were also recovered along the chase route. The gun associated with the magazine and bullets was not recovered. However, Isaac admitted to police that a 9-millimeter handgun was also thrown from the vehicle and two 9-millimeter casings found in the Explorer appeared to have been fired by the same gun that fired six such casings found at the scene of the crime. Gunshot residue tests also corroborated the fact that Adam and Isaac were the shooters, while Jesse drove the Explorer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Finally, the prosecution provided testimony from an expert on criminal street gangs, Detective John Sample, who testified Jesse, Adam, and Isaac were each active members of the Norte\u00f1o street gang, and a hypothetical shooting based on the facts of this case would have been committed in association with or for the benefit of the gang. We provide a more detailed description of Detective Sample's testimony in the discussion that follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We first address those contentions asserted by all three defendants. Then, we address one claim raised by both Adam and Isaac.

He had personally contacted about 150 such gang members. The detective testified their commonly used symbols are \"the letter N, anything that is representative of the number 14-N is the 14th letter of the alphabet-the Roman numerals XIV, which is the number 14 in Roman numerals, a one dot and a four dot. Typically their primary color is red. They use the Huelga bird as one of their primary symbols, which was taken from the United Farmworkers.\" He further testified their primary activities include \"[a]ssaults with firearms, stabbings, homicides, narcotics trafficking, burglaries, robberies, stealing cars.\" Finally, the detective testified regarding the facts of two predicate offenses committed by gang members belonging to two different Norte\u00f1o subsets. The first predicate offense involved three Norte\u00f1o gang members who belonged to the Varrio Centro subset, a \"click that's in downtown Sacramento,\" one of whom fired upon a car being driven by a person he \"had problems with in the past\" while another threw two beer bottles at the car. The other predicate offense involved four Norte\u00f1o gang members who belonged to the Varrio Gardenland subset, one of whom pulled out a handgun during a fight with a rival group of Norte\u00f1os and shot three people, killing one. However, while there is more than sufficient evidence establishing the defendants in this case are Norte\u00f1o gang members, they did not belong to the specific subsets whose members perpetrated the predicate offenses. Instead, Adam and Jesse belonged to the Oak Park subset, while\n   Isaac belonged to the Varrio Franklin Boulevard subset. Detective Sample testified Norte\u00f1o subsets adhere to the same structure, have the same beliefs, and claim membership in the overarching Norte\u00f1o gang.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We are compelled by our Supreme Court's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Prunty, supra,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12454510\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/62/59/\">\n    62 Cal.4th 59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=192%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20309\">\n    192 Cal.Rptr.3d 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=355%20P.3d%20480\">\n    355 P.3d 480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , to conclude the foregoing evidence was not sufficient to support the gang enhancements.

As the Attorney General points out, Detective Sample testified Norte\u00f1o subsets adhere to the same structure, have the same beliefs, and claim membership in the larger Norte\u00f1o gang. However, the detective did not testify as to what that purported structure was, or that it was somehow imposed upon the subsets by the larger Norte\u00f1o organization. (See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Prunty, supra,\n   </em>\n   62 Cal.4th at p. 77,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=192%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20309\">\n    192 Cal.Rptr.3d 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=355%20P.3d%20480\">\n    355 P.3d 480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [\"straightforward cases might involve subsets connected through formal ways, such as shared bylaws or organizational arrangements\"; \"proof that different Norte\u00f1o subsets are governed by the same 'bylaws' may suggest that they function-however informally-within a single hierarchical gang\"].) Nor is the fact subsets share the same beliefs sufficient to establish the associational connection required by\n   <em>\n    Prunty\n   </em>\n   . Instead, as our Supreme Court explained, \"subsets of a criminal street gang must be united by their\n   <em>\n    activities,\n   </em>\n   not simply by their viewpoints.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at p. 75,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=192%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20309\">\n    192 Cal.Rptr.3d 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=355%20P.3d%20480\">\n    355 P.3d 480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , italics added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Finally, Detective Sample's testimony that Norte\u00f1o subsets claim membership in the larger Norte\u00f1o gang does not suffice to establish the requisite connection. As our Supreme Court explained: \"[T]here are some limits on the boundaries of an identity-based theory. The evidence must demonstrate that an organizational or associational connection exists in fact,\n   not merely that a local subset has represented itself as an affiliate of what the prosecution asserts is a larger organization. [Citation.] Although evidence of self-identification with the larger organization may be relevant, the central question remains whether the groups in fact constitute the same 'criminal street gang.' In making the required showing, moreover, the prosecution must do more than simply present evidence that various alleged gang subsets are found within the same broad geographic area. For instance, that the various alleged gang subsets in this case were located 'all over Sacramento' does not show that the subsets constituted a single criminal street gang. The prosecution must introduce evidence of the alleged subsets'\n   <em>\n    activities,\n   </em>\n   showing a shared identity that warrants treating them as a single group. Such evidence could come in the form of proof that a certain Norte\u00f1o subset retaliates against a Sure\u00f1o gang for affronts that gang has committed against other Norte\u00f1o subsets. Behavior of this kind could suggest that members of the Norte\u00f1o subset consider themselves to be part of a larger association. Or, the prosecution could introduce evidence showing that different subsets require their members to perform the same initiation activities. Evidence of this common behavior may be some evidence that members identify themselves as belonging to the same gang. The key is for the prosecution to present evidence supporting a fact finder's reasonable conclusion that multiple subsets are\n   <em>\n    acting\n   </em>\n   as a single 'organization, association, or group.' (\u00a7 186.22(f).)\n   Evidence of self-identification must refer to the particular\n   <em>\n    activities\n   </em>\n   of subsets, and must permit the jury to reasonably conclude that the various subsets are associated with each other because of their shared connection with a certain group. And where, as in this case, the alleged perpetrators of the predicate crimes under section 186.22(f) are members of particular subsets, the\n   <em>\n    behavior\n   </em>\n   of those subsets' members must connect them to the gang the defendant sought to benefit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Prunty, supra,\n   </em>\n   62 Cal.4th at pp. 79-80,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=192%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20309\">\n    192 Cal.Rptr.3d 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=355%20P.3d%20480\">\n    355 P.3d 480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , italics added.)

With respect to Jesse, the detective testified: \"He admitted to being an Oak Park Norte\u00f1o to Detective Al Sanchez. He's been contacted in the company of known Norte\u00f1o gang members, I believe, on six different occasions. He's been involved in gang crimes on several occasions. And he, too, filled-described on his jail classification form that he was an associate to the Norte\u00f1os and requested to be separated from Southerners, again, a term for the Norte\u00f1o rivals.\" Finally, with respect to Isaac, the detective testified: \"Multiple-he's met multiple criteria. I think I read almost a dozen reports containing gang evidence. He was contacted on nine different occasions in the company of ... known Norte\u00f1o gang members. He's been named by no less than two other Norte\u00f1o gang members as a Norte\u00f1o gang member. He's been documented [as] involved in several gang crimes, several reports of documented gang graffiti found in his possession. I've seen gang photos where Isaac is throwing up gang hand signs, and he's been involved in gang\n   activity.

He was in his neighborhood. He is not going to attract, nor would the occupants of his vehicle, in my belief, attract trouble to their home. [\u00b6] The [Explorer] was out of the area. They're south area occupants up in the north area in a vehicle with weapons. [Ellison] was pulling into his driveway.

With respect to Detective Kirtlan, the Attorney General argues the challenged testimony \"was not admitted as his opinion on whether Neal in fact acted in self defense,\" but rather \"was properly admitted to rebut the implied bias raised by the defense under Evidence Code section 780, subdivision (f),\" i.e., the detective concluded Neal fired in self-defense before speaking to him because of a prior working relationship with Ellison and Boyd because Ellison had cooperated in a previous case against a fellow gang member.

Counsel was seeking to establish that the detective did not consider the possibility Neal could have started the gun fight by firing on the Explorer because of his bias in favor of Ellison, one of his \"snitches.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In these circumstances, it was proper for the prosecution to then rehabilitate the detective by eliciting the reason he believed Neal did not fire first before he had spoken to the man. In other words, the challenged testimony was offered to show the detective's belief Neal fired in self-defense was based on reason, as opposed to mere bias, as the defense questioning suggested.

Here, Detective Sample testified, based on his special knowledge, training, education, and experience working as a gang detective, that a gang member who is feeling vulnerable because he has been threatened and labeled a snitch would not be likely to turn into a dead end and leave himself open to attack. Defendants argue this specific opinion was not sufficiently beyond common experience to be helpful to the jury because \"[n]o sensible person, regardless of their gang status, would knowingly place themselves in a trap if they thought the[y] were under threat.\" We disagree. While no sensible person would pull into his own driveway and start a gun fight with no means of escape, whether a\n   <em>\n    gang member\n   </em>\n   would do so is not something the average juror would know.

The post stated: \"GET MONEY TRUST NOT A SOUL MONEY AND MURDER I SWEAR IM BACK AT IT AGAIN WHO CAN I TRUST IN THIS WORLD? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? GET ACTIVE.\" The printout also included Ellison's profile picture, in which he was apparently making a gang sign with his hands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Jesse's trial counsel argued the post was relevant to show Ellison's state of mind at the time of the shooting, i.e., he and the other occupants of the Taurus \"were expecting to get hit\" and \"were expecting trouble,\" which he argued was \"very probative of who fired first.\" Counsel also argued the post was admissible despite the hearsay rule because it qualified as a statement of Ellison's then-existing state of mind and a statement against penal interest. Counsel further argued Boyd, who also had access to Ellison's Facebook account, could authenticate the post. Isaac's attorney joined in these arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In response, the prosecutor did not object to the profile picture being admitted, but argued defense counsel was attempting to \"circumvent the hearsay rules and circumvent the foundational requirements\" by seeking to admit the Facebook post. With respect to hearsay, the prosecutor did not actually make an argument. With respect to foundation, the prosecutor questioned whether counsel would be able to establish Ellison \"did in fact, make that entry.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   After further argument from defense counsel, the trial court took the matter under submission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Trial began without a ruling on admissibility of the Facebook post. The following exchange occurred during Jesse's cross-examination of Neal:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \"Q Did you also say that [Ellison] don't even gang bang no more?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \"A Yes, I did say that.

Thus, the trial court ruled the Facebook post was not admissible to impeach Neal under an Evidence Code section 352 analysis. The trial court never ruled on the initial motion to admit this evidence\n   <em>\n    to prove self-defense\n   </em>\n   , nor did any of the defendants press the trial court to do so. By failing to press for a ruling-and in Adam's case, by failing to join in the argument altogether-defendants have forfeited their now-joint contention the trial court prejudicially erred and violated their due process rights by excluding the proffered evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Anticipating forfeiture, Jesse argues his trial counsel rendered constitutionally deficient assistance by failing to \"explicitly argue that the fact that Ellison had returned to an active gang life would tend to show that he and his associates ... were just as likely to fire first as were Jesse and his associates.\" Adam and Isaac join in this argument as well, which we interpret as arguing their respective counsel were equally ineffective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   A criminal defendant has the right to the assistance of counsel under both the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article I, section 15, of the California Constitution.

Even assuming the post established in the jurors' minds that Ellison possessed the gun, not simply for protection, but also for gang purposes, i.e., confrontation, and Ellison deliberately cut off the Explorer while pulling into his driveway, neither fact would justify defendants' actions of opening fire on Ellison's car. The only purported fact that would justify such an assault is Neal's firing at the Explorer first, or at the very least, pointing Ellison's gun in defendants' direction, and thereby causing a reasonable belief in the need to employ deadly force in self-defense. But the Facebook post was made by\n   <em>\n    Ellison,\n   </em>\n   not\n   <em>\n    Neal\n   </em>\n   . There is no dispute Neal was the one who fired Ellison's gun. Indeed, Ellison was apparently hit before he could put the car in park. Ellison's post was therefore relevant on the issue of Neal's conduct only if Neal was aware of the post. In other words, Ellison's decision to return to gang life, by itself, does not tend to prove anything\n   <em>\n    about Neal\n   </em>\n   . However, Neal's belief Ellison was out of the gang life would tend to make it less likely that he would take it upon himself to use Ellison's gun to fire upon another vehicle in front of Ellison's house had occupants of that vehicle not fired first. Conversely, Neal's belief Ellison had returned to the gang life would tend to make his firing first in these circumstances more likely. But how much more likely? We conclude the answer is \"not much.\" The evidence established Ellison had offered testimony against a rival gang member,\n   had been threatened for having done so, and was pulling into his driveway when the shooting occurred. In these circumstances, regardless of whether Ellison had decided to return to the gang lifestyle, and regardless of whether Neal was aware of this decision, opening fire on an Explorer full of gang members\n   <em>\n    in front of Ellison's house, and in a driveway with no means of escape\n   </em>\n   when the occupants of the Explorer predictably returned fire, is so unlikely as to be implausible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Weighing against this low level of probative value is the reality that admission of the evidence would have required a significant consumption of time. The defense would have been required to establish what we have assumed in our analysis thus far, i.e., the post was in fact made by Ellison, the post indeed meant Ellison had returned to an active gang lifestyle, and Neal was aware of his return to this lifestyle. In light of the minimal probative value of the evidence, we cannot conclude the trial court would have abused its discretion by excluding the evidence under an Evidence Code section 352 analysis. Nor are we persuaded such a decision would have amounted to a deprivation of due process. While defendants are correct to point out Evidence Code section 352 \"must bow to the due process right of a defendant to a fair trial and his [or her] right to present all relevant evidence of significant probative value to his [or her] defense[,] ... the proffered evidence must have more than slight relevancy to the issues presented.

Here, there was no dispute Ellison died of a single gunshot wound. This was the direct, but-for cause of death. Overwhelming evidence established both Adam and Isaac fired into Ellison's car.

The same is true here. While the jury should have been instructed with the \"direct, natural, and probable consequences\" language, we have no doubt the jury reached the same conclusion without it, i.e., the act of firing the fatal shot caused Ellison's death. Then, under the instruction that was provided, the jury properly concluded both Adam and Isaac proximately caused the death regardless of who fired the fatal shot. Moreover, use of the term \"proximate cause\" in the instruction,\n   while improper, could only have benefitted defendants by potentially misleading jurors that proximate cause has a \" 'physical or temporal nearness' \" requirement that does not exist in the law.

As for Jesse, liability for murder turned on principles of aiding and abetting, on which the jury was appropriately instructed. Thus, any instructional error was manifestly harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Nevertheless, defendants argue there is evidence the occupants of the smaller car in front of the Explorer may have also fired upon Ellison's car, and one of them might have fired the fatal shot. While there is some evidence shots may have also been fired from the smaller car, this would not undermine our conclusion Adam and Isaac, by firing their own bullets into Ellison's car, also proximately caused Ellison's death. Stated simply, assuming there were three gunmen instead of two, who fired the fatal bullet is still unknown, and the jury could find\n   <em>\n    all three\n   </em>\n   gunmen proximately caused the death. Nor are we persuaded by the argument, made in Adam's opening brief, it would be speculative to conclude that \"defendants were acting in concert with the occupants of the other vehicle, or that the occupants of the two vehicles even knew each other.\" If, as defendants suggest, both the Explorer and the smaller lead car fired upon Ellison's car as it pulled into the driveway, a reasonable inference is that the two vehicles were acting in concert. Adam's trial counsel acknowledged as much when he argued in closing that the smaller car was \"a companion car\" containing \"friends of theirs.\" Moreover, defendants cite no authority for the proposition that the two cars had to act in concert in order for Adam and Isaac to have proximately caused Ellison's death by also firing upon his car.

However, whether to impose consecutive rather than concurrent sentences with respect to the remaining counts was a discretionary decision. (See \u00a7 669;\n   <em>\n    People v.

[\u00b6] This is not a situation where there [were] only one or two shots fired. Factually in this case, multiple guns were basically unloaded. [\u00b6] And it is quite clear that it is appropriate, in the Court's view, to recognize the imposition of a separate sentence as it relates to each of the individual victims in this case.\" We do not dispute these are appropriate reasons for imposing consecutive sentences.

However, as previously explained, where the defendant is a juvenile, and the result of imposing consecutive sentences is an aggregate prison term that is the functional equivalent of LWOP, the Eighth Amendment requires the trial court to specifically consider \"all mitigating circumstances attendant in the juvenile's crime and life, including but not limited to his or her chronological age at the time of the crime, whether the juvenile offender was a direct perpetrator or an aider and abettor, and his or her physical and mental development,\" before imposing such a harsh sentence.

Thus, while rule 4.425 provides circumstances in mitigation \"may be considered,\" the circumstances of this case required the trial court to consider such mitigating circumstances, separately with respect to each juvenile offender, as a matter of constitutional law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   The record is unclear as to whether this occurred. After stating its reasons for imposing consecutive sentences on Counts Two through Five (\u00a7\u00a7 664/187), the trial court stated it would run\n   <em>\n    one\n   </em>\n   25-years-to-life firearm enhancement, i.e., that attached to Count Five, concurrently \"in light of the constitutional scheme argued by defense.\" Thus, it appears the trial court considered the constitutional arguments raised by Adam and Isaac and agreed the probation officer's recommendation would amount to cruel and unusual punishment. However, running one of the firearm enhancements concurrently did not reduce the sentence below that of a functionally equivalent LWOP. As a practical matter, there is no difference between the sentence recommended by probation (170 years to life plus 37 years 4 months), the sentence the trial court would have imposed without running one firearm enhancement\n   concurrently (145 years to life plus 9 years 4 months), and the sentence actually imposed (120 years to life plus 9 years 4 months). In other words, if an individualized consideration of \"all mitigating circumstances attendant in the juvenile's crime and life\" (\n   <em>\n    Caballero, supra,\n   </em>\n   55 Cal.4th at p. 268,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"237\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=145%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20286\">\n    145 Cal.Rptr.3d 286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"238\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=282%20P.3d%20291\">\n    282 P.3d 291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), would have rendered the functional LWOP sentence recommended by the probation department a violation of the Eighth Amendment, then the sentence imposed by the trial court-also a functional LWOP-was also a violation of the Eighth Amendment. At the same time, if the trial court did consider \"how children are different, and how those differences counsel against irrevocably sentencing them to a lifetime in prison\" (\n   <em>\n    Miller, supra,\n   </em>\n   132 S.Ct. at p. 2469 ), but nevertheless concluded these particular juveniles were deserving of spending the rest of their lives in prison without possibility of parole, there would be no such violation.

The Legislature noted the bill \"recognizes that youthfulness both\n   lessens a juvenile's moral culpability and enhances the prospect that, as a youth matures into an adult and neurological development occurs, these individuals can become contributing members of society,\" and declared: \"The purpose of this act is to establish a parole eligibility mechanism that provides a person serving a sentence for crimes that he or she committed as a juvenile the opportunity to obtain release when he or she has shown that he or she has been rehabilitated and gained maturity, in accordance with the decision of the California Supreme Court in [\n   <em>\n    Caballero\n   </em>\n   ] and the decisions of the United States Supreme Court in [\n   <em>\n    Graham, supra,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n    560 U.S. 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"247\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ], and [\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ]. It\n   is the intent of the Legislature to create a process by which growth and maturity of youthful offenders can be assessed and a meaningful opportunity for release established.\" (SB 260, \u00a7 1 (2013-2014 Reg. Sess.).) To effectuate the Legislature's intent, SB 260 added section 3051 to the Penal Code, which requires the Board of Parole Hearings (the Board) to conduct youth offender parole hearings during the 15th, 20th, or 25th year of incarceration. (\u00a7 3051, subd. (b), Stats.2013, ch. 312, \u00a7 4.) A youthful offender whose sentence is a term of 25 years to life or greater is \"eligible for release on parole by the board during his or her 25th year of incarceration at a youth offender parole hearing, unless previously released or entitled to an earlier parole consideration hearing pursuant to other statutory provisions.\" (\u00a7 3051, subd. (b)(3) ; SB 260, \u00a7 4 (2013-2014 Reg. Sess.).) In conducting youth offender parole hearings under section 3051, the Board is required to \"give great weight to the diminished culpability of juveniles as compared to adults, the hallmark features of youth, and any subsequent growth and increased maturity of the prisoner in accordance with relevant case law.\" (\u00a7 4801, subd. (c); Stats.2013, ch. 312, \u00a7 5.)

As we have already explained, while\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   's categorical ban on an LWOP sentence or its functional equivalent does not apply in this homicide case, under\n   <em>\n    Miller,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"255\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/#p2458\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the sentencing court was still required to consider all mitigating circumstances of\n   youth before imposing a sentence the functional equivalent of LWOP. Thus, the penalty selection that comports with\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   must be undertaken in the first instance by the sentencing court. Regardless of whether the new statutory scheme enacted by SB 260 may eventually convert an LWOP sentence to one with possibility of parole, the sentencing court must consider the factors of youth and maturity\n   <em>\n    when selecting the initial punishment\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Our dissenting colleague concludes SB 260 has converted what would otherwise be the functional equivalent of an LWOP sentence into one with the possibility of parole, thereby obviating the sentencing court's obligation to engage in any consideration of youth before imposing such a sentence. We disagree. While SB 260 promises a parole hearing will be held within a juvenile homicide offender's natural life, the statutory language does nothing to convert the originally-imposed sentence into a term of 15, 20, or 25 years to life. If it did, we could simply modify the judgments entered against Adam and Isaac in this case to reflect terms of 25 years to life and be done with it. But that is not what section 3051 says. As relevant to Adam and Isaac, it simply provides for a parole hearing during their 25th year of incarceration. Should this provision be repealed in the meantime, their originally-imposed sentences would remain operative. Nor are we persuaded by our dissenting colleague's assessment that the prospect of such a repeal is \"highly unlikely.\" We have no way of knowing the intentions of a future Legislature. And while such a hypothetical repeal would undoubtedly be challenged in the courts, the question of its constitutionality is not before us for the obvious reason it has not yet happened, and may never happen. What is certain, however, is the trial court imposed sentences on Adam and Isaac that, by their terms, do not provide them with the possibility of parole during their natural lives. These sentences will hang over their heads until the parole hearing promised by SB 260 comes to pass. Thus, while SB 260 may eventually remedy the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   violation by offering an opportunity for parole, it has not yet done so. We therefore conclude the appropriate remedy is to remand the matter for a new sentencing hearing that comports with\n   <em>\n    Miller, supra,\n   </em>\n   567 U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"256\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/#p2458\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"257\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/#p2458\">\n    183 L.Ed.2d 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   This conclusion is bolstered by our Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    People v.

[Citation.] Neither\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   nor\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   indicated an opportunity to recall a sentence of life without parole 15 to 24 years into the future would somehow make more reliable or justifiable the imposition of that sentence and its underlying judgment of the offender's incorrigibility 'at the outset.' [Citation.] [\u00b6] Indeed, the high court in\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   explained that a juvenile offender's subsequent failure to rehabilitate while serving a sentence of life without parole cannot retroactively justify imposition of the sentence in the first instance: 'Even if the State's judgment that Graham was incorrigible were later corroborated by prison misbehavior or failure to mature, the sentence was still disproportionate\n   <em>\n    because that judgment was made at the outset.\n   </em>\n   ' [Citation.] By the same logic, it is doubtful that the potential to recall a life without parole sentence based on a future demonstration of rehabilitation can make such a sentence any more valid when it was imposed.

Police found multiple 9-millimeter and 10-millimeter shell casings in the street in front of Ellison's house. As mentioned, they found the corresponding 10-millimeter handgun along the chase route. However, while police also found a magazine for a 9-millimeter handgun along the chase route, they did not find the gun itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Detective Kirtlan interviewed Isaac after the shooting. The detective told Isaac police had found the 10-millimeter handgun and the 9-millimeter magazine, but were still looking for the 9-millimeter handgun. He also explained it was a \"public safety issue\" to have a gun left out on the street, especially since there would be children walking down that street on their way to school the next morning. Isaac then discussed the matter with his stepmother, who had joined him in the interview room, and ultimately agreed to point out the location of the missing handgun.

Yes. Did you look for it in that location? Yes. Did you find it? No.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   In response, Isaac's trial counsel argued: \"I think that there is ... [an Evidence Code section] 356 problem. I think that the throwing of the gun is being used to show consciousness of guilt, whereas Isaac's statement during this long period that he was interrogated and questioned was that this was self-defense. So I think that you need to get in the entire statement so that the jury could, in essence, understand that.\" Counsel also expressed concern that limiting the testimony to Isaac providing the location of the gun \"gives a false impression that if he's saying where the gun was thrown, then it gives the impression that he threw the gun, and that's a significant issue.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   The prosecutor argued in reply: \"As far as [Evidence Code section] 356, I don't know that there is anything in his self-serving statements to [Isaac's stepmother]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   or even his inculpatory statements to [his stepmother] that explained the limited part that I'm trying to get out, where could they look for the gun. [\u00b6] One of the things that has already been raised here by [counsel for Jesse] is that the police didn't do their job, didn't look for the .40 caliber, didn't even bother to look for the .40 caliber, didn't even bother to find it. Now, that's the one that was used by Latrele Neal. But it should at least be shown that the officers made attempts to find the outstanding nine millimeter. [\u00b6] Because one of the other arguments counsel can make, well, maybe if we had the nine millimeter we could have-if they had done their job and looked for that maybe we could have done some testing on that or figured out which one of them fired it. There's nothing in any of the witness statements, even the witnesses who saw the ten millimeter being thrown from the car that indicates who in the car threw it. [\u00b6] Now, in his statement, that portion of it I think he indicates or the officer indicates that it was thrown from the driver's side window. I'm not implying that we know who threw the gun. I'm simply trying to get before the jury that the officers attempted to locate it. They attempted to get information. They got information, and they went to look for it. But there's nothing in the statements that he makes to [his stepmother] or the lies that he makes to Detective Kirtlan initially that explains that or adds to it or clears anything up.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   The trial court ruled that admitting the fact Isaac provided the location of the gun to police would not violate\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   . The trial court further ruled Evidence Code section 356 did not require \"allowing an entire expansive rambling statement encompassing a number of topics to address a sole and easily isolated question such as we have in this case.\" Finally, the court explained the prosecution's intended use of Isaac's statement as to the location of the 9-millimeter handgun did not \"over-implicate\" Isaac or \"misrepresent\" he was the one who threw the gun out of the Explorer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   In accordance with the trial court's ruling, during the prosecution's examination of Detective Kirtlan, the following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   \"Q Did you receive information from [defendant] Isaac Vasquez about the location of a missing nine-millimeter semiautomatic handgun?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   \"A Yes, I did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   \"Q Did you go to the area after receiving that information and search the area where it was thought that that gun might be?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   \"A Yes, ma'am.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   \"Q And where was that location?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   \"A Essentially in the area of Northgate and Striker in North Sacramento.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   \"Q Now, is that an area where other evidence had been located?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   \"A Yes, ma'am.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   \"Q What other evidence had been located there?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   \"A A magazine to a nine-millimeter semiautomatic handgun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   \"Q Did you find the nine-millimeter semiautomatic handgun?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   \"A No, we did not.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   Evidence Code section 356 provides: \"Where part of an act, declaration, conversation, or writing is given in evidence by one party, the whole\n   <em>\n    on the same subject\n   </em>\n   may be inquired into by an adverse party; when a letter is read, the answer may be given; and when a detached act, declaration,\n   conversation, or writing is given in evidence, any other act, declaration, conversation, or writing which is necessary to make it understood may also be given in evidence.\" (Italics added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   This provision \"is sometimes referred to as the statutory version of the common-law rule of completeness.

We review the trial court's determination of whether or not to\n   admit evidence under this provision for abuse of discretion. (See\n   <em>\n    People v.

Implicit in this testimony is that Isaac told the detective the gun could be found at that particular location. From this, and the fact the location was along the chase route, the jury could infer\n   <em>\n    someone\n   </em>\n   in the Explorer threw the gun out of the vehicle during the chase. The testimony does not reveal who threw the gun. Thus, the concern raised below that the testimony would misleadingly suggest Isaac was the one who threw the 9-millimeter handgun, and therefore likely fired the shot that killed Ellison, was obviated by the actual testimony received into evidence. Indeed, the prosecutor never argued, in either her closing or rebuttal argument, that Isaac fired the fatal shot. Instead, she specifically conceded, \"we don't know who had the nine and who had the ten.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   The other argument for admission of the entire statement, which was raised below, was the jury should hear the entirety of Isaac's statement, including the portion indicating the shooting was done in self-defense, to balance out the suggestion that throwing the gun out of the Explorer evidenced Isaac's consciousness of guilt. However, the trial court appeared to credit the prosecutor's assurance Isaac's statement as to where the 9-millimeter handgun could be found was being offered solely on the issue of whether the police conducted a thorough investigation. (See 4 Jones on Evidence (7th ed.2014) \u00a7 24:26 [\"where the defendant challenges the investigation as unprofessional or sloppy or claims that he [or she] was falsely accused, the prosecutor should be entitled to spell out the investigation in greater detail to rebut this defense\"].) The prosecutor lived up to this assurance. At no point in her arguments to the jury did she argue the fact Isaac threw a handgun from the SUV evidenced his consciousness of guilt. Moreover, the rule of completeness prevents \" 'the use of selected aspects of a [statement] so as to create a misleading impression\n   <em>\n    on the subjects addressed,\n   </em>\n   ' \" and therefore \"hinges on the\n   requirement that the two portions of a statement be '\n   <em>\n    on the same subject\n   </em>\n   .' \" (\n   <em>\n    People v.

Here, whether Isaac told Detective Kirtlan where to find the 9-millimeter handgun is not the same subject as whether the shooting itself was done in self-defense. We acknowledge narrow lines should not be drawn around the exact subject of inquiry (\n   <em>\n    People v.

(Evid.Code, \u00a7 356.)\n   Finally, we note Isaac raises a separate issue for the first time on appeal. He argues his exact statement to Detective Kirtlan, i.e., \"they throwed it out\" should have been admitted because it \"was exculpatory in that it supported an inference that [Isaac] did not shoot the [9-millimeter] gun that killed Ellison.\" Acknowledging admission of Isaac's statement, \"they throwed it out\" at the joint trial in this case, where Isaac did not testify, would have potentially violated his codefendants' confrontation rights under\n   <em>\n    People v.

However, because S.B. 260 now provides juvenile offenders sentenced to indeterminate terms an opportunity to obtain parole, a trial court's indeterminate term sentence (no matter how long it is) no longer has the effect of depriving juvenile defendants of that opportunity\n   <em>\n    at the outset\n   </em>\n   . Furthermore, as I will explain, the death penalty analogy underlying the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   requirement for individualized sentencing consideration as an Eighth Amendment imperative does not apply to indeterminate sentences imposed on juveniles post-S.B. 260.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   To be clear, a state certainly may require trial courts to engage in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   -style individualized sentencing consideration before imposing a lengthy indeterminate term sentence on a juvenile.

The California Supreme Court extended\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   to apply to lengthy indeterminate sentences in nonhomicide cases that are the functional equivalent of LWOP.

The California Legislature's Fix-Senate Bill No. 260\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   Section 1 of S.B. 260 states in relevant part: \"The Legislature finds and declares that, as stated by the United States Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   [,\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"342\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/#p2458\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ], 'only a relatively small proportion of adolescents' who engage in illegal activity 'develop entrenched patterns of problem behavior,' and that 'developments in psychology and brain science continue to show fundamental differences between juvenile and adult minds,' including 'parts of the brain involved in behavior control.' The Legislature recognizes that youthfulness both lessens a juvenile's moral culpability and enhances the prospect that, as a youth matures into an adult and neurological development occurs, these individuals can become contributing members of society. The purpose of this act is to establish a parole eligibility mechanism that provides a person serving a sentence for crimes that he or she committed as a juvenile the opportunity to obtain release when he or she has shown that he or she has been rehabilitated and gained maturity, in accordance with the decision of the California Supreme Court in [\n   <em>\n    Caballero\n   </em>\n   ] and the decisions of the United States Supreme Court in [\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   ], and [\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ].\" (Legis.

Indeed, effective January 1, 2016, offenders who were under the\n   age of 23 at the time of the offense are now eligible for parole under section 3051. (Legis. Counsel's Dig., Sen. Bill No. 261, Stats.2015, ch. 471, \u00a7 1 (2015-2016 Reg. Sess.).) Specifically, youth offender parole hearings are to be held during the 15th year of incarceration for an inmate serving a determinate sentence (\u00a7 3051, subd.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   S.B. 260 applies here. Both Adam and Isaac will have their first parole hearing during their 25th year of incarceration, just as if they had been sentenced to only 25 years to life. Their sentences, therefore, are not the functional equivalent of LWOP; they are no longer effectively condemned to die in prison. Adam and Isaac will have a realistic opportunity for parole on a date that falls well within their natural life expectancy. Consequently, their sentences do not violate the Eighth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   The majority says this is not enough. The majority concludes that \"[t]here can be no doubt the sentence imposed in this case, i.e., 120 years to life plus 9 years 4 months, is the functional equivalent of LWOP\" and goes on to state that, at sentencing, the Eighth Amendment requires the trial court to specifically consider the attributes of youth and all mitigating circumstances before imposing such a sentence. (Maj.opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   pp. 835-36.) But the premise that the sentences here continue to be the functional equivalent of LWOP after S.B. 260 is wrong. No indeterminate sentence imposed on a juvenile can be considered the functional equivalent of LWOP after S.B. 260. This is necessarily true because, by definition, an LWOP sentence means incarceration\n   <em>\n    without the possibility for parole\n   </em>\n   . As noted, our Supreme\n   Court has defined the functional equivalent of LWOP as a sentence that results in \"a parole eligibility date that\n   falls outside the juvenile offender's natural life expectancy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Caballero, supra,\n   </em>\n   55 Cal.4th at p. 268,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"343\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=145%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20286\">\n    145 Cal.Rptr.3d 286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"344\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=282%20P.3d%20291\">\n    282 P.3d 291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) That definition is consistent with the United States Supreme Court's concern that LWOP sentences are the equivalent of\n   <em>\n    condemning juvenile offenders to die in prison\n   </em>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    Montgomery,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601432\" index=\"345\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/718/\">\n     supra,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   136 S.Ct. at p. 726, citing\n   <em>\n    Miller, supra,\n   </em>\n   132 S.Ct. at p. 2469.) After S.B. 260, no juvenile sentenced to a lengthy indeterminate sentence can be considered to have been condemned to die in prison because no indeterminate sentence can function as the equivalent of LWOP. All juvenile offenders sentenced before and after the enactment of S.B. 260, including Adam and Isaac, now have a parole eligibility date no later than the 25th year of incarceration, well within their life expectancy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   The majority reasons that S.B. 260 did not \"convert\" what would otherwise be the functional equivalent of LWOP to sentences that carry the possibility of parole. They say, \"While S.B. 260 promises a parole hearing will be held within a juvenile homicide offender's natural life, the statutory language does nothing to convert the originally-imposed sentence into a term of 15, 20, or 25 years to life.\" (Maj.opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   p. 839.) But there is no constitutional requirement that sentences be reduced or converted; the only requirement is that juvenile defendants be given a realistic opportunity to demonstrate maturity and rehabilitation and thereby obtain release on parole. And the Legislature has the authority to establish when a person becomes eligible for parole, notwithstanding the minimum sentence imposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   In my view, the word \"convert\" is the wrong word to use in describing what S.B. 260 did to the functional equivalent of LWOP. The appropriate word is \"abolish.\" S.B. 260\n   <em>\n    abolished\n   </em>\n   the functional equivalent of LWOP for juvenile offenders by eliminating the last three letters in that acronym-WOP-which stands for\n   <em>\n    without the possibility\n   </em>\n   of parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   Notwithstanding the S.B. 260 abolition of the functional equivalent of LWOP, the majority concludes that\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   's individualized sentencing consideration requirement is still constitutionally compelled by the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment; thus, a sentencing court must consider the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   factors \"\n   <em>\n    when selecting the initial punishment\n   </em>\n   .\" (Maj.opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   p. 839.) I disagree with the majority's view of\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   . The majority correctly notes that the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   court held that the \"imposition of an LWOP sentence for a homicide committed as a juvenile constitutes a task '\n   <em>\n    demanding individualized sentencing\n   </em>\n   ' and requiring 'that\n   <em>\n    a sentencer have the ability to consider the \"mitigating qualities of youth\n   </em>\n   .\" ' (\n   <em>\n    Miller, supra,\n   </em>\n   132 S.Ct. at p. 2467,\n   quoting\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

But the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   court required this individual sentencing consideration as an Eighth Amendment imperative precisely because the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   defendants had been\n   <em>\n    mandatorily\n   </em>\n   sentenced to LWOP and for no other reason. The vice of the LWOP sentencing schemes in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   was that the sentencer was prevented from imposing a sentence that provided for an opportunity for parole and thus more proportionate to the crime and the offender. Instead, the sentencer was required to impose LWOP, the \"harshest\" sentence available for juveniles in all cases. \"By removing youth from the balance-by subjecting a juvenile to the same life-without-parole sentence applicable to an adult-these laws prohibit a sentencing authority from assessing whether the law's\n   <em>\n    harshest term\n   </em>\n   of imprisonment proportionately punishes a juvenile offender. That contravenes\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   's ... foundational\n   principle:\n   <em>\n    that imposition of a State's most severe penalties on juvenile offenders cannot proceed as though they were not children\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Miller,\n   </em>\n   at p. 2466, italics added.) The court in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   recognized that in homicide cases an LWOP sentence could constitutionally be imposed when sentencing \" 'the rare juvenile offender whose crime reflects\n   <em>\n    irreparable corruption,\n   </em>\n   ' \" but required sentencers \"to take into account how children are different, and how those differences\n   <em>\n    counsel against irrevocably sentencing them to a lifetime in prison\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 2469, italics added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   Now, as a result of S.B. 260, juvenile offenders in California are no longer treated as if they are not children, and they are no longer \"irrevocably\" sentenced to a lifetime in prison. Indeed, defendants here will have a realistic opportunity for parole after 25 years whereas an adult (23 years old and older at the time of the offense) would be effectively condemned to die in prison if given the same sentence. (Legis. Counsel's Dig., Sen. Bill No. 261, Stats.2015, ch. 471, \u00a7 1 (2015-2016 Reg. Sess.).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   In insisting that trial courts expressly consider the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   factors before imposing an indeterminate sentence that would be the functional equivalent of LWOP, the majority and others not only effectively ignore the opportunity for parole provided by S.B. 260, but they also overlook the reason the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   court mandated individual sentencing consideration before condemning juveniles to die in prison. Following its earlier statements in\n   <em>\n    Graham,\n   </em>\n   the court in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   equated an LWOP sentence for a juvenile to the death penalty for adults. (\n   <em>\n    Miller, supra,\n   </em>\n   132 S.Ct. at pp. 2463, 2466.) The majority does not account for this, but does quote\n   <em>\n    Miller's\n   </em>\n   reference to \" '\n   <em>\n    demanding individualized sentencing\n   </em>\n   ' \" before imposing LWOP. (Maj.opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   p. 838, italics added.) What the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   court actually said\n   <em>\n    demanded individual sentencing consideration\n   </em>\n   at the page cited by the majority was the death penalty precedents where the Eighth Amendment proportionality principle of individual sentencing consideration\n   had its genesis. (\n   <em>\n    Miller,\n   </em>\n   at p. 2467.) Specifically, the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   court said, \"\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   's '[t]reat[ment] [of] juvenile life sentences as analogous to capital punishment,' [citation]-makes relevant here a second line of our precedents,\n   <em>\n    demanding individualized sentencing when imposing the death penalty\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Miller,\n   </em>\n   at p. 2467, italics added.) The Court noted that it had prohibited the mandatory imposition of capital punishment and required sentencing authorities to consider the characteristics of a defendant and the circumstances of the offense before imposing a death sentence. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at pp. 2463-2464.) The import of this death penalty analogy-equating LWOP for juveniles to the death penalty for adults-cannot be overlooked. It is this analogy that motivated the high court to invoke the Eighth Amendment proportionality rule from the death penalty jurisprudence mandating individualized sentencing consideration for adult offenders and apply that rule to the imposition of LWOP, the harshest sentence that can be imposed on a juvenile.

(Maj.opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   p. 841.) But in holding that the provision of an opportunity for parole fixes the Eighth Amendment problem, the\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   court cited Wyoming Statutes section 6-10-301(c).

(Maj.opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   p. 839.) But it is extremely unlikely that the Legislature would repeal this parole mechanism after a California appellate court declares that the provisions of that measure are what make lengthy indeterminate sentencing of juveniles compliant with the Eighth Amendment. This is particularly true given that the motivation for enacting this legislation was the California Supreme Court's suggestion to enact a parole eligibility mechanism that provides juvenile offenders serving de facto LWOP sentences with the opportunity to obtain release on a showing of rehabilitation and maturity.

And\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   now establishes that on collateral review, a defendant is entitled to an opportunity for a parole hearing, so an outright repeal of S.B. 260 would be ineffective. As a general proposition, I disagree that a reviewing court should base its decision on the hypothetical prospect of repeal of a statute, and that seems especially so here in light of circumstances I have mentioned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   In the highly unlikely event there is a legislative repeal, the constitutionality of that action will no doubt be challenged in court.

Rules of Court, rule 4.437 [allowing defendants to file statements in mitigation prior to the sentencing hearing].) Thus, when trial attorneys do their jobs-a job that is no different whether individualized sentencing inquiry is constitutionally mandated or not-trial courts will be required to consider what has been proffered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   However, the Eighth Amendment simply does not require that courts engage in a\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   -style individual sentencing inquiry before imposing indeterminate sentences when there is a realistic opportunity to obtain release on parole during the defendant's expected lifetime.

One option to achieve that goal could be to legislatively require trial courts to engage in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   -style individual inquiry and modify the state's sentencing scheme to allow trial courts to impose specified lower sentences for juvenile offenders. But that is not the option adopted by our state's legislature. Instead, the Legislature opted to establish a parole mechanism, one that kicks in after 15, 20, and 25 years of incarceration depending\n   on the sentence. (\u00a7 3051, subd. (b)(1)-(3).) Under these circumstances, in my view, it is not appropriate for us to require a different option when the option adopted by the Legislature satisfies the Eighth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   There may be future legislation that establishes a requirement mandating that trial courts engage in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   -style individual sentencing inquiry. I suppose it is even possible that the California Judicial Council could, on its own or in the response to a legislative mandate, augment the Rules of Court discussed by the majority to add special mitigating factors for juveniles facing indeterminate sentences.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   But these possibilities will be the result of a policy determination, not a federal constitutional requirement. Or it could be that our high court ultimately employs a modified analysis under the California Constitution's prohibition against \"cruel or unusual\" punishment, requiring trial courts to engage in the specific individual sentencing consideration analysis set forth in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   as an extension of California's proportionality analysis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   But for now, the individual sentencing inquiry required by\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   is not required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   In summary, just as the United States Supreme Court banned the imposition of the death penalty on adults without an individualized sentencing inquiry, it also banned the imposition of LWOP on juveniles in homicide cases without individualized sentencing consideration. In doing so, the court in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   added the various attributes of youth to the factors sentencers must consider in the individual sentencing inquiry. The focus of the inquiry mandated by\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   is the question of whether the offense reflects irrevocable corruption, such that a sentence of LWOP is warranted. Thus, when considering imposition of an LWOP sentence for a juvenile offender, the Eighth Amendment requires that the trial court consider the factors outlined in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   . However, post-S.B. 260, no indeterminate sentence can be considered the functional equivalent of LWOP. Now, when a juvenile defendant\n   is sentenced to an indeterminate term, S.B. 260 provides a realistic opportunity to demonstrate maturity, rehabilitation and fitness to reenter\n   society and thereby obtain release on parole well within any juvenile defendant's expected lifetime. Thus, there is no Eighth Amendment violation if the trial court does not engage in the individual sentencing inquiry required by the Eighth Amendment in adult death penalty cases and juvenile LWOP cases, no matter how long the indeterminate sentence. Consequently, defendants' sentences do not violate the Eighth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   I close with one last observation. The majority acknowledges that after considering the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   factors, the minimum sentence the trial court can impose on remand here is 45 years to life. (Maj.opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   p. 836.) But S.B. 260 provides defendants with a parole opportunity after their 25th year of incarceration, regardless of whether the trial court imposes the 45 years to life sentence or some sentence lower than the original sentence, but higher than that minimum. Indeed, Adam and Isaac will have the benefit of S.B. 260 even if the trial court finds that the offenses here were not the result of transient immaturity, but rather reflect irrevocable corruption. My point is that both defendants will receive a parole hearing before the 45th year in their life term whatever the trial court does on remand. Thus, it seems to me that we ask the trial court to engage in an essentially meaningless act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   I would affirm the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-252\">\n    Because Adam and Jesse Cornejo have the same last name, we refer to them by their first names; for consistency, we also refer to Isaac Vasquez by his first name.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-253\">\n    Undesignated statutory references are to the Penal Code.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-254\">\n    Detective Sample was also the expert in\n    <em>\n     Prunty\n    </em>\n    .

(\u00a7 1170, subd. (d)(2)(E).) In addition to the facts required for the petition, in deciding whether to grant the petition, the court \"may consider\" the following facts: (1) prior to the commitment offense, the defendant had \"insufficient adult support or supervision and had suffered from psychological or physical trauma, or significant stress\"; (2) the defendant \"suffers from cognitive limitations due to mental illness, developmental disabilities, or other factors that did not constitute a defense, but influenced the defendant's involvement in the offense\"; (3) the defendant has performed acts that tend to indicate rehabilitation or show evidence of remorse; (4) the defendant has maintained family ties or connections; and (5) the defendant has no disciplinary actions for violent activities in the last five years in which the defendant was the aggressor.
