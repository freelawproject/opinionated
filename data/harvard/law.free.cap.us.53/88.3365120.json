That he did not notice any writing on the papers. That this was almost half an hour after the boat arrived at Rochester. The said United States Attorney thereupon asked the said witness whether the said steward, when he gave the said papers to the boy, gave any directions to the boy in respect to said papers. And the said counsel for the said defendant did then and there object, and insist that the said question was improper, and that the said witness ought not to answer the same.

He found it at the hotel at Albion, when he came back from Berne Centre..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-7\">On cross-examination, this witness testified, that he supposed, when he wrote, that the Empire would be the first boat out of Rochester, after -the receipt of the order by Palmer.

Palmer was then called and sworn, as a witness on behalf of the United States, and testified that he was the person of that name referred to in the testimony of the last witness, and had charge of the business of the firm at Rochester, for whom Brainard was peddling tobacco in May, 1846. That he frequently received orders from Brainard by mail and otherwise ; that the orders were all destroyed; that he never sent tobacco to peddlers except upon orders, unless they requested it before they left Rochester.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-5\">On cross-examination, he testified that he recollected sending tobacco by the defendant\u2019s boat, in May, 1846, to Brainard.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AVZ\">William Parmlee was then sworn, and called as a witness on behalf of the United States, and testified that, in May, 1846, he attended bar for Mr. Hopkins, at Albion. That he did not recollect handing any paper or letter to Kelsey, to be carried by him, or for any other purpose; that he had offered letters to Kelsey to carry, and he refused to carry them; that he recollected seeing Brainard giving a note to Kelsey, written on two thirds of a sheet of foolscap paper, and folded in about the size of an ordinary letter, to be carried to Rochester.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-7\">On cross-examination, the witness testified that the. boat Empire brought the tobacco from Rochester for Brainard; and he (the witness) paid the steward (Kelsey) half a dollar for bringing it, which Brainard afterwards repaid him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-8\">Said Kelsey was then call\u00e9d as a witness for the said United States, and testified that in May, 1846, he was steward of the Empire. The defendant was captain of the said boat; that he recollected the circumstances spoken of by Brainard and Sherman ; that Brainard came with a letter, and he (the witness) refused to take it; and that he soon afterwards brought the order spok\u00e9n of, which he (the witness) took, and, when he arrived at Rochester, sent to Mr. Palmer, and received the tobacco and carried it to Albion, for which he received a half dollar, which was a perquisite of his own.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-9\">The said United States Attorney thereupon rested the said cause, and the counsel for the defendant did then and there ask \u2022the said judge to direct the said jury that the said evidence did not establish a cause of action against the said defendant; and that the said defendant, upon the said evidence, was entitled to a verdict; and the said judge did thereupon, then and there declare and decide, that the said evidence, so as aforesaid given, did not establish a cause of action against the said defendant; and that the said paper, carried and conveyed by the steward of the said boat, from Albion to .Rochester, as aforesaid described by the witnesses, was not a letter or mailable matter within the meaning of tne act of Congress, but was a paper having a differ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>\u00e9nt and distinct character of its own, and could be lawfully carried by the said steward of the packet-boat aforesaid; and did then and there, for the reason aforesaid, direct the said jury, to find\u2019 a verdict for the said defendant.

That, although the amount in controversy is under the sum of two thousand dollars, yet this court has jurisdiction, under the act of 31st May, 1844: \u201c An act to amend the Judiciary act, passed the 24th September, 1789,\u201d whereby it is enacted, \u201c that final judgments in any Circuit Court of the United States, in any civil action, brought by the United States, for the enforcement of the revenue laws of the United States, or for the collection of the duties due, or alleged to be due, on merchandise imported therein, may be reexamined, and reversed or affirmed in the Supreme Court of the United States, without regard to the sum or value in controversy in such action, at the instance of either party.\u201d 5, Stat. at Large, 658. And that the laws relating to the revenue of the Post-Office Department are revenue laws, within the meaning of the above act. The act under which the suit is brought is entitled \u201c An act to reduce the rates of postage, &amp;e., and for the prevention of frauds on the revenue of. the Post-Office Department.\u201d 5 Stat. at Large, '736.

See testimony of Parmlee and Brainard.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b105-11\">1st.

A letter is a written communication from one person to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>another; neither external direction, nor sealing, nor envelope, are essential to a letter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-5\">3d. The paper in question being directed externally, was mailable matter; that is, had every requisite to enable it to be effectively transmitted by post.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-6\">. 4th. That here was an attempt to \u00e9vade the statute. The steward rejected what he describes as a letter, but conveyed a paper with, the same contents and direction. See Kelsey\u2019s testimony</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-7\"><em>Mr. Sackett </em>contended:</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-8\">1. This Court has no jurisdiction, less than $2,000 being in controversy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-9\">The act of 31st cif May, 1844, (5 Stat. at Large, 658,) giving to this court the right of review, on error, to a circuit court, in all \u201c civil actions for the enforcement of the revenue laws of the United States,\u201d does not apply to the act under which this suit is brought. That act is a law to carry out the power vested in Congress in relation, to post-offices and post-roads, and nof a revenue act. Art. 1, sec. 8, of the Constitution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-10\">The system of postages, established by that act, is. not a system of revenue. It is a plan of compensation for the .services of government in carrying the mails.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-11\">Revenue laws must be uniform. Sec. 8, Constitution. This law is but a graduated scale of rates charged for labor performed. Indeed, there is no power in Congress to convert its power \u201c to establish post-offices and post-roads\u201d into a revenue power. And though postages, however unequally levied, may incidentally produce revenue, they are not levied as revenue. Official fees of marshals, attorneys, &amp;c., that go into the Treasury, may as well be claimed to arise from the taxing or revenue power.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-12\">But if this be held to be a revenue law, query, does the act of 31st of May reach suits for penalties for its violation ? Such suits are not suits to enforc\u00e9 the law, but to punish for a breach of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-13\">2. The paper carried by Kelsey was not \u201c mailable matter.\u201d It was not a letter, and there is no other specification of \u201c mailable . matter,\u201d except letters, by which this case is even supposed to be embraced. The parties acted sincerely, and, as they believed, lawfully. It is said, on the other side, that the same thing was contained in the order, that was in the destroyed letter. . There is no proof of this; but if true it is of no legal consequence. The same word might have been sent verbally, and it would have been as much an evasion in one case as the other, so, far as payment was concerned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-14\">This paper was not a letter, a packet, or package ; it was an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>open request, a memorandum. To compel such papers to pass through the mails would be a most useless clog to business, and utterly derange the customs and conveniences of society. ' It is not intended by the post-office act to compel business into' the mails, but only to prevent what- naturally belongs to them from being drawn out by private hands. 5 Stat. at Large, 737, sec. 15.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-5\">. 3. If the paper carried was \u201cmailable matter,\u201d standing, alone, it was not so in its connection with the \u201c cargo \u201d of the boat. The act clearly contemplates that boats and vessels may do their own business in-relation to their own cargo, whether on board or to be procured. This will be seen from the language of the act. The 10th section, in stating the exceptions, says, \u201c except such as may have relation to some part of the cargo of such steamboat, packet-boat, or vessel, or to some article at the same time conveyed by the same stage-coach, railroad car, or other vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0\">In fact, if vessels on lakes, rivers, and canals, are not to be permitted to carry memorandums or orders, in relation to their cargo, either on board or to be procured, they will suffer endless inconvenience. For instance, a boat is passing, and a shipper wishes \u201c cargo \u201d put on board a few miles ahead; the mail may not pass in three days ; he wants to send by the boat an order to his agent to ship, under the rule contended for he cannot do it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-7\">4. The act is a penal one, and must be construed strictly. Its penal character is very extraordinary. It makes the innocent pay the penalty for the guilty. So in this case.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b107-8\">Mr. Justice McLEAN</author>\n<p id=\"AnN\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">This is a case on error, from the Circuit Court of- the Northern District of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">An action of debt was brought in the District Court, under the tenth section of the act of the 3d of March, 1825, entitled \u201cAn act to reduce the rates of postage, &amp;c., and for the prevention of frauds on the revenue of the Post-Office Department.\u201d ' It prohibits, under the penalties provided, any stagecoach, railroad car, steamboat, or other vehicle or vessel, Or any of the owners, managers, servants, or crews of either, which regularly performs trips on a post-route, on which the mail is carried, from transporting letters, packages, or other mailable matter, except such as may have relation to some part of the cargo, or to some article at the same time conveyed in a stage or other vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-11\">The declaration charged the defendant Bromley, as the captain of the packet-boat Empire, which regularly performed trips <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>on the canal between Albion and Rochester, in the State of New York, on which line the mail was transported, under the authority of the Post-Office Department, with transporting, otherwise than in the mail, divers letters, packets, and packages of letters, then and there being mailable matter, other than newspapers, &amp;c., not having relation to the cargo.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Th\u00e9 defendant pleaded <em>nil </em>debet, and the plaintiffs joined issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Evidence Was given to show that the defendant was captain of the boat Empire, which performed trips between the places stated, and that the mail was regularly conveyed on the same route in 1845 and 1846. That Brainard, one of the witnesses, gave a note to Kelgey, the steward of the boat, written on two thirds of a. sheet of foolscap paper, and folded the size of an ordinary letter, with a direction upon it, to be carried to Rochester. That the letter, was an order to Mr. Palmer for tobacco, which was sent by the return boat, and for which Kelsey, the bearer, received fifty cents.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">The testimony being closed, the defendant prayed the judge to instruct the jury that it did not establish a cause of action against the defendant; and the judge instructed the jury that the paper conveyed by the steward of the boat, Kelsey, from Albion to Rochester, as sworn to by the witnesses, was not a letter or mailable matter, within the meaning of the act of Congress ; but was a paper having a different and distinct character of its own, and could be lawfully carried by the said steward of the packet-boat aforesaid, and did therefore direct the jury to find for the defendant, which they did; and to which instruction the plaintiff excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">The cause was afterwards removed to the Circuit Court by writ of error, and by which court the \u2022 judgment of the District Court was affirmed. This judgment of affirmance is now before us for revision.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">This writ of error was issued under the act of the 31st. of May, 1844, entitled (tAn act to amend the Judiciary Act passed the 24th September,' 1789, which provides that final judgments in any Circuit Court of the United States, in any civil action brought by the United States for the enforcement of the revenue laws of the United States, or for the collection of the duties due on merchandise imported therein, may be. examined, and reversed or affirmed in the Supreme Court of the United States, without regard to the sum or value in controversy in such action, at the instance of- either party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">That the act which prescribes the offence charged is a revenue law, there would seem to be .no doubt. In its title, it is declared to.be an act to reduce the rates of postage, and for the \u201c pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>vention of frauds on the revenue of the Post-Office Department.\u201d In its character and object it is a revenue law* as it acts upon the rates of postage and increases the revenue by prohibiting and punishing fraudulent acts which lessen it. Under the act of 1836, the revenue of the Post-Office Department is paid into the treasury. Revenue is the income of a State, and the revenue of the Post-Office Department, being raised by a,tax on mailable matter, conveyed in the mail, and which is disbursed in the public service, is as much a part of the income of the government as moneys collected for duties on imports.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">We think the instruction of the court was erroneous. The letter or order, as it is called by some of the witnesses, was folded in the form of a letter and directed as such, though it was not sealed. A seal was not necessary to constitute it a letter or to make it chargeable with postage. The letter was not within the exception of the statute, as it did not relate to-the cargo or to any article on board of the boat. It was an order for tobacco on Mr. Palmer, of Rochester, who was a dealer in that article. Among merchants, an order to the wholesale dealer for merchandise is a common subject of correspondence. And it may be doubted whether any other subject can be named on which more letters are -\\toitten and forwarded in the mail. Two thirds of the half sheet which composed the letter was covered with writing, from which an inference may be drawn, that something more than a mere order for goods was requested by the writer. But an order for goods, folded and directed as a letter, is clearly mailable matter, and a conveyance of it, as charged, is a violation of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The judgment of the Circuit Court is reversed, and the cause is remanded to that court for further proceedings, according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">\n<em>Order.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record, from the Circuit Court of the United States for the Northern District of New York, and was argued by counsel.
