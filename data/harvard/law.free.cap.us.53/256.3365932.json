Hitchcock resisted the payment of the debt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>upon the plea of usury.

James Erwin, her brother, purchased at sheriff\u2019s sale, all the right and title of Hitchcock, to a part of the property, for fifty dollars, and procured an attornment from the tenants.

The consideration was one hundred and fifty thousand' dollars, which, it was alleged, was to be appropriated to the payment of other debts of Hitchcock, which were not secured by mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-5\">3. A release by the bank to Anne Hitchcock. This recited the bond, the mortgage, the delivery to the bank, by Anne, of the lands and houses devised to her, and then agreed that the bank should look only to the mortgaged property for the payment of its debt, and should surrender the notes and bills given by Hitchcock t\u00f3 the bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-6\">After the execution of these deeds, but within a year from the death of her husband; viz., on the 15th August, 1840, Anne refused to qualify as executrix, and repudiated the provisions made for her in the will, and claimed dower in lieu thereof. These papers were filed and recorded in the Orphans\u2019 Court of Mobile county; whereupon Isaac H. Erwin was appointed administrator with the will annexed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-7\">In 1840, the bank filed a bill in the Court of Chancery at Mobile, against Isaac H. Eiwin, Anne, and her children, which court decided that the property was properly held by the bank under the deeds, and that the defendants should be foreclosed unless the debt and costs were paid by a certain day. This decree was carried by appeal to the Supreme Court of Alabama, and there affirmed at January term, 1845.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-8\">On the 23d of April, 1847, Anne Hitchcock filed a bill in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District of Alabama, against the bank, claiming dower in the lands included in the mortgage. The bank answered; evidence was taken, and the judge of the Circuit Court decided that the complainant was entitled to dower, and decreed that it should be set off to her. From this decree the bank appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b272-9\">It was argued by <em>Mr. Bradley </em>and <em>Mr. Campbell, </em>for the appellants, and by <em>Mr. Hopkins </em>and <em>Mr. Badger, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-10\">The following is an outline of the arguments of the respective counsel.-</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-11\">The counsel for the appellants contended:</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-12\">1. That the deed of Mrs. Hitchcock, written underneath the deed of her husband, dated of the same date, and which, she says in her answer to the trustees of the Bank of the United States in the chancery suit, was designed as a joining in the mortgage of her husband, was legal, valid, and operative, and that this has been already determined judicially.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-13\">The complaint of Mrs. Hitchcock is, that the notary, in de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>scribing the paper acknowledged by her, says that it was the said \u201c Indenture of Mortgage,\u201d and that by no construction can these words be held to describe the deed of relinquishment of dower. It is said she did really sign and seal the mortgage with her husband, but she employed no terms of grant in its body; and that her acknowledgment must be confined to the execution of that paper, and to have no relation to the deed immediately following, and signed the same day, and which was- present, and held by the notary who took the acknowledgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-5\">We contend that the mortgage to the bank consisted of the estate of Henry Hitchcock, unembarrassed by the claim for dower, and that there was no misnomer in the designation of the whole instrument, which exhibited the grant of that estate, and the renunciation of the dower claim, \u201c as an indenture of mortgage.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-6\">We contend, further, that the acknowledgment certified must be taken to have, been of the whole transaction to which Mrs. Hitchcock was a party, and which is contained in the instrument executed by her. Such was the intention of all concerned with it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-7\">Mrs. Hitchcock, in her relinquishment,-refers to the deed of her husband four times. She describes herself as the wife of the said Henry Hitchcock; she refers twice to the grantees as the said Cowperthwaite, &amp;c.; she refers to the premises as \u201c the above-described premises.\u201d The instrument is of the same date.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-8\">The principle of construction applicable,'then, to this instrument is that, found in Lord Cromwell\u2019s case, Coke\u2019s R. book 2, 75. \u201c The law will not adjudge by parcels in subversion of the intent and agreement of the parties; but when all acts are done in performance of the original contract and agreement of the parties, the law will judge upon the whole as executed at one and the same time.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-9\">Here the execution of the deed and the acknowledgment bear the same date, are on the same paper, and are obviously pursuant to the same contract. \u201c The end of the law is to settle, repose, and make peace between man and man concerning their possessions, and it would be too dangerous. a thing to make any construction against the allowance in common assurances; for thereupon would rise infinite contentions, quarrels and suits, which would be inconvenient.\u201d Selwyn <em>v. </em>Selwyn, 2 Burr. 1131; Vaughan <em>v. </em>Atkins, 5 Burr. 2764, 2787. There the court says, \u201c that the several parts and ceremonies necessary to complete a conveyance shall be taken together as one act, and operate from the substantive part of it, by relation.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-10\">\u2022 It is riot denied that the manifest intention was that the dower <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>of Mrs. Hitchcock should not encumber the estate of the mortgagees. It was designed that the mortgage should cover that estate. When her signature appears on the mortgage, and her acknowledgment is, that she executed the \u201c indenture of mortgage,\u201d what is the interpretation to be put upon her words ? Must we not hold that her acknowledgment applies to the papers. .executed by her, and under which her acknowledgment is certified ? Lawrence <em>v. </em>Blatchford, <em>2 </em>Ver. 457; Van Hagen <em>v. </em>Van Rensselaer, 18 Johns. 420, 16 Viner\u2019s Abr. 138, Chitty on Contracts, 90.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-6\">The same principle of construction has been fully recognized in Alabama. Bradford <em>v. </em>Dawson, 2 Ala. R. 203; Hines <em>v. </em>Bank of Alabama, 2 Ala. 452, 482; Sewall <em>v. </em>Henry, 9 Ala. 24.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-7\">For applications of the same principle, see 11 Verm. 221,15 Verm. 472.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-8\">The court would then look to the whole instrument to find what was understood by the acknowledgment made by Mrs. Hitchcock with a view of sustaining the conveyance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-9\">,2. We contend that if the question were open, upon the au\u00bb. thorities and arguments we have adduced, a similar decision would be proper. \" \u25a0</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-10\">3. We contend that, on the 8th February, 1840, in so far as we are concerned, Mrs. Hitchcock accepted the provisions of her-husband\u2019s will, and was invested with every right it gave, and divested of every right antagonistic or adverse. ' That this'elec tion appears by the deed to the trastees, and was for.a valuable consideration. That she conveyed by that deed every right and estate in the land she had or might derive from the. most solernfe \u2022and authentic acceptance of the terms of the will, and we say that this conclusion legally results from the decree of the Court of Chancery. . . \"</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-12\">4. We contend that, whether the renunciation of Mrs. Hitchcock had been prior or subsequent to the execution of her deed of the 8th of February, the effect of her deed is the same. That\" the deed operates upon the estates, rights, and claims she. then had of every name and nature. That the deed bars an inchoate or unassigned dower estate, as well as an equity of redemption.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-14\">\u2022It is perfect and all comprehensive, not only as a release and quitclaim but as a cqnveyance. It purports to transfer rights as well as to discharge claims.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-15\">5. We contend that all these claims were properly raised, or might have been raised, in the suit in chancery at Mobile between Mi-s. \"Hitchcock and the plaintiffs in error. That the adjudication in that court covers all the questions of right that are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>embraced in this suit, or that they were the appropriate subjects of adjudication then, and waived by her if not legally presentee!: That the title of the trustees was quieted by that litigation, and ought not to be disturbed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-5\">The counsel then proceeded to argue these points, and cited Drew <em>v. </em>Norbury, 3 Jon. &amp; Lat. 284, to show that where a person had several estates and interest, they all passed under a deed. Sugden on Powers, 82; Hobart, 153; 10 Vesey, 246; Note 7 to Appendix 2 Co. Litt. 800, (Thomas\u2019s Coke); and that even supposing that the widow\u2019s dower did not pass under the mortgage, and that her deed to the trustees only conveyed her interest under the will, still she could not recover in this suit. That she was estopped by her deed from disputing the validity artd binding operation of the will, and from defeating the estate she claimed under it, by holding up a title she might have possessed at the time of her deed in contradiction to that she purports to convey under the will. 1 Metcalf, 180; 8 Ham. 180; 6 East, 105; Carver <em>v. </em>Jackson, 4 Pet. 85, 86; Harding <em>v. </em>Ambler, 3 M. &amp; Wels. 279; 2 Adol. &amp; E. 278; 1 Id. 792; 1 Ired. 566.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-6\">Whether, in the absence of any statutory provision, her acts, apart from this deed, would amount to an acceptance of the provisions of the will, will appear from 2 Yeates, 102; 6 Rand. 541; 17 S. &amp; R. 16; 4 H. &amp; M. 23; 3 Yeates, 79; 3 Fairf. 138; 10 Johns. 30.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b275-7\">The counsel for the appellee</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AC-\">made, amongst others, the following points:</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-8\">1. The mortgage is the deed of Henry Hitchcock only. His wife is no party to it. It contains no words of grant from her. Her name is not mentioned in the deed, not even in the clause of attestation. If she signed and sealed the mortgage, such acts would not make it her deed, and would leave her right to dower unimpaired. 4 How. Rep. (U. S.) 241, 242; 9 Mass. Rep. 218; 3 Mason\u2019s Cir. Ct. Rep. 347, 349; 16 Ala. Rep. 130; 7 Ohio Rep. 195; 10 Ohio Rep. 305-307; 7 Mass. Rep. 14; 13 Mass. Rep. 223.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIX\">2. The certificate of the notary that she acknowledged she signed, sealed, and delivered the indenture of mortgage, gives no effect to the mortgage against her right to dower, because the acknowledgment was of the deed of mortgage, which could not convey her right of dower, as it was not her .deed, and contained no grant from her. The interest of a married woman in real estate can be conveyed only by a grant from her in a deed, to which she is a party. The execution of her deed must be acknowledged by her before an officer authorized to receive it, and in the mode prescribed by law. \u2022' The fact that she made the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>acknowledgment and in the legal mode, can be proved only'by the certificate thereof made by a proper officer, and the'one before whom the acknowledgment was made. 4 How. Rep. (U. S.) 242; 3 Mason\u2019s Cir. Ct. Rep. 348, 349 ; 9 Mass. Rep. 218; 2 Story\u2019s Eq. 618; sect. 1391; Macqueen on Husband and Wife, Appendix No. 1, 37, 38; Id. No. 2, 49.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b276-5\">6. The relinquishment, if she had acknowledged the execution, of it, would be no bar to her right to dower. The statute law requires such a deed to be made and acknowledged by a wife as would convey her own estate, if her deed included her own land. Such a deed, properly acknowledged, will convey her dower, if her right to dower be her interest in the real estate, included in her deed. Clay\u2019s Dig. <em>155, </em>sect. 27, 28; 7 Mass. Rep. 14, 20; Aik. Dig. 93, sect. 29.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b276-6\">11. The effect of the acts of Mrs. Hitchcock, in taking possession of the mortgaged premises and conveying the equity of redemption, was not an election on her part of the trust made in the will for her benefit. Her possession and conveyance were in effect as trustee for the creditors who were beneficiaries. She did no act, in her individual character, unconnected with the relation of trustee which she bore to others, and secured by her conveyance no benefit for herself. 1 P. Wms. 315, 318; 1 Vesey, Jr. 335; 12 Vesey, 136; 3 Stewart\u2019s Rep. 375.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b276-7\">If her acts had evinced her intention to elect the trust intended by the testator for her benefit, they would not bind her, -as it does not appear that she then had full knowledge of her rights. 2 Vesey, Jr. 572, 577; 12 Vesey, 151, 152; 2 Johns. Ch. R. 451; 2 Vesey, 367, 371.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b276-8\">The deposition of C.ope proves that the deed of Mrs. Hitchcock to the trustees of the bank, and .the deed of release from Cope and others to her were delivered at the same time. This is competent evidence. 3 Mason\u2019s Circ. Ct. Rep. 348; 15-Pet. 21. They are therefore parts of the same contract, and the release of Cope and others to her was the consideration of her deed to them. 1 Vesey, Sen. 127, 133; 7 B. Monroe\u2019s Rep. 345, 347; 2 Wheat. 290, 291, 299. As Mrs. Hitchcock received, no consideration in money or in a:ay thing else of value to herself, her dower would not be barred by the deed, if a release of her right to dower were expressly made in the deed, and she had intended to make it. 3 Johns, R. 478, 479-488; 16 Johns. R. 47, 48.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b276-9\">The answer of the appellants in effect admits that the release of the mortgage debt was the consideration of -Mrs. -Hitchcock\u2019s deed to the trustees of the .bank.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b276-10\">It is stated in the answer that the sum of one hundred and fifty thousand dollars was paid to Mrs. Hitchcock or her agent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>as a part of the consideration for her release, to be applied to the payment of other debts of her husband'. If the whole consideration had been money paid by the bank upon an agreement with Mrs. Hitchcock, that it should be applied by her to the payment of other debts of the mortgagor, it would not enlarge the operation of her release of the equity of redemption, and make it a conveyance also of the dower. 7 Cranch, 34, 35, 46, 47.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b277-4\">Mr. Justice GRIER</author>\n<p id=\"Aer\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The respondent, Mrs. Anne Hitchcock, was complainant below, in two bills filed in the Circuit Court of Alabama, claiming her dower in certain property in the city of Mobile, of which her late husband, Henry Hitchcock, was seized in hit lifetime, and of which the appellants, as trustees of the United States Bank, were in possession, claiming under a mortgage given by said Henry.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The answer admits the marriage of' complainant, and the .seizin and death of her husband, and that the appellants hold the property under a deed of mortgage from him; but deny that complainant has any right of dower in the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">1st.

That after the death of her husband, the complainant took possession of his property as <em>sole devisee in fee, and </em>surrendered the possession to the mortgagees in satisfaction of the debt, and for a large consideration paid to her executed a full and absolute release to them of all her. right, title, interfest, and estate, in the mortgaged property.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">3d. That she was estopped by a decree of the court of Alabama, on a bill filed by the mortgagees for a foreclosure and to have their title quieted.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">If the appellants can succeed in establishing either of these three grounds of defence, they will be entitled to a decree in their favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">We will therefore consider them in their order.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">I. The instrument of mortgage is dated on the 14th July, 1838. The first part of it is a deed poll in, the usual form \u2018/Know all men, &amp;c., that I, Henry Hitchcoc of Mobile, &amp;c., in consideration of the sum of \u00a1$620,530.96, to me in hand paid, by these presents do grant, bargain, sell, &amp;c.,\u201d and concluding, \u201c Given under my hand and seal, &amp;c.,\u201d and signed \u201c Henry Hitchcock, Anne Hitchcock,\u201d with their respective seals; also these words, \u201c Signed, sealed, and delivered in presence of,\u201d but no names of witnesses annexed.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>Under these signatures and attestation is the following release, signed and sealed by Anne Hitchcock:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-5\">\u201cAnd I, Anne Hitchcock, wife of the said Henry Hitchcock, for and in consideration of the sum of one dollar, to m\u00e9 in hand paid by the said Joseph Cowperthwaite, Thomas Dunlap, and Herman Cope, have relinquished, and hereby do relinquish by these presents, all my right and title of dower in and to the above-described premises, to the said Joseph Cowperthwaite, Thomas Dunlap, and Herman Cope, the survivors or survivor of them, and to the heirs, executors, and assigns of such survivor, forever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-6\">Witness my hand and seal, this fourteenth day of July, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-eight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-7\">Anne Hitchcock. [Seal.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-8\">Attest: Charles A.,Marston.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">The acknowledgment which appears to have been taken at the same time is as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-10\">\u201c The State of Alabama,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-11\">\n<em>Mobile County.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-12\">Personally appeared before me, Charles A. Marston, notary-public in and for said county, the above-named Henry Hitchcock, who acknowledged that he signed, sealed, and delivered the foregoing indenture of mortgage to Joseph Cowperthwaite, Thomas Dunlap, and Herman Cope, on the day and year therein mentioned. And also appeared personally \u2022 before me, Charles A. Marston, Anne Hitchcock, the wife of said H. Hitchcock, who being examined privately and apart from her said husband, acknowledged that she signed, sealed, and delivered the said indenture of mortgage.freely, and of her own. accord, and without any fear, threats, or compulsion of her said husband.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-13\">Given under my hand and seal notarial, this fourteenth day of July, A. D. 1838.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-14\">Charles A. Marston.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-15\">The objections to the sufficiency of this instrument to bar the dower of the wife, are, 1st, \u201c That the mortgage is the deed of the husband only. It contains no words of grant by the wife \u2014her name is not mentioned in the deed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-16\">2d. That the relinquishment of dower is \u00e1 several and separate deed, which should have the signature of the husband, to show his consent, and that it was the joint act of husband and wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-17\">3d. That the acknowledgment of Mrs. Hitchcock is of \u201c the said 'indenture of mortgage,\u201d and not of her relinquishment of dower.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>And, 4th. That the acknowledgment is not in due form of law; '</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">The first three of these objections are founded on the assumption that the release of Mrs. Hitchcock forms no part of the deed of mortgage, but is a separate and distinct deed. It is true, if that portion of the instrum\u00e9nt, above the joint signatures of the husband and wife, is to be construed as. the whole indenture of mortgage, the first proposition cannot be denied. For the instrument, thus far, does not purport to dispose of any right or interest vested in the wife; and if nothing further had been added, the deed would have been wholly inoperative for that purpose. But the face of the instrument shows that it does not end' there: for it proceeds, \u201c And I, Anne Hitchcock, &amp;e., in consideration of the sum of one dollar to me in hand paid by the said Joseph, &amp;c., do relinquish all my right and title of dower in and to the above-described premises to the said Joseph, &amp;c.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Usually this initiate and contingent right of dower is b\u00e1rred, in deeds of sale and mortgage, by a conveyance making the grant in the joint names of the husband and wife, in the same manner as if the estate belonged to the <em>wife; </em>the deed operating by way of <em>estoppel when the </em>right of <em>dower \\becomes </em>complete by the death of the husband. But when the legal estate is vested wholly in the husband, and the right of the wife is but a contingent incumbrance, there is no necessity that she should join in the grant of the fee, the release of her inchoate, right acknowledged in due form, being all that is necessary to bar her from setting up a, claim of dower, after the death of her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">The insertion of the clause of release of dower might generally be considered by conveyancers as in better taste, if it had preceded the signature and attestation of the other covenante which\u2019 affected the fee of the husband; but there is no stringent unbending rule of law, which requires a deed to be in such form, or in any peculiar form, in order to operate as a valid conveyance. The intention of the parties is to be gathered from an inspection of the whole instrument of assurance taken together. It ought not to be dislocated and rent into separate fragments by a captious or astute construction, whose only result is to defeat the plain meaning and intention of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">The acts of Assembly of Alabama concerning conveyances, frequently use the phrase \u201c deeds and relinquishments of dower,\u201d which is probably the cause or the consequence of this form of conveyancing in that State, and that in popular parlance, a conveyance of land in this form is described as if a \u201c relinquishment of dower \u201d was not a deed, or a portion of the conveyance,- assurance,, or grant, though made at the same time, and forming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>a portion of it. The instrument before us, composed of what is popularly called the mortgage and relinquishment of dower, con\u00bb stitutes but one deed or conveyance executed by husband and wife for the purpose of conveying the fee vested in the husband, and releasing the inchoate right of the wife. It was all written on the same paper or parchment, for one purpose, the latter sentences connected with those which precede it, by a copulative conjunction. \u25a0 It was all executed at the same time, and acknowledged by husband and wife at the time of its execution; and they have each signed that portion of the conveyance which purports to grant or release their several interests. The relative position of the signatures of the husband and wife, or the unnecessary duplication of either, is of little importance, where the instrument, by apt and proper terms, clearly shows the intention of the parties, that the husband should convey the fee, and the wife join with him in the deed, for the purpose of releasing her contingent estate of dower. In such cases, and especially where this form of assurance is in common use, the <em>astutia, </em>of a court would be illy employed in criticizing the form of the conveyance, in order that one of the parties may be enabled to escape from his covenants, and thus wrong and defraud the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Let us now examine whether the acknowledgment of the wife is sufficient, according to the statutes of Alabama, to operate as a conveyance or relinquishment of her right of dower.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">'The act of Assembly of Alabama on this subject (Aikin\u2019s Digest, 93, \u00a7 29) is a's follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-7\">\u201c No estate of a <em>feme </em>covert, in any lands, tenements, or hereditaments, lying and being in this territory, shall pass by her deed or conveyance, without a previous acknowledgment made by her on a private examination apart from her husband, before one of the territorial judges, or one of the justices of the County Court, that she signed, sealed, and delivered the same as her voluntary act and deed, freely, without any fear, threats, or compulsion of her husband, and a certificate thereof, written on or under the said deed or conveyance, and signed by the officer before whom it was made; and every deed or conveyance so executed and acknowledged by a <em>feme </em>covert, and certified as aforesaid, shall release and bar her right of dower, and be good and effectual to convey the lands, tenements, and hereditaments thereby intended to be conveyed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">One of the objections to the acknowledgment of Mrs. Hitchcock is, that she acknowledges to have signed and sealed <em>\u201c </em>the said indenture' of mortgage,\u201d and not that part of it called the \u201c relinquishment of dower.\u201d This objection we think is- hypercritical. \u201c <em>Hasret in Ktem.\u201d </em>It is founded on the assumption which we have ju3t noticed, that the several covenants signed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>by the husband and wife do not constitute one assurance or deed of mortgage. The same criticism would annul the acknowledgment of the husband, which is, \u201c that he executed the foregoing indenture,\u201d whereas the deed signed by him is a deed poll and not an indenture. Surely no court would declare his acknowledgment invalid for this slight misnomer. It would, certainly, be no great latitude of construction, even if they were separate and distinct instruments, to refer the acknowledgment of the wife to that one which contains her own grant or release, and which she has signed and sealed. Even in cases of doubtful construction, the rule of law is, that the court should construe the instrument <em>ut res magis valent,* </em>and not annul it by such fanciful criticism.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">It is objected, also, that this acknowledgment is not in the very words of the statute. In place of the words, \u201c as her vbluntary act and deed,. freely,\u201d it substitutes the words, \u201c <em>freely </em>and of her own accord.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A5c\">That the words of the acknowledgment have the same meaning, and are in substance the same with those used in the statute it needs no argument to demonstrate; and that such an acknowledgment is a sufficient compliance with the statute' to give validity to the deed of the wife, is not only consonant with reason, but, as the cases cited by counsel show, supported by very numerous authorities. The act requires a private examin-\u2019 ation of the wife to ascertain that she acts freely and not by compulsion of her husband, but it prescribes no precise form of words to be used in the certificate, nor requires that it should contain all the synonymes used in the statute to express the meaning of the legislature. In other acts of the same legislature, where a precise form of acknowledgment of certain deeds is prescribed, it is provided, that \u201c any certificate of probate or acknowledgment of any such deed, shall be good and effectual if it contain the substance, whether it be in the form or not, of that set forth in the first section of this act.\u201d Clay\u2019s Dig. 153. -The legislature have thus shown a laudable anxiety to hinder a construction of their statutes, which would require a stringent adherence to a mere form of words without regard! to their meaning or substance, and make the validity of titles to depend on the verbal accuracy of careless scriveners.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">We are, therefore, of opinion that the certificate of the acknowledgment of the complainant of the deed executed by her, is valid and sufficient in law to bar her claim of dower in the mortgaged premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">II. But, even if this deed of mortgage were not a sufficient \u25a0 bar to the claim, we are of opinion that the deed of release exe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>cuted by the complainant on the 8th of February, 1840, is a complete bar and estoppel to the, claim set up in her bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Henry Hitchcock died in August, 1839, having first made his will, in which he devises all his estate, real and personal, to the complainant in trust to sell and dispose of the same, and invest it for the use of herself and children, share and share alike. Under this devise she entered and. took possession of the estate of her husband, and, in consideration of the sum of $150,000, paid to her by the trustees of the. bank, and of a release by them of all claim upon the other estate of the deceased, she executed, on ,8th of February, 1840, \u00e1 deed of release of the. mortgaged property, containing the following recitals and covenants. \u201c This indenture, made, &amp;c., between Anne Hitchcock, widow and sole devisee of Henry Hitchcock, acting under and by virtue of the last will and testament, of said Henry Hitchcock, duly proved, &amp;e., of the first part, and Joseph Cowperthwaite, &amp;c., of the second. part, witnesseth, that the party of the first part, for,- and in consideration of the sum of $773,352, &amp;c., hath remised, conveyed, and forever quitclaimed, and doth remise, &amp;c., \u2022 to the said parties of the second part, all the estate, right, title, interest, use, property, claim, and demand whatsoever, at law as well as in equity, in possession as well as in reversion of, in, to, or out of all. and singular, the following described premises, to wit, &amp;c., &amp;e.: \u201c To have and to hold all and singular the afores.aid lands, tenements, improvements, and appurtenances, unto the said parties of the second part, the survivors and survivor of them, and the heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns of said survivor to their own proper use, benefit, and behoof forever; so that neither the said party of the first part, her heirs off assigns, nor any person or persons whatsoever, in trust for them or her, or in her or their name or names, can or may, by any ways or means whatsoever, hereafter have, claim, challenge, or. demand any right, title, interest or estate of, in, to, or out of all and singular the premises above described, and \u25a0 hereby released and conveyed; but therefrom and thereout are and shall be by these presents forever excluded and debarred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">By. the law of Alabama, the wide W is allowed one year after probate of the will to make her election, whether to take under it or not. The will of Henry Hitchcock was admitted to probate on the, 17th August, 1839, and cm the 14th of August, 1840, the widow filed her election, renouncing all benefit under .the will and electing to take her dower. This bill was filed on the 29th of April, 1847, nearly seven years afterwards.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">She makes no offer in her bill to restore the sum of $150,000 paid to her or her agent, or to surrender the release given to her by the trustees.of the bank which was the consideration paid for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>her release, but contends that she is remitted to her original rights by her last election, and is not estopped by her deed which was merely the execution of a power, and could not affect her personal right, or bar her claim to dower in the land conveyed or released.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">It is admitted, that the mere equity of redemption of this property was worth nothing; on the contrary, the other property of the mortgagor would have been liable for a large portion of the bond which accompanied the mortgage. Yet, it is contended, that the widow may elect to take under this devise in the will; that, under pretence and belief of such election, she may get her husband\u2019s estate released from a debt and receive a large consideration in money for a release of her title as \u201c sole devisee,\u201d and afterwards change her election, defeat all the covenants of her own deed, and yet retain the whole consideration paid for it. It is not worth while to examine what acts of a widow amount to an election <em>in pais </em>to take under the will. It is clear she cannot take possession, under the will and sell the title in fee conferred upon her by the devises in it, and then revoke her grant by changing her election within the year. \u25a0 The time given to the widow by the law, to make her election, is intended for her protection, and not that she shall use it as a we\u00e1pon of, offence to defraud others. Courts of equity do not exert their powers, even in favor of widows, to assist them in such a transaction. The deed executed by the complainant in 1840 is an estoppel, both in law and equity, against this claim of dower. By this deed, she professes to convey, as \u201c widow,\u201d \u201c sole devisee,\u201d and under the powers vested in her by the will. She releases all claim or demand in law or equity, in possession or expectancy, \u201cso that neither she,.nor her heirs, can or may, by any ways or means whatsoever, hereafter have, claim, challenge, or demand any right, title, interest, or estate in the premises.\u201d' It is hard to conceive how any conveyancer could devise language more comprehensive, or legal phraseology mor\u00e9 stringent, to convey every possible estate of the grantor and operate as a perfect legal estoppel against all possible claim in any character whatever. If this had been a mere naked power of appointment, or to make a conveyance of the title of the deceased, not coupled, with an interest, and the widow had intended merely to exercise such power without affecting her own right in th'e property, her deed should have been carefully drawn,.so as to show on its face an intention to save her own.rights, if she did not intend to convey them. For, it is a settled rule of construction, that \u201c whoever conveys to a purchaser, without restraining \u2022 the operation of his conveyance, shall be deemed to convey in every .character, which enabled him to give effect to \u25a0 his deed.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>Sugden, on Powers, 82; Coxe <em>v. </em>Chamberlain, 4 Ves. Jr. 637, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">This cage is much stronger against the grantor; for her deed was worthless, unless she had elected to take' the devise under the will, and having recited in her deed, that she was \u201c widow and sole devisee,\u201d she is thereby estopped from denying that she conveyed all rights he\u00edd in either character, or, as between her and the grantees, ever asserting, that she had not elected to take as sole devisee.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Being, therefore, of opinion, that the. complainant below is doubly estopped from setting up this claim of dower,, it will be unnecessary to consider the third point of defence urged by appellant\u2019s counsel, as to the effect of the decree of foreclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">The decree of the Circuit Court is therefore reversed, and the bill dismissed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">\n<em>Order.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record, from the Circuity Court of the United States for the. Southern District of Alabama, and was argued by' counsel. On consideration whereof, it is now here ordered, adjudged, and decreed by this court, that the d\u00e9cree of the said Circuit Court in this cause be, and the same is hereby, reversed, with costs; and that this cause be, and the same is hereby, remanded ito the said Circuit Court, with directions to dismiss the bill of complaint with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
