Cooley, Plaintiff in Error, <em>v. </em>The Board of Wardens of the Port of Philadelphia, to the use of the Society for the Relief of distressed Pilots, their Widows and Children, Defendants. Same <em>v. </em>Same.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b311-8\">A law of the State of Pennsylvania, that, a vessel which neglects or .refuses to take a pilot shall forfeit and pay to the master warden of the pilots, for the use of the Society for the relief of Distressed and Decayed Pilots, their widows and children, one half the regular amount of pilotage, is an appropriate part of a general system of regulations on the subject of pilotage, and cannot be considered as a covert attempt to legislate upon another subject, under the appearance of legislating on this one.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Aerg\">Nor can the exemption of American vessels .engaged in the Pennsylvania coal-trade from the-npeessity of paying half pilotage, be declared to be other than a fair exercise of legislative discretion, acting upon the' subject of the regulation of the pilot-age-of the port of Philadelphia. \u2022</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b311-11\">The law of Pennsylvania is, therefore, not inconsistent with the second and third clauses Of the tenth section of the first article of the Constitution of the \"United States. Imposts, and duties on imports, exports, and tonnage, were understood, ' when the Constitution was formed, to mean-totally distinct things from fees of pilotage.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b311-13\">Nor is the law repugnant to the first clause of the eighth section of the first article of the Constitution, because, as the charge is not a duty, import, or excise; there is no necessity for its being uniform throughout the United States.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b311-14\">Neither is the law repugnant to the fifth clause of the ninth-section of'the first article of the Constitution; heeaus\u00e9 it neither gives a preference of one port over another, nor does it require a vessel to pay duties.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b311-15\">Upon this point,'the act of Congress, passed in 1789, (1 Stat. at Large, 5,4,) recognizing the pilot-laws of the States, is entitled to great weight, as -showing that these laws neither levied duties hor gave a preference of one port over another.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b311-16\">Moreover, the law'is not inconsistent with the third clause of the eighth section of the first article of the Constitution.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b311-17\">It is true that the power to regulate commerce includes the regulation of navigation, and that pilot-laws are regulations of navigation, and-, therefore, of commerce, within the grant to Congress of the commercial power.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b311-18\">But the mere grant of the commercial power to Congress, does not forbid the States from passing laws to regulate pilotage. The power to regulate commerce includes various subjects; upon some of which there should be a uniform rule, and upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>others different rules in different localities. The power is exclusive in Congress in the former, but not so in the latter class.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b312-5\">Although Congress may legislate upon the subject of pilotage throughout the United States, yet they have manifested an intention not to overrule the State laws, except in one instance. The law of Pennsylvania, not being overruled, is not repugnant to the Constitution of the United States.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-6\">These two cases were brought up from the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, by writs of error; issued under the twenty-fifth section of the Judiciary Act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-7\">They both depended upon the same principle, were argued alid decided together, and will be treated as one. The only difference between them was, that the pilotage was demanded from two different vessels, the Undine and the Consul. .. Cooley was the consignee of both vessels.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-8\">The twenty-ninth section of the act passed by the Legislature of Pennsylvania on the 2d of March, 1803, is set forth at length in the opinion of the court and need not be repeated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-9\">The board of wardens brought an action of debt before Aider-man Smith, against' Cooley for half-pilotage, due by a vessel which sailed from Philadelphia without a pilot, when one might have been had. The magistrate .gave judgment for the plaintiffs, and the defendant appealed to the Court of Common Pleas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-10\">In that court,, a declaration in debt was filed by the plaintiff below. In the case of the Undine, the defendant demurred, and upon the demurrer, judgment was given for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-11\">In the case of the Consul, the defendant put in two pleas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-12\">1. That the Consul was engaged in the coasting trade, sailing under a coasting license from the United States.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-13\">2. That the said schooner was bound- from' the port of Philadelphia, in the State of Pennsylvania, to the port\u2019of New York, in the State of New York.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-14\">To both of which pleas there was a demurrer and a joinder in demurrer, and a judgment for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-15\">The case was then carried-to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, which, in January, 1850, passed the following judgment:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ASS\">That \u201c the judgment of the Court of Coirtmon Pleas for the city and county of Philadelphia be affirmed, because this court is- of opinion that the twenty mnth section of the act of the State of Pennsylvania, of the 29th of March, A. D. 1803, entitled An -act to establish a Board of Wardens for the port of Philadelphia, and for the regulation of pilots and pilotages, and for other purposes therein mentioned, is not in any of its provisions involved in this cause, at variance with any of the provisions of the Constitution or laws of the United States,- but is a constitutional and legal enactment.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AkiT\">Cooley then brought the case up to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b313-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>. It was argued by <em>Mr. Morris </em>and <em>Mr. Tyson, </em>for the plaintiff in error, and by <em>Mr. Campbell </em>and <em>Mr. Dallas, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-4\">For the plaintiff in error, it was contended that the law of Pennsylvania was unconstitutional and void, because :</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-5\">1. It is repugnant to the first and third clauses, eighth section, first article of. the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-6\">The first clause declares that all duties, imposts and excises, shall be uniform throughout the United States; and the third, that Congress shall have power to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-7\">. Upon the first clause we argue, that the constitutional uniformity enjoined in respect to duties and imposts, is as real and. obligatory on the States in the absence of all legislation by Congress, as if the uniformity had been made by the legislation of Congress.' The twenty-ninth section of the act of Pennsylvania, of 29th March, 1803, in question, and the.seeond section of the act of June 11th, 1832, overthrow every thing like uniforiiriity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-8\">No penalties, then, imposed by either of these acts can be binding.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-9\">Upon the third clause .we argue, that the power to regulate commerce is exclusive in Congress.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-10\">2. It is repugnant to the second clause of the tenth section first article of the Constitution of the United States, to wit: \u2014 \u201c No State shall, without the consent of Congress, lay any imposts, or duties, on imports or exports, except what may be absolutely necessary for executing its inspection laws, and the net produce of all duties and imposts laid by any State on imports and exports shall be for the use of the. treasury of the United States.\u201d And to the subsequent branch of the same clause, which declares, \u201c No State shall, without the consent of Congress, lay any duty on tonnage.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AaF\">The present case resembles Brown <em>v. </em>the State of Maryland. 12 Wheat. 419. There the tax was exacted for the privilege of selling. Here for the privilege of introducing or sending away.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIT\">' The defendant in this case is the consignee, the merchant. This is, in reality, a tax upon imports. Judge Grier, Norris <em>v. </em>The City of Boston, 7 How. 458, 459. It is a tax upon those engaged in the business of importation, arising out of their position as importers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-12\">It is a tax for' a particular purpose, the support of a hospital for decayed pilots. If the State can appropriate the funds to this purpose, she can appropriate them to. any other, \u2014 a general hospital for mariners, or an alms-house for indigent foreigners.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-13\">If the right be once admitted, and she choose, she can make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>the tax so high as to exclude cotnmerce altogether. She can exclude all vessels not engaged in particular trades.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-5\">If this is a tax or duty, which we think is clearly shown, it is a tax or duty on tonnage, and, therefore, contrary to the second clause, tenth section, first article of the Constitution of the United States: \u201c No State shall, without the consent of Congress, lay any duty on tonnage.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-6\">This is a duty on a tonnage of seventy-five tons or more, and increases with the increased draught of water. The same power might increase the duty or tax, varying it with the increased tonnage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-7\">It may be said that Congress has consented, by the act of 7th August, 1789, section 4, \u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-8\">\u201c That all pilots in the bays, inlets, rivers, harbors, and ports of the United States, shall continue to be regulated in conformity with the existing laws of the State, respectively, wherein such pilots may be, or with such laws as the States may respectively hereafter enact for the purpose, until further legislative provision shall be made by Congress.\u201d The act of Congress <em>2d </em>March, 1837, 5 Stat. at Large 153, is a repeal of the part of the act of 1803 now in question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-9\">But this act of Pennsylvania which we object to, is not an act to regulate pilots. It is an act to raise a fund for the support of decayed pilots.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-10\">We answer further: Congress may adopt State legislation when within constitutional limits, no doubt; yet it cannot be, that by general legislation of this kind, they can prospectively confer upon the States powers not given by the Constitution, or enable individual States to legislate on subjects clearly within the powers of Congress, and to support that legislation even ag\u00e1inst subsequent acts of Congress upon the same subject.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-11\">The Chief Justice, in speaking of this act in the license cases, 5 Howard, p.'580, says:</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-12\">\u201c Undoubtedly Congress had the power, by assenting to the State laws then in force, to .make them its own, and thus make the previous regulations of the States'-the regulations of the General\u2018Government. But it is equally clear, that, as to all future laws by the States, if the Constitution, deprives them of the power of making any regulations on the subject, an act of Congress could not restore it; for it will hardly be contended that an act of Congress can alter the Constitution, and confer upon a State a power which the Constitution declares it shall not possess.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-13\">All that has been said applies equally to the case of the Consul. In addition to which we set up by plea, \u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-14\">1. The coasting license.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>2. That she was bound from one port in the United States, to another port in the United States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-5\">Let it be granted that the power to regulate commerce is not so exclusive as to prevent State legislation, in the absence of legislation by Congress.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-6\">Yet Congress having legislated, so far as regards coasting vessels, by the act of 18th Feb., 1793, sect. 4, the Pennsylvania act of 29th March, 1803, sect. 29, which is in conflict therewith, is unconstitutional and void, so far as it relates to coasting vessels. 4 Smith\u2019s L., 76; 1 Stat. at Large, 305.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-7\">To make out these propositions, we argue,</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-8\">First, That pilot-laws are regulations of commerce, within the meaning of the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-9\">Second, That the act of Pensylvania is no exception to the. general rule.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-10\">Third, That the act of Congress, 18th Feb., 1793, sect. 4, has regulated the navigation of coasting vessels, and limited the exactions to which vessels so employed can be -subjected.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-11\">1. Regulations of navigation are regulations of commerce and within the jurisdiction.of Congress.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-12\">\u201cCommerce is intercourse. The power to regulate commerce extends to the regulation of navigation.\u201d Per Chief Justice Marshall, Gibbons <em>v. </em>Ogden, 9 Wheat. 189; see Id. 191, 192, 193.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-13\">Again, \u2014 Mr. Justice Johnson, Id. 229, says, \u201cWhen speaking of the power of Congress over navigation,' I do not regard it as a power incidental to that of regulating commerce'; I consider it as the thing itself-; inseparable from it, as vital motion is from vital existence.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-14\">This power comprehends navigation within the limits of every State in the Union. Id. 107. Norris <em>v. </em>The City of Boston, and Smith <em>v. </em>Turner, 7 How. 414, 415, 462.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-15\">Pilotage laws are regulations of navigation. They prescribe the terms of commercial or maritime intercourse. ' They take possession of the vessel as she appears upon the coast, or as soon as she leaves the wharf.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-16\">Clearly stated by Chief Justice Taney, License Cases, 5 How. 580. By Judge Rodgers, Flanigan <em>v. </em>The Insurance Company, 7 Barr. 311.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-17\">Congress has exercised the jurisdiction, and it has never been questioned. Act of Congress, 7th August, 1789, sect. 4, adopting the State laws-then in force. 1 Stat. at Large, 53. Act of Congress, 2d March, 1837, c. 22, sect. 1, authorizing a navigator of waters, bounding two or more States, to employ a pilot duly authorized by either; any law or usage of the contrary notwithstanding. 5 Stat. at Large 153.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>2. The act of Pennsylvania, 29th March, 1803, (in question,) is no exception to the general rule, but is a clear regulation of commerce.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-5\">It cannof be considered as an act to regulate the port police. The very'terms of the act forbid it being so considered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-6\">The act is confined to vessels arriving from, or bound to foreign ports or places, and to vessels of seventy-five tons and upwards, sailing from, or bound to ports not within the river Delaware. Its principal force is expended without the port.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-7\">Suppose the obligation to take \u00e1 pilot to be a regulation of port police.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-8\">This act cannot -be so considered, because it does not insist on the pilot being employed, but suffers the parties to compound by paying a- certain sum for the support of an institution, which mayx or may not be a good one.. Its operation is that of a scheme to raise revenue for a particular purpose. The character of a police regulation is assumed and fallacious.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-9\">By the act lltK June,. 1832, Pam. Laws, p. 620, vessels engaged in the Pennsylvania coal trade are exempt from half pilotage. An invidious distinction in favor of a particular branch of commerce, which shows the character of the whole legislation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-10\">3. Congress has legislated upon the subject by the act 18th Feb. 1793, sect. 4; 1 Stat. at Large, 305. . The State law is at variance with this act,' and must ^ive way.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-11\">This sectionunakes it the duty of collectors in their districts, on application made and the fulfilment of certain conditions, (the duty' of six cents per ton being first paid,) to grant a license for carrying on the- coasting trade.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-12\">This act of Congress was passed by virtup of the power to regulate commerce, and declares the- terms upon which vessels-shall be entitled to a coasting license.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-13\">The license gives a right to trade, and does not merely confer - the American character.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-14\">\u201c The enrolm\u00e9nt of vessels designed for the coasting trade, corresponds precisely with the registration of vessels designed for the \u2018 foreign trade, and requires every circumstance which \" can constitute the American character. . The license can be granted only to vessels already enrolled, if they be of the burden' of twenty-tons and upwards, and requires no circumstances essential to the .American character. \u201c The object of the license, then, cannot be to ascertain the character of the vessel,' out to do what it professes to do; \u2014 that is, to give permission to a vessel, already-proved by her.'enrolment to be American, to carry- \u00f3n the coasting trade.\u201d Gibbons <em>v. </em>Ogden, 9 Wheat. 214.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b317-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>The license to carry on the coasting trade, granted under this act, transfers to the licensed vessel all the right which the government can-transfer, and limits the impositions with which such a trade may be burdened. Gibbons <em>v. </em>Ogden, 9 Wheat. 210, 211, 212, 213, 214, &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b317-4\">This'is the main point ruled in Gibbons <em>v. </em>Ogden, and is unshaken, and of immense importance. The question arose on an act of the State of New York, giving to the heirs of Fulton, and those having license from them, %he exclusive right to navi-: gate the waters of New York by steam for a period of ten years.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b317-5\">The owners of two steamboats plying between New Jersey and New York, having a coasting license from the United States, contested the validity of- the State act, and insisted upon their rights under their coasting license.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b317-6\"><em>Decree in Gibbons </em>v. Ogden.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AtG\">\u201c This court is of opinion that the several licenses to the steamboats, the .Stondinger and the Bellona, to carry on the coasting trade, which are set up by the appellant, Thomas Gibbons, in his answer to the bill of the respondent, Aaron Ogden, filed in the Court of Chancery in the State of New York, which were granted under an. act of Congress, passet^in pursuance of the Constitution of the United States, gave full authority to those vessels to navigate the waters of the United States by steam or otherwise, for the purpose of carrying on the coasting trade, any law of the State of New York to the contrary notwithstanding; and that so much of the several-laws of the State of New York, as prohibit vessels licensed according to the laws of'the United States, from navigating the waters of the State of New. York, by means of fire or steam, is repugnant to the said Constitution, and void.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b317-8\">.In our case, instead of purchasing a license from the heirs of \u00a1Pulton, we are required to purchase a right of navigation by paying a tax to the State, or, what is the same thing, to an institution created by the State.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b317-9\">The decision in Gibbons <em>v. </em>Ogden has never been in the least degree questioned or shaken. Inferences, drawn from some expressions of the court in that case, which were supposed to imply, that the States could not legislate on matters affecting commerce, even in the absence of any exerci e of their powers by Congress, are disavowed by perhaps a majouty of the judges in the License Cases in 5 Howard. But the principle of the decision in Gibbons v. Ogden, upon which we rely, was not in the smallest degree impeached. On the contrary, it is expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>adopted. Any other rule would be fatal to the peace of the country.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-5\">The 29th section of the act of the 29th March, 1803, is repugnant to the 5th clause of the 9th section of the 1st article of the Constitution of the United States, to wit: \u201c No preference shall be given, by any regulation of commerce or revenue, to the ports of one State ov\u00e9r those of another; nor shall vessels to or from one State, be obliged to enter, clear, or pay duties in another.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-6\">The Consul was bound from the' port of Philadelphia to the port of New York; and under this act was required to pay the duty, tax, or toll in dispute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-7\">A preference is given to the ports of Delaware, and to such' ports of New Jersey as' are within the river Delaware.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-8\">The counsel for the defendants in error contended that the law of Pennsylvania-was not in violation of any provision of the Constitution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-9\">I. Not of the third clause, 8th ^section, art. 1 (To regulate commerce, &amp;c.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-10\">Because, \u2014 1st. The act in question is no regulation of commerce. It y as passed in the exercise, of a power of the State not granted or surrendered, to control the ports and harbors by which her commerce enters, and to protect the property, and lives of those engaged in it. Gibbons <em>v. </em>Ogden, 9 Wheat. 208. It is local in. character and object, an essential exercise of one branch of the police power of the State, to aid, and not to regulate commerce. City of New York <em>v. </em>Miln, 11 Pet. 132; Passenger Cases, 7 How. 402. 2d. Even if it be a regulation of commerce, the power of Congress is not exclusive. No conflicting legislation by Congress exists, and the State law is therefore valid. License Cases, 5 How. 504.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-11\">II. Nor to the first clause, 8th section, art. 1. (All duties, imposts, and excises, shall be uniform, throughout the United States.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-12\">Because, \u2014 1st. This claus has reference to an exercise of power by Congress. The subject of pilotage is incapable of uniformity throughout all the States, and could not have been intended to be included in it. Passenger Cases, 7 How. 402; 2d. The sum demanded is not a duty, impost, or excise, in terms or in design. Brown <em>v. </em>State of Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419; License Cases, 5 How. 504. It is a compensation to the pilot for time, watchfulness, labor, and risk in seeking for the vessel and offering his services. Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Ricketson, 5 Met. 417, (Shaw, C. J.) 3d. Nor is there any such constitutional obligation upon the States, in the absence of legislation by Congress, to legislate uniformly as to duties, imposts, or excises, (as is submitted by brief of plaintiff in error.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>III. Nor to the first and the second clause of the 10th section, art.,1. ' (No State shall, without the consent of Congress, lay any imposts or duties on imports or exports, &amp;e., or of tonnage.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-5\">If the law in question does regulate commerce at all, it is contended, that it does so by the means specified in these clauses. But they do not.affect it,\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-6\">Because, \u2014 1st. The sum demanded is neither a duty or impost on imports or exports, (already referred to,) nor a duty of tonnage. Nor does Brown <em>v. </em>The State of Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419, apply to the case, for it was decided upon.the ground that a duty upon imports was laid without the consent of Congress.

Nor is the act, as contended, a regulation of commerce or revenue. \u2014 2d. The law does not (from whatever fountain of power derived) give a preference to the ports of one State over those of another; it limits the demand to those cases where the labor, skill, and risk of the pilot is really required; nor would such preference, if' it exist, render the residue of the law invalid. \u20143d.

If to give the right, it was to enter and navigate the ports and harbors of the United States, at a less tonnage-duty, and without the necessity of entry on every voyage. If it was to limit a preexisting light to trade, it licensed such trade at less than the ordinary tonnage-duties, and relieved from the necessity of entry at every voyage, as required of all other vessels. Beyond this, nothing. It did not, in its policy or by its words, affect or legislate in reference to harbor, nor health, nor quarantine regulations, nor profess to interfere with pilotage, nor repeal the act of 1789, nor revoke the consent it contained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-10\">Gibbons <em>v. </em>Ogden, 9 Wheat. 208, does not sustain the position as contended for, that such vessels are discharged, by virtue of a coasting license, from liability to such regulations of police or commerce (if any) which a State may enact, nor especially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>from such tonnage-tax or duty, on imports , (if this be either) as Congress has consented that the State, may establish.</p>\n<p data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-5\">\u25a0 Here; in effect, the question is between two acts of Congress, one by enactment, and the other by adoption or consent, but of equal authority.

The plaintiff in error alleges that the highest court of the State has decided against a right claimed by him under the Constitution -of the United States. That right is to be exempted from the payment of the sums of money demanded, pursuant to the State law above referred to, because that law contravenes several provisions of the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">The particular section of the State law drawn in question is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-9\">\u201c That every ship or vessel arriving from or bound to any foreign port or place, and every ship or vessel of the burden of seventy-five tons or more, sailing from or bound to any .port not within the river Delaware, shall be obliged to receive a pilot. And it shall be the duty of the master of every such ship or vessel, within thirty-six hours next after the arrival of such ship - or vessel at the city of Philadelphia, to make report to the master-warden of the name of such ship or vessel, her draught of water, and the name of the pilot who shall, have conducted her to the port. And when any such vessel shall be outward-bound, the master of such vessel shall make known to the wardens the name of such vessel, and .of the pilot who is to conduct her to the capes, and her draught of water at that time., And it shall be the duty of the wardens to enter eveiy such vessel in a book to be by them kept for that purpose, without fee or reward. And if the master of any ship or vessel shall neglect to .make such report, he shall forfeit and pay the sum of sixty dpllars. And if the master of any such ship or vessel shall refuse or neglect to take a pilot, the master, owner or consignee of such vessel shall forfeit and pay to the warden aforesaid, a. sum equal, to the half-pilotage of s\u00fach ship or vessel, to the use of the Society for the Relief, &amp;c., to be recovered as pilotage in the manner herein-, after directed: Provided always, that where it shall appear to the warden that, in case of an inward-bound vessel, a pilot did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>not offer before she had reached Reedy Island; or, in case of an outward-bound vessel, that a pilot could not be obtained for twenty-four hours after such vessel was ready to depart, the penalty aforesaid, for not having a pilot, shall not be incurred.\u201d It constitutes one. section of \u201c An act to establish'a Board of Wardens, for the port of Philadelphia, and for the regulation of Pilots and Pilotages, &amp;c.,\u201d and the scope of the act is in conformity with the- title to regulate the whole subject of the pilot-age of that port.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">\u00cd- We'think this particular regulation concerning half-pilotage fees, is an appropriate part of a general system of regulations of this subject. Testing it by the practice of commercial States ,and countries legislating on this subject, we find it has usually been deemed necessary'to make similar provisions. Numerous laws of this kind are cited in the learned argument of the counsel for the defendant in error; and their fitness, as a part of a system of pilotage, in many places, may be inferred from their existence in so many different States and countries. Like other laws they are framed to meet the most usual cases, <em>quce frequentius accidwit; </em>they rest upon the propriety of securing lives and property exposed to the perils of a dangerous navigation, by taking, on board a person peculiarly skilled to encounter or avoid them; upon the policy of discouraging the commanders of vessels from refusing tor receive such persons on board at the proper times and places; and upon the' expediency, and even intrinsic justice, of not suffering those who have incurred labor, and expense, and danger, to place themselves in a position to render important service generally necessary, to go unrewarded, because the \"master of a particular vessel either rashly refuses' their proffered assistance, or, contrary to the general experience, does not need it. There are many cases, in which an offer to perform, accompanied by present ability to perform, is deemed by law equivalent to performance. The laws of commercial States and countries have made an offer of pilotage-service one offthose cases; and we cannot pronounce a law which does this, to-be so far removed from the usual and fit scope of laws for the regulation of pilots and pilotage, as to be deemed, for this cause, a covert attempt to legislate upon another subject under the appearance of legislating on this one.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">- It is urged that the second section of the act of the Legislature of Pennsylvania, of the 11th of June, 183\u00e1, proves that the State had other objects in view than the regulation of pilotage. That section is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8X\">\u201c And be it further enacted, by the authority aforesaid, that from and after the first day of July next, no health-fee or halfpilotage shall be charged on any vessel engaged in the Pennsylvania coal trade-\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQcR\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>It must be remembered, that the fair objects' of a law imposing half-pilotage when a pilot is not received, may be secured, and at the same time some classes of vessels exempted from such charge. Thus the very section of the act of 1803, now under consideration, does not apply to coasting vessels of less burden than seventy-five tons, nor fo those bound to, or sailing from, a port in the river Delaware. The purpose of the law being to cause masters of such vessels as generally need a pilot, to employ one, and to secure to the pilots a fair remuneration for cruising in search of vessels, or waiting for employment in port,, there is an obvious propriety in having reference to the number, size, and nature of employment of vessels frequenting the port; and it will be found, by an examination of the different systems of these regulations, which have from time to time been made in this and other countries, that the legislative discretion has been constantly exercised in making discriminations, founded on differences both in the character of the trade, and the tonnage of vessels engaged therein. .</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">We do not perceive any thing in the nature or extent of this particular , discrimination in favor of vessels engaged in the coal trade, which would enable us to declare it to be other than a fair exercise of legislative' discretion, acting upon the subject of the regulation of the pilotage of this port of Philadelphia, with a view to operate upon the masters of those vessels, who, as a general rule, ought to take a pilot, and' with the further view of relieving from the charge of half-pilotage, such vessels as from their size, or the nature of their employment, should be exempted from contributing to the support of pilots, except .so far as they actually receive their services. In our judgment, though this law of 1832 has undoubtedly modified the 29th section of the act of 1803, and both are to be taken together as giving the rule on this subject of half-pilotage, yet this change in the \u25a0rule has not changed the nature of- the law, nor deprived it of .the character and attributes of a law for the regulation of pilotage.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">Nor do we consider- that the appropriation of the sums received under this section of the act, to the use of the society for the relief of distressed and decayed pilots, their widows and children, has any legitimate tendency to impress on it the character of a revenue law. Whether these sums .shall go directly to the use of tfie individual pilots by whom the service is tendered, or shall form a common fund, to be administered by trustees for the benefit of such pilots and their families as may stand in peculiar need of it, is a matter resting in legislative discretion, in the proper exercise of which the pilots alone are interested.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">For these reasons, we cannot yield our assent to the argument, that this provision of law is in conflict with the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>and third clauses of the tenth section of the first article of the Constitution, which prohibit a State, without the assent of Congress, 'from laying any imposts or duties, on imports or exports, or tonnage. This provision of the Constitution was intended to operate, upon subjects actually existing and well understood wh\u00e9n the Constitution was formed. Imposts and duties on imports, exports, and tonnage were then known to the commerce of a civilized world to be as distinct from fees and charges for pilotage, and from the penalties by which commercial States enforced their pilot-laws, as they were from 'charges for wharfage, or towage,, or any other local port-charges for services rendered-to vessels .or cargoes; and to declare that such pilot-fees or .'penalties, are embraced within the words imposts or duties on imports,- exports, or tonnage, would be to confound things essentially different, and which must have been known to be actually.different by those who used this language. It cannot be denied that-a tonnage-duty, or an impost on imports or exports, may be levied under the name of pilot-dues or penalties ; and: certainly it is the thing, and not the name, which is to b\u00bf considered. But,, having previously stated that, in this instance, the law complained of does not-pass the appropriate line which limits' laws for'.the regulation -of pilots and pilotage, the suggestion; that this law'levies a duty-on tonnage or on imports dr exports, is not admissible; and, if so, it also follows, that this law is not repugnant to the first clause of the eighth section of the first article of the Constitution, which declares that all duties, imposts, and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States; for, if it is not to be deemed a law levying a duty, impost, or excise, the want' of uniformity throughout the United States is not objectionable. Indeed the necessity of conforming regulations of pilotage to the local peculiarities of each port, and the consequent impossibility of having its charges uniform throughout the United States, would be sufficient of itself to prove that they could not have been intended to be embraced Within this clause of the Constitution; for it cannot be supposed uniformity was required, when it must have been known to be impracticable.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">It is further objected, that this law is repugnant to the fifth clause of the ninth section of the first article of the Constitution, viz. \u2014 \u201cNo preference shall be given by any regulation of commerce or revenue, to the ports of one State over those of another; nor shall vessels, to or from one State, be obliged to enter, clear, or pay duties in another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">But, as already stated, pilotage-fees are not duties within .the meaning of the Constitution; and, certainly, Pennsylvania does not give a preference to the port of Philadelphia, by requiring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>the masters, owners, or consignees of vessels, sailing to or from that port, to pay the charges imposed by the twenty-ninth section of the act of 1803. It is an objection to, and not a ground of preference of a port, that a charge of this kind must be borne by vessels entering it; and, accordingly, the interests of the port require, and generally produce, such alleviations of these charges as its growing commerce from time'to time renders consistent with the general policy of the pilot-laws. This State, by its act of the 24th of March, 1851, ,has essentially modified the law of 1803, and further exempted many vessels from the charge now in question. Similar changes may be observed in the Jaws of New York, Massachusetts, and other commercial States, and they undoubtedly spring from the conviction that burdens of this land, instead of operating to give a \"preference to a port, tend to checlt its commerce, and that sound policy requir\u00e9s them to be lessened and removed .as early as the necessities of the system will allow.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">In addition to what has been said respecting each of these constitutional objections to this law, it may be observed, that similar laws have existed and been practised on in the States since the' adoption of the federal Constitution; that, by the act of the 7th of August, 1789, (1 Stat. at Large, 54,) Congress declared that all pilots in the bays, inlets, rivers, harbors, and ports of the United States, shall continue to be regulated in conformity with the existing laws of the States, &amp;c.; and that this contemporaneous construction of the Constitution since acted on with such uniformity in a matter of much public interest and importance, is entitled to great weiglit, in determining whether such a law is repugnant to the Constitution, as levying a duty-not uniform throughout the United States, or, as giving a preference to the ports of one State over those of another, or, as obliging vessels to or from one State to enter, clear, or pay duties in anotlier. Stuart <em>v. </em>Laird, 1 Cranch, 299; Martin <em>v. </em>Hunter, 1 Wheat. 304; Cohens <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth of Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264; Prigg <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 16 Pet. 621.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The opinion of the court is, that the law now in question is not repugnant to either of the above-mentioned clauses of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">It remains to consider. the objection, that it is repugnant to the third clause of the eighth section of the first article. \u201c Tire Congress shall have power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several States, and with the Indian tribes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">That the power to regulate commerce includes the regulation of navigation, we consider settled. And when we look, to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>nature of the service performed, by pilots, to the relations which that service and its compensations bear to navigation between the several States, and between the ports of the United States and foreign countries, we are brought to the conclusion, that the regulation of the qualifications of pilots, of the modes and times of offering and rendering their services, of the responsibilities which shall rest upon' them, of the powers they shall possess, of the compensation they may demand, and of the. penalties by which' their rights and duties- may be enforced, do constitute regulations of navigation, and consequently of commerce, within the just meaning of this clause of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">The power to regulate navigation is the power to prescribe rules in conformity with which navigation must be carried on. It extends to the persons who conduct it, as well as to the instruments used. Accordingly, the first Congress assembled under the Constitution passed laws, requiring the masters of ships and vessels of the United States to be citizens of the United States, and established many rules for the government and regulation of officers and seamen. 1 Stat. at Large, 55, 131. These have been from time to time added to and changed, and we are not aware that their validity has been questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">New, a pilot, so far as respects the navigation of the vessel in that part of the voyage which is his pilotage-ground, is the temporary master charged' with \u25a0 the safety of the vessel and cargo, and of the lives of those on board, and intrusted with the command of the crew.- He is not only one of the persons engaged in navigation, but he occupies a most important and responsible place among those thus engaged. And if Congress has power to regulate the seamen who assist the pilot in the management of the vessel, a power never denied, we can perceive no valid reason why the pilot should be beyond the reach of the same power. It is true that, according to the usages of modem commerc\u00e9 on the ocean, the pilot is on board only during a part of the voyage between ports of different States, or between .ports of the United States and foreign countries; but if he is on board for such a purpose and during so much of the voyage as to be engaged in' navigation, the power to regulate navigation extends to him while thus engaged, as clearly as it would if h.e were to remain on board throughout the whole passage, from port to port. For it is a power which extends to every part of the voyage, and may regulate those who conduct or assist in conducting navigation in one part of a voyage as much as in another part, or during the whole voyage.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Nor should it be lqst sight of, that this subject of the regulation of pilots and pilotage has am intimate connection with, and an important relation to. the general subject of commerce with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>foreign nations and among the several States, over which it was one main object of the Constitution to create a national control. Conflicts between the laws of neighboring States, and discriminations favorable or adverse to commerce with particular foreign nations, might be created by State laws regulating pilotage, deeply affecting that equality of commercial rights, and that freedom from State interference, which those who formed the Constitution were so anxious to secure, and which the experience of more than half a century has taught us to value so highly. The apprehension of this danger is not speculative merely. For, in 1837, Congress actually interposed to relieve the commerce of the country from serious embarrassment, arising from the laws of different States, situate upon waters which are the boundary between them. This was done by an enactment of the 2d of March, 1837, in the following words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-5\">. \u201c Be it enacted, that it shall and may be lawful for the master or- commander of any vessel coming into or going out of any port situate upon waters which are the boundary between two States, to employ any pilot. duly licensed or authorized, by the laws of either of the States bounded .on the said waters, to pilot said vessel to or from said port, any law, usage, or custom, to the contrary, notwithstanding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">The act of 1789, (1 Stat. at Large, 54,) already referred to, contains a clear legislative exposition of the Constitution by the first Congress,.to the effect that the power to regulate pilots \u2022was conferred on Congress by the Constitution; as does also the act of March the 2d, 1837, the terms of which have just been given. The weight to be allowed to this contemporaneous construction, and the practice of Congress under it, has, in- another connection, been adverted to. And a majority of the court are of opinion, that a regulation of pilots is a regulation of commerce, within the grant to Congress of the commercial .power,' contained in the third clause of the eighth section of. the first article of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">It becomes necessary, therefore, to consider whether this law of Pennsylvania, being a regulation of commerce, is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">\u2019 The act of Congress of the 7th of August, 1789, sect. 4, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-9\">\u201c That all pilots in the bays, inlets, rivers, harbors, and ports of the United States shall continue to be regulated in conformity with the existing laws of the States, respectively, wherein such pilots may be, or with such laws as the States may re- \u25a0 spectively hereafter enact for the purpose, until further legislative provision shall be made by Congress.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">\u25a0 If the law of Pennsylvania, now in question, had been in existence at the date of this act of Congress, we might hold it to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>have been adopted by Congress, and thus made a law of the United States, and so valid. Because this act does, in effect, give the force of an act of Congress, to the then existing State laws on this subject, so long as they should continue unrepealed by the State which enacted them.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">But the law on which these actions are founded'was not enacted till 1803. What effect then can be attributed to so much of the act of 1789, as declares, that pilots shall continue to be regulated in conformity, \u201c with such laws as the States may respectively hereafter enact for the purpose, until further legislative provision shall be made by Congress \u201d ?</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">If the States were divested of the power to legislate on this subject by the grant of the. commercial power to Congress, it is plain this act could not confer upon them power thus to legislate. If the Constitution excluded the States from making any law regulating commerce, certainly Congress cannot regrant, or in any manner reconvey to the States that power. And yet this act of 1789 gives its sanction only to laws enacted by the States. This necessarily implies a constitutional power to legislate; for only a rule created by the sovereign power of a State acting in its, legislative capacity, can be deemed a law, enacted by a State; and if the State has so limited its sovereign power that it no longer extends to a particular subject, manifestly it cannot, in any proper sense, be said to enact laws thereon. Entertaining these views we are brought directly and unavoidably to the consideration of the question, whether the grant of the commercial power to Congress, did <em>per se </em>deprive the States of all power to regulate pilots.. This question has never been decided by this court, nor, in our judgment, has any case depending upon all the considerations which must govern this one, come before this court. The grant of commercial power to Congress does not contain any terms which expressly exclude the States from exercising an authority over its subject-matter. If they are excluded it must be because the nature of the power, thus granted to Congress,- requires that a similar authority should not exist in the States. If it were conceded on the one side, that the nature of this power, .like that to legislate for the District of Columbia, is absolutely and totally repugnant to the existence of similar power in the States, probably no one would deny that the grant of the power to Congress, as effectually and perfectly excludes the States from all future legislation on the subject, as if express words had been used to exclude\u2019them, And on the other hand, if it were admitted that the existence of this power in Congress, like the power of taxation, is compatible with the existence of a similar-power in the States, then it would be in conformity with the contemporary.exposition of the Constitution, (Federalist, No. 32,) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>and with the judicial construction, given from time to timb by this court, after the most deliberate consideration., to hold that the mere grant of such a power to Congress, did not imply a prohibition on the States to exercise the same power; that it is not the mere existence of such a power, but its exercise by Congress, which may be incompatible with the exercise of the same power by the States, and that the- States may legislate- in the absence of congressional regulations. Sturges <em>v. </em>Crowninshield, 4 Wheat. 193; Moore <em>v. </em>Houston, 5 Wheat. 1; Wilson <em>v. </em>Blackbird Creek Co. 2 Peters, 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The diversities of opinion, therefore, which have existed on this subject, have arisen from the different views taken of the nature of this power. But when the nature of a power like this is spoken of, when it is said that the nature of the power requires that it should be exercised exclusively by Congress', it \u25a0must be intended to refer to the subjects of that power, and to say they are of such a nature as to require exclusive legislation by Congress. Now the power to regulate commerce, embraces a vast field, containing not only many, but exceedingly various subjects, quite unlike in their nature; some imperatively demanding a single uniform rule, operating equally on the commerce of the United States in every port; and some, like the subject now in question, as imperatively demanding that diversity, which alone can meet the local necessities of navigation.</p>\n<p id=\"AZA\">Either absolutely to affirm, or deny that the nature of this power requires exclusive legislation by Congress, is to lose sight of the nature of the subjects of this power, and to assert concerning all of them,'what is really applicable but to,a part. Whatever subjects of this power are in their nature national, or admit only of one uniform system, or plan of regulation, may justly be said to be of such a nature as to require exclusive legislation by Congress. That this cannot be affirmed of laws for the regulation of pilots and pilotage is plain. The act of 1789 contains a clear and authoritative declaration by the first Congress, that the nature of this subject is such, that until Congress should find it necessary to exert its power, it should be left to the legislation of the States; that it is local and not national; that it is likely to be the best, provided , for, not by one system, or plan of regulations, but by as many as the legislative discretion of the several States should deem applicable to the local peculiarities of the ports within their limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Viewed in this light, so much of this act of 1789 as declares that pilots shall continue to be regulated \u201c by such laws as the States may respectively hereafter enact for that purpose,\u201d instead of being held to be inoperative, as an attempt to confer on the States a power to legislate, of which the Constitution had de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>prived th$m, is allowed an appropriate and important signification. It manifests the understanding of Congress, at the outset of the government, that the nature of this subject is not such as to require its exclusive legislation. The practice of the States, and of the national government, has been in conformity with this declaration, from the origin of the national government to this time; and the nature of the subject when examined, is such as to leave no doubt of the superior fitness and propriety, not to say the absolute necessity, of different systems of regulation, drawn from local knowledge and experience, and conformed to local wants. How then can we say, that by the mere grant of power to regulate commerce, the States are deprived of all the power to legislate on this subject, because from the nature of the power the legislation of Congress must be exclusive. This would be to affirm that the nature of the power is in any case, something different from the nature of the subject to which, in such, case, the power extends, and that the nature of the power necessarily demands, in all cases, exclusive legislation by Congress, while the nature of one of the subjects of that power, not only does not require such exclusive legislation, but may be best provided for by many different systems enacted by the States, in conformity with the circumstances of the ports within their limits. In construing an instrument designed, for the formation of a government, and in determining the extent of one of its important grants of power to legislate, we can make no such distinction between the nature of the power and the nature of the subject on which that power was intended practically to operate, nor consider the grant more extensive by affirming of the power, what is not true of its subject now in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">It is the opinion of a majority of the court that the mere grant to \u25a0 Congress of the power to regulate commerce, did not deprive the States of power to regulate pilots, and that although Congress has legislated on this subject, its legislation manifests an intention, with a single exception, not to regulate this subject, but to leave its regulation to the several States. To these precise questions, which are all we are called on to decide, this opinion must be understood to be confined. It does not extend to the question what other subjects, under the commercial power, are within the exclusive control of Congress, or may be regulated by the States in the absence of all congressional legislation; nor to the general question how far any regulation of a subject by Congress, may b\u00e9 deemed to operate as an exclusion of all legislation by the States upon the same subject.- We decide the precise questions before us, upon what we deem sound principles, applicable to this particular subject in the state in which the legislation of Congress has left it. We go no further.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>We have not adverted to the practical consequences of holding that the States possess no power to legislate for the regulation of pilots, though in our apprehension these would be of the most serious importance. For more than sixty years this subject has been acted on by the States, and. the systems \u00f3f some of them created and of others essentially modified during that period. To hold that pilotage fees and penalties demanded and received during that time, have been illegally exacted, under color of void laws, would work an amount of mischief which a clear conviction of constitutional duty, if entertained, must force us to occasion, but which could be viewed by no just mind without deep regret. Nor would the mischief be limited-to the past. If Congress were now to pass a law adopting the existing State laws, if enacted without authority, and in violation of the Constitution, it would seem to us to be a new and questionable mofle of legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">If the grant of commercial power in the Constitution has deprived the States of all power to legislate for the regulation of pilots, if their laws on this subject are mere usurpations upon the exclusive power of the general government, and utterly void,. it may be doubted whether Congress could,, with propriety, recognize them as laws, and adopt them as its own acts; and how are the legislatures of the States to proceed in future, to watch over and amend these laws, as the progressive wants of a growing commerce will require, when the members of those legislatures are made aware that they cannot legislate on this subject without violating the oaths they have taken to support the Constitution of the United States <em>1</em></p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">We are of opinion that this State law was enacted by virtue of a power, residing in the State to legislate; that it is not in conflict with any law of Congress; that it does not interfere with any system which Congress has established by making regulations, or by intentionally leaving individuals to their own unrestricted action ; that this law is therefore valid, and the judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in each case must be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b333-7\">Mr, Justice McLean and Mr. Justice Wayne dissented; and Mr. Justice Daniel, although he concurred in the judgment of the court, yet dissented from its reasoning.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b333-8\">Mr. Justice McLEAN.</author>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">It is with regret that I feel myself obliged to dissent from the opinion of a majority of my brethren in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">As expressing my views on the question involved, I will copy a few sentences from the opinion of Chief Justice Marshall in the opinion in Gibbons <em>v. </em>Ogden. \u201c It has been said,\u201d says that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>illustrious judge, \u201c that the act of August 7th, 1789; acknowledges a concurrent power in the States to* regulate the conduct of pilots, and hence is inferred an admission of their concurrent right with Congress to regulate commerce with foreign nations and amongst the States.\u201d \u201c But this inference is not, we think, justified, by the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">\u201c Although Congress,\u201d he continues,\u201ccannot enable a State to, legislate, Congress may adopt the provisions of a State on any subject. When the government of the Union was brought into existence, it found a system for the regulation of its pilots in.full force in every State. The act which has been mentioned, adopts this system, and gives it the same validity as if its provisions had been specially made by Congress. But the act, it may be said, is prospectiv\u00e9 also, and the adoption of laws to be in future presupposes the right in the maker to legislate on the subject.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Af2\">\u201c The act unquestionably manifests an intention to leave this subject entirely to the States, until Congress should think proper to interpose; but the very enactment of such a law indicates -an opinion that it was necessary; that the existing system would not be applicable to, the new state,of things, unless expressly applied to it by Congress. But this section is confined to pilots within the bays, inlets, rivers, harbors, and ports of the United States, which are, of course, in whole or in part, also within the limits of some particular State. The acknowledged power of a State to regulate its police, its domestic trade, and to govern its own citizens, may enable it to legislate on this subject, to a considerable' extent; and the adoption of its system by Congress, and the application of it to the whole subject of commerce, does not seem to the court to imply a right in the States so to apply it of their own authority. But the adoption of the State system being temporary, being only, \u201c until further legislative provision shall be made by Congress,\u201d shows conclusively, an opinion that Congress could control the whole subject, .and might adopt the system of the States or provide one of its own.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Wiry did Congress pass the act of 1789, adopting the pilot-laws of the respective States ? Laws they unquestionably were, having been enacted by the States before the adoption of the Constitution. But were they laws under the Constitution ? If they had been so considered 'by Congress, they would not have been adopted by a special act. There is believed to be no instance in the legislation of Congress, where a State law has been adopted, which,'\u201cbefore its adoption, applied to federal powers. To suppose such .a ease, would be an imputation of ignorance as to federal powers, least of all chargeable againstthe men who formed the Constitution and who best understood it.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">Congress adopted the pilot-laws of the States, because it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>well understood, they could have had no forc\u00e9, as regulations of foreign commerce or of commerce among the States, if not so adopted. By their adoption they were made acts of Congress, and ever since they have been so considered and enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Each State regulates the commerce within its limits; which is not within the range of federal powers.- So far, and no farther could \u00e9ffect have been given to the pilot laws of the States, under the Constitution. But those laws were only adopted\u201c until further legislative provisions shall be made by Congress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">This shows that Congress claim\u00e9d the whole commercial power on. this subject, by adopting the pilot laws of the States, making them acts of Congress; and also by declaring that the adoption was only until some further legislative provision could be made by Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">Can Congress annul the acts of a State passed within its admitted sovereignty? . No one, I suppose, could sustain such a proposition. State sovereignty cap neither be enlarged nor 'diminished' by an act of Congress. It is not known that Congress has ever claimed such a power.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">If the States had not the. power to enact pilot laws, as connected with foreign commerce, in 1789, when did theyget.it? It is an exercise of sovereign power to legislate. In this respect -the Constitution is the same now as in 1789, and also the power of a State is the same. Whence, then, this enlargement of State \u2022power. Is it derived from the act of 1789, that pilots shall continue to be regulated \u201c in conformity with such laws as the States may respectively hereafter enact\u201d ? In the opinion of] the Chief Justice, above cited, it is said, Congress may adopt th\u00e9 laws of a State, but it cannot enable a State to legislate. In other words, it cannot transfer to a State legislative powers.' And the court also-say that the States canno't apply the pilot laws of their own authority. We have here, then, the deliberate action of Congress, showing that the States have no inherent power to pass these laws, which is affirmed by the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"ACb\">Ought not this to be considered as settling this question? What more of authority can be brought to bear upon it ? But it is said that Congress is incompetent to legislate on this subject. Is-this so? Did not Congress, in 1789, legislate on the-subject by adopting the State laws, and may it not do so again ? Was not that a wise and politic-act of legislation ? This is admitted. But it\u2019 is,- said that Congress cannot legislate on this matter in detail. The act of 1789 shows that it is unnecessary for Congress so to legislate.' A single section covers the whole legislation of the States, iii regard .to pilots. Where, then, is the necessity of <em>recognizing </em>this power to exist in\u2019 the States ? There is no such necessity; and if there were, it would not make the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>act of the State constitutional; for it is admitted that the power is in Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">That a State may regulate foreign commerce, or commerce among the States, is a doctrine which has been advanced by individual judges of this court; but never before, I believe, has such a power been sanctioned by the decision of this court. In this case, the power to regulate pilots is admitted to belong to the commercial power of Congress; and yet it is held, that a State, by virtue of its inherent power, may regulate the subject, until such regulation shall be annulled by Congress. This is the principle established by this decision. Its language is guarded, in order to apply the decision only to the case before the court. But such restrictions can never operate, so as to render the principle' inapplicable to other cases. And it is in this light that the decision is chiefly to be regretted. The power is recognized in the State, because the subject is more appropriate for State than Federal action; and consequently, it must be presumed the Constitution cannot have intended to inhibit State action. This is not a rule by which the Constitution is to be construed. It can receive but little support from the discussions which took place on the adoption of the Constitution, and none at all from the earlier decisions of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">It will be found that the principle in this case, if carried out, will deeply affect the commercial prosperity of the country. If a State has power to regulate foreign commerce, such regulation must be held valid, until Congress shall repeal or annul it. But the present case goes further than this. Congr\u00e9ss regulated pilots by the act of 1789, whi.ch made the acts of .the State, on that subject, the acts of Congress. In 1803, Pennsylvania passed the law in question, which materially modified the act adopted by Congress; and this act of 1803 is held to be constitutional. This, then, asserts the right of a State, not only to regulate foreign commerce, but to modify, and, consequently, to repeal a prior regulation of Congress. Is there a mistake in this statement ? There is none, if an adopted act of a State is thereby made an act of Congress, and if the regulation of pilots, in regard to foreign commerce, be a regulation of commerce. The latter position is admitted in the opinion of the court, and no one will controvert the former. I speak of the principie of the opinion, and not of the restricted application given to it by the learned judge who delivered it.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">The noted Blackbird Creek case shows what little influence the facts and circumstances of a case can have in restraining the principle it is supposed to embody.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">How can the unconstitutional acts of Louisiana, or of any other State which has ports on the Mississippi, or the Ohio, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>on any of our other rivers, be corrected, without the action of Congress? And when Congress shall act, the State has only to change its ground, in order to enact and enforce its regulations. Louisiana now imposes a duty upon vessels for mooring in the river opposite the city of New Orleans, which is called a levee tax, and which, on some boats performing weekly trips to that city, amounts to from $3,000 to $4,000 annually. What is there to prevent the thirteen or fourteen States bordering upon the two rivers first named, from regulating navigation on those rivers, although Congress may have regulated the same at som\u00e9 prior period ? I speak not of the effect of this doctrine theoretically in this matter, but practically. And if the doctrine be true, how can this court say that such regulations of commerce are invalid ? If this doctrine be sound, the passenger cases were erroneously decided. In those cases there was no direct conflict between the acts of the States taxing passengers and the acts of Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">From this race of legislation between Congress and the States, and between the States, if this principle be maintained, will arise a conflict similar to that which existed before the adoption of the Constitution. The States favorably situated, as Louisiana, may levy a contribution upon the commerce of other States, which shall, be sufficient to meet the expenditures of the States.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">The application of the money exacted under this, act of Pennsylvania, it is said, shows that it is not raised for revenue. The application of the money cannot be relied on as showing an act of a State to be constitutional. If the State has power to pass the act it may apply the money raised in its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">I think the charge of half-pilotage is correct under the circumstances, and I only object to the power of the State to pass the law. Congress, to whom the subject peculiarly belongs, should have been applied to, and no doubt it would have adopted the act of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">Mr. Justice DANIEL.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">I agree with the majority in their decision, that the judgments of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in these cases, should be affirmed, though I cannot go with them in the process or argument by which their conclusion has been reached. The power, and the practice of enacting pilot-laws, which'has been exercised by the States from the very origin of their existence, although it is one in some degree connected with commercial intercourse, dees not come essentially and regularly within that power of commercial regulation vested by the Constitution' in Congress, and which by the Constitution must, when exercised by Congress, be enforced with perfect equality, and without any kind of dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>crimination, local or otherwise, in its application. The power delegated to Congress by the Constitution relates properly to the terms on which commercial engagements may be prosecuted; the character of the articles which they may embrace; the permission or terms according to which they may be introduced; and do not necessarily nor even naturally extend to the means of precaution and safety adopted within the waters or limits of the States by the authority of the latter for the preservation of vessels and cargoes, and the lives of navigators or passengers. These last subjects \u00e1re essentially local \u2014 they must depend upon local necessities which call them into existence, must differ according to the degrees of that necessity. It is admitted, on all .hands, that they cannot be uniform or even general, but must vary so as to meet the purposes to be accomplished. They have no connection with contract, or traffic, or with the permission to trade in any subject, or upon any conditions. . They belong to the same conservative power which undertakes to guide the track of the vessel over the rocks or shallows of a coast, or river ; which directs her mooring or her position in port, for the safety of life and property, whether in reference to herself or to other vessels, their cargoes and crews, which for security against pestilence subjects vessels to quarantine, and may order the total destruction of the cargoes they contain. This is a power which is deemed indispensable to the s\u00e1fety and existence of every community. It may well be made a question, therefore, whether it could, under any circumstances, be surrendered; but certainly it is one which cannot be supposed to have been given by mere implication, and as incidental to another, to the- exercise of which it is not indispensable. It is not just nor philosophical to argue from the possibility of abuse against the rightful existence of this power in the States; such an argument would, if permitted, go to the overthrow of all power in either the States or in the federal government, since there is no power which may not be abused. The true question here is, whether the power to enact pilot-laws is appropriate and necessary, or rather most appropriate and necessary to the State or the federal governments. It being conceded that this power h\u00e1s been exercised by the States'from their very dawn of existence; that it can be practically and beneficially applied by the local authorities only; it being conceded, as it must be, that the power to pass pilot-laws, as such, has not been in any express terms delegated to Congress, and does not necessarily conflict with the right to establish commercial regulations, I am forced to conclude that this is an original and inherent power in the States, and not one to be merely tolerated, or held subject to the sanction of the federal government.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>\n<em>Order.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, for the Eastern District, and was argued by counsel.
