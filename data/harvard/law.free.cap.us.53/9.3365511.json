That the tariff laws are to be construed according to the commercial sense of the terms used in them. Lee <em>v. </em>Lincoln, 1 Story, 610; U. S. <em>v. 112 </em>Casks Sugar, 8 Pet. 277; Bacon <em>v. </em>Bancroft, 1 Story, 341; U. S. <em>v. </em>Wigglesworth, <em>2 </em>Story, 369; Henry W. Sill et al. <em>v. </em>Cornelius W. Lawrence, Collector, MS., before Justice Nelson, U. S. C., New York.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b25-12\">' <em>2. </em>That statutes laying restrictions upon trade, or which lay .an excise or tax upon it, are to be construed strictly. Sewall <em>v. </em>Jones, 9 Pick. 412; and that the court cannot, therefore, look for the intent of the framers beyond the ordinary and natural import of the language used.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b25-13\">3. That the words \u201c plain tumblers,\u201d in the second clause upon this subject, in schedule C, are to be taken as used in commerce. Tariff Laws of July, 1846, p. 42; schedule B, \u201c glass cut,\u201d p. 44; schedule C, p. 45, Boston edition; Tariff, 1842, p. 552, sec. 5.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b25-14\">4. That in commerce the tumblers in question are known as \u201c plain tumblers.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b25-15\">5. That no <em>other </em>tumblers, either in commerce or manufacture, are known simply as <em>plain </em>tumblers. U. S. <em>v. </em>Wigglesworth, 2 Story, 369.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b25-16\"><em>Mr. </em>Crittenden, for the defendant, contended\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b25-17\">1. \u2022 That whether the tumblers in question were \u2022 or were not of \u201c glass cut,\u201d was a question of fact. Upon that question the evidence is clear in favor of the verdict.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b25-18\">That tumblers of glass punted are \u201c glass cut \u201d is undeniable upon the evidence of the manufacturers; and upon the same evidence it is equally clear that tumblers of glass with orna<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>mental^figures engraved on them are \u201c glass cut,\u201d and so both descriptions of the tumblers, about which the suit was brought, are within schedule B, and subject to a duty of forty per cent, ad valorem.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-5\">The descriptions, in schedule' B, of \u201c glass cut,\u201d and in schedule C, of \u201c glass tumblers, plain, moulded, or pressed, not cut or punted,\u201d do not leave ropm for argument.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-6\">Both classes of the imported tumblers in question had been cut, pimted, smoothed, and, ground by the glasscutter; none of them were plain and uncut, as they were from the hands of the glassblower, a\u00f1d therefore cannot be brought to the lower duty of thirty per cent, ad valorem according to schedule C.-</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-7\">The maxim, <em>\u201c </em>Cuique in sua arte credendum est,\u201d applies to the evidence of the manufacturers of glass introduced by the collector.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-8\"><em>2. </em>Upon the. statements appearing upon the record, there is no ground for a new trial.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ALB\">It is not possible to mistify and make intricate the matters of fact. That the tumblers- of glass in question were \u201c glass cut,\u201d tumblers of glass punted, tumblers with ornamental figures cut upon them, and not \u201c glass tumblers,\u2019 plain, moulded, or pressed, not cut or punted,\u201d cannot be made more lucid by argument than -by the testimony given. Importing merchants- cannot demolish facts, change the qualities and substance of things, alter the descriptions and meaning of schedules B and C, in the tariff of 1846, nor evade their effect by arbitrary names, which they may think fit to give to things imported by them.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b26-10\">Mr. Justice DANIEL</author>\n<p id=\"Al\">delivered the opinion of -the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-11\">This was an action brought by the plaintiffs, importers of glassware, against the defendant as collector of - the port of New York, to recover a certain \u2022 amount of money-paid under protest to the defendant as collector, for duties exacted by him upon glass tumblers imported by the plaintiffs at. the period Set forth in an exhibit filed in the cause, by which are also shown, the duties charged by and paid to the defendant, and the amount claimed by the plaintiffs, as having been improperly exacted; this last amount, consisting in each instance of the. difference between the duty of 40 per centum <em>ad </em>valorem, charged under schedule B of the Tariff Act of July 30th, 1846, as on importations of \u201c glass cut,\u201d and the duty of 30 per centum <em>ad </em>valorem, at which rate the plaintiffs, claimed to enter their importations of glass above-mentioned, under schedule C of the same act of Congress, as \u201c glass ttimbler3 plain, moulded, . or pressed, <em>not cut or pimted,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b26-12\">The question of law upon the construction of the Statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Of 1846 upon which the judges differed in opinion, and the facts of the case, out of which that question has grown, cannot he stated with greater clearness .or with more succinctness of form, than they have been in the certificate from the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"Abr\">This cause having been tried before his honor Justice Nelson, on the 3d of November, 1848, the jury impanelled returned a verdict for the defendant. The counsel for the plaintiff having excepted to the charge of the presiding judge on the trial, the cause was heard upon the exception reserved for the plaintiff, involving the question whether, according to the true construction of the Act of Congress of 30th of July, 1846, entitled \u201c An net reducing the duty on imports and for other purposes,\u201d glass tumblers, the bottoms of which have, been smoothed or flattened by the process of cutting or grinding, and glass tumblers which have been engraved on the si .es by a similar process, should be charged with the duty of 40 per centum ad valorem, under schedule B of said act, as \u201c glass cut,\u201d or with the duty of 30 per centum- ad valorem, under schedule C of said act, as \u201cglass tumblers plain, moulded, or pressed, not cut or punted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">On which question the opinion of the judges of the court were opposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">Whereupon, on motion of the said plaintiffs by their counsel, that the point upon which the disagreement hath happened may, during the term, be stated under the direction of the judges, and certified under the seal of this court to the Supreme Court to be finally decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-9\">It is ordered, that the following statement of facts, which is made under the direction of the judges, .be certified according to the request of the said plaintiffs, and the statute in such case made and provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-10\">\n<em>Statement of Facts.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b27-11\">That the tumblers in question consisted of two kinds, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b27-12\">1.

That the bottoms of glass tumblers manufactured entirely by the glassblower, are rough, particularly in the centre5 being theie broken off from the punt or stick on which made; and that when sold in this condition, such tumblers are known in trade and commerce in the city of New York as \u201cplain\u201d or \u201cplain rough-bottomed tumblers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"As\">By the same witnesses. That, after their completion by the glassblower, such rough-bottomed tumblers frequently pass into the hands of the glasscutter, or grinder, by whom the centre of the bottoms of such tumblers is cut or smoothed, for the purpose of removing the particular roughness of that part of the tumbler, and that the process- of thus cutting or smoothing the centre of the bottoms of such tumblers is called punting; and that tumblers manufactured by the glassblower, but the centre part of the .bottoms of which have- been so cut or smoothed by the glasscutter, are known in trade and commerce as \u201c punted \u201d tumblers.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-12\">By the same witnesses.

That the cutting or smoothing of the bottoms of the tumblers in question, (of the first class,) is done by the glasscutter, and that the process of cutting and smoothing is identical with that of punting, except that it extends to the entire surface of the bottom of the tumblers, whereas the \u201c punting \u201d is limited, as above stated, to the centre of the bottom merely.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">By the same witnesses.

In the construction of the Act of Congress of July 30th, 1846, as in that of every other statute, one cardinal rule must govern, and it is this; that wherever the will or intention of the lawmaking power is declared in plain and unequivocal terms, that will or intention must be followed \u2014 absolutely followed. It would not be admissible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>under such circumstances, to attempt a control or modification of that will, by speculations df policy or by facts or opinions derived <em>aliunde, </em>as' such a proceeding would in effect operate a repeal of the positive law, or the abrogation of a superior power, by what were the just and regular subjects of its operation. Where a statute maybe ambiguous in its language, or may have reference to facts or conclusions dependent on usage, the influence of opinion or the proof of established usage may be proper or even indispensable, in fixing the just interpretation of the law, but it is only in instances like these last mentioned, that such a rule of interpretation can be tolerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">The question present\u00e9d upon the certificate from the Circuit Court will be considered, 1st, with'reference to the language of the Tariff Act of July 30th, 1846; and-next upon the import of the facts proved in the case, upon the hypothesis that those facts could at all affect the rule of interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">In schedule B, part of the act above-mentioned, laying an impost of 40 per centum on all articles embraced within it, the only description of glass mentioned, is that designated as <em>\u201cglass cut\u201d </em>Its distinguishing characteristic, that brings the <em>article </em>Within the j urview of that schedule is, that it be <em>cut; </em>the figure, or the extent in which the process of cutting should have been applied, was nowhere defined by the statute; and it must be obvious, that any attempt to define or describe that which may, and must indeed be as diverse as the sldll, the taste, or the prospect of profit on the part of the manufacturer, would have been utterly nugatory. But it could be easily, understood, both by the law-maker and by others, that the oeauty, the quality, and the price of glass are heightened by the process of cutting, and it was equally notorious or susceptible of proof, that the process of cutting is accomplished by but one species of operation, viz.: the operation of grinding. It would appear plain then, that all glass subjected to this one known process, as being enhanced in value, was designed to fall within the description in the statute of <em>\u201cglass cut\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">The articles of glassware enumerated in schedule C, as being subject to an impost of 30 per centum, are thus described, viz.: glass tumblers plain, moulded, or' pressed, <em>\u201cnot cut or punted.\u201d </em>Upon the language of the description just quoted it would seem too clear for cavil, that <em>cut </em>or <em>punted </em>tumblers, cannot be placed in the same class with those .that are enumerated as <em>\u201cplain, moulded, </em>or <em>pressed,\u201d </em>but are carefully contradistinguished from these last denominations. <em>Out </em>or <em>punted </em>tumblers, therefore, even if these two terms could be understood as having different significations and were not applicable merely to different degrees of cutting or grinding, do not fall under the lower rate of duty but all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number><em>cut </em>tumblers, no matter in what part, in what figures, or to what extent they are cut, and all <em>punted </em>tumblers, were by the act of Congress of July 30th, 1846, subject to a duty of 40 'per cent, upon the proper construction of the language of the statute. An effort has been made to control this language, by introducing the opinions of certain dealers in glass, and of other persons in the city of New York, to show, that tumblers, the' entire bottom of which are ground or smoothed by the glass-cutter, and tumblers the sides of which are wrought and ornamented by the same means, are not considered as <em>cut, </em>but are held to be the first <em>plain, </em>and the second <em>engraved </em>tumblers. The sum of the argument thus attempted, when tested by common sense, amounts to this: That the process of grinding or cutting, when applied to the entire surface of the bottom of tumblers, or to the ornamenting of their sides, although it be the identical process and the only one by which cut glass is manufactured, is not cutting, but something less; and that the manufacturing -of cut glass, means something else or beyond the only process by which cut glass is ever made. The integrity or indeed the intelligibility of this argument, this court are unable to perceive. It cannot be sustained in opposition to the language of the statute, in violation of consistency, and against the weight of the testimony in the cause, upon mere arbitrary and unfounded assumption, or upon opinion entertained within a limited theatre, and this by persons whose interests are involved in and would be advanced by that assumption. The weakness of this assumption is further exposed by recurrence to facts stated by manufacturers and found in the record, in strict conformity with Which, the distinction made in the statute appears to have been taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">Thus it is proved, that tumblers are manufactured either entirely by the glassblower, or in part by the glassblower, and in part by the cutter or grinder; and <em>that glass-blowing and glass-cutting are distinct and separate trades and processes of manufacture. </em>It is further shown, in proof, that the bottoms of tumblers manufactured entirely by the glassblower, are rough in the centre, being there broken off from the <em>putit </em>or stick in which they <em>are made; </em>that after their completion as far as can be by the glassblower, they pass into the hands of the cutter or grinder, by whom the centre of the bottom is cut or smoothed, and that the process of thus cutting or smoothing the centre of the bottoms of these tumblers, is called <em>punting. </em>Again it is in proof, that the tumblers, as made by the glassblower, are frequently passed to the cutter or grinder, by whom the <em>entire surface </em>of the bottom is cut or smoothed; and it is the tumbler, thus cut and finished by the glasscutter, that is said to be known in the trade in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>New York as \u201c the plain tumbler,\u201d or as the \u201c plain, smoothed-bottomed tumbler.\u201d It is also proved, that the cutting and smoothing the bottom of the tumbler is effected by the identical process which is applied in <em>punting, </em>the only difference consisting in the fact, that in the former operation it extends to the <em>entire surface, </em>instead. of being limited to the point at which the tumbler was separated from the punt or stick. \u201c Cut or punted tumblers are expressly distinguished in the statute from glass tumblers, <em>plain, moulded, or </em>pressed.\u201d Punted tumblers, it is clearly shown by the facts certified, are made by the operation of cutting or grinding the centre of the bottom; the smoothing of the entire bottoms of tumblers, is merely the application of the same process, to a greater extent; how this extended application can cause those tumblers subjected to it to be considered less as <em>cut glass, </em>than if they were merely punted, or cut at a small point of the bottom, presents a problem not easy of solution. Could these tumblers, with the entire bottom or sides cut or ground, be, with any propriety of language, denominated \u201cplain tumblers,\u201d or \u201cplain, smoothed-bottomed tumblers,\u201d they still are not the less \u201c plain tumblers,\u201d or \u201c plain, smoothed-bottomed tumblers,\u201d or- \u201c plain tumblers with flattened bottoms,\u201d or \u201c engraved tumblers \u201d so constituted by the operation of <em>cutting or grinding. </em>In this view of the question certified, it is the opinion of this court, that glass tumblers, having the entire surface or bottom smoothed or polished, or their sides figured or ornamented by cutting or grinding, come regularly within the operation of schedule B of the Tariff Act of July 30th, 1846, and are, within the intent and meaning of that schedule, subject to a duty of 40 per <em>centum.act valorem, </em>as <em>glass cut; </em>and we order it to be so certified to the- Circuit Court of the United States, for the Southern District of Nevy York.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">\n<em>Order.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">This caus\u00e9 came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the .United States for the Southern District of New York, and on the point or question on which the judges of the said Circuit Court were opposed in opinion, and which was certified to this court for its opinion, agreeably to the act of Congress in such case made and provided, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, it is the opinion, of this court, that, according to the tru\u00e9 construction of the act of Congress of 30th July, 1846, entitled \u201c An Act reducing the duty on imports, and for other purposes,\u201d glass tumblers, the bottoms of which have been smoothed or flattened by the process of cutting or grinding, and glass tumblers which have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>engraved on the sides by a similar process, should be charged with the duty of 40 per centum <em>ad </em>valorem, under schedule B of said act, as cut glass. Whereupon, it is now here ordered and adjudged by this court that it be so certified to the said Circuit Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
