Bastardy\u2014subsequent marriage of the mother\u2014effect upon her rights under the Bastardy act. Under the Bastardy act, complaint during pregnancy, and before delivery of the child, can only be made by an unmarried woman; but after delivery while she is single, the subsequent marriage of the mother will not prevent her from making complaint against the reputed father of the child.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b292-12\" pgmap=\"292\">2.

A trial was had in the Criminal Court of Cook county, which resulted in a verdict of guilty, and judgment against the defendant in the sum of $493.50, from which he appealed to the Appellate Court for the First District. In the Appellate Court this judgment was reversed, and final judgment entered against the prosecutrix, on the ground that being married at the time of making the complaint, she did not come within the Bastardy act, and could not institute the proceeding. The prosecutrix brings the case to this court by writ of error, and asks a reversal o\"f the judgment of the Appellate Court, claiming that the proceeding will lie, for the reason that she was unmarried at the time of the birth of the child.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b293-6\" pgmap=\"293\">Mr. Clarence F.

In that case the complainant must be \u201cunmarried\u201d at the time of making the complaint. It also authorizes the institution of the prosecution when an unmarried woman has been delivered of a child, in which case it is not necessary that she be unmarried when she makes the complaint. The marriage of the mother of an illegitimate child, after delivery, to one not the father, can not affect the status of such child, and her husband will not be liable for its support. (Brush v. Blanchard, 18 Ill. 46; Mowbry v. Mowbry, 64 id. 383.) The true construction of the statute is, that the mother shall be unmarried at the time the child is born, and the word \u201cunmarried, \u201d in the law, does not properly relate to the time of making the complaint.</p> <p id=\"b295-6\" pgmap=\"295\">The judgment of the Appellate Court will be reversed, and the cause remanded to that court, with direction to enter judgment in conformity to this opinion.</p> <p id=\"b295-7\" pgmap=\"295\">Judgment reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
