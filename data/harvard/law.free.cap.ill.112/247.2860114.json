Landlord and tenant\u2014extent of landlord\u2019s lien. A lien is given by the statute to a landlord upon crops growing and grown upon demised premises in any year, for the rent that shall accrue during such year; but no specific lien is created or given as to any other property of the tenant.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b247-13\" pgmap=\"247\">2. Same\u2014statute of Anne, giving lien, not in force in this State. The statute of 8th Anne, C. 14, giving a landlord a lien on the goods and chattels of his tenant, generally, is not in force in this State, being of a date later than the fourth year of James I. If ever in force here as a part of the laws of Virginia, it has been repealed by implication, or superseded by subsequent acts of our legislature intended as revisions of the whole subject.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b247-14\" pgmap=\"247\">3. Same\u2014distress subject to prior liens. A distress warrant issued and placed in the hands of a sheriff after his receipt and levy of executions upon the goods and chattels of the tenant, not crops grown or growing upon the demised premises, does not take precedence of the executions, and a levy of the distress warrant will be subject to the prior liens of the executions.</syllabus><summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-15\" pgmap=\"247\">Appeal from the Appellate Court for the Second District;\u2014 heard in that court on appeal from the County Court of Peoria county; the Hon. L. W. James, Judge, presiding.</summary><summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-16\" pgmap=\"247\">This was a motion by William A. Herron, for a rule on Samuel L. Gill, late sheriff of Peoria county, to pay appellant the sum due him for rent from Marvin A. Breed, out of the proceeds of assets of said Breed in his (Gill\u2019s) hands, as sheriff, for distribution to execution creditors of Breed. The motion was overruled, and Herron appealed to the Appellate Court for the Second District, where the judgment of the county court was affirmed, and the case comes to this court on Herron\u2019s further appeal.</summary><summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-17\" pgmap=\"247(31) 248(369) 249(57)\">\"The stipulation relating to the facts, filed with the motion, shows that Breed was for many years a tenant of Herron, doing a general merchandise business, and owning a stock of goods, with which he occupied a store-room of Herron. On July 14, 1882, there was due Herron, for rent, $1364.83, and on that day Herron issued a distress warrant, directed to said Gill, and delivered the' same to him, to execute, at thro\u2019clock P. M., and Gill, as sheriff, returned that he had levied the same on the stock of goods belonging to Breed, in the said store. t On July 15, 1882, a copy of the distress warrant, with the indorsement thereon, was filed in the circuit court of Peoria county, and such proceedings were had that at the next succeeding term judgment was rendered against Breed-for said amount. On the 13th of July, (the day prior to the issue and levy of the distress warrant,) judgments by confession were obtained in the county court of Peoria county against Breed, in favor of the following parties: First National Bank of Peoria, two judgments,\u2014one for $906.64, and one for $526.50; John C. Tates, for $328; Hattie A. Breed, for $1000; and Stevens &amp; Lee, for $75,\u2014on each of which judgments execution issued forthwith, and came to the hands of Gill, as sheriff, on the 13th of July, all before noon. On the following day, (July 14,) and before the issue and delivery of the distress warrant, judgments by confession were rendered in the county court against Breed, in favor of other parties, upon which executions were issued on the same day, and placed in the sheriff\u2019s hands before the distress warrant, and were levied upon all the goods afterwards levied upon by the distress warrant. The sheriff, in pursuance of the levies under the executions, took possession of all of said goods, and still had possession thereof when the distress warrant came to his hands. Afterwards, by agreement of the execution creditors and Herron, the sheriff surrendered-the goods to the assignee of Breed, and an order was entered in the county court authorizing the assignee to sell the same at public or private sale, and hold the proceeds as custodian for the sheriff, and subject to the rights and priorities therein of each of said parties, and directing him to return to said sheriff enough of said proceeds to answer all said writs. The net proceeds of the goods were admitted to be insufficient to pay said executions and the claim for rent. The appellant, Herron, claims that he has a lien upon the goods for one year\u2019s rent, and this is the real point presented by the record.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b249-4\" pgmap=\"249\">Messrs.

Penny v.

Stat. 1874, chap. 80, sec. 31,) but no specific lien is created or given as to any other property of the tenant. (Hadden et al. v. Knickerbocker, 70 Ill. 677.) At common law, before the adoption of the statute of 8th Anne, G. 14, the landlord had no lien of any kind, but only a right to distrain. Grant v. Whitwell, 9 Iowa, 156; Doane v. Garretson, 24 id. 351; Craddock v. Riddlesbarger, 2 Dana, 208; Eye v. Eye, 5 Watts, 139.</p> <p id=\"b251-8\" pgmap=\"251(42) 252(48)\">This court has held that when personal property has been sold by the tenant in payment of a preexisting debt, in good faith, and the purchaser has removed the same from the demised premises, such property is not liable to distress for \u00a1vent, either at common law or by any provision of our statute, even though the purchaser knew there was rent due.

Scott, 4 W. &amp; S. 344; Hamilton v. Reedy, 3 McCord, 38.</p> <p id=\"A9\" pgmap=\"252\">The .statute of Anne, giving a landlord such a lien, is not in force in this State, being .of a date later than the fourth year of James I. If ever in force here as a part of the laws of \"Virginia, it has been repealed by implication, or superseded by subsequent acts of our legislature intended as revisions of the whole subject; and the present statute, by giving the landlord a lien only upon crops growing or grown, by implication excludes the idea of a lien on any other property of the tenant. All the executions, here, came to the hands of the appellee, Gill, as sheriff of Peoria county, and were levied upon the goods of Breed, the tenant, before the distress warrant was issued and placed in his hands. When it came to his hands the lien of the various executions had attached, and any levy of the distress warrant was subject to such prior lien.</p> <p id=\"b252-6\" pgmap=\"252\">Perceiving no error, the judgment of the Appellate Court will be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b252-7\" pgmap=\"252\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
