Negligence\u2014care required of persons crossing railroad trade. It is the duty of a person about to cross a railroad track, to approach cautiously, and endeavor to ascertain if there is present danger in crossing; and when the railroad track and crossing are so situated that the approach of a train can not be seen, it may be the duty of a person about to cross, to stop and look, to ascertain if a train is coming.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b398-20\" pgmap=\"398\">2. Same\u2014whether proper care exercised\u2014a question of fact-r-of instructions in respect thereto. It is a question of fact for the jury to determine, from the evidence, whether a person receiving an injury from the alleged negligence of another, and who sues to recover therefor, has exercised proper care and caution on his part, and not one of law. It is not for the court to tell the jury that certain facts constitute negligence, and an instruction so telling the jury is erroneous.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b398-21\" pgmap=\"398(52) 399(40)\">3. In an action against a railway company, the court was asked by the defendant to instruct that if the jury believed, from the evidence, that the plaintiff \u201c could have discovered the approach of defendant\u2019s train, and avoided the injury in question by having stopped his mule before driving upon the track, and looking and listening for the approach of said train, then he can not recover in this case, unless, \u201d etc.: Held, properly refused, as it virtually took the question of fact (plaintiff\u2019s care or negligence) from the jury.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b399-5\" pgmap=\"399\">4. In the same case the defendant asked the court to instruct the jury \u201cthat those in charge of the train which collided with the plaintiff were not bound to stop the same in anticipation that plaintiff might drive upon the track,\u201d which the court refused: Held, properly refused, as invading the province of the jury, and taking the question of negligence from them.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b399-6\" pgmap=\"399\">5. There may be cases where a railroad company or its servants would be under no obligation whatever to stop its train, and on the other hand there may be cases where a failure to do so would be gross negligence. Whether it is, or not, in a particular case, is a question exclusively for the jury to determine, from the evidence.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b399-7\" pgmap=\"399\">6. An instruction which merely informs the jury that what a person, on approaching a railroad crossing, should do in order to exercise ordinary care for his safety, and what should be done in operating a railway in order to exercise the same degree of care for the safety of others, is a question of fact for the jury to determine, from the evidence, is substantially good, and there is no error in giving the same in an action against a railroad company, to recover damages arising from a collision at a crossing in a public street.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b399-8\" pgmap=\"399\">7. Same\u2014 defence that the person injured was aiding in the violation of an ordinance. The fact that a plaintiff injured by a collision with a passing train of a railroad company, was, at the time of the accident, in the employment of a lumber firm who kept more than ten thousand feet of lumber stored in one place without a permit, in violation of a city ordinance, is no defence to an action against the railroad company to recover for the injury caused by its negligence, and evidence of such facts can not have any legitimate bearing on the question of negligence, or the defendant\u2019s liability. Even a violator of the ordinance is entitled to the same protection as any other citizen.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b399-10\" pgmap=\"399\">8. Allegations and proofs\u2014must correspond. If the negligence of a defendant in a suit for an injury is established by the evidence, that evidence must necessarily have been confined to the averments of the declaration, as negligent acts not averred in the declaration can not be proven.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b399-11\" pgmap=\"399\">9. Instructions\u2014as explaining the reason for refusing others ashed. The court gave the jury an instruction on its own motion, in the first part of which was stated the reason why certain instructions were refused: Held, that this was not a proper subject for the consideration of the jury, but as the instruction could not have affected the verdict, the giving of it was no ground for reversal.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b399-12\" pgmap=\"399(48) 400(82)\">10. Same\u2014instruction construed, as whether leaving jury to determine applicability of an ordinance. In an action to recover for a personal injury caused by negligence, the court instructed the jury that if the plaintiff, while exercising ordinary care to avoid the injury, was injured by the negligence of the defendant, as charged in the declaration, they should find for the plaintiff. One count of the declaration charged the defendant with negligence in failing to have a flagman at the place of the accident, in violation of an ordinance of the city of Chicago: Held, that the words, \u201cas charged in the declaration,\u201d did not leave it to the jury to determine the applicability of the ordinance to the circumstances of the case, and that the instruction was a proper one.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b400-4\" pgmap=\"400\">11. Same\u2014whether the jury are told they may give punitive damages\u2014 in an action for personal injury from negligence. In case against a railway corporation for negligence resulting in a personal injury, the court instructed the jury that if they found for the plaintiff, then, in fixing the damages, they should take into consideration all the circumstances as disclosed by the evidence, \u201csuch as the circumstances attending the injury.\" There was no evidence given to authorize exemplary damages, and none were claimed by the plaintiff: Held, that the instruction was not open to the objection that it authorized the jury to give punitive damages under the circumstances, and could not have misled the jury.</syllabus><summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-5\" pgmap=\"400\">Appeal from the Appellate Court for the First District;\u2014 heard in that court on appeal from the Superior Court of Cook county; the Hon.

Railway Co. v. Kellam, 92 Ill. 245; Springall v. Ball, 4 F. &amp; F. 472; Harlan v. Railway Co. 65 Mo. 22.</p> <opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b403-5\" pgmap=\"403\">Mr. Justice Craig</author> <p id=\"AyO\" pgmap=\"403\">delivered the opinion of the Court:</p> <p id=\"b403-6\" pgmap=\"403\">No question is made in regard to the admission or exclusion of evidence. The only question, therefore, to be considered is, whether the law governing the case was properly given to the jury by the instructions of the court.</p> <p id=\"b403-7\" pgmap=\"403\">The court gave two instructions on behalf of the plaintiff, and they are both claimed to he erroneous. The first in substance directed the jury that if they' believed, from the evidence, that the plaintiff, while exercising ordinary care to avoid the injury, was injured by the negligenee of the defendant, as charged in the declaration, they will find for the plaintiff. The second count of the declaration charged the defendant with negligence in failing to have a flagman at the place of the accident, in violation of an ordinance of the city of Chicago, and it is claimed that the words of the instruction, \u201cas charged in the declaration, \u201d left the jury to determine the applicability of the' ordinance to the circumstances of the case. We think this is a misapprehension of the meaning of \u2019 the instruction. Whether the railroad was required to keep a flagman at the place of the accident, whose duty it was to flag persons whq attempted to cross the track, was not alluded to or mentioned in the instruction. If the negligence of the defendant was established by the evidence, that evidence was necessarily confined to the averments of the declaration, as negligent acts not averred in the declaration could not be proven,\u2014and we perceive no substantial objection to the instruction;</p> <p id=\"b404-4\" pgmap=\"404\">The second instruction, to which objection is made, declared, in substance, that if the jury believed, from the evidence, under the instructions of the court, that the plaintiff was entitled to recover, then, in fixing the damages, the jury should take into consideration all the circumstances as disclosed by the evidence, \u201csuch as the circumstances attending the injury.\u201d Under this last clause of the instruction, counsel for appellant urge that the jury might give punitive damages. There was no evidence introduced on the trial which would authorize the jury to give punitive damages, and by the terms of the instruction they were limited and confined to the evidence in making a verdict. Indeed, so far as appears from the record, there was no pretence on the part of plaintiff that he was entitled to recover punitive damages. As no such claim was made, and as no evidence was offered to establish a claim of that character, the instruction could not have misled the jury.</p> <p id=\"b404-5\" pgmap=\"404\">The court refused defendant\u2019s instruction No. 1, which was as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b404-6\" pgmap=\"404\">\u201cThe jury are instructed that it is the duty of a person, before attempting to cross a railway track, to stop, if necessary, and look and listen for the approach of trains, before entering upon such track; and if the jury believe, from the evidence, that the plaintiff in this case could have discovered the approach of the defendant\u2019s train, and avoided the injury in question by having stopped his mule before driving upon the track, and looking and listening for the approach of said train, then he can not recover in this case, unless the jury shall believe, from the evidence, that the agents or servants of the defendant were guilty of gross negligence in the operation of said train.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b404-7\" pgmap=\"404(35) 405(144)\">\u2014And this' decision is relied upon as error. It is no doubt true that it is the duty of a person about to cross a railroad track, to approach cautiously, and endeavor to ascertain if there is present danger in crossing; and where the railroad track and crossing are so situated that the approach of a train can not be seen, it may be the duty of a person about to cross, to stop and look, to ascertain if a train is coming; but it is always a question of fact for the jury to determine, from the evidence, whether the person injured has exercised proper care and caution in crossing a railroad track, and not a question of law. It was the province of the jury to determine whether the plaintiff was guilty of negligence, and not for the court to tell the jury that certain facts constituted negligence. The instruction, as drawn, took the question of fact from the jury, and hence was erroneous, and for this reason the court did not err in refusing it.</p> <p id=\"b405-4\" pgmap=\"405\">The defendant\u2019s ninth instruction, which the court refused, is liable to the same objection. It declared: \u201cThe jury are instructed that those in charge of the train which collided with the plaintiff were not bound to stop the same, in anticipation that plaintiff might drive upon the track. \u201d It was for the jury to determine, from all the evidence, whether those in charge of the train were guilty of negligence in not stopping the train before the collision occurred. Cases might occur where a railroad would be under no obligation whatever to stop its train, and on the other hand cases might arise where a failure to do so would be gross negligence. Each case must be determined by its facts, and those facts are for the jury.</p> <p id=\"b405-6\" pgmap=\"405(103) 406(77)\">On the trial the defendant read in evidence an ordinance of the city of Chicago, to the following effect: \u201cNo person, without first obtaining a permit therefor from the city council, shall hereafter establish or keep any lumber yard, or place for the storing, or piling, or deposit of lumber for sale, in quantities exceeding ten thousand feet, upon any land within the limits of the city, except such land fronts or abuts on navigable water.\u201d The defendant also introduced evidence that Parsons &amp; Foster owned the lumber yard where appellee was employed in hauling lumber, at the time of the accident; that they bought and sold lumber by the cargo, and the average quantity kept in their yard was three millions of feet. It was also proven that the premises occupied as a lumber yard did' not front or abut on navigable water, and it was not proven that Parsons &amp; Foster had a permit from the city, as required by the ordinance. Under this evidence the defendant requested the court to give the following instruction:</p> <blockquote id=\"b406-4\" pgmap=\"406\">\u201cIf the jury believe, from the evidence and the instructions of the court, that the lumber yard of Parsons &amp; Foster, located on the corner of Fulton and Canal streets, in the city of Chicago, Cook county, Illinois, did not abut or front on navigable waters, and that said Parsons &amp; Foster stored and kept therein lumber in quantities exceeding ten thousand feet, then the keeping of said yard by said Parsons &amp; Foster was illegal, unless the jury shall find, from the evidence, that the said Parsons &amp; Foster had a permit from the common council to keep said lumber yard; and the hauling of lumber to said yard, and the crossing of the defendant\u2019s tracks for the purpose of hauling lumber, would in such case be illegal and wrongful on the part of the plaintiff, as an employe or servant of said Parsons &amp; Foster. \u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b406-5\" pgmap=\"406(130) 407(143)\">This and several other instructions announcing in a different form the same principle, were refused. We do not think that the ordinance had -any legitimate bearing on the case, or on the rights or duties of the parties. It was doubtless passed to guard against the destruction of property by fire, and had no reference whatever to the duties of a railroad company, or the rights of an individual who might be employed by any one who kept lumber in quantity at a place prohibited by the ordinance whose duties might require him to cross the railroad track. Again, if Parsons &amp; Foster kept a lumber yard contrary to the ordinance of the city of Chicago, that was a matter resting entirely between the firm and the city authorities, and in no manner concerned appellant,\u2014so far, at least, as the railroad was required by law to run its trains. Parsons &amp; Poster, and their employes, were entitled to the same protection in crossing the railroad track, although they kept a lumber yard in violation of the ordinance, as any other citizen of Chicago who might have occasion to cross the railroad track. If appellee had been a trespasser in going upon the railroad track, a different question might arise, but he was not. He had a right to cross the railroad track, which was constructed on a public street, and the company, in operating its trains, was bound to exercise proper care to avoid injury. If we are correct in this view, it follows that the instruction, and others announcing a similar principle, were properly refused by the court.</p> <p id=\"b407-5\" pgmap=\"407\">The court, on its own motion, gave one instruction to the jury, to which exception was taken. In the first part of the instruction the court gave the reason why certain instructions were refused. We do not understand that this was a proper subject for the consideration of the jury; but as the instruction could not affect the verdict, it could do no. harm to appellant, and hence can not be relied upon to reverse the judgment. The latter part of the instruction merely informs the jury that what a person approaching a railroad should do in order to exercise ordinary care for his safety, and what should be done in operating a railway in order to exercise the same degree of care for the safety of others, is a question of fact, for the jury to determine, from the evidence. We perceive no substantial objection to this portion of the instruction.</p> <p id=\"b407-6\" pgmap=\"407\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b407-7\" pgmap=\"407\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
