Action\u2014remedy to collect tax by action of debt. The right to recover a tax upon moneys and credits by an action of debt, depends upon the fact whether a valid tax is delinquent, and not upon the question of the regularity of the steps to enforce its payment through forfeiture and sale of property. The remedy in debt is cumulative, and is only barred by a prior judgment when it. is shown to have been satisfied.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b272-10\" pgmap=\"272\">2. Pleading\u2014of the declaration in suit to collect taxes. Whether property is taxable at a particular place is a question of law, and not of fact;, and the pleader seeking to charge one with liability, upon the ground his property is taxable at a particular place, must, therefore, state the facts from which such liability results, as a conclusion of law. An averment in a declaration that credits are liable to taxation at a certain place, is simply the statement of a legal conclusion.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b272-11\" pgmap=\"272\">3. Taxation\u2014moneys and credits\u2014as to resident and non-resident owners. By the statute, moneys, credits, etc., and other personal property held, owned or controlled by persons residing in this State, are taxable. If the owner resides in this State, they are taxable at his place of residence. If he is a non-resident, and the moneys, credits, etc., and other personal property, are under the control of an agent or attorney, they shall be listed in the place where the agent or attorney is required to list his own moneys and credits and other personal property.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b272-12\" pgmap=\"272\">4.

In order to the proper taxation of the moneys and credits of a non-resident at a particular place in this State, they must be under the control of an agent or attorney residing there, and such control must be an actual control at that place.</syllabus><summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-13\" pgmap=\"272\">Writ of Error to the Circuit Court of Christian county; the Hon.

Jones, their attorney, and John Gr. Brennan, State\u2019s attorney for said county, complain of Henry Davis, the defendant, of a plea of debt,\u2014for that the defendant, on the first day of May, A. D. 1875, and afterward, was the owner of a large amount of personal property, consisting of moneys, moneys loaned and invested, notes, mortgages, bonds and credits,\u2014 which said personal property, moneys and credits were controlled by Henry D. Davis, as agent for said defendant; that at said time said Henry D. Davis resided in and had his office and place of business in school district No. 2, in the town of Taylorville, in the county of Christian, State of Illinois; that on, to-wit, the second day of May, A. D. 1875, the assessor of the township of Taylorville, in said county, applied to said Henry D. Davis, and requested him to make a statement of the personal property of said defendant controlled by said Henry D. Davis, as his agent, for the purpose of taxation, as provided by law; that said Henry D. Davis refused to make any list or statement of such personal property, and thereupon the said assessor ascertained the amount and value thereof, and assessed the same at the sum of $142,707; that said sum was the fair amount and value of said property ; and that for the year A. D. 1875 a personal property tax was levied against defendant, upon said assessment, to the aggregate amount of $2554.67, being $421.10 State tax due to the State of Illinois, the sum of $332.16 county tax due said Christian county as a county tax, and $63.69 as a county railroad tax, $50.45 town tax due the town of Taylorville, in said county, as a town tax, and $203.79 due said town as town railroad tax, and $1451.90 district school tax, \u2022 due school district No. 2, in township 13, north, range 2, west of the third principal meridian, in said town of Taylorville, and county aforesaid; that said State, county, county railroad, town, town railroad and district school tax were, by the county clerk of said county, duly extended upon the tax collector\u2019s book of said town of Taylorville,- as the law requires; that said tax collector\u2019s book, with the said taxes extended thereon, was duly delivered to the collector of said town for the year A.

D. 1876, and that he would offer said land for sale on the 19th day of June, A. D. 1876, and designated the said tract in said advertisement as the tract against which said personal property tax was charged; that said county collector showed the fact that said personal property tax was charged against said land, in his list of delinquent lands filed for judgment at the June term, A. D. 1876, of said county court, as the law requires; that at said June term, A. D. 1876, of said county court, judgment was duly rendered against said land for said taxes and costs; that on the 19th day of June, 1876, said county collector offered said land for sale at public sale, in pursuance of such notice; that at said sale said collector received no bid for said land, and the said land was then and there forfeited to the State of Illinois; that defendant has never paid the said taxes, nor any part thereof, and plaintiff avers that the said personal property tax so attached to said land was, by the county clerk of said county, carried forward, with the interest thereon proided by law in case of back taxes, and extended on the collector\u2019s -book in the town of Mosquito, where said land is situated, each year thereafter; that said collector\u2019s book, with the taxes so extended thereon, has been duly delivered to the collector of said town of Mosquito each year since the said year 1876, with a proper warrant thereto attached, as required by law; that said defendant was not at any time a resident of said town of Mosquito, and had no personal property in said county during nor since the year 1876 out of which the said taxes could be made; that the said town collector, for each of said years since 1876, returned said taxes to the county collector, uncollected, with a statement in writing, under oath, that he had used due diligence, and that said taxes could not be collected; that the county collector of said county, for each.year since 1876, reported said taxes to the county court of said county as delinquent, and specified the same, as required by law, each year, on the delinquent list filed by him to obtain judgment against said land for said taxes, and that judgment was rendered against said land each year for said taxes by said county court; that said land was, after being duly advertised by the said county collector, offered for sale each year, and each year said land was forfeited to the State for want of bidders; and plaintiff avers that the county clerk of said county extended the said taxes forward, as back taxes, upon the collector\u2019s book for said town of Mosquito, for the year A. D. 1879, containing the taxes of 1879, in separate columns, as required by law; that the total amount of said taxes, with the interest thereon, and taxes as provided by law, extended upon said book, was the sum of $3804.50; that said tax book, with said taxes for said year 1879, was duly delivered to the collector of said town of Mosquito, with a proper warrant thereto attached; that said collector returned said tax, uncollected, to the county collector of said county when he returned the said book, with a statement in writing, under oath, that he had used due diligence to .collect the said taxes, and that the same could not be collected; that the said county collector duly advertised said land for judgment, on the second Monday of June, A.

D. 1875, was the owner of a large amount of moneys, credits, goods and chattels, situated and liable to taxation in the town of Taylorville, in the county of Christian, in the State of Illinois, and being so liable to taxation, the assessor of said town of Taylorville for the year 1875, did assess the said goods and chattels, moneys and credits of defendant at the sum of $142,707, and that for the year A. D. 1875 a personal property tax was levied against defendant, upon his said assessment, to the aggregate amount of $2554.67, (specifying the different kinds of taxes, and amounts;) that said taxes were, by the county clerk of said county, duly extended upon the tax collector\u2019s book of said town of Taylorville, for the taxes due for the year A.

It is a proceeding to enforce a forfeiture under special provisions of the statute. It is not an action of debt, arising out of .a common law liability to pay taxes, according to earlier decisions of this court. Ryan v. Gallatin County, 14 Ill. 83; Dunlap v. Gallatin County, 15 id. 9.</p><p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-6\" pgmap=\"280\">The averments in the declaration would not justify an action of debt at common law. The omission to aver the residence of the defendant and facts which would create a legal liability, forbids such action. Taxes are not debts, in the ordinary sense of that term. They are not contracts between the State and the citizen.

Biggins v. People, 96 Ill. 385.</p><p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-9\" pgmap=\"280\">The fact of ownership at a particular time is an essential averment. It should be positive, and not left to inference. Even when a court of general jurisdiction exercises a special statutory power, it stands upon the same ground as courts of limited jurisdiction. In such case, nothing shall be intended to be within the jurisdiction but that which is expressly averred. Haywood v. Collins, 60 Ill. 333.</p> <opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b280-10\" pgmap=\"280\">Mr. Chief Justice Scholfield</author> <p id=\"AqY\" pgmap=\"280\">delivered the opinion of the Court:</p> <p id=\"b280-11\" pgmap=\"280(29) 281(154)\">We see no cause to disturb this judgment. By section 1, chapter 120, of the Revised Statutes of 1874, entitled \u201cRevenue,\u201d moneys, credits, etc., and other personal property held, owned or controlled by persons residing in this State, are taxable. If the owner resides in the State, they are taxable at the residence of the owner. (Ibid. sec. 7.) If the owner is a non-resident, and the moneys, credits, etc., and other personal property, are under the control of an agent or attorney, they shall be listed in the same place where such agent or attorney is required to list his own moneys and credits, and other personal property. (Secs. 6, 19.) But where the owner is a non-resident, before he can be taxed here it must be shown that his property is actually at the place where it is assessed; and it is not enough to show, merely, that an indebtedness to him, evidenced by a promissory note which may be in his hands, was negotiated through an agent at that place. Goldgart v. People ex rel. 106 Ill. 25.</p> <p id=\"b281-5\" pgmap=\"281\">The primary liability of the defendant, here, rests upon the fact that at the date at which his liability is claimed to commence, he was the owner of moneys, credits or other personal property, and resided there, or such moneys, credits or other personal property were under the control of an agent or attorney residing there; and such control must be an actual control at that place. (Goldgart v. People, supra.) Whether property is legally taxable at a particular place, is a question of law, and not' of fact; and the pleader seeking to charge one with liability because his property is taxable at a particular place, must, therefore, state the facts from which such liability results, as a conclusion of law. This is elementary, and has been often decided by this court.</p> <p id=\"b281-6\" pgmap=\"281(84) 282(69)\">There is no averment in the first count that the defendant resided at the place where the property was assessed, at the date of the assessment, nor is there any averment therein that the property was, at that date, under the actual control of an agent or attorney at that place. For aught that appears therein, the evidences of indebtedness, and other personal property, may, at that time, actually have been elsewhere. There is no averment in the second count either that the defendant resided at the place where the property was assessed, at the date of the assessment, or that it was, at that time, in the actual coiitrol of an agent or attorney at that place. The' averment that the property was liable to taxation at that place, is simply the statement of a legal conclusion. The facts from which that conclusion is claimed to result, should have been stated.</p> <p id=\"b282-5\" pgmap=\"282\">To avoid misapprehension hereafter, we may state this is not a suit to recover a forfeiture. The action is to recover a tax due, which has been unavailingly attempted to be col-' leeted by forfeiture and sale of property. The right to recover depends upon the fact that a valid tax is delinquent, and not upon the regularity of the steps to enforce its payment through forfeiture and sale. The remedy is cumulative, and is only barred by a prior judgment when it is shown to have been satisfied.</p> <p id=\"b282-6\" pgmap=\"282\">The judgment is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b282-7\" pgmap=\"282\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
