Brinkley filed a putative class action against defendant Monterey Financial Services, Inc. (Monterey), asserting statutory violations arising from allegations that Monterey unlawfully recorded and/or monitored telephone conversations that Brinkley had with Monterey's representatives. Monterey moved to compel Brinkley to arbitrate her individual claims and to dismiss Brinkley's class claims, based on an arbitration agreement contained in a contract that Brinkley entered into with a third party who subsequently assigned Brinkley's contract to Monterey. The trial court ordered Brinkley to arbitrate her individual claims, and dismissed the class claims, as Monterey had requested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On appeal, Brinkley raises a number of challenges to the trial court's order compelling arbitration. She contends that (1) the claims fall outside the scope of the arbitration agreement; (2) the arbitration clause is unconscionable and therefore unenforceable; and (3) the court erred in dismissing her class action claims because the parties agreed that an arbitrator would determine whether class arbitration is available under the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We conclude that Brinkley's claims fall within the scope of the arbitration agreement and that the arbitration agreement is enforceable, with the exception of one provision that we find to be unconscionable under the applicable jurisdiction's law. We conclude, however, that it is possible to sever the unconscionable provision from the remainder of the arbitration agreement and\n   from the contract as a whole. We therefore affirm the trial court's order compelling arbitration of Brinkley's claims. However, because the parties' agreement delegates to the arbitrator the question whether class arbitration is available under the contract, we reverse that portion of the trial court's order compelling the arbitration of Brinkley's individual claims, alone, and dismissing Brinkley's class claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Monterey Financial Services provides three services to its customers, including\n   consumer financing, loan servicing, and debt collecting. Real Estate Investor Education (REIE) was one of Monterey's customers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On or about August 10, 2011, Brinkley signed up to receive six real estate coaching sessions through REIE for $4,195. Brinkley paid REIE $850, and financed the remainder of the purchase price through REIE's \"Retail Installment Contract\" (the RIC). Once Brinkley's financing was approved, she had 30 days to complete an e-signature process. During this period of time, she had the ability to access the RIC online. Brinkley executed the RIC with her e-signature on August 24, 2011. The RIC provided that Brinkley could cancel the contract within three days of e-signing it if she were to change her mind.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The RIC contains a choice of law provision that provides: \"This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted and constructed in accordance with the law of your state of residence as indicated on the address section hereof completed by you, as applied to contracts between residents of such state entered into and to be performed wholly within such state.\" Brinkley identified her residence as being in the state of Washington.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The RIC also contains the following arbitration provision:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"AGREEMENT DISPUTE RESOLUTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"ARBITRATION: By signing this Agreement, you agree that, except as provided below, any claim or dispute arising out of or in any way related to this Agreement, whether past, present or future, or any matter of fact, law, background, circumstance, or other matter of any kind whatsoever relating to this Agreement, shall be resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. You further acknowledge and agree that the sole and exclusive venue for such binding arbitration shall be San Diego, California. The decision by the arbitrator or arbitrators shall be final and binding on all parties, and may be entered in any court of competent\n   jurisdiction for enforcement. Such a decision shall include the payment of all fees and costs of the prevailing party. The determination of the 'prevailing party' shall be made by the arbitrator or arbitrators. The AGREEMENT FOR DISPUTE RESOLUTION shall not limit the right of any party to take non-judicial actions to enforce security interests and all rights related thereto, or to take judicial actions for (i) the enforcement of arbitration decisions, or (ii) the protection of any party pending arbitration decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"SMALL CLAIMS PROCEDURE: Additionally, because the purpose of the AGREEMENT FOR DISPUTE RESOLUTION is to promote fast and inexpensive resolution of claims and disputes, Buyer, Seller and Seller's assignee remain free to choose the small claims court procedure to resolve any dispute or claim, as defined above, that is within the monetary jurisdictional limit of the court. Buyer, Seller and Seller's assignee agree, however, that any claims, counterclaims and/or disputes, as defined above, of any sort which are in excess of the small claims court jurisdictional monetary limit must be arbitrated before the American Arbitration Association and in accordance with its rules.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In addition, the RIC informs consumers that the \"Seller may assign this Agreement to any third party without prior notice to you,\" and that \"[u]pon any such assignment, such third party will become the holder of this agreement and your\n   creditor.\" It further informs consumers regarding the party to whom the assignment may be made, stating, \"Seller intends to assign this agreement to Monterey Financial Services, [I]nc., 4095 Avenida de la Plata, Oceanside, CA 92056 ('Monterey'),\" and explains that \"[a]fter the assignment of this Agreement to Monterey, all questions concerning the terms of this Agreement or payments should be directed to Monterey at its address indicated above.\" Later, in a separate box that includes signature lines where the assignment can be effectuated, the consumer is told: \"TERMS CONTAINED IN THIS BOX ARE NOT PART OF THE BUYER'S AGREEMENT.\" According to Monterey, REIE assigned the RIC to Monterey shortly after the contract was executed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At some point, Brinkley stopped making payments on the RIC. According to Brinkley, she never received all of the coaching sessions from REIE, which went out of business in August 2012. Monterey took the position that Brinkley owed it the remaining payments, and began collection efforts against her. During Monterey's collection efforts, Monterey called Brinkley, and Brinkley called Monterey.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   According to the allegations in Brinkley's complaint, Brinkley made telephone calls to and received telephone calls from employees, officers, and/or agents of Monterey between December 2012 and March 2013. Brinkley also alleges that Monterey failed to inform Brinkley at any time that it was recording the telephone conversations between its representatives and Brinkley. During these calls, Brinkley revealed her identity and shared personal information. Brinkley believed that her calls were confidential and were not being monitored or recorded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Brinkley filed a putative class action against Monterey in October 2013, asserting causes of action for invasion of privacy, unlawful recording of telephone calls, and unlawful and unfair business practices. The class that Brinkley seeks to represent includes persons who made telephone calls to or received telephone calls from Monterey while located or residing in California or Washington, and who were not provided notice that the calls might be recorded or monitored. Brinkley asserts that Monterey's conduct in recording her confidential communications without her knowledge was an invasion of her privacy and a violation of the California Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA; Pen.Code, \u00a7\u00a7 630-637.5), which was enacted \"to address concerns that 'advances in science and technology that have led to the development of new devices and techniques for the purpose of eavesdropping upon private communications and that the invasion of privacy resulting from the continual and increasing use of such devices and techniques has created a serious threat to the free exercise of personal liberties and cannot be tolerated in a free and civilized society.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Kight v.

The choice-of-law provision indicates that the law that is to be applied is the law of the consumer's state,\n   <em>\n    as if\n   </em>\n   the contract at issue had been entered into in that state and wholly performed in that state. This language is not suggesting that the RIC\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   such a contract or that it does not involve interstate commerce; rather, it expresses the intent of the parties to apply the law of the purchaser's state to the RIC, despite the fact that it may have been entered into by residents of different states (i.e., the consumer and\n   REIE). As Brinkley concedes, the RIC at issue was entered into between Brinkley, a Washington resident, and REIE, a Utah entity, and set the terms of Brinkley's purchase of services from REIE. The RIC thus clearly evidences an interstate transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Given the nature of the RIC and its choice-of-law provision, the very existence of which suggests that the transaction at issue in the contract might be undertaken by individuals and/or entities residing in different jurisdictions and thereby involve interstate commerce, we conclude that the RIC \"evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce.\" Therefore, contrary to Brinkley's contention, the FAA and its rules apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   ii.\n   <em>\n    To the extent the application of state law is necessary, Washington state law applies\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Brinkley asserts on appeal that the law of Brinkley's state of residence, Washington, governs interpretation of the contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The FAA creates \"a body of federal substantive law of arbitrability, applicable to any arbitration agreement within the coverage of the Act.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Moses H.

Important for our purposes is the\n   <em>\n    Wagner\n   </em>\n   court's description of the factual basis for the plaintiff's claims in that case as related to the language of the arbitration agreement:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \"Mr. Wagner's allegations specifically relate to the legality of Discover's acts when it went about its collection activities. He alleges unlawful conduct by Discover when it made numerous calls to his cell phone and used a prerecorded voice system. These allegations relate to the\n   <em>\n    manner\n   </em>\n   in which Discover attempted collection. Although the existence of a debt on the account and the right to collect the debt would 'arise from' or 'relate to' the Account, the legality of the manner in which collection is pursued does not. The manner of collection-whether calls were made, how frequently they were made, and what was said during them-has nothing to do with either the Account, the terms of the Cardmember Agreement, or the parties' relationship. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Coors Brewing Co. v.

Indeed, Mr. Wagner may succeed on his TCPA claims despite the existence of any account or relationship with Discover. Although the existence of the Account may have been the 'but for' cause of the alleged violations, that is not enough to establish that the claims arise from or relate to the Account or the parties' relationship resulting from the Account.\" (\n   <em>\n    Wagner, supra,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%20128372\">\n    2014 WL 128372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *5,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%203682\">\n    2014 U.S. Dist.

As we have explained, a dispute regarding the legality of any conduct Monterey undertook in its collection efforts is a \"dispute\" that is \"related to\" the terms of the RIC.\n   <em>\n    Wagner\n   </em>\n   is therefore distinguishable and is thus unpersuasive in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   We conclude that the telephone calls that Brinkley alleges Monterey unlawfully recorded were related to the RIC. As a result, Brinkley's claims concerning the legality of the calls fall within the scope of the broad arbitration provision included in the RIC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    The arbitration provision is enforceable\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Brinkley raises two claims challenging the enforceability of the arbitration provision in the RIC, arguing that the clause should not be enforced because it violates public policy, and that the clause is unconscionable, both procedurally and substantively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Public policy does not render the arbitration agreement unenforceable.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Brinkley contends that the trial court erred in enforcing the arbitration agreement because it \"is against public policy.\" Specifically, Brinkley argues that \"[c]ontract provisions, like this one, which purport to mandate arbitration of individual claims involving illegal conduct and/or criminal activities should be void as a matter of public policy because they do little to discourage such practices.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Brinkley acknowledges that her argument in this regard must be premised on the FAA being inapplicable to the RIC, given that the FAA preempts state law\n   attempts to invalidate arbitration agreements on the basis of public policy. As we have already concluded, however, the FAA does apply to the contract at issue here. Brinkley's argument that public policy\n   requires courts not to enforce an arbitration agreement with respect to claims alleging illegal or criminal conduct must therefore be rejected.

Further, courts \"interpret the statutory terms 'custodian' and 'other qualified witness' broadly.\" (\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   ) In addition, Washington statutory law \"does not require examination of the person who actually made the record.

Pruitt's declaration in this regard was sufficient to demonstrate to the trial court that the RIC was a true and\n   correct copy of the agreement entered into by Brinkley and REIE. The trial court therefore did not err by admitting Pruitt's declaration or the attached RIC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Because Pruitt's declaration attaches the relevant RIC entered into between Brinkley and REIE, and also provides information regarding the process by which consumers would access the RIC and complete the e-signature process, Hughes's declaration, which was intended merely to provide the foundation for the admission of evidence of the RIC between Brinkley and REIE, was rendered redundant and thus, unnecessary. The trial court's decision not to sustain Brinkley's objections to it, however, does not amount to an abuse of discretion, given that the trial court could have been satisfied that Hughes also was aware of the manner in which Monterey's records were kept.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   We are similarly unconvinced by Brinkley's contention that the trial court should have held an evidentiary hearing in order to resolve evidentiary conflicts that exist based on the parties' submitted declarations. Brinkley contends that there is a \"sharp[ ]\" dispute about \"whether the RIC contract upon which the motion is based is the correct one.\" She bases this on a statement in her declaration in which she indicates that, because she received a copy of the signed agreement from Monterey, and not from REIE, she \"ha[s] no idea if such document is, in fact, the actual document that I electronically signed online on August 24, 2011.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Despite this statement in Brinkley's declaration, the trial court could have reasonably concluded that it should accord greater weight to Pruitt's declaration, to which the RIC, including Brinkley's electronic signature, was attached, given Pruitt's testimony regarding her role in keeping Monterey's business records pertaining to REIE's installment contracts with customers. The court therefore had no need to\n   hold an evidentiary hearing to take live witness testimony, and it did not abuse its discretion in declining to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Application of procedural unconscionability standards\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Brinkley asserts that the arbitration clause is procedurally unconscionable because \"it did not offer [Brinkley] a meaningful choice\" given the manner in which the contract was entered, and it failed to provide her with a \" 'reasonable opportunity to understand the terms,' \" in part on the ground that the contract did not include or attach the AAA rules that it was incorporating.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Brinkley did not lack a meaningful choice\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Brinkley contends that she was not given \"a meaningful choice\" because \"she (1) was not given any opportunity to make changes to the pre-printed\n   online agreement, (2) was not allowed adequate time to review all of the terms or to have an attorney review it, (3) did not have any power to negotiate the terms, (4) was informed she had to sign the agreement in order to get financing as it was presented on a take-it-or-leave-it basis, (5) never received a copy of the signed agreement from REIE, and (6) never received a copy of the assignment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Brinkley's first, third, and fourth contentions refer to the adhesive nature of the RIC. It is true that Brinkley had no opportunity to make changes to the terms of the agreement or negotiate price or other terms, and that her ability to obtain financing from REIE was nonnegotiable and dependent on her entering into the RIC as offered. However, in our view, the fact that the RIC is a contract of adhesion does not, by itself, render it procedurally unconscionable such that the arbitration provision included in the RIC may not be enforced. (See\n   <em>\n    Zuver, supra,\n   </em>\n   153 Wash.2d at p. 304,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=103%20P.3d%20753\">\n    103 P.3d 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) In\n   <em>\n    Zuver,\n   </em>\n   the Washington Supreme Court held that in the context of an employment agreement, the existence of unequal bargaining power between the parties is insufficient to demonstrate that an arbitration provision was procedurally unconscionable, despite the employee's contention that the \"unequal bargaining power precluded her from ' \"enjoying a meaningful opportunity to negotiate and choose the terms of the contract.\" ' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 305,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=103%20P.3d%20753\">\n    103 P.3d 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, an employee \"must show some evidence that the [party with the greater bargaining power] refused to respond to her questions or concerns, placed undue pressure on her to sign the agreement without providing her with a reasonable opportunity to consider its terms, and/or that the terms of the agreement were set forth in such a way that an average person could not understand them.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 306-307,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=103%20P.3d%20753\">\n    103 P.3d 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)

However, Brinkley first submitted a credit application to REIE in order to obtain financing to purchase the real estate classes \"on or about August 10, 2011.\" According to ordinary course of business for REIE and Monterey with respect to these contracts, Brinkley \"would have been notified that her credit application was approved and that she could proceed with the e-signature process\" on the same day that she applied. Upon being notified of an approval for credit, an applicant like Brinkley was provided \"30 days to complete the e-signature process,\" and during this time period, an applicant would be given \"unfettered access to the document on-line.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   During the 30-day period after Brinkley received notification that her credit application had been approved, \"[o]n August 23, 2011, Monterey sent Ms. Brinkley a follow up email with instructions for completing the application process\".\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Brinkley signed the document on August 24, 2011, approximately 14 days after first having access to the RIC. We are unconvinced that a 14-day period to review a five-page document is \"inadequate,\" notwithstanding Brinkley's conclusory statement in her declaration that she was \"not allowed adequate time to review all of the terms of REIE's pre-printed online agreement.\" In any event, Brinkley's statement regarding the adequacy of the time that she was provided appears to be nothing more than a legal conclusion about the sufficiency of time provided to her to review and understand the RIC, and as such it is of little evidentiary value.

The very first line of the document states: \"To print this document-right-click on your mouse and select print from the popup menu.\" Brinkley was provided the opportunity to print and retain (and review repeatedly) a copy of the RIC, with her e-signature, during this process. Given these circumstances, and the fact that Brinkley has not suggested that she was unable to print the document or did not have access to a printer, the fact that Brinkley was given the opportunity to print the document in this manner is\n   sufficient to overcome Brinkley's contention that the RIC should be considered procedurally unconscionable because she did not receive a signed copy of it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Brinkley's contention that she was not provided with a copy of the assignment of the RIC between REIE and Monterey is of no significance for purposes of our procedural unconscionability analysis. The RIC specifically informs consumers that the \"Seller may assign this Agreement to any third party without prior notice to you,\" and that \"[u]pon any such assignment, such third party will become the holder of this agreement and your creditor.\" Beyond this, the RIC even informs consumers that \"Seller intends to assign this agreement to Monterey Financial Services, [I]nc., 4095 Avenida de la Plata, Oceanside, CA 92056 ('Monterey'),\" and that \"[a]fter the assignment of this Agreement to Monterey, all questions concerning the terms of this Agreement or payments should be directed to Monterey at its address indicated above.\" The portion of the RIC that included signature lines related to an assignment of the contract was specifically marked \"TERMS CONTAINED IN THIS BOX ARE NOT PART OF THE BUYER'S AGREEMENT.\" In these circumstances, the fact that Brinkley was not provided a copy of the assignment between REIE and Monterey did not affect Brinkley's ability to have a meaningful choice with respect to entering into the RIC, nor did it in any way prejudice her ability to understand the terms of the agreement or have a meaningful opportunity to understand her rights and obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    The failure to attach the AAA rules does not render the arbitration agreement unconscionable\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Brinkley contends that the arbitration agreement is procedurally unconscionable because she was not given an opportunity to fully understand the terms of the agreement, given that the RIC provided for arbitration to be completed in accordance with the American Arbitration Association (AAA) rules, but failed to include or attach those rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   It appears that Monterey concedes that neither a copy of the AAA rules nor a link to a relevant version of the rules was attached to or included in the RIC. However, we do not consider this to be a ground for concluding that the entire arbitration agreement is procedurally unconscionable. Although it\n   appears that Washington courts have yet to consider this issue, as other courts have noted, the arbitration rules referenced in the RIC were relatively easily accessible to Brinkley, given that they are available on the Internet, and she was already online completing the e-signature process.

However, she asserts that although she \"did not list the travel and lodging costs she would have necessarily incurred for an arbitration in San Diego, that level of proof was unnecessary when she already established she could not even afford the filing fees and arbitrator's fees.\" She contends that it is essentially irrelevant that she chose to file a class action lawsuit in San Diego because \"the economics of a class action in California, where costs are shared with other class members, quite differs from the pursuit of an individual\n   claim for $10,000 in statutory damages [citation] in a distant forum.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Monterey asserts in response that, contrary to Brinkley's assertions, the AAA's \"Consumer-Related Disputes Supplementary Procedures\" (Consumer Supplementary Procedures) would limit Brinkley's costs to a $200 filing fee, and that all other costs would be borne by Monterey, including the arbitrator's fee and the arbitrator's travel or other expenses. Brinkley contends in reply that \"the supplemental procedures d[o] not apply, because they only deal [ ] with 'consumable goods or services,' involving products and services for 'personal or household use.' \" Brinkley does not provide any further explanation as to why she believes the Consumer Supplementary Procedures\n   do not apply to her dispute with Monterey, and we have difficulty seeing how those AAA rules would not apply in this situation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The Consumer Supplementary Procedures included in the record before us set forth when these rules apply to a particular dispute:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   \"The Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and these Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes shall apply whenever the American Arbitration Association (AAA) or its rules are used in an agreement between a consumer and a business where the business has a standardized, systematic application of arbitration clauses with customers and where the terms and conditions of the purchase of standardized, consumable goods or services are non-negotiable or primarily non-negotiable in most or all of its terms, conditions, features, or choices. The product or service must be for personal or household use.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The AAA rules are used in the RIC that was entered into between Brinkley, a consumer, and REIE, a business (which then assigned its rights and obligations under the contract to Monterey, another business). REIE had a standardized, systematic application of arbitration clauses with its consumers, evidenced by Brinkley's declaration in which she states that she was not able to change the terms of the RIC, and that it was provided to her on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. In addition, the terms and conditions of Brinkley's purchase of the real estate classes and the financing terms were nonnegotiable, as she further states in her declaration, given that there was no opportunity to negotiate price or the terms of the services. The real estate classes were for Brinkley's personal use. Thus, it appears that the Consumer Supplementary Procedures would apply to this dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Further, Monterey has argued in the trial court and on appeal that the Consumer Supplementary Procedures apply to any arbitration of the underlying dispute. Monterey has thus made a judicial admission that the Consumer Supplementary Procedures, including the fee provisions set forth in those procedures, apply to any arbitration of its dispute with Brinkley; Monterey may therefore be estopped from arguing otherwise at a later point in time.

The RIC's arbitration agreement provides in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   \"The decision by the arbitrator or arbitrators shall be final and binding on all parties, and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction for enforcement. Such a decision\n   <em>\n    shall include the payment of all fees and costs of the prevailing party\n   </em>\n   . The determination of the 'prevailing party' shall be made by the arbitrator or arbitrators.\" (Italics added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   This provision essentially undermines the fee provisions in the Consumer Supplementary Procedures discussed above, since the arbitration agreement\n   <em>\n    requires\n   </em>\n   an arbitrator to award a prevailing party \"all [of that party's] fees and costs.\" This provision thus thwarts a consumer claimant's right under the Consumer Supplementary Procedures to have the\n   <em>\n    business\n   </em>\n   bear all of the costs of arbitration with the exception of a limited filing fee, in that under the RIC, if a consumer fails to prevail, he or she will be liable for\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of those fees (which includes any additional filing or administrative fees, plus the arbitrator's fees and costs).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Potentially even more costly to Brinkley, and more troubling for purposes of our unconscionability analysis, is that this provision appears to shift to the nonprevailing party the prevailing party's attorney fees, in addition to the costs associated with the arbitration. Although Monterey suggests that Brinkley merely \"speculates that the language of the RIC Contract could allow the arbitrator to award Monterey attorneys' fees if it prevails,\" our reading of the provision is the same as Brinkley's. The arbitration agreement requires the nonprevailing party to pay \"\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   fees and costs of the prevailing party.\" (Italics added.) The most reasonable understanding of that phrase is that the nonprevailing party will be required to pay any and all of the fees and costs incurred by the prevailing party in arbitrating the matter before the arbitrator, which would include the attorney fees incurred by that party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   The Washington Supreme Court has concluded that a similar fee and cost shifting provision was substantively unconscionable.

(See Rev.Code Wash., \u00a7 9.73.060 [\"A person so injured shall be entitled to ... a reasonable attorney's fee and other costs of litigation.\"].) By undermining an injured plaintiff's right to attorney fees without the plaintiff having to bear a concomitant risk of paying attorney fees, the fee and cost shifting provision in the arbitration agreement benefits \" 'the party with a substantially stronger bargaining position and more resources.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Adler, supra,\n   </em>\n   153 Wash.2d at p. 355,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=103%20P.3d%20773\">\n    103 P.3d 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) We therefore conclude that the arbitration agreement's fee and cost shifting provision is substantively unconscionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Severability of unconscionable provision\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Given our conclusion that the fee and cost shifting provision is substantively unconscionable, we are next tasked with deciding how to address the unconscionability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Monterey argues that if this court concludes that any of the terms of the arbitration provision are deemed unconscionable, the appropriate remedy is to sever that term. Brinkley argues that severance of any particular term would be inappropriate because, she contends, severance would require the court to rewrite the parties' agreement, the unconscionability pervades the entire arbitration agreement, and the \"illegal clauses operate in concert to eliminate any realistic possibility of relief for consumers.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Under Washington law, \"[s]everance is the usual remedy for substantively unconscionable terms, but where such terms 'pervade' an arbitration agreement, [Washington courts] 'refuse to sever those provisions and declare the entire agreement void.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Gandee, supra,\n   </em>\n   176 Wash.2d at p. 603,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=293%20P.3d%201197\">\n    293 P.3d 1197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) The\n   <em>\n    Gandee\n   </em>\n   court had to consider whether three unconscionable provisions in an arbitration clause were severable, or, rather, whether the entire arbitration provision was invalid as a result of the unconscionability. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 607,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=293%20P.3d%201197\">\n    293 P.3d 1197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) In applying the relevant rules, the\n   <em>\n    Gandee\n   </em>\n   court explained that the arbitration clause was relatively short, in that it was a \"four-sentence arbitration\n   clause,\" (\n   <em>\n    ibid.\n   </em>\n   ) and that it contained \"three unconscionable provisions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   ) The court concluded:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   \"Severing all three provisions would significantly alter both the tone of the arbitration clause and the nature of the arbitration contemplated by the clause. The location, fee structure, and timing of the arbitration would be changed. Little would be left of the arbitration 'agreed' to by the parties. On these facts, the unconscionable terms pervade the entire clause and severing three out of four provisions would require essentially a rewriting of the arbitration agreement. Thus, the arbitration clause cannot be severed from the overall contract.\" (\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Here, in contrast, we have found one unconscionable provision: the fee and cost shifting provision. That provision essentially consists of a single sentence: \"Such a decision shall include the payment of all fees and costs of the prevailing party.\" Contrary to Brinkley's contention, unconscionability does not permeate the arbitration agreement, but, rather, is found only in this single sentence. The offending sentence can readily be removed from the arbitration agreement without further upsetting the terms of that agreement and without requiring us to rewrite the parties' agreement. We conclude that severing the fee and cost shifting provision is the most reasonable course of action in these circumstances. We therefore sever this language from the RIC. The contract may not be enforced to the extent that it requires an arbitrator to award \"all fees and costs of the prevailing party\" to that party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    The putative class claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Brinkley contends that even if the trial court was correct in granting Monterey's motion to compel arbitration, the court nevertheless erred in dismissing the putative class claims, rather than ordering the entire matter to arbitration and allowing the arbitrator to decide whether the parties' arbitration agreement permits class claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   The arbitration agreement does not expressly state whether class or representative claims may be arbitrated. Although the parties disagree as to the meaning of this silence, and as to whether Brinkley may pursue class arbitration under this arbitration agreement, there is a threshold question regarding whether the determination as to the availability of class arbitration is to be decided by the court or the arbitrator. The parties disagree as to the answer to the question of who decides whether the arbitration agreement allows for class arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Brinkley asserts that the parties' decision to rely on the AAA rules for arbitration, which includes a provision that the arbitrator is to decide whether the arbitration agreement permits class and/or representative arbitration, constitutes clear and unmistakable evidence that the parties intended to delegate this question to the arbitrator. Monterey contends that the question whether class arbitration is available under this arbitration agreement is to be decided as a gateway matter by the court, relying on\n   <em>\n    Garden Fresh Restaurant Corp. v.

Monterey asserts that\n   <em>\n    Garden Fresh\n   </em>\n   \"specifically addressed the narrow issue of whether the trial court or the arbitrator should decide the arbitrability of class claims, and held that classwide arbitrability\n   is a question to be determined by the trial court in the first instance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Arbitrators derive their powers from the parties' voluntary submission of disputes for resolution in a nonjudicial forum. The primary purpose of the FAA is to ensure that agreements to arbitrate are enforced according to their terms, and arbitration agreements are construed to give effect to the parties' contractual rights and expectations.

In this case, Brinkley asserts that the arbitration provision is\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    silent on the question of who decides this significant issue, and that by incorporating by reference the rules of the AAA, the arbitration agreement in fact delegates the determination of this issue to the arbitrator.

However, if the contract clearly and unmistakably delegates the question whether the contract allowed for class arbitration to an arbitrator to decide, then even if \"only one possible outcome exists\" for answering that question, the parties have contracted to have\n    <em>\n     the arbitrator,\n    </em>\n    not\n    <em>\n     a court,\n    </em>\n    ultimately state that \"one possible outcome.\" By taking that determination away from the arbitrator, the appellate court failed to give effect to the parties' expressed contractual intentions. Thus, it seems apparent that where the parties dispute whether an issue is for a court or an arbitrator to decide, a court should, as a matter of regular course, first determine whether it is appropriate for the court to make a determination as to a particular issue raised by an arbitration clause, or whether the parties have delegated the determination of that issue to the arbitrator.

The RIC's reference to \"any claim or dispute\" that \"aris[es] out of\" the RIC would necessarily include a dispute as to whether class arbitration is permitted under the RIC.
