We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-13\">\u00b62 This appeal raises the following issue:</p>\n<p id=\"b309-14\">\u00b63 Whether the doctrine of res judicata barred the District Court from vacating that portion of its judgment which granted future tax exemptions for the Crow Tribe Members?</p>\n<p id=\"b309-15\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b309-16\">\u00b64 On January 31, 1989, Dorothy Jefferson, an enrolled member of the Crow Tribe, filed an action on behalf of herself and all persons similarly situated against Big Horn County and the State of Montana (hereinafter referred to collectively as \u201cBig Horn County\u2019) for declar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>atory and injunctive relief and a refund of property taxes paid, in the Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Big Horn County. In her complaint, Jefferson challenged Big Horn County\u2019s authority to impose and collect real property taxes on land owned in fee simple by enrolled members of the Crow Tribe and located within the boundaries of the Crow Reservation. Jefferson requested that the court declare Big Horn County without jurisdiction to tax property owned by the Plaintiff class, enjoin Big Horn County from taxing that property, and direct Big Horn County to refund all taxes collected on that property. Pursuant to \u00a7 15-1-407, MCA, the court certified Jefferson\u2019s cause of action as a class action. The class consisted of \u201call enrolled members of the Crow Tribe who own land located within the exterior boundaries of the Crow Indian Reservation which was never allotted under the General Allotment Act and upon which Big Horn County levies real property taxes.\u201d (hereinafter \u201cCrow Tribe Members.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">\u00b65 On July 10, 1989, the Crow Tribe Members filed a motion for partial summary judgment. In their brief supporting their motion, the Crow Tribe Members requested that the court \u201cpermanently enjoin [Big Horn County] from assessing and collecting taxes.\u201d However, pursuant to a joint motion, the action was stayed pending the decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakima Nation </em>v. <em>County of Yakima </em>(9th Cir. 1990), 903 F.2d 1207. In <em>Yakima Nation, </em>the issue was whether real property allotted under the Indian General Allotment Act of 1887 (\u201cGAA\u201d), 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 349, and owned in fee-patent by enrolled Tribe members was subject to state ad valorem taxation pursuant to \u00a7 6 of the GAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">\u00b66 In the later half of the 19th century, the federal government changed its policy of setting aside reservation lands for the exclusive use and control of Native American tribes and moved toward a policy of allotment. Under the allotment policy, Congress removed significant portions of reservation land from tribal ownership and federal protection, allotting some parcels to individual tribal members in fee simple. One of the objectives of allotment was to assimilate Native Americans into society at large. Most of the allotments were made pursuant to the GAA. Section 5 of the GAA provided that parcels of tribal land would be allocated to individual Native Americans and held in trust by the United States for a 25-year period, after which the federal government would convey title to individual allottees. Section 6 of the GAA, as amended by the Burke Act, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 349, provides that once title to lands have been conveyed \u201call restrictions as to sale, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>incumbrance, or taxation of said land shall be removed.\u201d In 1934 Congress enacted the Indian Reorganization Act, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 461 et seq., reflecting a dramatic shift in policy toward Native Americans. The Reorganization Act ended the practice of making allotments to individual tribe members. <em>See generally Cass County, Minn. v. Leech Lake Band of Chippewa Indians </em>(1998), 524 U.S. 103,106-08, 118 S. Ct. 1904, 1906-07, 141 L. Ed. 2d 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">\u00b67 The Ninth Circuit in <em>Yakima </em>concluded that the GAA manifested Congress\u2019s unmistakably clear intent to permit states to tax land allotted under the GAA. Subsequently, on April 3, 1990, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the Crow Tribal Members, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-5\">All authority cited to this Court that governs taxation of the property in question is based on the General Allotment Act. Plaintiff\u2019s land is not and never has been subject to the General Allotment Act. Therefore, defendants cannot tax plaintiff\u2019s land because the General Allotment Act, which contains the Congressional permission for taxation that defendants rely on, does not apply to plaintiffs land.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">\u00b68 On August 21,1990, Big Horn County and the Crow Tribe Members filed a Joint Motion for Entry of Judgment requesting the court to enter their proposed judgment. On August 28,1990, the District Court issued an order implementing its Judgment. The District Court required Big Horn County to refund taxes paid under protest and remove the Crow Tribe Members from the tax rolls. The court stated that \u201c[t]his declaratory ruling establishes a future tax exempt status for land that is located within the Crow Reservation, has never been subject to the General Allotment Act and is owned by an enrolled Crow Tribe member.\u201d The District Court also stated that its order granting summary judgment in favor of the Crow Tribe Members \u201cestablished as a matter of law that Defendants may not collect property tax on a Crow Tribe member\u2019s land within the Crow Reservation that is not and never has been subject to the General Allotment Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">\u00b69 On June 20,1997, Big Horn County filed a Motion for Partial Vacation of Judgment and Supporting Memorandum requesting the District Court vacate that portion of its order establishing a future tax exempt status for the Crow Tribe Members pursuant to Rule 60(b), M.R.Civ.P. Big Horn County claimed that subsequent federal decisions had established that alienable land owned by enrolled members of tribes was subject to state ad valorem taxes even if it had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>not been patented in fee pursuant to the GAA. The court did not rule on the motion within 60 days and it was deemed denied under Rule 60(c), M.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">\u00b610 On December 12,1997, Big Horn County filed a Motion to Dissolve Injunction pursuant to \u00a7 27-19-401, MCA, asserting that due to a change in the applicable law, there were insufficient grounds to continue the initial order. On October 2,1998, Big Horn County supplemented its motion to dissolve the injunction with a copy of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Leech Lake. </em>In <em>Leech Lake, </em>the Supreme Court rejected the distinction drawn in <em>post-Yakima </em>federal appellate decisions which had held that lands not allotted pursuant to the GAA were not subject to state ad valorem taxes. The Court held that when Congress makes reservation lands freely alienable, it is \u201cunmistakably clear\u201d that Congress intends that land to be taxable by state and local governments unless a contrary intent is \u201cclearly <em>manifested.\u201dLeech Lake, </em>524 U.S. at 113, 118 S. Ct. at 1910.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">\u00b611 On December 18,1998, the District Court granted Big Horn\u2019s motion and dissolved that portion of its Judgment dated August 28, 1990, which had granted a future tax exempt status to the Crow Tribe Members. The Crow Tribe Members appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">\u00b612 Whether a district court has the authority to modify or vacate part of its previous judgment is a question of law. We review a district court\u2019s conclusion of law to determine whether it is correct. <em>See Carbon County v. Union Reserve Coal Co. </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 459, 469, 898 P.2d 680, 686.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">\u00b613 Whether the doctrine of res judicata barred the District Court from vacating that portion of its judgment which granted future tax exemptions for the Crow Tribe Members?</p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">\u00b614 As part of its Judgment dated August 28, 1990, the District Court stated that \u201c[t]his declaratory ruling establishes a future tax exempt status for land that is located within the Crow Reservation, has never been subject to the General Allotment Act and is owned by an enrolled Crow Tribe member.\u201d The District Court also ordered Big Horn County to refund property taxes paid under protest by Crow Tribe Members. On December 18, 1998, the court dissolved that portion of its judgment which had established a future tax exempt status for Plaintiffs\u2019 lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>\u00b615 The Crow Tribe Members assert that the District Court was barred by the doctrine of res judicata from dissolving a portion of its judgment. The State contends that the portion of the judgment which had established a future tax exempt status for the Plaintiffs was a form of injunctive relief that the District Court could modify or dissolve under <em>Santa Rita Oil &amp; Gas Co. v. State Board of Equalization </em>(1941), 112 Mont. 359, 116 P.2d 1012 (hereinafter <em>\u201cSanta Rita IF). </em>The Crow Tribe Members respond that if the portion of the judgment granting them a future tax exempt status can be characterized as in-junctive relief, the District Court could not modify it under <em>Santa Rita II </em>absent a change in the controlling facts on which the injunction rested.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">\u00b616 The judgment issued by the District Court on August 28,1990, was specifically granted pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 15-1-406,407, and 408, MCA, provisions which outline the declaratory judgment and alternative remedy procedures and forms of relief for aggrieved taxpayers. Section 15-1-406, MCA (1987), provided, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-5\">Alternative Remedy-Declaratory Judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-6\">(1) An aggrieved taxpayer may... bring a declaratory judgment action in the district court seeking a declaration that a tax levied by the state or one of its subdivisions was illegally or unlawfully imposed or exceeded the taxing authority of the entity imposing the tax.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Section 15-1-408 (1987), MCA, provided, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-8\">If the district court determines that the tax was illegally or unlawfully imposed ... the judgment may direct:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-9\">(1) that the revenue collected under the illegal tax be directly refunded ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-10\">(3) such other remedy as the court considers appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">\u00b617 Pursuant to \u00a7 15-1-406, MCA (1987), the District Court had the authority to declare that the tax Plaintiffs challenged \u201cwas illegally or unlawfully imposed.\u201d Once it reached this' determination, the District Court was authorized to grant at least two remedies: a refund of the revenue collected and \u201csuch other remedy as the court considered] appropriate.\u201d \u00a7 15-1-408, MCA (1987). This is precisely what the District Court did. It determined that the property tax previously imposed by the State and challenged by the Plaintiffs was unlawful. This conclusion authorized the court to award a refund of the revenue collected and to fashion any other remedy it considered appropriate. In this re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>gard, the District Court \u201cestablished] a future tax exempt status\u201d for Plaintiffs\u2019 land.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">\u00b618  \u201cAny order which requires a person to refrain from a particular act for any period of time, no matter what its purpose is an \u2018injunction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sheridan County Elec. Co-op.,Inc., v.Ferguson </em>(1951), 124 Mont. 543, 554, 227 P.2d 597, 603. What distinguishes an injunction from other forms of relief is that it is an equitable remedy granting prospective, as opposed to retrospective, relief. <em>See generally </em>42 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Injunctions </em>\u00a7 1 (1969) (observing that an injunction is a form of relief which commands or prohibits the doing of certain acts in the future); <em>see also State ex rel. Tillman v. District Court </em>(1936), 101 Mont. 176, 186, 53 P.2d 107, 112 (noting that an injunction \u201cwill not lie to prevent an act already committed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">\u00b619 As authorized by \u00a7 15-1-408, MCA (1987), the District Court\u2019s judgment contained both retrospective and prospective relief. The District Court granted retrospective relief by directing the State to refund property taxes paid in 1988 and 1989 by Dorothy Jefferson, the named Plaintiff, and for property taxes paid under protest in 1989 by similarly situated taxpayers. Pursuant to its authority under \u00a7 15-1-408(3), MCA (1987), the court fashioned prospective rehef by establishing a future tax exempt status for the property of Crow Tribe Members subject to the judgment and ordering the Big Horn County Assessor to remove this property from its tax rolls. Although not expressly referred to as injunctive relief, this portion of the District Court\u2019s judgment is clearly in the form of perpetual injunctive relief. It commands the State to refrain from imposing and collecting taxes in the future on the real property of Crow Tribe Members located within the Crow Reservation and not subject to the GAA. We note that the Crow Tribe Members were aware of the nature of this relief when they specifically requested in their Brief in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment filed July 10, 1989, that the court enter an order <em>\u201cpermanently enjoining </em>[Big Horn County] from assessing or collecting taxes on such property.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">\u00b620 The Dissent asserts that injunctive relief was \u201cspecifically precluded by\u201d and \u201ccontrary to the specific prohibition of injunctive relief found at \u00a7 15-1-404, MCA.\u201d Dissent, \u00b6\u00b6 36 and 37. However, \u00a7 15-1-404, MCA (1987), did not preclude injunctions. Rather, this provision stated that \u201c[t]he remedies hereby provided shall supersede the remedy of injunction and all other remedies <em>which might be invoked to prevent the collection of taxes or licenses alleged to be irregu</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number><em>larly levied or demanded.\u201d </em>Section 15-1-404, MCA (1987). More significantly, the very next statutory provision, \u00a7 15-1-405, MCA (1987), provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-4\">\u201cNo injunction must be granted... to restrain the collection of a tax ... <em>except:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-5\">(1) where the tax ... sought to be enjoined is illegal or is not authorized by law ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">(2) where the property is exempt from taxation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">\u00b621 Clearly, \u00a7 15-1-404, MCA.(1987), did not preclude the granting of all injunctions in tax protest cases because the next provision permitted injunctions restraining the collection of a tax where the tax sought to be enjoined was illegal or where the property was exempt from taxation. The prohibition on injunctive relief contained in \u00a7 15-1-404, MCA (1987), was limited to injunctions \u201cto prevent the collection of taxes or licenses alleged to be irregularly levied or demanded.\u201d Even within this class of cases involving taxes irregularly levied or demanded, a court could still grant an injunction \u201cin unusual cases\u201d where the remedies provided under Title 15, Chapter 1, Part 4, were \u201cdeemed by the court to be inadequate.\u201d Section 15-1-404, MCA (1987). Plaintiffs did not allege that the property tax challenged was \u201cirregularly levied or demanded.\u201d Rather, they alleged that the tax was unlawfully imposed and that their property was exempt from taxation. Section 15-1-405, MCA (1987), expressly empowered the court to grant an injunction restraining the collection of this tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">\u00b622 The Dissent also argues that \u201c[t]he declaratory relief was sufficient to exempt the taxpayer\u2019s property from taxation on a stand-alone basis. It was not necessary to additionally enjoin Big Horn County or the State of Montana from prospective conduct.\u201d Dissent, \u00b6 37. The correctness of this argument hinges on the scope of a declaratory judgment under \u00a7 15-1-406, MCA (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">\u00b623 Section 15-1-406(1), MCA (1987), provided that an aggrieved taxpayer may seek a declaration that \u201ca tax <em>levied </em>by the state ... <em>was </em>illegally or unlawfully <em>imposed.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Significantly, the statute used the past tense. Furthermore, subsection (2) of this statute required that a declaratory judgment action \u201cbe brought within 90 days of the imposition of the tax;\u201d and subsection (3) required that \u201c[t]he taxes that are being challenged under this section must be paid when due as a condition of continuing the action.\u201d We think the import of these provisions is clear. A taxpayer who brought a declaratory judgment action pursuant to these provisions was required to bring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>the action within 90 days after the tax was imposed and pay the tax. If the aggrieved taxpayer complied with these requirements, a district court was empowered to declare that the specific tax imposition which was timely challenged and paid <em>was unlawfully imposed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">\u00b624 This declaratory judgment provision did not permit a district court to declare that taxes not yet imposed would be unlawful if and when the state imposes those taxes. A declaratory judgment under \u00a7 15-1-406, MCA (1987), simply could not speak to the legality of future tax impositions. Instead, it only established that the specific tax imposition challenged was unlawful. As we noted in a previous case involving state ad valorem property taxation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-5\">[E]ach tax year is singular and self-contained. Each year the taxpayer inventories and reports his assets, the Department assesses the property and sends that taxpayer notice of the property value.... A <em>separate tax is imposed for each year.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-6\"><em>Eagle Communications v. Flathead County </em>(1984), 211 Mont. 195, 203, 685 P.2d 912, 916 (emphasis added). Consequently, the scope of the declaratory judgment was limited to the lawfulness of the singular tax imposition properly challenged. In order to prevent future similar impositions, the District Court had to order relief beyond a declaratory judgment. As noted above, \u00a7 15-1-408(3), MCA (1987), enabled the court to grant \u201csuch other remedy\u2019 it considered appropriate. In this case, the District Court granted prospective relief-preventing the State from collecting property taxes in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">\u00b625  In summary, \u00a7 15-1-404, MCA (1987), did not preclude the District Court from ordering injunctive relief, nor could the court\u2019s declaratory judgment exempt the Plaintiffs\u2019 property from future taxation without a further order of injunctive relief. Because that portion of the District Court\u2019s Judgment which ordered a \u201cfuture tax exempt status\u201d was an order granting prospective relief by restraining the Defendants from imposing an ad valorem property tax on Plaintiffs\u2019 property in the future, it was injunctive relief. Accordingly, the only remaining issue is whether the court was authorized to modify or dissolve its injunction. In this regard, the Crow Tribe Members assert that if that portion of the District Court\u2019s Judgment can be characterized as injunctive relief, the District Court was without authority to modify it absent a change in the controlling facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">\u00b626  A court may modify or dissolve perpetual injunctive relief based on a subsequent change in the judicial interpretation of a law. In <em>Santa Rita II, </em>we stated that \u201c[t]he latter point hardly requires citation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>to authority, for obviously it is not equitable to continue to restrain a party from actions no longer unlawful [when] the change in law has come about... through an authoritative change in judicial construction by courts.\u201d 112 Mont, at 368, 116 P.2d at 1016-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">\u00b627 In <em>Santa Rita Oil &amp; Gas Co. v. State Board of Equalization </em>(1936), 101 Mont. 268,54 P.2d 117 (hereinafter <em>\u201cSanta Rita </em>/\u201d), we enjoined the State from levying taxes arising out of the production and recovery of oil from land leased to the plaintiff by a Native American who was the owner of an allotment of land under a trust patent because it amounted to a tax on the property or an instrumentality of the federal government. Subsequently, in <em>Santa Rita II, </em>the State Board of Equalization petitioned this court to vacate the injunction on the ground that the judicial interpretation of the law upon which the injunction was based had changed. The respondent asserted that the original decision was res ju-dicata and therefore could not be modified or vacated. We held that the doctrine of res judicata did not bar a court from modifying or vacating an injunction, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-5\">An injunction is merely the process by which the court enforces equity and it has not only the power but the duty to modify or annul its injunction as equity demands. A final or permanent injunction is a continuing process over which the equity court necessarily retains jurisdiction in order to do equity. And if the court of equity later finds that the law has changed or that equity no longer justifies the continuance of the injunction, it may and should free the defendant\u2019s hands from the fetters by which until then its activities have been prevented, thus leaving it free to perform its lawful duties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-6\"><em>Santa Rita II, </em>112 Mont, at 370, 116 P.2d at 1017. Observing that the United States Supreme Court had overruled its previous decisions regarding state taxation of federal instrumentalities upon which we had based a portion of our injunction, we granted the State\u2019s motion and vacated that part of our injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">\u00b628  In <em>Santa Rita II, </em>we recognized the principle that a court has the inherent power to modify or vacate an injunction when the law upon which that injunction was based has been changed by subsequent judicial interpretation. As in <em>Santa Rita I, </em>the District Court judgment granted the Crow Tribe Members injunctive relief in the form of future tax exemptions for their real property which prevented the State from levying, assessing, and collecting taxes. The Crow Tribe Members concede that the judicial interpretation of the law upon which that relief was based has subsequently changed under the Supreme Court\u2019s deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>sion in <em>Leech Lake. </em>Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court did not err when it vacated the injunctive portion of its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">\u00b629 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b318-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES GRAY and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b318-6\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER</author>\n<p id=\"AEd\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">\u00b630 I dissent from the majority opinion.

Section 15-1-404, MCA, of that chapter specifically provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-12\">The remedies hereby provided shall supersede the remedy of injunction and all other remedies which might be invoked to prevent the collection of taxes or licenses alleged to be irregularly levied or demanded, except in unusual cases where the remedies hereby provided are deemed by the court to be inadequate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-13\">\u00b634 Section 15-1-406, MCA, pursuant to which the parties agreed relief was entered, provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-14\">(1) An aggrieved taxpayer may bring a declaratory judgment action in the district court seeking a declaration that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-15\">(b) a tax authorized by the state or one of its subdivisions was illegally or unlawfully imposed or exceeded the taxing authority of the entity imposing the tax.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>(5) The remedy authorized by this section is the exclusive method of obtaining a declaratory judgment concerning a tax authorized by the state or one of its subdivisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">\u00b635 Relief was granted pursuant to \u00a7 15-1-408, MCA, which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-6\">If the district court determines that the tax was illegally or unlawfully imposed or exceeded the taxing authority of the entity imposing the tax, the judgment may direct:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-7\">(1) that the revenue collected under the illegal tax be directly refunded to the taxpayers who have paid the illegal tax and who have not been excluded from the action;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-8\">(2) that the revenue collected under the illegal tax be used to reduce a similar levy in the ensuing tax year;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-9\">(3) that the assessment be changed for the taxpayer or taxpayers who brought the action as well as for all similarly situated taxpayers; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-10\">(4) any other remedy as the court considers appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-11\">\u00b636 In this case, the court granted relief pursuant to subparagraphs (1) and (4), of \u00a7 15-1-408, MCA. It ordered that illegally collected taxes be refunded to the taxpayers who brought the action and that they not be collected in the future. However, both forms of relief were pursuant to the declaratory judgment action provided for in \u00a7 15-1-406, MCA. They were not in the form of injunctive relief which is specifically precluded by \u00a7 15-1-404, MCA. In fact, nowhere in the District Court\u2019s August 28, 1990 order is the word \u201cenjoin\u201d or any of its derivative forms mentioned. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-12\">It is the judgment of this Court that Defendants may not collect property tax on Plaintiffs\u2019 land within the boundaries of the Crow Reservation that has never been allotted under the General Allotment Act and is owned by an enrolled member of the Crow Tribe. The Court stated:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-13\">Section 15-1-406, MCA, states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-14\">The decision of the court shall apply to all similarly situated taxpayers except those taxpayers who are excluded under 15-1-407.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-15\">Section 15-1-408, MCA, allows this Court to fashion a remedy to implement the declaratory judgment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-16\">(B) Removal from tax rolls.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>This declaratory ruling establishes a future tax exempt status for land that is located within the Crow Reservation, has never been subject to the General Allotment Act and is owned by an enrolled Crow Tribe member. This land may be removed from the tax rolls as follows:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">\u00b637 In other words, the principal thrust of the District Court\u2019s 1990 judgment was to provide for declaratory relief. The declaratory relief was sufficient to exempt the taxpayer\u2019s property from taxation on a stand-alone basis. It was not necessary to additionally enjoin Big Horn County or the State of Montana from prospective conduct. Any incidental language to that effect was gratuitous, unnecessary, and, in fact, contrary to the specific prohibition of injunctive relief found at \u00a7 15-1-404, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">\u00b638 For these reasons, when federal decisional law changed from what had been in effect at the time of the District Court\u2019s August 28, 1990 order, the only procedure available to the State or to the county for relief from that judgment was Rule 60(b)(6), M.R.Civ.R, or the residual clause of Rule 60(b), M.R.Civ.R Big Horn County filed a motion for Rule 60(b), M.R.Civ.P. relief. The District Court did not act on that motion within 60 days and it was therefore deemed denied pursuant to Rule 60(c), M.R.Civ.P. However, neither the county nor the State appealed from the District Court\u2019s denial of their Rule 60(b) motion. Therefore, the District Court\u2019s denial is final.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">\u00b639 For these reasons, I would reverse the judgment of the District Court and I dissent from the majority opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b320-7\">JUSTICE HUNT and JUSTICE NELSON, join in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
