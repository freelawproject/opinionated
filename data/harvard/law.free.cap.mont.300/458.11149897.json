Following a jury trial, Davis was convicted of both offenses. At the conclusion of the State\u2019s presentation of evidence, Davis moved for dismissal of the negligent homicide charge for insufficient evidence. The District Court denied Davis\u2019 motion. Davis appeals from the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion and the use of the jury instruction regarding evidence of flight. We affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">\u00b62 The following issues are presented on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied Davis\u2019 motion to dismiss based on insufficient evidence of negligent homicide?</p>\n<p id=\"b483-12\">\u00b64 2. Should the judgment of the District Court be set aside because the jury was instructed that flight by the defendant tends to prove consciousness of guilt?</p>\n<p id=\"b483-13\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b483-14\">\u00b65 On February 2,1997, Missoula resident Gwen Taylor, and her two children, 12-year-old Twila Taylor, and 8-year-old David Taylor decided to walk to the local Pizza Hut from their residence in an area known as the Rattlesnake Canyon in Missoula, Montana. Due to harsh winter conditions in early 1997, snow berms and icy patches had formed between several sidewalks and streets, including portions of Van Bur\u00e9n Street in the Rattlesnake Canyon. The snow and ice made pedestrian travel in the area especially difficult because the sidewalks were intermittently covered with snow and ice and required careful maneuvering.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>\u00b66 Following dinner at Pizza Hut, Gwen, Twila, and David began their walk home traveling north on Van Bur\u00e9n. At the time they began their walk back home it was getting dark outside. Because the sidewalks were generally icy, they utilized the passable portions of the sidewalks and walked on the right-hand side of the road with their backs to traffic. Two motorists testified that as they traveled northbound on Van Bur\u00e9n, they noticed Gwen, Twila, and David walking near the right-hand side of the road. The first motorist, Denise Giuliani, testified that they were walking predominately on the street, in single file, near the 1200 block of Van Bur\u00e9n. The second motorist, Jeanne McGinley, testified that near the 1300 block, they were walking side by side, and that Gwen was still walking on the right- hand side of the street, but that Twila and David were now walking on the snow berm which had formed over the sidewalk. McGinley further testified that she was required to swerve into the other lane of traffic in order to avoid Gwen as she walked on the right-hand side of the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">\u00b67 As Gwen, Twila, and David traveled onto the 1400 block of Van Bur\u00e9n, Gwen was walking on the right-hand side of the street, holding onto David\u2019s left hand, while Twila walked in front of David. An oncoming vehicle approached them driven by Anderson Cagle. At the same time, a vehicle approached them from behind driven by the Defendant, Robert Davis. Cagle testified that he noticed Davis\u2019 white Jeep Cherokee veer towards the right-hand side of the road as Davis approached the place where Gwen, Twila, and David were walking. Eight-year-old David testified that as Davis\u2019 Jeep passed them, he felt a tug on his hand and his mother disappeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">\u00b68 Davis\u2019 Jeep struck Gwen in the back of the legs and buttock region, causing her to be thrown onto the hood of Davis\u2019 Jeep and then into the air. She landed some distance from where she was struck, near a road sign.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">\u00b69 Immediately following the collision, Cagle pulled over and his passenger ran to a nearby house for help. Twila and David were frantically looking around and yelling for their mother, and following the discovery of their mother\u2019s body in the snow, they were led away by another witness. Davis, however, did not stop his Jeep following the collision. Witnesses watched Davis\u2019 white Jeep continue driving north on Van Bur\u00e9n. Gwen was transported by emergency personnel to the hospital where she died as a result of the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>\u00b6 10 When Davis arrived home, he parked his Jeep in the garage and asked his girlfriend, Tracy Kelly, to come look at his Jeep because, as he told her, he had hit a deer on the way home and damaged his car. Davis and Kelly ate dinner that night and then went to bed. When Davis and Kelly awoke the next morning, February 3,1997, they heard a news report on the early news regarding a fatal hit and run collision involving a pedestrian and a light colored Jeep in the Rattlesnake Canyon. According to Kelly\u2019s testimony, Davis told her that he needed time to talk to an attorney before he turned himself in. Davis then drove Kelly to work in her van and returned back home.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">\u00b611 Later that morning, while leaving the house again, Davis was stopped by Missoula Police Detective Michael Brady. The Missoula Police had received a tip that Davis was the owner and driver of a white Jeep which fit the description of the vehicle the police were searching for. Davis informed Detective Brady that he owned a white Jeep and that he needed to talk to his attorney prior to giving the detective any more information.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">\u00b6 12 Davis was able to contact his attorney that afternoon and later that afternoon his attorney gave Missoula Police consent to search the garage where Davis\u2019 Jeep was parked. Missoula Police evidence technician, Barbara Fortunate, testified that when she and other officers first examined Davis\u2019 Jeep that afternoon, she smelled the odor of alcohol through the Jeep\u2019s open driver\u2019s-side window.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">\u00b613 As Missoula Police detectives began to piece together what had occurred on the day of the accident, they learned that prior to the accident, Davis had been at the Prime Time Casino in Missoula with Kelly and her son. Kelly was doing her laundry at a laundromat next door to the Prime Time and between approximately 4:00 and 6:30 p.m., she and Davis ordered food and drinks at the Prime Time while finishing the laundry next door. Davis was drinking shots of brandy along with beer. Davis and Kelly left the Prime Time in separate cars at approximately 6:30 p.m. However, Davis forgot his briefcase at the Prime Time and returned ten minutes later to retrieve it, at which time he drank another shot of brandy.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">\u00b614 The two bartenders who served drinks to Davis and Kelly that afternoon testified that they believed that together they had served Davis approximately nine drinks that afternoon. The first bartender, Wendy Best, testified that she served Davis three shots of brandy and three beers between 4 and 6 p.m. The second bartender, Jacqueline Peterson, testified that after she came on duty at 6 p.m., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>she served Davis a shot of brandy and a beer, and an additional shot of brandy when Davis returned for his briefcase at approximately 6:40 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">\u00b615 On March 6,1997, the State filed an Information charging Davis with negligent homicide, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-104, MCA, and failure to remain at the scene of an accident which resulted in death or personal injuries, a misdemeanor, in violation of \u00a7 61-7-103, MCA. Davis entered a plea of not guilty to both charges. A jury trial was held on June 10 through 24, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">\u00b616 On June 23,1998, following presentation of the State\u2019s evidence, Davis made a motion to dismiss the negligent homicide charge based on insufficient evidence. The District Court denied Davis\u2019 motion, and following presentation of the Defendant\u2019s case, the jury found Davis guilty on both counts. On August 24,1998, the District Court sentenced Davis to ten years in the Montana State Prison for negligent homicide and six months in the Missoula County Jail for failure to remain at the scene of the accident, with both sentences to be served concurrently. Davis now appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss and the District Court\u2019s instruction to the jury regarding evidence of flight.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">\u00b617 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence to determine whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>See State v. Berger, </em>1998 MT 170, \u00b6 25, 290 Mont. 78, \u00b6 25, 964 P.2d 725, \u00b6 25. An order dismissing a criminal action is appropriate only when no evidence exists to support a guilty verdict. <em>See State v. Clay, </em>1998 MT 244, \u00b6 29, 291 Mont. 147, \u00b6 29, 967 P.2d 370, \u00b6 29. We find no abuse of discretion if, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Berger, </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">\u00b618 The standard of review of jury instructions in criminal cases is whether the instructions, as a whole, fully and fairly instruct the jury on the law applicable to the case. <em>See State v. Johnson, </em>1998 MT 289, \u00b6 28, 291 Mont. 501, \u00b6 28, 969 P.2d 925, \u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AAT\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">\u00b6 19 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied Davis\u2019 motion to dismiss based on insufficient evidence of negligent homicide?</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">\u00b620 Davis asserts that at the close of the State\u2019s case-in-chief, there was insufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find him guilty of negligent homicide beyond a reasonable doubt. Davis contends that the State did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he disregarded the risk created by Gwen or that Davis\u2019 conduct immediately before the accident was a gross deviation from the reasonable person standard of care established for similar conditions. Accordingly, Davis argues that the District Court abused its discretion when it deified his motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">\u00b621 Section 46-16-403, MCA, provides the following procedure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Abt\">When, at the close of the prosecution\u2019s evidence or at the close of all the evidence, the evidence is insufficient to support a finding or verdict of guilty, the court may, on its own motion or on the motion of the defendant, dismiss the action and discharge the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AnN\">\u00b622 Section 45-5-104, MCA, provides that \u201ca person commits the offense of negligent homicide if the person negligently causes the death of another human being.\u201d Section 45-2-101(42), MCA, defines \u201cnegligently\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-7\">[A] person acts negligently with respect to a result or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense when the person consciously disregards a risk that the result will occur or that the circumstance exists or when the person disregards a risk of which the person should be aware that the result will occur or that the circumstance exists. The risk must be of a nature and degree that to disregard it involves a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the actor\u2019s situation. \u201cGross deviation\u201d means a deviation that is considerably greater than lack of ordinary care.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">\u00b623 The State points out that Davis\u2019 contention is based on the argument that the State failed to present evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that Davis disregarded the risk created by Gwen, and is not based on the risk created by Davis\u2019 alcohol consumption prior to the accident. The State asserts that Davis\u2019 consumption of approximately nine drinks prior to driving his vehicle was the risk disregarded by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>Davis, and his conduct was clearly a gross deviation from a reasonable person\u2019s standard of conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">\u00b624 At trial, Davis argued the following to the District Court in support of his motion to dismiss:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-5\">Taking the evidence in the light which is best to the Prosecution is, as stated by Detective Reid, Mr. Davis was driving in his own lane of traffic, he was not going any faster than Mr. Cagle, who it was agreed was driving in a safe manner. There is not evidence of intoxication, as the State\u2019s own expert stated he does not know and he could not know and he can\u2019t express an opinion as to either the effect of any alcohol on Mr. Davis or its degree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">\u00b625 In response, the State argued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-7\">[T]here has been evidence of significant alcohol consumption, and there has been evidence by several witnesses that the Defendant was not, in fact, in the portion of the road where he should have been in violation of Montana rules, regulations and statutes and ordinances. And I would ask the Court to deny the Defendant\u2019s motion on those grounds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">\u00b626 The District Court denied Davis\u2019 motion and concluded that the \u201cState has met its burden of presenting a prima facie case.\u201d After reviewing the record and drawing permissible inferences in favor of the prevailing party, we agree with the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">\u00b627 The State presented substantial evidence of Davis\u2019 alcohol consumption prior to the accident. Prime Time bartender Wendy Best testified that during her shift on February 2,1997, between 4 and 6 p.m., she served Davis six drinks, including three brandies and three beers. Jacqueline Peterson also testified that during her shift as a bartender at the Prime Time on February 2, 1997, beginning at 6 p.m., she served Davis an additional two brandies and one beer. Admittedly, the State was unable to present evidence of Davis\u2019 blood alcohol content at the time of the accident, however, this was due solely to Davis\u2019 failure to remain at the scene. Moreover, the jury is free to draw inferences from the evidence presented at trial. <em>See State v. Heffner, </em>1998 MT 181, \u00b6 30, 290 Mont. 114, \u00b6 30, 964 P.2d 736, \u00b6 30; \u00a7 26-1-501, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">\u00b628 The State\u2019s expert, Phillip I. Lively, director of the breath analysis program for the Division of Forensic Sciences, Department of Justice, State of Montana, testified regarding the effect of alcohol on a person:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>Q. [W]ould you have an opinion as to whether or not an individual who weighed approximately 200 pounds who consumed five ounces of brandy as well as four of those St. Pauli Girl beers in a two and a half hour period of time, do you have an opinion as to whether that individual would have approached the range of diminished ability to perform a multiple attention task?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-4\">A. Well, I mean, alcohol is a drug that has a specific function. It comes in and it alters your brain function, that\u2019s its pharmacological action. An individual who consumed five ounces of brandy and how many, four beers? Something like that? Um in a two-hour period, I mean, that\u2019s - - that\u2019s a good quantity of alcohol to do in two hours. My assessment is that there is alcohol on board on that individual, and that that individual is experiencing the effects of alcohol at that time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">\u00b629 Even though both bartenders testified that Davis did not appear to be intoxicated that evening, the State\u2019s expert, Lively, distinguished between being intoxicated and being under the influence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-6\">Well, when we think of people who are drunk or intoxicated, we think of the typical - - stereotypical thing that we see on TV or whatever of the individual who staggers and slurs their speech; and, you know, may be very volatile and so forth. And, yes, people do become that way under the influence of alcohol. But the mental faculties, the effect on the mental faculties, the depression of your judgmental centers, the effect that it has on the sensory occurs well before many of these particular signs manifest themselves. You know, I guess one could say that all drinkers are under the influence, but not all people that are under the influence are, quote, drunk; but they are being affected by the drug, even though it\u2019s not visibly manifested.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">\u00b630 Additionally, the testimony of eyewitness Cagle regarding Davis\u2019 driving prior to and immediately following the accident supports the State\u2019s allegation that Davis\u2019 driving subsequent to substantial alcohol consumption was a gross deviation from the standard of conduct of a reasonable person, and that Davis consciously disregarded that risk. Cagle was traveling southbound on Van Bur\u00e9n in his Isuzu Trooper and his vehicle passed Davis\u2019 Jeep almost simultaneously with Davis\u2019 Jeep\u2019s collision with Gwen. Cagle testified that just prior to the accident, Davis\u2019 Jeep began to drift steadily towards the right-hand side of the road. Cagle additionally testified to the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>Q. And you didn\u2019t have any difficulty at all seeing the pedestrians?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-4\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-5\">Q. About how much time was there between the time you saw the vehicle veering off to the side of the road and the time that the collision occurred?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\">A. Maybe three to five seconds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-7\">Q. And did the vehicle in any way attempt to correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-8\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-9\">Q. What did you see the Jeep do after it hit the lady?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-10\">A. I didn\u2019t see what it did, but I do remember hearing a loud engine noise as if it was taking off, getting out of there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-11\">\u00b631 Moreover, Kelly testified to the following at trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-12\">Q. What happened when he [Davis] got home?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-13\">A. He walked into the house. I was cooking chicken in the kitchen, and he asked me to come and look at his car, because he had just hit a deer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-14\">Considering that Gwen weighed approximately 250 pounds at the time of the accident and landed on the hood of Davis\u2019 vehicle before she was thrown into the air, the fact that Davis was under the impression that he hit a deer on the way home also infers that Davis was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-15\">\u00b632 We have previously held that intoxication can be the basis for a finding of criminal negligence. <em>See State v. Cook </em>(1982), 198 Mont. 329, 333, 645 P.2d 1367, 1370, (citing <em>State v. Kirkaldie </em>(1978), 179 Mont. 283, 292, 587 P.2d 1298, 1304.)</p>\n<p id=\"b490-16\">\u00b633  After viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we conclude that a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of negligent homicide beyond a reasonable doubt. The jury could reasonably have found from the evidence presented that Davis consciously disregarded the risk posed by his driving under the influence of alcohol, and that his conduct immediately before, during, and after the accident reveals a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person, not under the influence of alcohol, would have observed. Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Davis\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>motion for a directed verdict of acquittal on the charge of negligent homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">\u00b634 Should the judgment of the District Court be set aside because the jury was instructed that flight by the defendant tends to prove consciousness of guilt?</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">\u00b635 We recently determined in <em>State v. Hall, </em>1999 MT 297, 297 Mont. Ill, 991 P.2d 929, that a jury instruction on flight may be an unnecessary comment on the evidence by the trial court, and that the better policy in future cases where evidence of flight has been properly admitted is to limit comment to counsel, rather than the court. <em>See Hall, </em>\u00b6 46. Therefore, we concluded that jury instructions on the significance of flight should no longer be given. <em>See Hall, </em>\u00b6 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">\u00b636 In this case, the District Court gave the following jury instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-8\">If you are satisfied that the crime charged in the Information has been committed by someone, then you may take into consideration any testimony showing or tending to show flight by the Defendant. This testimony may be considered by the jury as a circumstance tending to prove a consciousness of guilt, but it is not sufficient of itself to prove guilt. The weight to be given such circumstance and significance if any to be attached to it are matters for the jury to determine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">\u00b637 Davis did object to the flight instruction at trial, however, not because it was an improper comment on the evidence, but for the following reason:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-10\">We object, Your Honor, simply noting that there\u2019s no actual evidence of flight in this case. All the evidence tends to show lack of knowledge on Mr. Davis\u2019 part as to the critical fact which would be attendant to flight that would acknowledge that he hit a human being.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">\u00b638 Before this Court can consider the application of <em>Hall, </em>Davis must show that he made a proper objection in the District Court, i.e., an objection on the basis now alleged. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-16-410(3), MCA; <em>State v. Hatten, </em>1999 MT 298, \u00b6 67,297 Mont. 127, \u00b6 67,991 P.2d 939, \u00b6 67. By first raising the issue in the District Court through a specific objection, the defendant enables the State, as well as the District Court, to avoid or correct the purported error. <em>See State v. McKeon </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 397, 409, 938 P.2d 643, 650.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>\u00b639 For example, in <em>Hatten, </em>this Court declined to reverse Hatten\u2019s conviction on the basis of the District Court\u2019s flight instruction because Hatten did not claim the instruction was an unnecessary comment on the evidence in the District Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-4\">In the case before us, Hatten, unlike the defendant in <em>Hall, </em>did not argue, either before the trial court or on appeal, that the instruction on flight was an improper comment on the evidence, thus, it would be improper for us to reverse the District Court on that basis. \u201cA party may not assign as error any portion of the instructions or omission from the instructions unless an objection was made specifically stating the matter objected to, <em>and the grounds for the objection, </em>at the settlement of the instructions.\u201d <em>State v. Grimes, </em>1999 MT 145, \u00b6 37, [295 Mont. 22, \u00b6 37], 982 P.2d 1037, \u00b6 37, 56 St.Rep. 571, \u00b6 37 (emphasis added) (quoting \u00a7 46-16-410(3), MCA). \u201cA party\u2019s assertion of error \u2018must stand or fall on the ground relied on by the trial court\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Henderson </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 454, 459, 877 P.2d 1013, 1016 (quoting <em>State v. Dep\u2019t of Highways v. DeTienne </em>(1985), 218 Mont. 249, 256, 707 P.2d 534, 538.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-5\"><em>Hatten, </em>\u00b6 67. Here, like the defendant in <em>Hatten, </em>Davis did not raise a <em>Hall-type </em>objection to the flight instruction during the settlement of instructions in the District Court. Accordingly, Davis has waived appellate review of his claim that the flight instruction offered in his case was an unnecessary comment on the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">\u00b640 Furthermore, in anticipation of the claim that counsel was ineffective for not making the proper objection we note that in <em>Hall, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-7\">[I]n the instant case, we find no reversible error because there was sufficient evidence that flight had taken place and the instruction . included the qualification that such flight is not by itself sufficient evidence of guilt but is only one circumstance to be considered by the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-8\"><em>Hall, </em>\u00b6 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">\u00b641  We conclude that in this case, like <em>Hall, </em>there was sufficient evidence that flight had taken place and that because the jury instruction contained the qualification that flight itself was not sufficient evidence of guilt, the jury instruction on flight was not prejudicial to Davis.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">\u00b642 Accordingly, we affirm the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b492-11\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES NELSON, REGNIER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
