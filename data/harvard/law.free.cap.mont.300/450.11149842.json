Brower, trespassed on her property and assaulted her. The District Court awarded Brower summary judgment. Kinsey-Cartwright appeals the judgment of the District Court. We affirm the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">\u00b62 The issues on appeal are:</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">1. Did the District Court err when it awarded Brower summary judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it sanctioned Kinsey-Cartwright pursuant to Rule 11, M.R.Civ.P.?</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">\u00b63 3. Should sanctions be imposed against Kinsey-Cartwright for</p>\n<p id=\"b475-11\">filing a frivolous appeal pursuant to Rule 32, M.R.App.P.?</p>\n<p id=\"b475-12\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b475-13\">\u00b64 Suzan Kinsey-Cartwright and Douglas M. Burleson had a dispute over an easement across Kinsey-Cartwright\u2019s property. Burleson hired attorney Floyd A. Brower to represent him, and filed a claim for injunctive relief. Burleson alleged that he had an easement over Kinsey-Cartwright\u2019s property and asked the District Court to enjoin her from obstructing the alleged easement. Kinsey-Cartwright hired attorney Matthew J. Sisler to represent her.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-14\">\u00b65 On May 15, 1998, Burleson and Brower investigated the disputed easement. During his deposition, Brower testified that he and Burleson drove up the alleged easement until they reached a gate, which was crossing the road near Kinsey-Cartwright\u2019s home. Brower testified the following then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-15\">A. She came out of the house and asked me what I was doing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALO\">Q. Who?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-16\">A. Suzan Kinsey and I replied, I\u2019m here because these gates are not to be locked, one; they\u2019re not even to be here, two; and I wanted them removed now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-17\">Q. You realized that this was her home, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-18\">A. I wasn\u2019t even off the easement. I was standing on the easement when I said that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>Q. On her place?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-4\">A. I\u2019m standing on the easement. I\u2019m entitled to be there. I was standing on the easement. She had two dogs that were barking and yelping, so then voices were raised. She then advised me that-although the locks appeared to be locked, they weren\u2019t. Then she asked me if I wanted to talk to her attorney and I said, yes; I\u2019ll talk to an attorney.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">She then went back in the house. She went back in the house and one of the dogs went in the house. She had chained one up at the corner of the house. I went back, started taking more pictures. And when she came out of the house with this cordless telephone in her hand, holding it out, she unchained-either one dog came out of the house with her or she unchains one, but there was one dog there and he was between us. He was on the easement. And she said, do you want to talk to my attorney? And I said, sure. Every time I would advance to talk to her, this dog would try to attack me from the right. And so I would go back, she would come up and she would hand this telephone, and this happened about three times. This dog was really making passes at me.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Finally, I said, if the son-of-a-bitch bites me, I\u2019m going to have him destroyed and I\u2019m going to sue you, and she had a sparkle in her eye and a big smug look on her face and she said nothing. She went for the phone like this again. I moved toward it and he really tried to take me. And I said, again, if that son-of-a-bitch bites me, I\u2019m going to have him destroyed and I\u2019m going to sue you. This got her attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">She got a hold of the dog. He was lunging. She still had the phone in this hand and he was lunging, he was lunging and he was lunging. So I went kind of this way and she handed the phone to me. I backed away.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">The words on the other line were, Floyd, you\u2019re trespassing and I replied, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. I was president of this company. [] Rodegheiro and I drafted these easements, get off my back. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. Goodbye.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">I then moved to hand the phone back to her and she said, you better look out, he\u2019s liable to bite you. You better lay this on the ground. So I did, laid it on the ground and I retreated to the pickup and this dog was lunging. She was trying to hold him as she backed toward her house. There was no time when she was in the yard that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>there wasn\u2019t a dog in between us at her side. And the only time that I was within arm\u2019s length was when I touched that telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">\u00b66 Kinsey-Cartwright described the event in her affidavit as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-5\">On May 15,1998, Floyd Brower and Douglas Burleson entered upon Mrs. Kinsey-Cartwright\u2019s property despite her requests and demands for them to leave.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-6\">On May 15,1998, Floyd Brower exited his pickup truck and assaulted Suzan Kinsey-Cartwright by flailing his arms and fists in the air, by shouting profane words and by approaching her in an intimidating fashion, creating the reasonable apprehension of bodily injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-7\">On May 15,1998, Floyd Brower stepped well beyond the alleged 60 foot summer access easement and into Mrs. Kinsey-Cartwright\u2019s yard when Floyd Brower assaulted and intimidated her.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">Kinsey-Cartwright also testified during her deposition that she was frightened, and that Brower said he was going to slap her. When asked if Brower used the word smack, Kinsey-Cartwright testified: \u2018Yes, you did. It was smack or slap. You were yelling so loudly there were times I didn\u2019t understand what you were saying.\u201d She also testified that she could have misunderstood Brower\u2019s words.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">\u00b67 During his deposition, Burleson testified that Kinsey-Cartwright\u2019s dogs were barking loudly; that Kinsey-Cartwright and Brower were both speaking loudly; and, that other than calling the dog a \u201cson-of-a-bitch,\u201d and maybe using the phrase \u201cdamn gates,\u201d Burleson did not recall Brower speaking profanely. Burleson also testified that, although Brower may have pointed his finger toward Kinsey-Cartwright, he was not shaking his fist; that during the exchange between Brower and Kinsey-Cartwright, the closest the two were to one another was 10 or 15 feet; and that Brower was never more than 15 feet from the vehicle. \u00b68 Following the confrontation, on the same day, May 15, 1998, Kinsey-Cartwright drafted a complaint against Brower in which she alleged that Brower assaulted her and trespassed on her land. Subsequently, both parties moved the District Court for summary judgment. On September 2,1999, the District Court granted Brower summary judgment. It also sanctioned Kinsey-Cartwright pursuant to Rule 11, M.R.Civ.R The District Court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>Sisler, apparently upset over the way he was treated by Brower, immediately drafted a Complaint on behalf of Kinsey-Cartwright alleging she was civilly assaulted by Brower (because he yelled obscenities at her) on that day and that Brower had unlawfully entered her property. Without further investigation, the Complaint went in the mail and was filed the following Monday in the Musselshell County Clerk of Court\u2019s office.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">Kinsey-Cartwright then appealed the District Court\u2019s decision to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">\u00b69 On February 17,2000, after the parties filed their briefs with the clerk of this Court, Brower moved this Court to strike portions of Kinsey-Cartwright\u2019s reply brief. Brower asserted that Kinsey-Cartwright improperly raised factual and legal arguments regarding assault and trespass in her reply brief which were not reused in her opening brief. On March 7, 2000, Kinsey-Cartwright moved this Court to \u201cjoin this appeal\u201d with her appeal from the judgment entered in Cause No. DV 98-42. She asserted that the easement issue resolved in that case is inextricably interrelated with the assault and trespass claims on appeal in this case. On March 28,2000, we issued a consolidated order in which we granted Brower\u2019s motion to strike those portions of Kinsey-Cartwright\u2019s reply brief addressing assault and trespass and denied Kinsey-Cartwright\u2019s motion to consolidate.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">\u00b610 Did the District Court err when it awarded Brower summary judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">\u00b611 We review summary judgment orders de novo. <em>See Motarle v. Northern Montana Joint Refuse Disposal Dist. </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 239, 242, 907 P.2d 154, 156. We determine whether the district court correctly applied Rule 56, M.R.Civ.R, which provides that summary judgment is only appropriate where there is no genuine issue of material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See Gilkey v. Schweitzer, </em>1999 MT 18, \u00b6 9, 295 Mont. 345, \u00b6 9, 983 P.2d 869, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">\u00b612 With the exception of four sentences, Kinsey-Cartwright\u2019s entire argument in her brief is devoted to arguing that no easement burdened her land. This case, however, is an appeal from the District Court\u2019s award of summary judgment with respect to Kinsey-Cartwright\u2019s complaint of trespass to land and assault. It is not an appeal from the District Court\u2019s judgment in <em>Burleson v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number><em>Kinsey-Cartwright, </em>et al, DV-98-42 regarding the validity of the easement over Kinsey-Cartwright\u2019s property. Therefore, those arguments regarding the validity of the easement are irrelevant to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">\u00b613 The four sentences in Kinsey-Cartwright\u2019s opening brief relating to trespass to land and assault were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-5\">The lower court determined that Mrs. Kinsey Cartwright\u2019s claims of assault and trespass were not supported by fact or law. The court was wrong on both issues. The facts contained in Mrs. Kinsey Cartwright\u2019s testimony supported the claims. The law, applied to Mrs. Kinsey Cartwright\u2019s facts, supported the claims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">\u00b614  This is not a legal argument. It contains no discussion of the law relating to trespass to land or assault; it contains no citation to legal authority; it contains no citation to the record; and it contains no application of the law to the facts. It is simply a collection of conclusions. In <em>State v. Blackcrow, </em>1999 MT 44, \u00b6 33, 293 Mont. 374, \u00b6 33, 975 P.2d 1253, \u00b6 33, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">It is not this Court\u2019s obligation to formulate arguments or locate authorities for the parties in support of their positions on appeal. <em>See Johansen v. State, Dept. of Natural Resources, </em>1998 MT 51, \u00b6 24,288 Mont. 39, \u00b6 24, 955 P.2d 653, \u00b6 24; <em>Small v. Good </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 159,163, 943 P.2d 1258,1260; <em>State v. Sol </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 69, 76, 936 P.2d 307, 311; <em>Rieman v. Anderson </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 139, 147, 935 P.2d 1122, 1127.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">Accordingly, we conclude that there is no meritorious argument to consider on appeal from the award of summary judgment in this case. Therefore, we hold that the District Court did not err when it awarded Brower summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">\u00b615 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it sanctioned Kinsey-Cartwright pursuant to Rule 11, M.R.Civ.P?</p>\n<p id=\"b479-11\">\u00b616 We review the imposition of discovery sanctions to determine whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>Sullivan v. Sisters of Charity of Providence of Montana </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 71, 77, 885 P.2d 488, 492. We give deference to the trial court because it is in the best position to know whether the party in question has disregarded the other\u2019s rights, and is in the best position to determine which sanction is most appropriate. <em>Sullivan, </em>268 Mont. at 77, 885 P.2d at 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-12\">\u00b617 The purpose of the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure is to \u201csecure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Rule 1, M.R.Civ.P. When litigants and their attorneys abuse the rules they are subject to sanctions. <em>See Sullivan, </em>268 Mont, at 77, 885 P.2d at 492. The district courts should punish those who engage in dilatory discovery actions rather than patiently encourage their cooperation. <em>See Morris v. Big Sky Thoroughbred Farms, </em>Inc., 1998 MT 229, \u00b6 13, 291 Mont. 32, \u00b6 13,965 P.2d 890, \u00b6 13 (citing <em>Owen v. F. A. Buttrey Co. </em>(1981), 192 Mont. 274, 278, 627 P.2d 1233, 1235.) Rule 11, M.R.Civ.P., provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-4\">Every pleading, motion, or other paper of a party represented by an attorney shall be signed by at least one attorney ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-5\">The signature ... constitutes a certificate by the signer that the signer has read the pleading, motion, or other paper; that to the best of the signer\u2019s knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry it is well grounded in fact and is warranted by existing law ..., and that it is not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\">If a pleading, motion, or other paper is signed in violation of this rule, the court, upon motion or upon its own initiative, shall impose upon the person who signed it, a represented party, or both, an appropriate sanction....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">However, before the district court can impose sanctions pursuant to Rule 11, M.R.Civ.R, it must conduct a hearing. <em>See State ex rel. Lovins v. Toole County </em>(1996), 278 Mont. 253, 263, 924 P.2d 693, 698 (citing <em>Lindey\u2019s, Inc. v. Goodover </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 489, 497, 872 P.2d 767, 772).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">\u00b618 The District Court found that Kinsey-Cartwright\u2019s attorney filed her complaint without conducting an investigation into the facts. Kinsey-Cartwright does not dispute the District Court\u2019s findings, rather she contends that the because the District Court failed to conduct a hearing before it imposed Rule 11 sanctions, the Court\u2019s sanctions were improper. Brower responds that Kinsey-Cartwright did not request a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">\u00b619 We will not review a district court\u2019s procedural error unless the appellant has made a timely objection. <em>Green v. Green </em>(1978), 176 Mont. 532, 536, 579 P.2d 1235, 1237. In <em>Green </em>we said, \u201c[i]t has long been the rule of this Court that on appeal we will not put a District Court in error for a ruling or procedure in which the appellant acqui<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>esced, participated, or to which appellant made no objection.\u201d <em>Green, </em>176 Mont, at 536,579 P.2d at 1237. We will not hold a district court in error for an omission which it was not given an opportunity to correct. <em>See State ex rel. Lovins, </em>278 Mont. at 257, 924 P.2d at 695.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">\u00b620  Kinsey-Cartwright was clearly entitled to a hearing regarding the District Court\u2019s imposition of Rule 11 sanctions. However, Kinsey-Cartwright cites no objection to the District Court\u2019s failure to conduct a hearing, and our review of the record reveals none. Since Kinsey-Cartwright failed to object, we will not hold the District Court in error for failing to conduct a Rule 11 hearing. Accordingly, we affirm the District Court\u2019s imposition of sanctions pursuant to Rule 11, M.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">ISSUE 3</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">\u00b621 Should sanctions be imposed against Kinsey-Cartwright for filing a frivolous appeal pursuant to Rule 32, M.R.App.P?</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">\u00b622 Brower requests the imposition of sanctions against Kinsey-Cartwright for filing a frivolous appeal pursuant to Rule 32, M.R.App.P., which provides the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-8\">If the supreme court is satisfied from the record and the presentation of the appeal in a civil case that the same was taken without substantial or reasonable grounds, such damages may be assessed on determination thereof as under the circumstances are deemed proper.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">\u00b623 Kinsey-Cartwright\u2019s brief contained only four sentences discussing trespass to land and assault. In those four sentences, Kinsey-Cartwright did not discuss the facts or the law. The remainder of her argument was dedicated to an easement issue, which was not included in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">\u00b624  This Court is burdened by a heavy volume of business and the problem is needlessly aggravated when frivolous appeals are taken. <em>See CNA Ins. Cos. v. Dunn </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 295, 302, 902 P.2d 1014, 1018. We conclude that this appeal was taken without substantial or reasonable grounds. We further conclude that this is a proper case in which to impose sanctions for a frivolous appeal pursuant to Rule 32, M.R.App.P., and we, therefore, remand to the District Court for a determination of Brower\u2019s reasonable costs and attorney fees incurred on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-11\">\u00b625 The judgment of the District Court is affirmed and this case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b481-12\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES HUNT, LEAPHART and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
