We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-14\">\u00b62 The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in denying Kriesel\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-15\">STATEMENT OF FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b69-16\">\u00b63 In January, 1996, Kriesel was placed on probation under a three-year deferred imposition of sentence from the Eighth Judicial District Court, Cascade County. Pursuant to the conditions of his probation, Kriesel was subject to the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>6. The Defendant shall be subject to search and seizure of his residence, person, and/or vehicle upon the request of his probation officer at any time with or without a warrant, with or without probable cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">\u00b64 In September, 1997, Kriesel was arrested for violating his probation, but was released to await revocation proceedings in Great Falls. After failing to report to his probation officer, Jim Simonich, (Simonich) the Eighth Judicial District Court issued a bench warrant for Kriesel\u2019s arrest for violation of his probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">\u00b65 On December 18, 1997, Simonich received a call from one of his probationers who notified him that Kriesel was on his way from Roundup to Lewistown, and described the make, color, and license plate number of the vehicle Kriesel was driving. Simonich notified a deputy from the Fergus County Sheriff\u2019s Office and the two drove to a location east of Lewistown and waited for Kriesel\u2019s vehicle. Upon observing a vehicle matching the informant\u2019s description, the deputy stopped the vehicle. Simonich identified Kriesel by way of a photograph and Kriesel was arrested on the outstanding warrant. The deputy conducted a search of the vehicle incident to arrest, and noticed a black film canister in the arm rest compartment, which a passenger identified as Kriesel\u2019s \u201ccrank.\u201d After being impounded, the vehicle was searched pursuant to a search warrant and officers seized methamphetamine and drug paraphernalia from the vehicle. Upon testing for drugs Kriesel was found to have marijuana and amphetamine in his system.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">\u00b66 Kriesel filed several suppression motions which were denied by the District Court. Kriesel then pled guilty to the charges against him reserving the right to appeal the issues presented by his Motion to Suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">\u00b67 This Court\u2019s standard of review of the denial of a motion to suppress is whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether the findings were correctly applied as a matter of law. <em>State v. Keating, </em>1998 MT 109, \u00b6 11, 288 Mont. 447, \u00b6 11, 958 P.2d 690, \u00b6 11 (citing State <em>v. New </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 529, 533, 917 P.2d 919, 921).</p>\n<p id=\"AuL\">\u00b68 Did the District Court err in denying Kriesel\u2019s motion to suppress?</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">\u00b69 The District Court found that \u201cthere was reasonable cause for the stop of (Kriesel) given the circumstances which existed at the time.\u201d Kriesel argues that the provisions of \u00a7 46-5-401, MCA, required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>Simonich to have particularized suspicion in order to make an investigatory stop of Kriesel\u2019s vehicle. He claims that because Simonich and the deputy did not have such particularized suspicion or probable cause, we should declare the stop unlawful and suppress the evidence gathered pursuant to that stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">\u00b610 Before the day of Kriesel\u2019s arrest, Simonich had advised one of his probationers of his interest in locating Kriesel. On the day of Kriesel\u2019s arrest, the probationer saw Kriesel and notified Simonich of Kriesel\u2019s location. In a deposition taken after Kriesel\u2019s sentencing, the probationer who acted as Simonich\u2019s informant stated that he was not a confidential informant. He stated, however, that he had routinely provided Simonich information as a part of his requirement to stay in contact with his probation officer.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-5\">The first time that I seen (Kriesel) after me and (Simonich) had the conversation I picked up the phone like I was asked to... and I would today. If some guy came around me with warrants today I would do the same thing, just like if somebody drove up in a hot car by my house I would call the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Kriesel claims the informant\u2019s testimony taints his reliability and therefore, there was no basis for finding a particularized suspicion to initiate the stop of Kriesel\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">\u00b611 Section 46-5-401, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-8\">[i]n order to obtain or verify an account of the person\u2019s presence or conduct or to determine whether to arrest the person, a peace officer may stop any person or vehicle that is observed in circumstances that create a particularized suspicion that the person or occupant of the vehicle has committed, is committing, or is about to commit an offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">Section 46-5-401, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">\u00b612  Kriesel argues that the informant supplied information which was not sufficiently corroborated, and therefore there was insufficient particularized suspicion to make the stop of Kriesel\u2019s vehicle. However, Simonich was not determining \u201cwhether to arrest\u201d Kriesel; the stop was initiated to detain Kriesel under the authority of a valid outstanding warrant satisfying the probable cause requirement of \u00a7 46-6-201, MCA. As a result, the particularized suspicion requirement was satisfied. In addition, we have held that a search of a probationer\u2019s residence or vehicle does not require probable cause but rather, reasonable grounds. <em>State v. Olmsted, </em>1998 MT 301, \u00b6 39, 968 P.2d 1154, \u00b6 39, 292 Mont. 66, \u00b6 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>\u00b613  Whether reasonable grounds exist to conduct a probationary search is a factual inquiry which should be determined based on the totality of the circumstances. <em>State v. Stucker, </em>1999 MT 14, \u00b6 32, 973 P.2d 835, \u00b6 32, 293 Mont. 123, \u00b6 32. The reasonable cause standard requires substantially less than the probable cause standard under the Fourth Amendment because of the probationer\u2019s diminished expectation of privacy and the superior position of the probation officer to determine what level of supervision is necessary to provide rehabilitation and community safety. <em>Stucker, </em>\u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">\u00b614  The District Court found that given Kriesel\u2019s status as a probationer, the search of his vehicle was properly executed. We have placed importance on the involvement of the probation officer in the search, holding that a search instigated and supervised by a probation officer of his probationer, probationer\u2019s car, premises, or other belongings is lawful. <em>State v. Small </em>(1989), 235 Mont. 309, 312, 767 P.2d 316, 318. However, the search should be permitted only if there is an underlying factual foundation justifying the search; and the search should not be used as an instrument of harassment or intimidation. <em>State v. Burke </em>(1988) 235 Mont. 165, 171, 766 P.2d 254, 257.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">\u00b615  The evidence presented shows there was probable cause for the stop and reasonable grounds for the resulting search of Kriesel\u2019s vehicle. The District Court\u2019s findings of fact are not clearly erroneous and were correctly applied as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">\u00b616 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b72-9\">JUSTICES GRAY, LEAPHART, REGNIER and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
