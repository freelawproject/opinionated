She appeals from the judgment of the Sixteenth Judicial District Court, Custer County, finding by a preponderance of the evidence that Susan exemplified Munchausen Syndrome By Proxy (MSBP) and smothered her sons Zachary and Mathew, Jr. (Mathew) and considering that conduct in sentencing Susan for the criminal endangerment conviction. The District Court further found that she was not entitled to be classified a first-time nonviolent offender for sentencing purposes. Susan appeals from the final judgment entered as to the criminal endangerment conviction and from the District Court\u2019s denial of Susan\u2019s motion to dismiss counts III, IV, and V of the Information upon double jeopardy grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">\u00b62 We affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-12\">Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b195-13\">In reviewing the District Court\u2019s judgment we consider the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b195-14\">\u00b63 1.

Susan\u2019s then four-year-old son Wesley was not feeling well and complained that his head hurt, so Susan put two Children\u2019s Tylenol tablets or a dose of Tylenol elixir<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on the coffee table in the living room. At trial, Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>Pezzarossi, who, with her partner Dr. Young, had been Wesley\u2019s and his deceased brother Mathew\u2019s pediatrician, testified that Susan later told her that there had been no water on the table. Pezzarossi also testified that Wesley was not able to swallow capsules without water. Susan testified at trial that Wesley had a cup of water. Also on the coffee table was a bottle of Benadryl capsules without a cap. Susan habitually removed the plastic wrappers from Benadryl capsules and put them in a bottle so that she would have quicker access to them at the onset of an allergy attack. When Susan set the Children\u2019s Tylenol on the coffee table for Wesley, about ten or twelve 25-milligram Benadryl capsules were remaining in the bottle. Susan told Wesley to take his medicine and resumed baking cookies in the kitchen.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">\u00b615 When Susan asked Wesley if he had taken his medicine, he replied, \u201cI took all my medicine.\u201d Susan continued baking cookies and a neighbor stopped by. Susan briefly visited with him in the living room and noticed, after the neighbor had left, that her Benadryl was gone. The Children\u2019s Tylenol was still sitting on the coffee table. Wesley confirmed that he had eaten the Benadryl capsules. Pezzarossi testified at trial that Susan later told her that she did not find pieces of the Benadryl on the floor, which might have indicated that Wesley had not taken all of the Benadryl. Susan testified that Wesley had tried to take other people\u2019s medicine on other occasions and that he had previously tried to take more vitamins than he was supposed to take. Susan unsuccessfully tried to phone her husband, Mathew Hocevar, Sr. (Mathew, Sr.), and then instructed the neighbor who had just visited to pick up Mathew, Sr. from work. Susan then called the emergency room and tried unsuccessfully to reach Dr. Young. Mathew, Sr. arrived at home and he and Susan took Wesley to the emergency room at Holy Rosary Hospital in Miles City.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">\u00b616 The hospital called Pezzarossi. Wesley\u2019s stomach was rinsed and he was given activated charcoal and a laxative to quickly remove the Benadryl from his system. Pezzarossi testified at trial that the Hocevars informed her that Wesley had ingested approximately 250 to 300 milligrams of Benadryl and that Pezzarossi was aware at the time of treating Wesley that the lethal dose for a child of Wesley\u2019s weight was 480 milligrams. She further testified that the symptoms of a Benadryl overdose include a fast heart rate, dilated pupils, hallucinations, combativeness, agitation, and hyperactivity. Pezzarossi testified that she observed hallucinations in Wesley. She also testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>that she was aware that an overdose of Benadryl could lead to seizures, but the record does not reflect that Wesley suffered any seizures following the overdose. Wesley was placed in the Intensive Care Unit for observation overnight and was released on the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">\u00b617 Pezzarossi was concerned that Wesley\u2019s Benadryl overdose might not have been accidental, partly based on her prior experience with Wesley\u2019s brother Mathew. Mathew died in December 1991 at the age of ten months. Pezzarossi first saw then six-month-old Mathew in August 1991, shortly after the Hocevars had moved to Montana from California. Susan informed Pezzarossi that Mathew had been on an apnea monitor in California, a device that alarms at a heart beat or respiration abnormality, because another Hocevar child, Zachary, had died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Although Mathew appeared normal to Pezzarossi, she therefore decided to prescribe another apnea monitor for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">\u00b618 Pezzarossi testified that subsequent to the August office visit, Mathew was hospitalized several times and brought in for office visits several.times, for problems including seizures, viral infections, and diarrhea. At the time of Mathew\u2019s last office visit on December 5, 1991, Pezzarossi testified that Susan felt that Mathew had been back to normal for several days and that Pezzarossi\u2019s examination of Mathew was normal. On December 19, 1991, Pezzarossi was summoned to the emergency room for a code blue (a child undergoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation) involving Mathew. Mathew was unable to breathe on his own and died the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">\u00b619 Pezzarossi feared that Susan exhibited the symptoms of MSBP<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and consulted with specialists about the situation. The Montana Department of Family Services removed Wesley from the Hocevar home on May 22, 1992, the day he was released from the hospital following the overdose. Wesley was place in a foster home for several weeks and then lived with Mathew, Sr.\u2019s parents. After an investigation, Wesley was returned to Susan and Mathew, Sr. in November 1993. Susan gave birth to a girl, Chelsea, in April 1993, who was also placed in a foster home until being returned to Susan and Mathew, Sr. in November 1993. Since then, the Hocevars have become <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>parents to another girl. Susan\u2019s sentence has been stayed pending this appeal, and she continues to reside in Miles City with Mathew, Sr. and their three living children.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">\u00b620 On February 16,1994, Susan was charged by information with commission of the following offenses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-6\">Count I: Attempted Deliberate Homicide, in violation of \u00a7 45-4-103, MCA; or, in the alternative to Count I only;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-7\">Count II: Criminal Endangerment, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-207, MCA;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUz\">Count III: Assault, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-201(l)(a) and (3), MCA;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABd\">Count IV: Deliberate Homicide, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-102(l)(b), MCA; or, in the alternative to Counts III and IV only;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-8\">Count V: Deliberate Homicide, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-102(l)(a), MCA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">The Information alleged, with regard to counts I and II, that Susan had provided an overdose of Benadryl to Wesley and, with regard to counts III, IV, and V, that Susan had smothered Mathew.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">\u00b621 The District Court granted Susan\u2019s motion for a change of venue and a jury trial commenced in Billings on April 17, 1995. The court dismissed Count I after the close of the State\u2019s case, finding that there was \u201cinsufficient evidence for the jury to find the essential element of having a purpose to cause Wesley\u2019s death beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d On May 13, 1995, the jury returned a guilty verdict on Count II, but was unable to reach a unanimous verdict on counts III, IV, and V. Susan filed motions for a new trial and to dismiss the remaining counts on double jeopardy grounds. The District Court denied both motions. On January 31, 1997, the District Court issued its sentencing memorandum, committing Susan to the Department of Corrections for ten years. Susan moved for her release pending appeal and the court stayed her sentence pending this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-11\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"Aqz\">Issue 1</p>\n<p id=\"b199-12\">\u00b622 Whether the evidence was sufficient to support Susan\u2019s conviction of the felony offense of criminal endangerment under \u00a7 45-5-207(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-13\">\u00b623 When reviewing whether evidence was sufficient to support a criminal conviction, this Court views the facts in a light most favorable to the prosecution. The standard of review is whether \u201c \u2018any ra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>tional trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Larson </em>(1992), 255 Mont. 451, 456, 843 P.2d 777, 780-81 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">\u00b624 Section 45-5-207, MCA, Montana\u2019s criminal endangerment statute, reads in pertinent part: \u201cA person who knowingly engages in conduct that creates a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another commits the offense of criminal endangerment.\u201d \u201cA person commits the offense of criminal endangerment when he is aware that there is a high probability that his conduct may cause a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another.\u201d <em>State v. Smaage </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 94, 98, 915 P.2d 192, 195 (citing <em>State v. Crisp </em>(1991), 249 Mont. 199, 203, 814 P.2d 981, 983). \u201cSerious bodily injury\u201d is defined as \u201cbodily injury which creates a substantial risk of death or which causes serious permanent disfigurement or protracted loss or impairment of the function or process of any bodily member or organ....\u201d Section 45-2-101(59), MCA. Susan contends that the only applicable statutory definition of \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d is bodily injury that creates a substantial risk of death, but the jury instruction contained the entire statutory definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">\u00b625 Susan argues that her conduct alleged by the State, i.e., making the Benadryl available to Wesley, did not actually create \u201ca substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury.\u201d Under Montana\u2019s criminal endangerment statute, the State did not have to prove that Susan\u2019s conduct actually resulted in bodily injury to Wesley. What the State had to prove was that Susan was aware that there was a high probability that making the Benadryl available to Wesley created a specific result-a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury. A rational jury could have found that Susan\u2019s conduct created both a substantial risk of death and of serious bodily injury based on the evidence the State presented at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">\u00b626 Susan\u2019s reliance on <em>State v. Andrews </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 292, 907 P.2d 967, is misplaced. There, the defendant was charged with aggravated assault, which requires proof that the defendant actually \u201cpurposely or knowingly cause[d] serious bodily injury to another.\u201d Section 45-5-202(1)(a), MCA. Criminal endangerment, on the other hand, does not require that the defendant actually caused death or serious bodily injury, but that the defendant\u2019s conduct created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury. Susan made approximately 250 to 300 milligrams of Benadryl available to Wesley. A lethal dose of Benadryl for a child of Wesley\u2019s size is 480 milligrams. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>The District Court correctly concluded that it was a jury question whether such an overdose poses a substantial risk of death. Evidence that Wesley was actually in danger of dying from the overdose was not required to prove the offense of criminal endangerment.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">\u00b627  Further, a rational jury could have found that Susan\u2019s conduct created a substantial risk of serious bodily injury, defined as \u201cbodily injury which causes serious permanent disfigurement or protracted loss or impairment of the function or process of any bodily member or organ....\u201d Section 45-2-101(59), MCA. Pezzarossi testified that an overdose of Benadryl could lead to seizures. It is irrelevant that Wesley did not actually suffer any seizures. Again, the criminal endangerment statute does not require actual injury, but risk of injury. The evidence presented by the State was sufficient for the jury to convict Susan of criminal endangerment pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-207(1), MCA, under either statutory definition of serious bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">\u00b628  Finally, Susan contends that the State failed to prove that she knowingly made the Benadryl available to Wesley. She speculates that by affirming her conviction, we open the doors to such an expansion of the criminal endangerment statute that gun dealers and pharmacists could subject themselves to criminal liability by making a firearm or medication available to a person, knowing the firearm or medication could cause a substantial risk of death if used in an improper manner. Indeed, a gun dealer would be subject to criminal liability for placing a loaded firearm within reach of a four-year-old child as would a pharmacist for placing medication within reach of a child. However, the criminal liability of a mother who not only places medication in reach of her young child, but next to the medicine she has instructed the child to take is hardly comparable to a gun dealer selling a firearm or a pharmacist selling medication to a legal customer. The State presented sufficient evidence that Susan knowingly made the Benadryl available to Wesley by leaving ten to twelve capsules thereof in an open bottle on the same coffee table that held the medicine Susan instructed Wesley to take.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">\u00b629  Having reviewed the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we conclude that a rational jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Susan knowingly engaged in conduct that created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to Wesley by making the Benadryl available to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>Issue 2</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">\u00b630 Whether the jury was properly instructed on the elements of criminal endangerment.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">\u00b631 We review a district court\u2019s discretionary rulings in a criminal case to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>See State v. Sullivan </em>(1994), 266 Mont. 313, 324, 880 P.2d 829, 836. We give broad discretion to a district court in formulating jury instructions. <em>See State v. Goulet </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 38, 41, 938 P.2d 1330, 1332 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">\u00b632 The instruction given to the jury with regard to the criminal endangerment count read in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-7\">To convict the defendant of criminal endangerment, the State must prove the following elements:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-8\">1. That the defendant engaged in conduct that created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to Wesley Hocevar; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-9\">2. That the defendant acted knowingly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">The court also instructed the jury on the definition of \u201cknowingly\u201d by giving the then-standard Montana instruction setting forth the statutory definition of knowingly. During its deliberations, the jury asked three questions concerning the criminal endangerment instruction: (1) Is making a mistake a criminal offense if it causes a risk? (2) Does knowingly in the charge of Criminal Endangerment mean that the defendant was aware of causing risk? (3) In regard to Criminal Endangerment and Instruction 19, does a person only need to be <em>aware of </em>their actions, or, do they have to be aware that the <em>consequences </em>of their actions constitute a substantial risk?</p>\n<p id=\"b202-11\">\u00b633 At issue in this appeal is the court\u2019s response to questions two and three. The court gave an additional instruction, which the parties agreed upon, in response to the second question and then referred the jury to that instruction in response to the third question. The instruction consisted of the following statement, citing this Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Crisp </em>(1991), 249 Mont. 199, 203, 814 P.2d 981, 983:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-12\">A person commits the offense of criminal endangerment when she is aware of a high degree of probability that her conduct will cause a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-13\">The jury\u2019s questions certainly could have been answered more clearly and emphatically, i.e., that the defendant must be aware of both conduct and risk. However, we find that the jury was properly instructed with regard to the elements of criminal endangerment; specifically, that the defendant had to be aware of her conduct and of the high <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>probability of the risk posed by her conduct. The additional <em>Crisp </em>instruction properly states the law from our decision in <em>State v. Lambert </em>(1996), 280 Mont. 231, 929 P.2d 846, which was decided after the trial. There, we held that the \u201c \u2018knowingly'\u2019 element of criminal endangerment contemplates a defendant\u2019s awareness of the high probability that the conduct in which he is engaging... will cause a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another.\u201d <em>Lambert, </em>280 Mont. at 237, 929 P.2d at 850.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">\u00b634  The District Court did not abuse its discretion in instructing the jury on the elements of criminal endangerment.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Issue 3</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">\u00b635 Whether Susan\u2019s motion for a new trial based on alleged juror misconduct was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">\u00b636 We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for a new trial to determine whether the court abused its discretion. Absent an abuse of discretion, we will affirm a district court\u2019s decision concerning whether or not to grant a motion for a new trial. <em>State v. Walker </em>(1996), 280 Mont. 346, 354, 930 P.2d 60, 64-65 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"Ah5\">\u00b637 During the course of the jury\u2019s deliberations, the District Court received several questions and notes from the jury regarding one of the jurors, Joseph Sullivan (Sullivan). The jury asked, \u201cCan we discredit a juror?\u201d The foreperson sent a note stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-8\">I believe that 11 people sat down at the table Monday ready to deliberate. I believe one person set out to keep us from following the instructions, weighing the evidence, using our collective memory to weigh the evidence, studying the exhibits and deliberating this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">The court received the following note from another juror requesting that the judge meet with the foreperson:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-10\">We have all been working together for the last week. Eleven of us have deliberated fairly and honestly. However, we have one juror who has manipulated the rest of us for 4 days. The eleven of us feel we have been betrayed and not allowed to do \u201cour job\u201d as specified by the court due to the narrow viewpoint of the one individual.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Atq\">\u00b638 Susan filed a motion for a mistrial based upon a breakdown in the deliberative process of the jury, which the court denied. The jury returned a guilty verdict on the criminal endangerment count. When the jurors were subsequently polled, Sullivan stated, \u201cNo, I\u2019ve changed my mind.\u201d The court directed the jurors to retire to the jury room to again consider whether they could reach a unanimous verdict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>on the criminal endangerment count. Shortly thereafter, the jury returned a unanimous verdict of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">\u00b639 Following the trial, Susan moved for a new trial based in part on her contention that juror misconduct had denied her a fair trial. In support, she introduced an affidavit prepared by Sullivan alleging that he had been unaware of the jurors\u2019 notes and their attempt to discredit him. Sullivan further alleged that he would not have changed his mind back to guilty had he been aware of the jurors\u2019 allegations and notes to the judge. The State moved to strike the affidavit pursuant to Rule 606(b), M.R.Evid. The court ordered the affidavit stricken and found no evidence of juror misconduct, with or without the affidavit. The court thus denied Susan\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">\u00b640 Susan claims that the court erred in striking Sullivan\u2019s affidavit and denying her motion for a new trial. Motions for a new trial are governed by \u00a7 46-16-702, MCA, which states in relevant part that \u201cthe court may grant the defendant a new trial if required in the interest of justice.\u201d Rule 606(b) of the Montana Rules of Evidence states in relevant part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-6\">[u]pon an inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment, a juror may not testify as to any matter or statement occurring during the course of the jury\u2019s deliberations or to the effect of anything upon that or any other juror\u2019s mind or emotions as influencing the juror to assent or dissent from the verdict or indictment or concerning the juror\u2019s mental processes in connection therewith. Nor may a juror\u2019s affidavit ... concerning a matter about which the juror would be precluded from testifying be received for these purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1IZ\">As an exception to this rule, a juror may testify or submit an affidavit on matters concerning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-7\">(1) whether extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jury\u2019s attention; or (2) whether any outside influence was brought to bear upon any juror; or (3) whether any juror has been induced to assent to any general or special verdict, or finding on any question submitted to them by the court, by a resort to the determination of chance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">Rule 606(b), M.R.Evid. In striking Sullivan\u2019s affidavit, the court found that the exceptions to Rule 606(b) did not apply, because the notes were part of the jury\u2019s deliberative process. The court found that the jurors acted as they had been instructed: \u201cyou should not talk to your fellow jurors about anything that you feel necessary to bring to the attention of the judge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>\u00b641  The jurors\u2019 notes to the court constituted an entirely internal process and did not introduce an extraneous or outside element into the jury\u2019s deliberative process. The jurors\u2019 notes did not signal a breakdown in the jury\u2019s deliberative process as Susan contends. The jurors had been instructed to bring questions and problems to the judge\u2019s attention. We fail to see how the jurors\u2019 notes could have had any bearing on the issue of Susan\u2019s guilt or innocence. Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the jurors\u2019 notes affected Sullivan\u2019s vote, such testimony is prohibited by Rule 606(b), M.E.Evid., and the District Court properly struck Sullivan\u2019s affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">\u00b642  The District Court did not abuse its discretion in striking the affidavit and denying Susan\u2019s motion for a new trial based on alleged juror misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Issue 4</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">\u00b643 Whether the videotapes of interviews with Wesley Hocevar should have been admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">\u00b644 In regard to evidentiary matters, it is within the district court\u2019s discretion to determine whether or not evidence is relevant and admissible. <em>See State v.

At trial, the State did not call Wesley as a witness or attempt to introduce the videotapes. Susan sought to introduce these videotapes during the defense\u2019s case-in-chief. The District Court ruled that the videotapes were not admissible under any exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">\u00b646 Susan contends that the videotapes of interviews with Wesley should have been admitted into evidence under one of three exceptions to the hearsay rule: present sense impression, recorded recollection, or other exceptions. Under Rule 803, M.E.Evid., the following, among others, are not excluded by the hearsay rule even though the declarant is available as a witness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-12\">(1) Present sense impression. A statement describing or explaining an event or condition made while the declarant was perceiving the event or condition, or immediately thereafter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>(5) Recorded recollection. A memorandum or record concerning a matter about which a witness once had knowledge but now has insufficient recollection to enable the witness to testify fully and accurately, shown to have been made or adopted by the witness when the matter was fresh in the witness\u2019 memory and to reflect that knowledge correctly. If admitted, the memorandum or record may be read into evidence but may not itself be received as an exhibit unless offered by an adverse party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-4\">(24) Other exceptions. A statement not specifically covered by any of the foregoing exceptions but having comparable circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">\u00b647 The present sense impression exception to the hearsay rule applies to out-of-court statements that describe or explain an event or condition \u201cmade while the declarant was perceiving the event or condition, or immediately thereafter,\u201d and is thus inapplicable in this case. The timing element assures the trustworthiness of present sense impressions in two ways: it reduces the likelihood of faulty recollection and precludes time for reflection. <em>See, e.g., </em>Christopher B. Mueller and Laird C. Kirkpatrick, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 8.34 (1995). Although we recognize that there could be a slight time lag between an event and the declarant\u2019s description of that event, the declarant\u2019s statement must nonetheless reflect a present sense impression rather than a description of events that were observed in the past. Absent contemporaneousness or near-contemporaneousness of event and statement, the inherent trustworthiness of a present sense impression is negated. In <em>State v. Newman </em>(1973), 162 Mont. 450, 457, 513 P.2d 258, 262, which was decided prior to the adoption of the Montana Rules of Evidence but is nonetheless instructive on the timing element of Rule 803(1), M.R.Evid., we held that a statement in reference to an event that occurred the previous evening was not a present sense impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">\u00b648  The videotaped interviews with Wesley were conducted five and twelve days after Wesley\u2019s Benadryl overdose. At the time of the interviews, Wesley was not describing the overdose as he was perceiving it nor immediately thereafter. Because the timing element is not satisfied, Wesley\u2019s statements to Stabio five and twelve days after the overdose cannot be considered trustworthy pursuant to the present sense impression exception. Enough time had passed that Wesley\u2019s recollection of the events could have become faulty. Wesley also had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>ample time for reflection during which he could have falsified or distorted the events surrounding his overdose. The admission of the videotaped interviews was properly denied under the present sense impression exception because its timing element was not satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">\u00b649  In order to admit evidence pursuant to the recorded recollection exception, the party seeking to introduce such evidence must establish certain foundational requirements. By its terms, Rule 803(5), M.R.Evid., requires the declarant to be a witness and requires that the witness \u201chas insufficient recollection to enable the witness to testify fully and accurately.\u201d Wesley was not a witness at trial and Susan made no showing that Wesley had insufficient recollection of the overdose. The court noted that \u201c[t]he Defendant did not demonstrate, or even make a proffer, that Mathew could not recollect or communicate regarding the subject matter of the videotape,\u201d and held that the recorded recollection exception did not apply. The admission of the videotaped interviews was properly denied under the recorded recollection exception because its basic foundational requirement was not satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">\u00b650 Susan finally argues that the videotapes should have been admitted pursuant the residual exception of Rule 803, which excepts from hearsay statements \u201cnot specifically covered by any of the foregoing exceptions but having comparable circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d Rule 803(24), M.R.Evid. The residual exception \u201clook[s] to the circumstances surrounding a hearsay statement when it is made-the \u2018circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness\u2019 that lend reliability to the hearsay statement in lieu of cross-examination.\u201d <em>State v. J.C.E. </em>(1988), 235 Mont. 264, 272, 767 P.2d 309, 314. \u201cEverything that bears on the credibility of the speaker and the accuracy of his statement counts....\u201d Christopher B. Mueller and Laird C. Kirkpatrick, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 8.65 (1995). We have held that the residual exceptions \u201cshould be used sparingly, and only in exceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>State v. Brown </em>(1988), 231 Mont. 334, 338, 752 P.2d 204, 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">\u00b651  Here, the District Court reviewed the videotapes and found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-7\">Mr. Stabio and Wesley did not communicate very well. There is a lot of inconsistencies, a lot of difficulty with times, staying focused on what Mr. Stabio wanted to say, and the Court cannot say that even at that time from that, that Wesley was a competent witness at that time. It just seems to me that he, initially, at the first inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>view, he was saying his mother told him-at first he said no, she didn\u2019t tell him to take them. He took them because he wanted to take them. And then she did tell him to take them. And then there was, how many were there? There were this many. And that means ten or five?

District courts are \u201c \u2018vested with <em>great </em>latitude in ruling on the admissibility of expert testimony.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Southern, </em>1999 MT 94, \u00b6 48, 294 Mont. 225, \u00b6 48, 980 P.2d 3, \u00b6 48 (citations omitted). Absent a showing of an abuse of discretion, we will not overturn a district court\u2019s determinations on evidentiary matters. <em>See Beavers, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">\u00b655 Susan challenged the admissibility of the MSBP expert testimony prior to trial. The District Court preliminarily ruled that the testimony would be admissible and that the jury was entitled to receive and weigh such evidence. The court noted that a further hearing outside of the presence of the jury might be necessary. The court conducted the hearing prior to the testimony of one of the State\u2019s expert witnesses, Dr. Randall Alexander, a Professor of Pediatrics. Alexander presented his prospective testimony. The court found that the foundational requirement for admission of MSBP testimony had been satisfied and allowed the State to present Alexander\u2019s testimony regarding MSBP to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">\u00b656 Although both parties have framed their argument with regard to the admissibility of the MSBP expert testimony around the <em>Daubert </em>standard, that standard is inapplicable because it only applies to the admissibility of novel scientific evidence. <em>See, e.g., Gilkey v. Schweitzer, </em>1999 MT 188, \u00b6 18, 295 Mont. 345, \u00b6 18, 983 P.2d 869, \u00b6 18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>(citations omitted). The expert testimony regarding MSBP is neither novel nor scientific. The term \u201cMunchausen Syndrome By Proxy\u201d has appeared in medical literature since at least 1977. <em>Cf. State v. Southern, </em>1999 MT 94, \u00b6 59, 294 Mont. 225, \u00b6 59, 980 P.2d 3, \u00b6 59 (holding that microscopic hair comparison evidence was not novel because the Court had considered several cases since 1978 and because comparing hair samples with a microscope had been done for decades and therefore <em>Daubert </em>standards were not applicable to determine its admissibility). While this Court has not previously addressed the admissibility of MSBP evidence, other courts have considered such evidence since 1981. <em>See California v. Phillips </em>(1981), 175 Cal.Rptr. 703. A Westlaw search reveals that the term \u201cMunchausen Syndrome By Proxy\u201d has appeared in over forty state and federal cases since then. Thus testimony regarding MSBP is not novel to the field of pediatrics or law.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">\u00b657 Further, Alexander referred to MSBP as a form of child abuse in the field of pediatrics, not a psychiatric disorder, and his testimony on MSBP is therefore not scientific evidence subject to <em>Daubert </em>standards. <em>Cf Gilkey, </em>\u00b6 20 (holding that a physician\u2019s expert opinion on informed consent constitutes specialized knowledge of a medical professional, not novel scientific evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">\u00b658 Instead, we analyze the admissibility of the MSBP expert testimony under a conventional Rule 702 analysis. Rule 702 of the Montana Rules of Evidence, identical to its federal counterpart, states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-6\">If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">Under such an analysis, a court must, before admitting expert testimony, determine (1) whether the subject matter requires expert testimony and (2) whether the putative expert has either special training or education and has adequate knowledge on which to base an opinion. <em>Southern, </em>\u00b6 60. Regarding the first prong, we have held that \u201c \u2018[e]xpert testimony is required in areas not within the range of ordinary training or intelligence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hulse v. State, </em>1998 MT 108, \u00b6 48, 289 Mont. 1, \u00b6 48, 961 P.2d 75, \u00b6 48 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">\u00b659  We hold that testimony about MSBP is beyond the range of ordinary training or intelligence and is therefore a subject matter re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>quiring expert testimony. \u201c[T]he dynamics of child abuse and specifically MSBP are generally not within the knowledge of the average juror.\u201d Lynn Holland Goldman &amp; Beatrice Crofts Yorker, <em>Mommie </em>Dearest? <em>Prosecuting Cases of Munchausen Syndrome By Proxy, </em>13 WTR Crim. Just. 2629 (1999). <em>Cf.

The record shows that the State sufficiently established Alexander\u2019s medical training and experience, specifically his experience with MSBP. As a Professor of Pediatrics, Alexander had written and taught on the subject. The State also established that Alexander had adequate knowledge about the Hocevar family situation on which to base his diagnosis of MSBP. Alexander testified that he was given the medical records on all the Hocevar children and a variety of investigative statements as well as some information on Susan.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">\u00b661 The District Court did not abuse its discretion in admitting expert testimony regarding MSBP into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">Issue 6</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">\u00b662 Whether Susan\u2019s motion to sever counts I and II and counts III, IV, and V for separate trials was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">\u00b663  In determining whether to grant a motion to sever, the trial court must balance the possibility of prejudice to the defendant against the judicial economy which results from a joint trial. Judicial economy weighs heavily in the balancing process. This balancing process is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge and absent an abuse of that discretion, we will not substitute our judgment for that of the trial court. The burden of showing prejudice rests on the defendant. In showing prejudice, it is not sufficient that the defendant prove some prejudice or that a better chance of acquittal exists if separate trials are held. Rather, the defendant must show the prejudice was so great as to prevent a fair trial. <em>State v. Richards </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 180, 188, 906 P.2d 222, 226-27 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>\u00b664 The District Court denied Susan\u2019s pretrial motion to sever the first two counts of the Information, which concerned Wesley\u2019s Benadryl overdose, from the last three counts, which concerned Mathew\u2019s death. Susan also cited the court\u2019s failure to grant the severance in support of her motion for a new trial. The court reaffirmed its holding in favor of joinder, holding that the counts related to Wesley\u2019s overdose and the counts related to Mathew\u2019s death were \u201csimilar in nature and much of the proof, which includes many out-of-state professional witnesses, would apply to all counts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">\u00b665 Section 46-11-404(1), MCA, states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-5\">Two or more offenses or different statements of the same offense may be charged in the same charging document in a separate count, or alternatively, if the offenses charged, whether felonies or misdemeanors or both, are of the same or similar character or are based on the same transactions connected together or constituting parts of a common scheme or plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Section 46-13-211(1), MCA, states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-7\">If it appears that a defendant ... is prejudiced by a joinder of charges ... in an ... information ... or by a joinder for trial together, the court may order separate trials ... or provide whatever relief justice requires.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">Susan contends that the joinder of counts I and II and counts III, IV, and V was improper pursuant to \u00a7 46-11-404(1), MCA, and prejudicial pursuant to \u00a7 46-13-211(1), MCA. Susan links this issue with her double jeopardy claim; however, we address the double jeopardy claim separately in our analysis of Issue 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">\u00b666 Susan contends that the joinder of the two sets of charges was improper under \u00a7 46-11-404(1), MCA, because they involve separate incidents: Wesley\u2019s May 1992 overdose, which resulted in the alternate charges of attempted deliberate homicide and criminal endangerment, and Mathew\u2019s 1991 death, which resulted in the alternate charges of assault, felony murder and deliberate homicide. She argues that Wesley\u2019s overdose and Mathew\u2019s death were dissimilar in victims, dates, and methods of commission, and were not part of a common scheme or plan. In responding to this argument in District Court, the State argued that joinder was proper because in both instances Susan injured or killed her children in an attempt to draw attention to herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">\u00b667  In Southern, \u00b6 23, we held that joinder is proper \u201cin cases in which the charges are logically linked by motive and where overlap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>ping proof must be offered.\u201d Here, the State, under its MSBP theory, alleged that Wesley\u2019s overdose and Mathew\u2019s death were linked by Susan\u2019s motive of drawing attention to herself by injuring or killing her children. The expert testimony on the subject of MSBP concerned all counts of the Information. Joinder of the charges resulting from Wesley\u2019s overdose and Mathew\u2019s death was proper pursuant to \u00a7 46-11-404(1), MCA, because the offenses were logically linked by the MSBP motive and the proof regarding all the charges overlapped. \u00b668 Having decided that joinder was proper, we turn to the question whether joinder of the charges resulted in unfair prejudice to Susan pursuant to \u00a7 46-13-211(1), MCA. We have held that three types of prejudice may result from the joinder of charges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-4\">First, a jury may consider the criminal defendant facing multiple charges a \u201cbad man\u201d and accumulate evidence until it finds him guilty of something. Second, a jury may use proof of guilt on one count to convict the defendant of a second count even though the proof would be inadmissible at a separate trial on the second count. Third, prejudice may occur when the defendant wishes to testify on his or her own behalf on one charge but not another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-5\"><em>State v. Martin </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 185, 192, 926 P.2d 1380, 1385 (citations omitted). Susan contends that the first and second types of prejudice resulted from the joinder of the charges against her. The State contends that Susan failed to meet her burden of establishing any of the three types of prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">\u00b669 Susan argues that the joinder of charges prejudiced her by portraying her as a \u201cbad person.\u201d She contends that the cumulative effect of the evidence presented during the three-week trial resulted in the jury wanting to find her guilty of something, even if they could not convict her of deliberate homicide. The State contends that Susan did not establish the first type of prejudice, relying on our holding in <em>Martin </em>that \u201ca bald assertion that the multiple charges and overlapping evidence \u2018invited\u2019 the jury to convict him is insufficient to meet his burden of demonstrating the existence of this first type of prejudice.\u201d 279 Mont. at 192, 926 P.2d at 1385. That holding is not quite applicable here. Albeit not in great detail, Susan does more than \u201cbaldly assert\u201d that the joinder of charges prejudiced her. She contends that during the long trial, the State attempted to portray her as a bad person and that the jury may have convicted her of \u201csomething\u201d in order to protect Wesley and Chelsea from further harm. Although Susan\u2019s claim of prejudice of the first type may be plausible, this type of preju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>dice alone is not sufficient to warrant severance. <em>See State v. Richards </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 180, 189, 906 P.2d 222, 227. <em>See also State v. Campbell </em>(1980), 189 Mont. 107, 121-22, 615 P.2d 190, 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">\u00b670 We turn to the second type of prejudice claimed by Susan, that the jury used proof of guilt on one count to convict her of another count, even though the proof would have been inadmissible at a separate trial. Susan\u2019s main contention with respect to this type of prejudice is that the evidence presented at her trial was not simple and direct, as in <em>State v. Campbell </em>(1980), 189 Mont. 107, 615 P.2d 190. In <em>Campbell, </em>we relied on the \u201crationale that when the charges are few and the evidence straightforward, there is no reason to assume the jury was confused and could not keep the relevant evidence separate.\u201d <em>Campbell, </em>189 Mont. at 122, 615 P.2d at 199. The State concedes that the evidence against Susan was complex and largely circumstantial, but argues that Susan failed to make the required showing under the second type of prejudice that proof on the first charge would have been inadmissible at a separate trial on the second charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">\u00b671 A review of the record reveals that Susan failed to satisfy the threshold requirement for showing this type of prejudice-that the proof regarding Mathew\u2019s death would have been inadmissible at a separate trial on charges regarding Wesley\u2019s overdose. Without deciding whether such evidence would have been admissible at a separate trial, we therefore hold that Susan has failed to meet her burden of showing prejudice of the second type.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">\u00b672 In attempting to sever the charges against her, it was Susan\u2019s burden to establish that prejudice resulted from the joinder. <em>See Martin, </em>279 Mont. at 197, 926 P.2d at 1388. We conclude that Susan has failed to establish the existence of the first and the second types of prejudice resulting from joinder of the charges against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">\u00b673 Moreover, joinder in this case promoted judicial economy, which weighs heavily in the District Court\u2019s balancing process in determining whether to grant a motion to sever. <em>See Martin, </em>279 Mont, at 197, 926 P.2d at 1388. The District Court noted that many of the expert witnesses at the three-week trial came from out-of-state and their attendance and testimony at a separate trial would have required additional time and inconvenience for them as well as the expenditure of considerable additional resources by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">\u00b674 Joinder of the charges against Susan was proper and did not result in prejudice.

The determination of \u201cgood cause\u201d for departing from the usual order of trial and permitting the State to reopen its case-in-chief is left to the sound discretion of the district court. <em>See State v.

She argued that Southall\u2019s testimony should be limited to an interpretation of the apnea monitor recordings. The District Court ruled that Southall would be permitted to testify regarding any matters to which the defense experts testified, but that his testimony should be limited to matters of record at that time or matters contained within the medical records to which the defense experts referred. The court further ruled that, to the extent Southall\u2019s testimony might exceed the scope of rebuttal, it would be allowed pursuant to \u00a7 46-16-401(3), MCA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">\u00b678 In her motion for a new trial, Susan asked the District Court to reconsider this ruling and the court held that Susan was neither surprised nor prejudiced by its allowing Southall\u2019s rebuttal testimony. The court noted that it allowed Southall\u2019s testimony in response to the defense\u2019s expert witnesses. In the alternative, it allowed Southall\u2019s testimony as part of the State\u2019s case-in-chief. The court noted that the State had given notice that Southall, who had to travel from the U.K., would not be available early in the trial and that the court had indicated that the defense would be allowed to call other witnesses to address the issues brought up by Southall\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>\u00b679 Susan alleges that Southall\u2019s rebuttal testimony should have been excluded on the bases that it constituted unfair surprise and that it was not based on a \u201cnew matter\u201d first raised by the defense, but on primary allegations raised by the State in its case-in-chief. While portions of Southall\u2019s testimony may have been outside the proper scope of rebuttal testimony, the District Court specifically noted that \u201cto the extent that [Southall\u2019s testimony] might exceed the scope of rebuttal, that would be due to the inability to get Doctor Southall here earlier. The Court will allow that under 46-16-401(3).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">\u00b680 Susan contends that no good cause existed to allow the prosecution to offer evidence upon its original case pursuant to \u00a7 46-16-402, MCA. She states that Southall was not contacted by the State until approximately a week or two prior to the trial, and defense counsel was first notified approximately ten to fourteen days before the trial that Southall may be called as a witness. Susan argues that the State offered no explanation as to why Southall was not contacted earlier and that therefore Southall\u2019s unavailability during the State\u2019s case-in-chief was attributable to the State\u2019s lack of diligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">\u00b681 The District Court, in exercising its sound discretion whether to depart from the usual order of trial and permit the State to reopen its case-in-chief, concluded that \u201c[t]he State had given notice early that Dr. Southall, who had to travel from England, would not be available early in the trial. The Court indicated early on that it would allow Dr. Southall\u2019s testimony and allowed the defense to call other witnesses to address the issues brought up by Dr. Southall.\u201d Susan\u2019s contention that no good cause existed to depart from the usual order of trial is not supported by the record. In <em>State v. White </em>(1980), 185 Mont. 213, 217, 605 P.2d 191, 193, this Court found good cause to depart from the usual order of trial when the State had difficulty in locating the witness, even though that difficulty may have been caused in part by the State\u2019s failure to subpoena the witness prior to trial. There, we held that good cause existed because the State kept the trial court and the defendant informed of its difficulty in locating the witness and of its intention to call the witness when he was located. We also noted that, in permitting the State to reopen its case, the trial court gave the defendant full opportunity to rebut the witness\u2019 testimony. <em>White, </em>185 Mont. at 217, 605 P.2d at 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">\u00b682 Likewise here, even if Southall\u2019s unavailability early in the trial may be in part attributable to the State not contacting him earlier, the State kept the trial court and the defendant informed that Southall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>would not be available until the end of the trial. The trial court informed Susan early on that it would allow Southall\u2019s testimony and that it would allow the defense to call other witnesses to address the issues brought up by Southall\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">\u00b683 The District Court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Southall\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Issue 8</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">\u00b684 Whether evidence concerning Zachary Hocevar\u2019s death was properly admitted pursuant to Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">\u00b685 A district court has broad discretion to determine whether other crimes, wrongs or acts evidence is relevant and admissible under Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid. <em>See State v. Henderson </em>(1996), 278 Mont. 376, 379-80, 925 P.2d 475, 477-78. Absent a showing of an abuse of discretion, we will not overturn a district court\u2019s determinations on evi-dentiary matters. <em>See Beavers, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">\u00b686 The State gave pretrial notice of its intent to introduce evidence of Zachary\u2019s death pursuant to Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid., for the purposes of proving:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-9\">(1) that Susan engaged in a common plan or modus operandi pursuant to which she unlawfully caused the deaths of Zachary and Mathew;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-10\">(2) that the death of Mathew and the poisoning of Wesley were neither natural nor accidental; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-11\">(3) that Susan\u2019s affliction with MSBP gave her motive to smother Mathew.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-12\">Susan filed a motion <em>in limine </em>to prohibit the State from introducing this other crimes, wrongs or acts evidence. The District Court denied the motion following a hearing. Susan renewed her objection to this evidence in her motion for a new trial. In denying the motion, the District Court held that Zachary\u2019s and Wesley\u2019s medical histories bore remarkable similarities regarding the phenomenon of MSBP and that Zachary\u2019s death was thus admissible to show motive and absence of any other cause pursuant to Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid., and <em>State v. Matt </em>(1991), 249 Mont. 136, 814 P.2d 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-13\">\u00b687 Susan argues that, contrary to the State\u2019s Notice, the evidence of Zachary\u2019s death was not intended to prove common plan or modus operandi, but to show Susan\u2019s \u201ccharacter,\u201d i.e., MSBP, and that she acted in conformity with that character. Susan asserts that the State used the evidence of Zachary\u2019s death to show that she suffered from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>MSBP and then used MSBP as the common plan or motive for her actions against Mathew and Wesley.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">\u00b688 Susan analogizes the introduction of evidence of Zachary\u2019s death to a situation where the State seeks to introduce evidence of past burglaries to show a that defendant charged with burglary is a kleptomaniac and acted in conformity with that diagnosis. We agree with the State that this analogy is not apt. As the District Court noted in allowing the MSBP evidence, MSBP is not a psychiatric diagnosis of a mental disorder, such as kleptomania. Rather, MSBP is a pediatric diagnosis of a form of child abuse, where the \u201cdisorder\u201d consists of the behavior of the person suffering from it. Unlike in the case of a mental disorder, there is no distinction between the disorder and the behavior associated with that disorder. As such, MSBP does not describe Susan\u2019s character, but her behavior toward her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">\u00b689 The Modified <em>Just </em>Rule guides the District Court\u2019s discretion in admitting other crimes, wrongs or acts evidence under Rules 404(b) and 403, M.R.Evid.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-6\">(1) The other crimes, wrongs or acts must be similar.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-7\">(2) The other crimes, wrongs or acts must not be remote in time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-8\">(3) The evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity with such character; but may be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-9\">(4) Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, misleading of the jury, considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-10\"><em>Matt, </em>249 Mont. at 142, 814 P.2d at 56. Applying the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule to the evidence of Zachary\u2019s death, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"AvT\">\u00b690 We limit our discussion to the third and fourth requirements of the Modified <em>Just </em>rule. Susan does not raise the second requirement in her briefs and cites no legal authority in support of her argument that Zachary\u2019s death was not similar to Wesley\u2019s overdose. Because Susan cites to no authority as required by Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P., and recognizing that she bears the burden of establishing error by the trial court <em>(see Duck Inn, Inc. v. Montana State Univ.-Northern </em>(1997), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>285 Mont. 519, 523, 949 P.2d 1179, 1181), we decline to address her argument regarding the first requirement of the Modified <em>Just </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"Abn\">\u00b691 The evidence of Zachary\u2019s death was introduced to show motive and not, as Susan contends, that she acted in conformity with her character-MSBP-in causing Mathew\u2019s death and Wesley\u2019s overdose. The evidence was thus properly admitted under the third requirement of the Modified <em>Just </em>rule because it was introduced to establish MSBP as Susan\u2019s motive for smothering Mathew and poisoning Wesley, not to establish MSBP as Susan\u2019s character and that she acted in conformity therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">\u00b692 Finally, Susan argues that the evidence of Zachary\u2019s death was inadmissible under the fourth requirement because its probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, misleading the jury, considerations of undue delay, and waste of time. With regard to counts I and II, concerning Wesley\u2019s overdose, Susan contends that the evidence of Zachary\u2019s death caused undue prejudice and that, because Alexander did not testify with certainty that Wesley\u2019s overdose was consistent with MSBP, the evidence only served to mislead the jury, cause undue delay, waste of time, and confusion of the issues. With regard to counts III, TV, and V, concerning Mathew\u2019s death, Susan contends that the evidence of Zachary\u2019s death caused undue prejudice because the State wanted the jury to be aware that two of the Hocevar children had died, leaving them to question how this could happen absent some wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">\u00b693  This Court has previously recognized that other crimes evidence will inevitably have some prejudicial effect on a defendant. <em>See State v. Anderson </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 344, 349, 912 P.2d 801, 804 (citing <em>State v. Brooks </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 79, 84, 857 P.2d 734, 737). The evidence of Zachary\u2019s death had great probative weight because it tended to establish the diagnosis of MSBP, which the State alleged as Susan\u2019s motive for smothering Mathew and poisoning Wesley. While it is possible that the jury could have viewed the deaths of two Hocevar children with suspicion, such inevitable prejudice does not rise to the level of outweighing the probative weight of the evidence of Zachary\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">\u00b694 The District Court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence of Zachary\u2019s death pursuant to Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>Issue 9</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">\u00b695 Whether considering the deaths of Mathew and Zachary-Hocevar in determining Susan\u2019s sentence for criminal endangerment violated Susan\u2019s right to due process under Article II, Section 17 of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">\u00b696 Our review of questions of constitutional law is plenary. <em>See State v. Anderson, </em>1998 MT 258, \u00b6 6, 291 Mont. 242, \u00b6 6, 967 P.2d 413, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">\u00b697 In the State\u2019s Supplemental Authority to its Sentencing Memorandum, it argued that the District Court should consider Mathew\u2019s death in sentencing Susan. Susan argued that it would be inappropriate to consider Mathew\u2019s death, which had been charged but resulted in a hung jury. The District Court determined that it should consider all relevant testimony in sentencing Susan, including testimony regarding the deaths of Mathew and Zachary. The court found that, \u201c[b]ased on the preponderance of the evidence,... Susan Hocevar exemplifies Munchausen\u2019s Syndrome By Proxy and suffocated Zachary Hocevar and Mathew Hocevar, Jr., and that the benadryl overdose may also be a manifestation of the syndrome.\u201d The court noted that \u201c[a]lthough the Court will consider such conduct [Mathew\u2019s and Zachary\u2019s deaths], the Court\u2019s finding does not constitute a conviction of such other offenses and the sentence the court imposes in this case is a sentence only for the Criminal Endangerment charge and not for the other offenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">\u00b698  We hold that considering the deaths of Zachary and Mathew in sentencing violated Susan\u2019s right to due process under Article II, Section 17 of the Montana Constitution- specifically the due process guarantee against having her sentence predicated on misinformation-and we therefore do not reach the issue whether considering Zachary\u2019s and Mathew\u2019s deaths in sentencing violated Montana\u2019s double jeopardy clause. We farther do not reach the issue whether <em>United States v. Watts </em>(1997), 519 U.S. 1144, 117 S.Ct. 633, 136 L.Ed.2d 554, or other federal cases may be applicable precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">\u00b699 We take notice of our decision in <em>State v. Anderson, </em>1998 MT 258, 291 Mont. 242, 967 P.2d 413, which we decided subsequent to the filing of the briefs in this case. There, we held that the double jeopardy clause of the United States Constitution did not bar prosecution of a DUI charge that had previously been considered in sentencing on a separate conviction. In <em>Anderson, </em>we did not consider a due process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>challenge, but decided the issue solely pursuant to the double jeopardy clause of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">\u00b6100 We have previously held that a convicted defendant \u201c \u2018has a due process guarantee against a sentence predicated on misinformation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bauer v. State, </em>1999 MT 185, \u00b6 21, 295 Mont. 306, \u00b6 21, 983 P.2d 955, \u00b6 21 (citing <em>State v. Orsborn </em>(1976), 170 Mont. 480, 486, 555 P.2d 509, 513). To help assure that the sentencing court does not rely on misinformation, the defendant has an affirmative duty to present evidence showing the inaccuracies contained in the presentence investigation report. <em>See State v. McPherson </em>(1989), 236 Mont. 484, 490, 771 P.2d 120, 124 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">\u00b6101 In <em>Orsborn, </em>which we cited with approval in <em>Bauer, </em>we held that a sentencing judge could rely on facts outside of the presentence report in determining defendant\u2019s sentence, provided that the defendant was given an opportunity to explain or rebut that information at the presentence hearing. We held there that the sentencing judge had averted any danger of relying on misinformation in sentencing and due process had not been offended by admitting information outside of the presentence report because (1) the defendant was represented by counsel at the time the sentencing information was made known to him; (2) the defendant was provided an opportunity to rebut that information; and (3) the defendant, rather than rebutting the information, chose to affirm its accuracy. <em>See Orsborn, </em>170 Mont. at 486, 555 P.2d at 513 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">\u00b6102 In <em>State v. Baldwin </em>(1981), 192 Mont. 521, 524, 629 P.2d 222, 224, we held that the sentencing court could consider the underlying facts of a previous charge of which the defendant had been acquitted. While we held that considering acquitted conduct did not offend the double jeopardy clause, we pointed out that \u201c[a] defendant is entitled to have his sentence predicated on substantially correct information.\u201d <em>Baldwin, </em>192 Mont. at 524, 629 P.2d at 224 (citations omitted). There, the sentencing judge relied on information in the presentence investigation report, which contained the defendant\u2019s volunteered version of the underlying facts of his previous acquittal. <em>Baldwin, </em>192 Mont. at 524, 629 P.2d at 224. The defendant did not challenge the accuracy of the information at the sentencing hearing. <em>Baldwin, </em>192 Mont. at 525, 629 P.2d at 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">\u00b6103  Here, the District Court denied Susan due process by finding by a preponderance of the evidence that she smothered Zachary and Mathew without affording her an opportunity procedur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>ally-during the sentencing phase-to challenge the accuracy of this information, which was not contained in the presentence investigation report. The presentence investigation report makes no mention of including Zachary\u2019s and Mathew\u2019s deaths in determining Susan\u2019s sentence; thus denying Susan the opportunity to challenge the information at the sentencing stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">\u00b6 104 Mathew\u2019s death was charged and tried with the charges relating to Wesley\u2019s overdose. The charges relating to Mathew\u2019s death, however, resulted in a hung jury. Although evidence as to Zachary\u2019s death was admitted during the guilt phase of the trial pursuant to Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid., the State did not attempt to prove that Susan smothered Zachary under any burden of proof. Thus Susan\u2019s effort at the trial was to raise a reasonable doubt in regard to her guilt for Wesley\u2019s overdose and Mathew\u2019s death. The facts regarding Mathew\u2019s and Zachary\u2019s deaths were highly disputed (as evidenced by the jury\u2019s inability to reach a verdict on counts III, IV, and V) and the District Court, in order to avoid relying on misinformation in sentencing Susan based on information outside of the presentence investigation report, owed Susan the procedural opportunity to explain or rebut this information during the sentencing stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">\u00b6105 We hold that the District Court denied Susan due process in considering Zachary\u2019s and Mathew\u2019s deaths without giving her the opportunity to explain or rebut this information during the sentencing phase of the trial. We reverse on this issue and remand for resentencing consistent herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Issue 10</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">\u00b6106 Whether Susan should have been classified a first-time, nonviolent felony offender for sentencing purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">\u00b6107 The District Court\u2019s refusal to classify Susan as a first-time nonviolent felony offender involves a question of statutory interpretation. We review a district court\u2019s interpretation of the law, including questions of statutory interpretation, to determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation is correct. <em>See State v. Montoya, </em>1999 MT 180, \u00b6 16, 295 Mont. 288, \u00b6 16, 983 P.2d 937, \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">\u00b6108 In her Sentencing Memorandum, Susan argued that she should be treated as a first-time, nonviolent offender for sentencing purposes. In its Sentencing Memorandum, the District Court found that \u201cSusan Hocevar committed a violent offense inasmuch as she caused serious bodily injury by causing a substantial risk of death. She is not entitled to be treated as a first-time, non-violent offender.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>\u00b6109  We agree with Susan that the District Court erred in refusing to classify her as a first-time, nonviolent felony offender and sentencing her in accordance with the criteria for sentencing nonviolent felony offenders set forth in \u00a7 46-18-225, MCA. Section 46-18-104(3), MCA, defines \u201cnonviolent felony offender\u201d as \u201ca person ... who has been convicted of a felony offense other than a crime of violence.\u201d The only relevant definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is \u201ca crime in which the offender causes a serious bodily injury or death to a person other than himself.\u201d Section 46-18-104(2)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">\u00b6110 Susan was convicted of criminal endangerment. As set forth under the discussion of Issue 1, to convict Susan of criminal endangerment, the jury had to find that Susan\u2019s conduct created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury. In contrast, \u00a7 46-18-104(2)(b), MCA, requires that an offender actually cause a serious bodily injury or death.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">\u00b6111 In our discussion of Issue 1, we concluded that a rational jury could have found that Susan\u2019s conduct created both a substantial risk of death and a substantial risk of bodily injury. There, we did not agree with Susan\u2019s contention that the only applicable definition of \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d was bodily injury that creates a substantial risk of death, but that \u201cbodily injury which causes serious permanent disfigurement or protracted loss or impairment of the function or process of any bodily member or organ\u201d was also an applicable definition. While the jury could have convicted Susan under either statutory definition of \u201cserious bodily injury,\u201d we have no way of knowing on which definition the jury relied.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">\u00b6112  In conclusion, a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is a crime in which the offender causes a serious bodily injury. Given the various options that were given to the jury, we cannot tell from the jury\u2019s verdict whether it found that Susan actually caused a \u201csubstantial risk of death\u201d or whether she merely caused the risk of \u201cserious permanent disfigurement or protracted loss or impairment of the function or process of any bodily member or organ.\u201d In light of the uncertainty inherent in the definitions and the verdict, the District Court erred in concluding that Susan had committed a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">\u00b6113 We hold that the District Court erred in refusing to classify Susan a first-time, nonviolent felony offender for sentencing purposes.

She maintains that the court should have ordered a directed verdict of acquittal on the charges relating to Mathew\u2019s death and that such a verdict would bar further prosecution as to those counts. The State argues that the court did not abuse its discretion in denying Susan\u2019s motion because, as the District Court noted in denying the motion, the court had already considered and ruled against Susan\u2019s insufficiency of the evidence claim several times and did not see a reason to reverse its rulings at that juncture.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">\u00b6 118 A district court should grant a motion for directed verdict of acquittal only when there is no evidence whatsoever to support a guilty verdict. <em>State v. Campbell </em>(1996), 278 Mont. 236, 246, 924 P.2d 1304, 1310-11 (citation omitted). A defendant is entitled to an acquittal <em>\u201c </em>\u2018if reasonable men could not conclude from the evidence taken in a light most favorable to the prosecution that guilt has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019\" <em>State v. Bromgard </em>(1993), 261 Mont. 291, 293, 862 P.2d 1140, 1141 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">\u00b6119 Here, although Susan points to testimony suggesting a contrary finding and notes that she challenged the admissibility of some of this evidence, she acknowledges in her Brief that some of the evidence presented at trial supported the State\u2019s theory that Susan smothered Mathew. Dr. Gary Dale testified that in his opinion the cause of Mathew\u2019s death was smothering. Further, our review of the transcript shows that Dale based his conclusion \u201con a comprehensive review of all the records, the interviews, a very large amount of data.\u201d Southall testified that \u201cit is my opinion that [Mathew] was suffocated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>by his mother.\u201d The fact that there is conflicting evidence in the record does not require that the court grant Susan\u2019s motion for a directed verdict of acquittal. The weight and credibility of witnesses are exclusively the province of the trier of fact. <em>See State v. Santos </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 125, 131, 902 P.2d 510, 514. \u201cIn the event of conflicting evidence, it is within the province of the trier of fact to determine which will prevail.\u201d <em>Santos, </em>273 Mont. at 131, 902 P.2d at 514 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">\u00b6120  It is clear from the record that a reasonable juror could have concluded from the evidence taken in a light most favorable to the prosecution that guilt on counts III, IV, and V was proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

Whether farther prosecution of counts III, IV, and V is barred by \u00a7 46-11-503, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">\u00b6124 Susan contends, pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 46-11-503, MCA, that further prosecution of counts III, IV, and V, relating to Mathew\u2019s death, is barred by her conviction of Count II, relating to Wesley\u2019s overdose. Section 46-11-503, MCA, states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0t\">(1) When two or more offenses are known to the prosecutor, are supported by probable cause, and are consummated prior to the original charge and jurisdiction and venue of the offenses lie in a single court, a prosecution is barred if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-10\">(b) the former prosecution resulted in a conviction that has not been set aside, reversed, or vacated;...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-11\">\u00b6125 Susan argues that Count II and counts III, IV, and V are part of the \u201csame transaction\u201d and that the former prosecution resulted in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>conviction on Count II, which has not been set aside, reversed, or vacated. In denying Susan\u2019s motion to dismiss counts III, IV, and V, the District Court rejected this contention and concluded that, \u201cCounts I and II dealt with the transaction involving Wesley\u2019s benadryl overdose and Counts III, IV and V dealt with the transaction involving Mathew\u2019s death. A conviction of Count II does not involve the same transaction as Counts III, IV and V and therefore does not constitute a bar to the retrial of such counts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">\u00b6126 The court relied on our decision in <em>State v. Berger </em>(1993), 259 Mont. 364, 856 P.2d 552, where we held that \u00a7 46-11-503, MCA, applies only to prosecutions arising from the \u201csame transaction,\u201d even after the 1991 amendments eliminated the \u201csame transaction\u201d language from subsection (1) of the statute. Susan urges this Court to overrule <em>Berger </em>and hold that in <em>Berger, </em>we violated a principle of statutory construction by adding the requirement of \u201csame transaction\u201d to the plain language of \u00a7 46-11-503(1)(b), MCA. We reaffirmed the \u201csame transaction\u201d requirement in <em>State v. Waldrup </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 456, 872 P.2d 772, and decline another invitation to reconsider our construction of \u00a7 46-11-503(1)(b), MCA, here.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">\u00b6127 When Susan moved to sever the counts involving Wesley from the counts involving Mathew pursuant to \u00a7 46-11-404(1), MCA, the State resisted and the District Court denied the motion. Having successfully argued to the District Court that the Wesley counts and the Mathew counts are part of the \u201csame transactions\u201d for purposes of joinder, the State is then estopped from conveniently adopting a contrary position and arguing that the counts are not part of the \u201csame transaction\u201d for purposes of further prosecution under \u00a7 46-11-503, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">\u00b6128 Montana\u2019s joinder statute, \u00a7 46-11-404, MCA, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-7\">Joinder of offenses and defendants. (1) Two or more offenses or different statements of the same offense may be charged in the same charging document in a separate count, or alternatively, if the offenses charged, whether felonies or misdemeanors or both, are of the same or similar character or are based on the same transactions connected together or constituting parts of a common scheme or plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">The language of the joinder provision is broader than the \u201csame transaction\u201d language used in the former prosecution context. That is, the joinder provision does not limit joinder to charges arising out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>the \u201csame transactions connected together or constituting parts of a common scheme or plan<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>,\u201d but also includes charges which are of the \u201csame or similar character.\u201d The dissent points to this distinction in concluding that the charges against Susan were joined, not because they were part of the \u201csame transactions,\u201d but because they were of \u201csame or similar character\u201d in that they involved similar victims, similar locations, and were offenses of a similar nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">\u00b6129 The State\u2019s entire prosecutorial theme was that the counts all arose out of MSBP and were thus part of the \u201csame transaction.\u201d In opposing Susan\u2019s motion to sever, the State was very clear as to its position:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-5\">In this case, the State contends that Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy caused the Defendant to engage in a common plan whereby she injured her children. Moreover, the expert witnesses on the subject of Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy whom the State intends to call will provide testimony which concerns all of the counts of the Information. For those reasons the counts do constitute the same transaction connected together or constituting part of a common scheme for purpose of Mont. Code Ann. Sec. 46-11-404(1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">The State\u2019s position throughout this prosecution was that all the counts were part of the \u201csame transaction\u201d as that term is used in Title 46 and, in particular, the joinder statute, \u00a7 46-11-404(1), MCA. Thus, although \u00a7 46-11-404(1), MCA, does allow joinder of offenses of \u201csame or similar character,\u201d as well as those arising out of the \u201csame transactions,\u201d that distinction is irrelevant here because the State\u2019s theory has always been that conduct attributable to MSBP is part of the \u201csame transaction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">\u00b6130 The definition of \u201csame transaction\u201d is set forth in \u00a7 46-1-202(23), MCA. That definition applies throughout Title 46 and thus encompasses both the joinder and the former prosecution statutes. Having convinced the District Court that the counts were all part of the same MSBP transaction for purposes of joinder, the State\u2019s contention that the Mathew counts are not part of the \u201csame transaction\u201d for purposes of further prosecution rings hollow.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>\u00b6131 Aside from the inconsistency inherent in the State\u2019s position, the fact is that the Mathew counts and the Wesley count are part of the \u201csame transaction\u201d as defined in \u00a7 46-1-202(23), MCA.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-4\">\u201cSame transaction\u201d means conduct consisting of a series of acts or omissions that are motivated by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-5\">(a) a purpose to accomplish a criminal objective and that are necessary or incidental to the accomplishment of that objective;...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0I\">Contrary to the dissent\u2019s contention that MSBP is not a \u201ccriminal objective,\u201d we determine that the seeking of attention through harming one\u2019s children is a criminal objective. The State\u2019s theory, which was supported by expert testimony, was that Susan engaged in a series of acts towards Wesley and Mathew that were motivated by a desire to accomplish a criminal objective (drawing attention to herself through harming her children) and that the overdosing of Wesley and the smothering of Mathew were necessary to the accomplishment of that objective. The Mathew counts and the Wesley count thus come within the \u201csame transaction\u201d element of \u00a7 46-11-503, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">\u00b6132  We reverse the District Court\u2019s conclusion and hold that, under \u00a7 46-11-503, MCA, any further prosecution of Susan for Mathew\u2019s death is barred by the former prosecution, which resulted in a conviction on Count II, relating to Wesley\u2019s overdose.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">\u00b6133 Affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b227-9\">JUSTICE NELSON concurring.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b195-15\">.

The issue in subpart (c) concerns whether the District Court erred in concluding that Hocevar\u2019s conviction for Criminal Endangerment in regard to Wesley\u2019s Benadryl overdose did not bar a subsequent prosecution on the charges arising out of Mathew\u2019s death. Because I believe that Wesley\u2019s Benadryl overdose and Mathew\u2019s death did not arise out of the same transaction, I would vote to affirm the District Court. I take this opportunity to restate some of the relevant facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">\u00b6138 On February 16, 1994, the State filed an Information charging Hocevar with two offenses, stated in the alternative, stemming from her son Wesley\u2019s Benadryl overdose. The State alleged that Hocevar had provided Wesley with Benadryl on May 21, 1992. The State also charged Hocevar with three offenses stemming from the death of her son Mathew from aspiration of vomitus. In regard to these charges, the State alleged that Hocevar had smothered Mathew in December 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">\u00b6139 On June 29, 1994, Hocevar filed a motion to sever Counts I and II, the charges stemming from Wesley\u2019s Benadryl overdose, from trial on Counts III, IV, and V, the charges stemming from Mathew\u2019s death, contending that joinder of these charges violated \u00a7 46-11-404, MCA. The District Court denied Hocevar\u2019s motion to sever. On May 12, 1995, the jury returned a verdict of guilty as to Count II, Criminal Endangerment, with respect to Hocevar\u2019s conduct toward Wesley, but was unable to reach a verdict on Counts III, TV, and V pertaining to Mathew\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>\u00b6140 On May 22, 1995, the State filed a motion requesting the District Court to schedule a trial date for Counts III, IV, and V of the Information. Hocevar filed a Renewed Motion to Dismiss requesting that the District Court dismiss Counts III, IV, and V of the Information. Hocevar contended that a second trial for Counts III, IV, and V was prohibited by the plain language of \u00a7 46-11-503(1)(b), MCA (hereinafter also referred to as the \u201cformer conviction statute\u201d). On December 18, 1996, the District Court denied Hocevar\u2019s motion to dismiss. The District Court concluded that pursuant to <em>State v. Berger </em>(1993), 259 Mont. 364, 856 P.2d 552, a second prosecution on Counts III, IV, and V was not barred because these charges did not arise out of the same transaction as Hocevar\u2019s Criminal Endangerment conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"Ar_\">\u00b6 141 On appeal, Hocevar asserts that we should overrule <em>Berger </em>because in deciding Berger we violated a principle of statutory construction by adding the requirement of \u201csame transaction\u201d to our interpretation of \u00a7 46-11-503(1)(b), MCA. In the alternative, Hocevar claims that Counts III, IV, and V relate to the same transaction as Count II and, therefore, a subsequent prosecution on the charges relating to her conduct with respect to Mathew\u2019s death is still barred under <em>Berger. </em>In this regard, Hocevar maintains that the counts arising from Wesley\u2019s hospitalization and the counts arising from Mathew\u2019s death are part of the same transaction for purposes of the former conviction statute because the State contended, and the District Court agreed, that the counts could be joined for trial under \u00a7 46-11-404, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">\u00b6142 The statute which Hocevar contends bars a retrial on the charges arising out of Mathew\u2019s death is \u00a7 46-11-503(1)(b), MCA, which provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-5\">Prosecution based on same transaction barred by former prosecution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">(1) When two or more offenses are known to the prosecutor, are supported by probable cause, and are consummated prior to the original charge and jurisdiction and venue of the offenses lie in a single court, a prosecution is barred if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-7\">(b) the former prosecution resulted in a conviction that has not been set aside, reversed, or vacated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">\u00b6143 I agree with the Court\u2019s conclusion that this provision only bars subsequent prosecutions of offenses arising out of the \u201csame transaction.\u201d <em>See Berger, </em>259 Mont. at 368, 856 P.2d at 554. Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>ingly, the remaining question is whether the charges stemming from Mathew\u2019s death in December 1991 arose out of the same transaction as Hocevar\u2019s Criminal Endangerment conviction which derived from Wesley\u2019s Benadryl overdose in May 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">\u00b6144 When determining whether charges arose out of the same transaction for purposes of the former conviction statute we have referred to the definition of same transaction contained in \u00a7 46-1-202(22), MCA. <em>See State v. Waldrup </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 456, 459, 872 P.2d 772, 774. Section 46-1-202(22)(a), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-5\">\u201cSame transaction\u201d means conduct consisting of a series of acts or omissions that are motivated by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-6\">(a) a purpose to accomplish a criminal objective and that are necessary or incidental to the accomplishment of that objective....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aog\">\u00b6145 The charges related to Mathew\u2019s death and the charges related to Wesley\u2019s hospitalization do not fit under the statutory definition of \u201csame transaction\u201d because Hocevar did not engage in conduct consisting of a series of acts motivated by a purpose to accomplish a <em>single criminal objective. </em>Rather, these events are the product of two separate criminal objectives which happen to share a noncriminal motivation. In one instance, Hocevar\u2019s alleged criminal objective was to smother Mathew. In the other, Hocevar\u2019s criminal objective was to endanger Wesley by providing him with Benadryl. These events are allegedly linked by Hocevar\u2019s noncriminal objective of seeking attention (the MSBP evidence). However, the sole fact that in both instances Hocevar was seeking attention does not bring these separate events within the definition of \u201csame transaction.\u201d Seeking attention is not a criminal objective under the same transaction provision.</p>\n<p id=\"Ao5\">\u00b6146 In my view, the court erred by confusing Hocevar\u2019s criminal and noncriminal objectives, thereby concluding that these separate events, Mathew\u2019s death and Wesley\u2019s overdose, are part of the same transaction. This error is manifested by the Court\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe seeking of attention through the harming of one\u2019s children is a criminal objective.\u201d Court\u2019s opinion at \u00b6 131. The objective of harming a specific person (e.g., Hocevar\u2019s son Mathew) has been criminalized, however, seeking attention has not. What the Court misconstrues is the fact that while Hocevar\u2019s conduct with regard to Mathew is of a similar character as her conduct toward Wesley in that in both instances Hocevar committed criminal acts in order to receive attention, these events did not arise out of the same transaction because they did not share the same <em>criminal </em>objective. As delineated above, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>these counts arise out of two separate and distinct transactions because they have separate and distinct <em>criminal </em>objectives. One set of charges arose out of the acts Hocevar committed in order to further the criminal objective of smothering Mathew. The other set of charges arose out of the acts Hocevar committed in order to further the criminal objective of harming Wesley. These crimes are of a similar nature in that they both shared a noncriminal motivation, the seeking of attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">\u00b6147 Seeking attention is not a \u201ccriminal objective\u201d in any sense under which we have previously analyzed the former conviction statute. In my view the meaning of \u201ccriminal objective\u201d is fairly clear: a goal which has been criminalized. This is precisely how we have previously analyzed it. For instance, had the State alleged that Hocevar poisoned Wesley with a substance which was illegal to possess, a conviction for criminally endangering Wesley would have prevented a subsequent prosecution for the illegal possession of the poisonous substance. The unlawful possession of the poisonous substance was necessary in order to accomplish the criminal goal of poisoning Wesley. The two crimes would be united by a common <em>criminal </em>objective and thus be part of the \u201csame transaction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">\u00b6148 I note that the facts of this case are remarkably similar to the facts of <em>Waldrup </em>in which we held that multiple counts of indecent exposure filed against the defendant h\u00e1d not arisen out of the same transaction as previous charges for which the defendant had already been convicted. 264 Mont. at 459, 872 P.2d at 774. Like Hocevar, presumably Waldrup repeatedly exposed himself in order to garner attention. However, we did not conclude that the similarity in motive meant that the separate incidents were part of the \u201csame transaction\u201d for purposes of the former conviction statute. This is because this provision does not prohibit the subsequent prosecution of a defendant for other similar offenses which share a similar <em>noncriminal </em>motivation.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">\u00b6149 A comparison of two decisions interpreting \u00a7 46-1-202(22)(a), MCA, clearly supports the conclusion that smothering Mathew and providing Wesley with Benadryl are not part of the same transaction. In <em>State v. Sword </em>(1987), 229 Mont. 370, 747 P.2d 206, we concluded that the defendant had engaged in a series of acts for the purpose of accomplishing the criminal objective of unlawfully taking a grizzly bear. The defendant had pled guilty to violating the Endangered Species Act by knowingly possessing, carrying, and transporting a grizzly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>bear taken unlawfully. The State subsequently filed an Information charging Sword with making false statements on a trophy license. The trophy license authorized Sword to possess and transport the grizzly bear. We concluded that the two charges arose from the same transaction because the false statements on the trophy license were necessary to the accomplishment of the criminal objective of possessing, carrying, and transporting a grizzly bear taken unlawfully. <em>Sword, </em>229 Mont. at 374, 747 P.2d at 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">\u00b6150 In <em>State v. Tadewaldt </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 261, 922 P.2d 463, we concluded that a former conviction for DUI did not bar a subsequent prosecution for criminal possession of dangerous drugs because the acts were not motivated by the purpose to accomplish a common criminal objective. The defendant in this case, Tadewaldt, was arrested for driving under the influence. Immediately following his arrest, several pills were found in his possession which were later identified as dangerous drugs. Tadewaldt pled guilty to a DUI charge and moved to dismiss a separate prosecution for criminal possession of dangerous drugs, asserting that it arose out of the same transaction. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUG\">The drugs forming part of the criminal possession charge had not been ingested and did not contribute to Tadewaldt\u2019s impairment. Thus, in statutory terms, Tadewaldt\u2019s conduct in possessing the dangerous drugs was not motivated by a purpose to accomplish the \u201ccriminal objective\u201d of DUI, nor was it necessary or incidental to that \u201cobjective.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-5\"><em>Tadewaldt, </em>277 Mont. at 267, 922 P.2d at 466.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">\u00b6 151 The paradigmatic example of charges arising out of the \u201csame transaction\u201d is <em>Sword. </em>Sword engaged in a series of acts motivated by the purpose of furthering his single criminal objective of taking a grizzly bear unlawfully. On the other hand, <em>Tadewaldt </em>did not involve charges arising out of the same transaction, even though they arose out of the same arrest, because the acts were not motivated by a single criminal objective. The facts of the instant case are unlike the conduct at issue in <em>Sword. </em>Allegedly smothering Mathew was not necessary or incidental to the accomplishment of harming Wesley by providing him with an overdose of Benadryl. Rather, these incidents involved two separate <em>criminal </em>objectives, smothering Mathew on the one hand and providing Benadryl to Wesley on the other, which were similar in that they shared a <em>noncriminal </em>objective, gaining attention. Undeniably, the Court\u2019s \u201csame transaction\u201d analysis is muddled by the combination of criminal and noncriminal objectives con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>tained in its conclusion that \u201cthe seeking of attention through harming one\u2019s children is a criminal objective.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">\u00b6152 It is clear that the actual reason for the Court\u2019s conclusion that the charges arose from the same transaction for purposes of the former conviction statute is its belief that the State adopted \u201ccontrary\u201d positions on joinder and on the former conviction statute. The Court\u2019s opinion states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-5\">Having successfully argued to the District Court that the Wesley counts and the Mathew counts are part of the \u201csame transaction\u201d for purposes of joinder, the State is then estopped from conveniently adopting a contrary position and arguing that the counts are not part of the \u201csame transaction\u201d for purposes of further prosecution under \u00a7 46-11-503, MCA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Court\u2019s Op. at \u00b6 127.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">\u00b6153 The Court\u2019s conclusion that the State has adopted contrary positions is based on a misunderstanding of the State\u2019s positions on joinder and on the former conviction statutue. The Court\u2019s opinion states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-8\">The State\u2019s theory, which was supported by expert testimony, was that Susan engaged in a series of acts towards Wesley and Mathew that were motivated by a desire to accomplish a criminal objective (drawing attention to herself through harming her children) and that the overdosing of Wesley and the smothering of Mathew were necessary to the accomplishment of that objective. The Mathew counts and the Wesley count thus come within the \u201csame transaction\u201d element of \u00a7 46-11-503, MCA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">Court\u2019s Op. at \u00b6 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">\u00b6154 Actually, the Court\u2019s representation of the State\u2019s positions as inconsistent is not accurate. As the Court acknowledges, joinder and the applicability of the former conviction statute are separate issues. The language of these provisions, the decisions interpreting them, and the purposes which they further are distinct. The State\u2019s position on joinder has nothing to do with its position on the former conviction statute. The plain language of the joinder provision, \u00a7 46-11-404, MCA, does not limit joinder to charges arising out of the \u201csame transaction,\u201d but rather includes charges which are of a \u201csimilar character\u201d or charges which are part of a \u201ccommon scheme or plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">\u00b6155 The Court states that the State\u2019s entire prosecutorial theme was that all of the counts arose out of the same transaction, referring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>to the State\u2019s brief supporting joinder. <em>See </em>Court\u2019s Op. at \u00b6 129. In fact, the State posed alternative arguments in its brief supporting joinder. The State did assert that the counts arose out of \u201ca common plan\u201d in that they were the product of Hocevar\u2019s MSBP pathology. However, the State also claimed that \u201c[t]he charges in Counts I and II are of <em>the same or similar nature </em>to those in Counts III, IV and V\u201d and should be joined because of their \u201cstriking similarity.\u201d (Emphasis added.) From these assertions, the Court draws the conclusion that the State is \u201cestopped from conveniently adopting\u201d a subsequent position on the former conviction statute which is inconsistent with one of its alternative arguments in its brief in support of joinder.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Au5\">\u00b6156 As the Court observes throughout its opinion, the essence of the State\u2019s position on joinder was that joinder of the charges was proper because \u201cin both instances Susan injured or killed her children in an attempt to draw attention to herself\u201d and the State intended to call expert witnesses on MSBP which would be relevant to all the charges. Court\u2019s Op. at \u00b6\u00b6 66, 67, and 130. Significantly, the Court acknowledges that the District Court joined the charges for trial, not because they arose from the same transaction, but because the counts were <em>\u201csimilar in nature </em>and much of the proof... would apply to all counts.\u201d Court\u2019s Op. at \u00b6 64 (emphasis added). We correctly affirmed the District Court\u2019s joinder of the charges <em>not </em>because they arose from the same transaction, but rather because the counts were \u201clogically linked by the MSBP motive and proof regarding all the charges overlapped.\u201d Court\u2019s Op. at \u00b6 67. Had the State argued that the charges could be joined for the sole reason that they were a series of acts motivated by the purpose to commit a single criminal objective, and more importantly, had the District Court agreed, it would have been error to have affirmed on that basis because, as noted above, the charges could not have been part of the \u201csame transaction\u201d for purposes of joinder-they did not share a <em>\u201csingle criminal objective.\u201d </em>Section 45-2-101(7), MCA (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">\u00b6157 The State\u2019s actual position with regard to the former prosecution statute was that Hocevar\u2019s conduct in relation to Wesley\u2019s overdose was \u201cnot necessary or incidental to the accomplishment of <em>any </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number><em>criminal objective related to the conduct alleged </em>[with respect to Mathew\u2019s death].\u201d (Emphasis added.) It is clear to me that the State correctly maintained that the charges could be joined because they were of a similar nature and logically linked by evidence of motivation while at the same time maintaining that Hocevar\u2019s conviction did not bar a subsequent prosecution because Mathew\u2019s death was not incidental or necessary to the accomplishment of Wesley\u2019s overdose. In no way are these positions inconsistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">\u00b6158 The resolution of this issue does not depend on one of the State\u2019s alternative arguments in its brief supporting joinder below, that is simply a red herring. The precise issue, as correctly framed by the Court, is \u201c[w]hether further prosecution on counts III, IV, and V is barred by \u00a7 46-11-503, MCA.\u201d Court\u2019s Op. at \u00b6 123. I would conclude that a conviction on one of the charges relating to Wesley\u2019s overdose does not preclude a subsequent prosecution on the charges relating to Mathew\u2019s suffocation because they do not arise out of the \u201csame transaction.\u201d The conduct underlying the charges occurred on different dates, involved different victims, and, while they shared a common explanation of motive, the MSBP evidence, the acts were not in furtherance of a common <em>criminal </em>objective. Hocevar did not smother Mathew in order to further the criminal objective of endangering Wesley, nor was the smothering of Mathew necessary or incidental to Wesley\u2019s overdose.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">\u00b6159 Accordingly, I would affirm the District Court conclusion that a subsequent prosecution on charges arising from Mathew\u2019s death was not precluded on account of a previous conviction arising from Wesley\u2019s overdose.</p>\n<judges id=\"b235-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE and JUSTICE GRAY, join in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b228-7\">. I refer to the \u201cCourt\u2019s opinion\u201d rather than the \u201cMajority opinion\u201d for the following reason: the \u201csame transaction\u201d analysis contained in subpart (c) to Issue 11 of Justice Leaphart\u2019s opinion has been joined by only one other member of the Court, Justice Nelson. Justices Trieweiler and Hunt concur in the Court\u2019s result, barring a retrial of the charges arising from Mathew\u2019s death, but on different grounds. They contend that the former conviction statute bars subsequent prosecutions regardless of whether the charge which forms the basis of the subsequent prosecution arose out of the \u201csame transaction.\u201d Therefore, although a majority of the Court would reverse the District Court and bar a retrial on Counts III, IV, and V of the Information, there is no majority opinion on that issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b234-5\">.
