Ethicon, Inc. </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 393, 402, 871 P.2d 1313, 1319.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">\u00b67 We note the pertinent facts in what is an extraordinarily lengthy record. While employed with Champion International Co. (Champion), Michael Dambrowski (Dambrowski) filed claims for employment-related injuries. At the time of those claims, Champion was self-insured for purposes of workers\u2019 compensation and employed Compensation Adjusters, Inc. (Compensation Adjusters) to handle the adjustment of workers\u2019 compensation claims for Champion\u2019s employees. In September, 1994 Dambrowski filed a complaint against the Respondents in the present case \u201cfor intentional torts, statutory violations and violation of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the adjusting and settling of his Montana Workman\u2019s Compensation claim.\u201d Dambrowski\u2019s claims arose out of his employment with Champion. In May, 1996 Compensation Adjusters and Carol Posterino (Posterino) listed Dambrowski\u2019s attorney, Rex Palmer (Palmer), as a trial witness. Compensation Adjusters later contended that it had a compelling need to obtain Palmer\u2019s opinion work product regarding his handling of Dambrowski\u2019s case. In June, 1996 Palmer filed a motion to bar Respondents from calling him as a witness. In August, 1996 Compensation Adjusters and Posterino moved to compel Palmer to submit to a discovery deposition. Palmer opposed that motion at a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">\u00b68 In January, 1997 the District Court denied Dambrowski\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>to prevent Respondents from calling Palmer as a witness and granted Respondents\u2019 motion to depose Palmer, concluding that their motion would \u201cnot work substantial prejudice to any party and additional discovery was clearly contemplated under the Pre-Trial Order.\u201d At a scheduling conference held later in January, 1997, the District Court requested that the deposition be done before the end of April.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">\u00b69 In April, 1997 Compensation Adjusters\u2019 counsel and Palmer agreed on May 28, 1997 as the date for his deposition. Thereafter, Compensation Adjusters and Posterino filed a notice of Palmer\u2019s deposition. On May 13, 1997 Compensation Adjusters faxed Palmer a proposed subpoena duces tecum. On May 27, 1997 Palmer filed a motion to quash subpoena and motion for protective order and canceled his deposition. Following a hearing, the District Court denied Dambrowski\u2019s motion for a protective order, ordered that Palmer\u2019s deposition be taken within ten days, and directed Palmer to log the items in his file that he claimed were privileged.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>\u00b610 Palmer\u2019s deposition was reset for June 4, 1997. At his deposition, Palmer stated that unless Respondents agreed to a stipulation that he had prepared, he would not answer questions about his file for Dambrowski or his representation of him. Respondents rejected Palmer\u2019s proposed stipulation and the deposition was concluded. That same day, the District Court held a hearing on Palmer\u2019s deposition. Thereafter, Compensation Adjusters and Posterino moved to disqualify Palmer as counsel. Champion moved for the imposition of sanctions against Palmer pursuant to Rules 11 and 37, M.R.Civ.P., and for dismissal of the case with prejudice. On June 16, 1997 the District Court stayed all existing discovery obligations and deadlines until further order of the District Court. On June 23, 1997 Palmer responded to Champion\u2019s motion for sanctions but did not request a hearing on sanctions. The parties jointly moved the District Court to vacate all deadlines, including the trial date, and the District Court granted their motion on July 28, 1997. In October, 1997, Palmer filed a \u201cLocal Rule 3F Reminder to Court\u201d but again did not request a hearing on Champion\u2019s motion for sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">\u00b611 In an Opinion and Order entered in April, 1998, the District Court denied Compensation Adjusters and Posterino\u2019s motion, which Champion joined, to disqualify Palmer from representing Dambrowski but also directed Palmer\u2019s associate to \u201cact as lead counsel in this matter in both the pre-trial and trial phases, until the litigation has concluded.\u201d Turning to Dambrowski\u2019s motions to quash subpoena and for a protective order regarding the deposition of Rex Palmer, the District Court concluded that it had previously determined those issues in its January, 1997 Order and that Palmer \u201cmust pay as sanctions the cost of Champion\u2019s and Compensation Adjust[e]rs\u2019 response to the Motion ...\u201d The District Court further ordered that Palmer would \u201cappear and cooperate at a deposition to be scheduled by Defendants at their convenience. Prior to the deposition, Palmer must submit a new document log to the Court with specific reasons for the withholding of any documents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">\u00b612 Further, the District Court denied Champion\u2019s motion to dismiss the action but found that \u201cPalmer\u2019s behavior and lack of respect toward opposing counsel, and this Court is reprehensible.... Palmer personally, not Dambrowski, must pay all costs of Champion\u2019s and Compensation Adjuster\u2019s preparation for and participation in the two scheduled depositions as well as the hearings that resulted from Palmer\u2019s failure to cooperate. Additionally, Palmer must pay the cost <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>of preparation of all briefs filed as a result of his failure to comply with the Court\u2019s orders beginning January 6, 1997.\u201d Champion submitted a sealed statement of fees; Compensation Adjusters and Posterino submitted statements of fees and costs. Palmer filed objections to Respondents\u2019 fees and costs and requested \u201ca hearing regarding the reasonableness and factual accuracy of [Respondents\u2019] fees and cost statement.\u201d The District Court set a hearing for July 15, 1998. Compensation Adjusters and Posterino filed a notice of deposition for Palmer, scheduling his deposition for June 26, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">\u00b613 On June 16, 1998 Dambrowski petitioned this Court for a writ of supervisory control. Three days later, Dambrowski moved the District Court for a stay of proceedings; the District Court denied Dambrowski\u2019s motion. On June 22, 1998 Dambrowski filed a motion to amend and a request for stay with this Court. On June 26, 1998 Palmer attended his deposition and produced his file together with an objection log. At his deposition Palmer answered under objection Respondents\u2019 questions about his handling of Dambrowski\u2019s case. Thereafter, this Court granted Dambrowski\u2019s motion for a stay of proceedings. In response, the District Court vacated the July, 1998 hearing on Defendants\u2019 costs and fees. In August, 1998 we denied Dambrowski\u2019s petition for supervisory control without prejudice, concluding that \u201cwhether Palmer\u2019s deposition should have been ordered and taken is moot\u201d as his deposition had been taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">\u00b614 In September, 1998 the District Court held a scheduling conference and granted Palmer\u2019s request to resume the role of lead counsel. Palmer advised the District Court that he questioned whether sanctions should be imposed, and the District Court granted Palmer until October 1, 1998 to file a request for hearing. On October 1, 1998 Palmer filed a \u201cRequest for Hearing on Whether Sanctions Should Be Awarded.\u201d On October 13, 1998 Palmer moved for the disqualification of the Honorable John W. Larson \u201cas regards the sanctions issues.\u201d In his disqualification affidavit, Palmer stated that \u201c[i]f the matter in dispute were to continue before the judge who had ruled without a hearing, any ruling consistent with the original ruling would be tainted with the implication that the matter had been pre-judged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">\u00b615 In November, 1998 the District Court held a hearing on sanctions. The District Court determined that Palmer\u2019s affidavit, which accompanied his motion to disqualify the Honorable John Larson, was \u201cinsufficient on its face and not in accordance with the statute.\u201d The District Court ruled further that it had previously determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>that sanctions were appropriate and that \u201cit\u2019s just an issue of how much.\u201d However, the District Court allowed Palmer to argue why sanctions were inappropriate. The District Court granted Respondents\u2019 motions for sanctions and directed them to prepare orders awarding them fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">\u00b616 In December, 1998 the District Court entered its Order regarding sanctions. The District Court denied Dambrowski\u2019s motion to disqualify. Further, \u201c[p]ursuant to the mandates of Rules 37(b) and (d),\u201d the District Court ordered that Palmer reimburse Champion $16,704.12 and that Palmer reimburse Compensation Adjusters and Posterino $8,873.98. In December, 1998 Palmer filed a notice of appeal from the District Court\u2019s orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">\u00b617 1. Whether the District Court abused its discretion in imposing discovery sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">\u00b618 Palmer argues that the District Court erred in compelling disclosure of his work product. In our order denying Palmer\u2019s petition for writ of supervisory control, we concluded that this issue is moot as Palmer attended his June, 1998 deposition and answered questions. We therefore decline to revisit this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">\n<em>A. Whether Palmer\u2019s rights to due process were violated.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">\u00b619 Palmer argues that the District Court\u2019s imposition of sanctions violated his rights to due process. Palmer contends that he was entitled to but did not receive notice and an opportunity to be heard before the imposition of Rule 11, M.R.Civ.P., sanctions. Respondents respond that Palmer had notice of sanctions because of their motions and briefs seeking sanctions. Respondents argue further that Palmer had ample opportunity to brief the propriety and amount of sanctions and that he had repeated opportunities to request an additional hearing but declined to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">\u00b620 We conclude that Palmer\u2019s due process argument regarding the District Court\u2019s April, 1998 order of sanctions is without support in the record. First, Palmer is mistaken in contending that the April, 1998 order deprived him of property without due process. In its April, 1998 Order, the District Court ordered that Palmer reimburse Respondents for the costs they incurred as a result of his discovery abuses. However, the District Court did not assess sanctions but rather directed the Respondents to file their costs and fees. Palmer was not deprived of property until the District Court assessed specific costs and fees in its December, 1998 order. Nor has Palmer shown that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>the alleged lack of notice and opportunity to be heard before the April, 1998 Order prejudiced his rights in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">\u00b621 Second, Palmer\u2019s argument that he is entitled to due process under decisions that have construed Rule 11, M.R.Civ.R, sanctions is misplaced. The District Court\u2019s April, 1998 Order made no mention of Rule 11. Further, although the District Court may have relied on Rule 11 in sanctioning Palmer for Dambrowski\u2019s Motions to Quash Subpoena and for Protective order, the District Court did not address either Rule 11 or Dambrowski\u2019s Motions to Quash Subpoena and for Protective Order in its final, December 1998 Order imposing sanctions. In his Reply brief, Palmer concedes that the District Court\u2019s final order \u201cdoes not rely upon or refer to Rule 11.\u201d We conclude that Palmer\u2019s rebanee on Rule 11 is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">\u00b622 Further, the record demonstrates that Palmer had notice of sanctions, that he responded to Respondents\u2019 motions for sanctions, and that he repeatedly elected not to request a hearing on sanctions before April, 1998. When Champion moved for the imposition of sanctions under Rules 11 and 37, M.R.Civ.P., in June, 1997, Palmer responded to Champion\u2019s motion but did not request a hearing. Rather, Palmer requested that \u201cthe Court reserve ruling until the transcript [of his deposition] is available for review.\u201d When Palmer filed a \u201cSupplementary Memorandum Re: Status of Recent Motions\u201d in June, 1997 he again did not request a hearing. Palmer asserted rather that \u201c[u]pon filing of the transcript of Mr. Palmer\u2019s deposition, Champion\u2019s motion [for sanctions] should be ripe for ruling.\u201d When Palmer filed a \u201cLocal Rule 3F Reminder To Court\u201d in October, 1997, he again did not request a hearing on Champion\u2019s motion. On this record Palmer cannot plausibly maintain that he was denied notice and an opportunity to be heard before the District Court\u2019s April, 1998 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">\u00b623 We turn to the District Court\u2019s December, 1998 order, which imposed sanctions under Rule 37, M.R.Civ.P. The plain language of Rule 37, M.R.Civ.R, does not require notice and a hearing before the imposition of sanctions. Further, we have previously concluded that no court order is required before the imposition of sanctions pursuant to Rule 37(d), M.R.Civ.P. <em>See Jerome v. Pardis </em>(1989), 240 Mont. 187, 191, 783 P.2d 919, 921 (concluding \u201cunder subsection (d) [of Rule 37] no [court] order is necessary, however, sanctions are only authorized for the three enumerated failures\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">\u00b624 However, Palmer appears to argue and Respondents do not dispute that Palmer was entitled to notice and an opportunity to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>heard before he was sanctioned under Rule 37(b), M.R.Civ.P., sanctions. We agree. When a person is sanctioned with attorney's fees and costs pursuant to Rule 37(b), that person is entitled to notice and the opportunity to be heard before the imposition of sanctions. <em>Compare Lindey\u2019s, Inc. v. Goodover </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 489, 497, 872 P.2d 767, 772 (concluding appellant was entitled to a \u201cnotice to show cause and ... a hearing\u201d before the imposition of Rule 11 sanctions).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">\u00b625  In the present case, however, we conclude that Palmer received adequate notice and opportunity to be heard before the imposition of sanctions at the December, 1998 hearing. As previously discussed, Palmer received extensive notice and opportunities to be heard before the District Court\u2019s April, 1998 order of sanctions. Following the District Court\u2019s April, 1998 Order, when Palmer objected to Respondents\u2019 costs and fees, he requested \u201cadditional discovery and hearing regarding the reasonableness and factual accuracy of [Respondents\u2019] fees and cost statement[s].\u201d Only in September, 1998 did Palmer question the appropriateness of sanctions, as opposed to their \u201creasonableness and factual accuracy.\u201d In October, 1998 Palmer at last filed his \u201cRequest for Hearing on Whether Sanctions Should be Awarded.\u201d Thus, Palmer waited more than <em>thirteen </em>months after Respondents moved for sanctions to question whether they should be imposed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">\u00b626 In November, 1998 the District Court held a hearing on sanctions and allowed Palmer to argue regarding the appropriateness of sanctions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-7\">Mr. Palmer: Would that be appropriate to stop now or should I go into the other matters that would concern whether some of the sanctions are appropriate in the first place?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-8\">The Court: You can briefly illuminate them, I\u2019m not trying to cut you off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-9\">Mr. Palmer: Okay. I just didn\u2019t want to offend the Court, because I thought we were limiting this hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>The Court: Okay, we\u2019re all here. This is your opportunity to make a statement, to make your argument on the issues that you think are presented?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-4\">Mr. Palmer: Okay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Palmer argued whether sanctions were warranted and concluded, \u201c[t]hat, again, is the testimony that I would offer, and I offer that under oath at this time. If the Court would like me to be sworn, I\u2019ll swear to those matters. In fact, I elect to do that, I think.\u201d Palmer then attested under oath to the truth of his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">\u00b627 This record clearly establishes that Palmer had an opportunity to be heard before the District Court <em>imposed </em>sanctions in December, 1998. We conclude that he received adequate notice and opportunity to be heard before the District Court assessed fees and costs for Respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">\u00b628 Palmer argues further, however, that Rule 37, M.R.Civ.R, has no application to him, in essence because he is a nonparty deponent. Palmer asserts that the District Court therefore erred in sanctioning him pursuant to that Rule. Champion responds and Palmer does not dispute that Palmer did not preserve this issue for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">\u00b629 The rule is well established that we do not consider issues raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Unified Industries, Inc. v. Easley, </em>1998 MT 145, \u00b6 15, 289 Mont. 255, \u00b6 15, 961 P.2d 100, \u00b6 15. We therefore decline to address whether an attorney who defies a district court\u2019s order to appear for a deposition may be sanctioned under Rule 37, M.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">\u00b630 However, for the benefit of lower courts and the bar, we draw attention to the plain terms of Rule 16(f), M.R.Civ.P., which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-10\">Sanctions. If a party <em>or party\u2019s attorney fails to obey a scheduling or pretrial order </em>... or if a party or party\u2019s attorney fails to participate in good faith, the judge, upon motion or the judge\u2019s own initiative, may, make such orders with regard thereto as are just, and among others any of the orders provided in Rule 37(b)(2)(B), (C), (D). In lieu of or in addition to any other sanction, the judge shall require the party or the attorney representing the party or both to pay the reasonable expenses incurred because of any noncompliance with this rule, including attorney\u2019s fees, unless the judge finds that the noncompliance was substantially justified or that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>Rule 16(f), M.R.Civ.P, clearly has application in cases like the present one where an attorney defies a district court\u2019s scheduling and pretrial orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">\n<em>B. Whether the amount of sanctions awarded was excessive.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">\u00b631 Palmer argues that the costs and fees awarded Respondents are excessive. Palmer argues that the fees awarded exceeded reasonable fees in the locality and that Rule 1.5, M.R.Prof.Conduct, lists the fees customarily charged in a locality as a factor to be considered in determining the reasonableness of fees. Palmer argues that he gave the only testimony on the reasonableness of fees and that he testified that fees for civil actions typically ranged from $125 to $140 per hour in Missoula. Palmer asserts that Compensation Adjusters\u2019 counsel billed at $130 per hour and that Champion\u2019s attorney billed at $275 per hour. Further, Palmer argues that the sanctions are not supported by the record. Palmer contends that he did not file motions that were wholly repetitive of previous motions on which the District Court ruled. We decline to review this latter argument as it is premised on Palmer\u2019s misplaced contention that the District Court assessed fees and costs, in part, under Rule 11, M.R.Civ.P. Palmer also argues that he did not refuse to answer <em>any </em>questions at the June, 1997 deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">\u00b632 Respondents respond that Palmer oxdy offered his own testimony as to the reasonableness of fees and that their proof of costs and fees was uncontested. Further, Champion asserts and Palmer does not dispute that Palmer did not offer specific objections either to the necessity of or the time spent on the work billed by Respondents\u2019 counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">\u00b633  We conclude that Palmer\u2019s objections to the amount of the fees and costs that the District Court imposed as sanctions are unpersuasive. Rule 1.5 does not state that the fee customarily charged in a locale is the <em>sole </em>factor to be considered. Rather, Rule 1.5 lists a host of factors that may be considered, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-9\">(1) the time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-10\">(4) the amount involved and the results obtained;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-11\">(5) the time limitations imposed by the client or by the circumstances;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>(6) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-4\">(7) the experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing the services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Rule 1.5, M.R.Prof.Conduct. Palmer asserts that to the extent the District Court\u2019s award of fees included fees for Rule 11 misconduct, they should be stricken. However, Palmer has identified nothing in the record that supports his claim. On this record, we conclude that Palmer has made no showing that the amount of the fees and costs awarded Respondents is excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">\n<em>C. The relationship between Palmer\u2019s discovery misconduct and the discovery sanctions imposed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">\u00b634 This Court has long taken a dim view of discovery abuses. In <em>Owen v. F.A. Buttrey </em>(1981), 192 Mont. 274, 627 P.2d 1233, the Court adopted \u201ca position that dilatory actions are no longer to be dealt with leniently,\u201d following the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>National Hockey League v. Metropolitan Hockey Club, Inc. </em>(1976), 427 U.S. 639, 96 S.Ct. 2778, 49 L.Ed.2d 747. <em>Owen, </em>192 Mont. at 278, 627 P.2d at 1235. Further, \u201cwhen it is not possible for this Court to make a ready, confident, and accurate determination of a party\u2019s good faith in the discovery process, we presume the correctness of the District Court\u2019s action under Rule 37.\u201d <em>Owen, </em>192 Mont. at 280-81, 627 P.2d at 1237 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">\u00b635 In <em>Smith v. Butte-Silver Bow County </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 329, 916 P.2d 91, we recognized \u201cthe salutary purposes underlying the availability of Rule 37, M.R.Civ.P., sanctions for discovery abuses ...\u201d <em>Smith, </em>276 Mont. at 332, 916 P.2d at 92. We noted concerns regarding crowded dockets and concluded that \u201cRule 37, M.R.Civ.P., provides trial courts with a means to prevent an excessive back-log of cases.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>276 Mont. at 332, 916 P.2d at 93 (citation omitted). Further, we determined that \u201c[t]he trial judge is in the best position to know ... which parties callously disregard the rights of their opponents and other litigants seeking their day in court.... As a result, we generally defer to the decision of the trial court regarding Rule 37, M.R.Civ.P., sanctions.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>276 Mont. at 332, 916 P.2d at 93 (citation omitted). We further concluded that \u201c[t]he extent of the \u2018consequences\u2019 imposed by a district court... should relate to the extent and nature of the actual discovery abuse and the extent of the prejudice to the opposing party which results therefrom.\u201d <em>Smith, 276 </em>Mont. at 339-40, 916 P.2d at 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>\u00b636 In light of <em>Smith\u2019s </em>requirement of a \u201crelationship\u201d between sanctions and \u201cthe extent and nature of the actual discovery abuse and the extent of the prejudice,\u201d we review the actual discovery abuse in the present case. <em>Smith, </em>276 Mont. at 339-40, 916 P.2d at 97. The District Court found that Palmer violated its orders concerning the depositions scheduled for May and June, 1997. We consider the circumstances of each one of these scheduled depositions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">\u00b637 Palmer does not dispute that he was directed to appear at the deposition scheduled for May, 1997. However, Palmer appears to argue that the effect of his objections to the subpoena under Rules 30(d) and 45(b)(1) was to suspend the deposition and disclosure of documents until further order of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">\u00b638 Palmer is mistaken. Rule 30(d) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AI7\">Motion to terminate or limit examination. <em>At any time during the taking of the deposition, </em>on motion of a party or of the deponent and upon a showing that the examination is being conducted in bad faith or in such manner as unreasonably to annoy, embarrass, or oppress the deponent or party, the court... may order the officer conducting the examination to cease forthwith from taking the deposition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Rule 30(d), M.R.Civ.P. (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">\u00b639 Palmer ignores that Rule 30(d) only contemplates a motion to terminate or limit a deposition \u201c[a]t any time during the taking of the deposition.\u201d Rule 30(d), M.R.Civ.P. Palmer filed his objections and motions before the deposition and therefore outside the reach of Rule 30(d). <em>Compare Pioche Mines Consolidated, Inc. v. Dolman </em>(9th Cir. 1964), 333 F.2d 257, 269 (concluding \u201cunless [a party] has obtained a court order that postpones or dispenses with his duty to appear [at a deposition], that duty remains.... Under the Rules, it is for the court, not the deponent or his counsel, to relieve him of the duty to appear.\u201d We agree with the court in <em>Pioche.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">\u00b640 Moreover, Rule 45(b)(1), is similarly unavailing for Palmer. Rule 45(b)(1) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-9\">For production of documentary evidence. A subpoena may also command the person to whom it is directed to produce the books, papers, documents, or tangible things designated therein; but the court, upon motion made promptly and in any event at or before the time specified in the subpoena for compliance therewith, <em>may </em>(1) quash or modify the subpoena if it is unreasonable and oppressive ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>Rule 45(b)(1), M.R.Civ.P. (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">\u00b641 Without authority, Palmer appears to assume that his filing of a motion to quash the subpoena served to quash the subpoena. Palmer is mistaken. Rule 45(b)(1), M.R.Civ.P., provides rather that upon filing of a timely motion, a district court \u201cmay ... quash or modify the subpoena.\u201d As the District Court did not quash the subpoena, Palmer was not free to simply disregard its command.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">\u00b642 We conclude that when Palmer unilaterally canceled the May, 1997 deposition, he violated the District Court\u2019s deposition order.</p>\n<p id=\"ARb\">\u00b643 Regarding his deposition in June, 1997, Palmer appears to argue that he was only directed to \u201cappear\u201d at his deposition, that he was not directed to answer questions, and that he therefore did not violate the District Court\u2019s order. This argument is unpersuasive. When asked whether he would not \u201ctestify about any of [his] actions with respect to the representation of Mr. Dambrowski and in the underlying workers\u2019 compensation case in any regard unless [the Defendants] sign the proposed stipulationf,]\u201d Palmer responded, \u201c[t]hat\u2019s right. But I\u2019m here to answer other questions.\u201d Palmer\u2019s contention that he was willing to answer \u201cother\u201d questions is both irrelevant and disingenuous: the record establishes that he refused to answer any of the questions for which Respondents had sought his deposition. Further, Palmer\u2019s suggestion that Respondents \u201cterminated\u201d the deposition, thereby depriving him of an opportunity to object to individual questions, is also disingenuous. The record shows that Respondents proposed and Palmer agreed that they \u201crecess the deposition\u201d and present their dispute to the District Court. Palmer has flatly misstated the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">\u00b644 As previously discussed, Palmer could have moved to terminate or limit his examination under Rule 30(d), M.R.Civ.P. Palmer also could have answered questions under objection, as he eventually did at his June, 1998 deposition. However, Palmer eschewed both courses of action and refused to answer <em>any </em>questions concerning his representation of Dambrowski unless Respondents agreed to his stipulation. We conclude that Palmer clearly defied the orders of the District Court concerning his scheduled June, 1997 deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">\u00b645 Further, the record establishes that Respondents were prejudiced by Palmer\u2019s defiance of the District Court\u2019s orders. Both Champion and Compensation Adjusters and Posterino\u2019s counsel spent substantial time preparing for the depositions scheduled in May and June, 1997 and for their related motions and briefs. Nor has Palmer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>disputed the details of Respondents\u2019 itemized statements of fees and costs. We conclude that he has failed to rebut the prejudice that the Respondents have shown. <em>Compare Smith, </em>276 Mont. at 340, 916 P.2d at 97 (considering prejudice to parties in reviewing a district court\u2019s order of sanctions).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">\u00b646  Although the District Court could, for example, have dismissed the underlying action in the present case or made other orders under Rule 37(b)(2)(B), (C), and (D), M.R.Civ.P., the District Court ordered Palmer to reimburse Respondents for the costs and fees that they incurred as a result of his defiance of the District Court\u2019s orders. Further, we note that Palmer has not shown that his \u201cfailure to comply with [the District Court\u2019s orders] was \u2018substantially justified,\u2019 or that other circumstances make such an award unjust.\u201d <em>Delaware v. K-Decorators, Inc., </em>1999 MT 13, \u00b6 89, 293 Mont. 97, \u00b6 89, 973 P.2d 818, \u00b6 89. We conclude that the consequences imposed by the District Court, though severe, related appropriately \u201cto the extent and nature of the actual discovery abuse and the extent of the prejudice to the opposing [parties] which resulted] therefrom.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>276 Mont. at 340, 916 P.2d at 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">\u00b647 We hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in imposing discovery sanctions on Palmer.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">\u00b648 2. Whether the District Court erred in denying Palmer\u2019s motion to disqualify the Honorable Judge Larson.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">\u00b649 Palmer argues that when he filed his October, 1998 motion to disqualify Judge Larson, the District Court was divested of jurisdiction to make orders regarding the imposition of sanctions under \u00a7 3-1-805, MCA. Palmer argues that because the District Court imposed sanctions in April, 1998 without a \u201crequired hearing,\u201d the District Court \u201cprejudged\u201d the matter. In his affidavit, Palmer stated that \u201c[prejudice has been defined as a \u2018forejudgment\u2019 or \u2018preconceived opinion\u2019 \u201d but added that he \u201crespects Judge Larson as an individual and as a judge and considers him a man of integrity.\u201d Without citation to any legal authority, Palmer argues that \u201cprejudgment\u201d is tantamount to prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">\u00b650 We reject Palmer\u2019s argument. As previously discussed, Palmer received notice and an opportunity to be heard before the District Court assessed fees and costs. Thus, the factual premise for Palmer\u2019s argument is erroneous. Moreover, Palmer has pointed to nothing in the District Court\u2019s orders that suggests \u201cprejudgment\u201d or prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>\u00b651  In light of Palmer\u2019s failure in his affidavit to allege bias or prejudice, as required under \u00a7 3-1-805, MCA, we conclude that the District Court correctly determined that \u201c[Palmer\u2019s] motion to disqualify is complete[ly] inappropriate and without merit.\u201d We hold that the District Court did not err in denying Palmer\u2019s motion to disqualify Judge Larson.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">\u00b652 The orders of the District Court are affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b114-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES HUNT, NELSON and GRAY.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b107-10\">. Palmer argues that the issue of a hearing arose in the Application for writ of supervisory control (hereafter, Application) that he filed with this Court. Even accepting the dubious premise that the Application was substantively the equivalent of a request for hearing in district court, we note that he filed his Application in June, 1998, <em>one year </em>after Respondents moved for sanctions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
