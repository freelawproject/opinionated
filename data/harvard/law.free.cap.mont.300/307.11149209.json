We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-12\">\u00b62 The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in applying the 4-year mandatory minimum sentence for sexual intercourse without consent set forth in \u00a7 45-5-503(3)(a), MCA (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-13\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b332-14\">\u00b63 The State of Montana (State) charged Fauque by information with two counts of sexual intercourse without consent in violation of \u00a7 45-5-503, MCA (1997), and one count of sexual assault in violation of \u00a7 45-5-502, MCA (1997), for acts committed against his 14-year-old daughter. The parties subsequently entered into a plea agreement under which Fauque agreed to plead guilty to one count of sexual intercourse without consent and one count of sexual assault and the State agreed to dismiss the second count of sexual intercourse without consent. The District Court accepted Fauque\u2019s guilty plea, dismissed the second count of sexual intercourse without consent and ordered a presentence investigation report with a sex offender evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>\u00b64 Probation officer Cathy Murphy (Murphy) conducted the presentence investigation and counselor Kevin Wyse (Wyse) performed the sex offender evaluation. Wyse determined Fauque was a moderate risk for sexual reoffense and recommended that Fauque participate in an intensive outpatient sex offender treatment program. He further recommended that Fauque be incarcerated only if the treatment were unsuccessful. Murphy\u2019s presentence investigation report recommended that Fauque be sentenced to a term of 25 years in the MSP for each offense, with all time suspended, and that the sentences run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">\u00b65 At the sentencing hearing, Murphy testified that, in recommending only a lengthy suspended sentence, she overlooked \u00a7 46-18-201(8), MCA (1997), which she believed required a mandatory minimum 30-day period of incarceration. Fauque responded that this Court had held that, as long as there was no serious bodily injury, the 30-day mandatory minimum requirement could be suspended. He relied on a case in which this Court followed the so-called \u201crule of lenity\u201d and resolved ambiguities in sentencing statutes to the benefit of the defendant. He also argued for application of certain statutory exceptions to the mandatory minimum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">\u00b66 The District Court ultimately concluded that the 4-year mandatory minimum sentence set forth in \u00a7 45-5-503(3)(a), MCA (1997), applied and further determined that Fauque had failed to establish entitlement to the application of any \u00a7 46-18-222, MCA (1997), exceptions to that mandatory minimum sentence. Consequently, the court sentenced Fauque to a term of 25 years at the MSP on each count, with all but 4 years suspended, the sentences to run concurrently. Fauque appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">\n<em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">\u00b67 \u201cWe review a trial court\u2019s interpretation of the law, including questions of statutory interpretation, to determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation is correct.\u201d <em>State v. Montoya, </em>1999 MT 180, \u00b6 16, 295 Mont. 288, \u00b6 16, 983 P.2d 937, \u00b6 16 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">\u00b68 Did the District Court err in applying the 4-year mandatory minimum sentence for sexual intercourse without consent set forth in \u00a7 45-5-503(3) (a), MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">\u00b69 Fauque contends that a direct conflict exists between the mandatory minimum sentence for sexual intercourse without consent when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>the victim is less than 16 years old and the defendant is 3 or more years older set forth in \u00a7 45-5-503(3)(a), MCA (1997), and the 30-day mandatory minimum sentence for sexual intercourse without consent when the victim is less than 16 years old set forth in \u00a7 46-18-201(8), MCA (1997). Fauque further contends that the conflict creates an ambiguity which must be resolved in his favor under the so-called \u201crule of lenity.\u201d Because we conclude that no conflict exists, we need not address Fauque\u2019s \u201crule of lenity\u201d argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">\u00b610 We construe or interpret statutes in accordance with the intent of the Legislature. <em>State v. Christensen </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 374, 376, 877 P.2d 468, 469 (citation omitted). In doing so, we look first to the plain meaning of the words of the statute and, if the language is clear and unambiguous, no further interpretation is required. <em>Christensen, </em>265 Mont. at 377, 877 P.2d at 469 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"Az8\">\u00b611 Section 45-5-503(2), MCA (1997), sets forth the generally applicable sentences for a person convicted of sexual intercourse without consent and includes a mandatory minimum 2-year term of imprisonment. Section 45-5-503(3), MCA (1997), sets forth the sentences applicable to persons convicted of sexual intercourse without consent under certain specific circumstances. At issue in this case is \u00a7 45-5-503(3)(a), MCA (1997), under which the District Court sentenced Fauque. It provides in pertinent part that \u201c[i]f the victim [of sexual intercourse without consent] is less than 16 years old and the offender is 3 or more years older than the victim..., the offender shall be punished by... imprisonment in the state prison for a term not less than 4 years ..., except as provided in ... 46-18-222.\u201d Section 45-5-503(3)(a), MCA (1997). Section 46-18-201(8), MCA (1997), provides that if</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-5\">the victim was less than 16 years old, the imposition or execution of the first 30 days of a sentence of imprisonment imposed under 45-5-503 ... may not be deferred or suspended. Section 46-18-222 does not apply to the first 30 days of imprisonment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Section 46-18-222, MCA (1997), lists exceptions to statutory mandatory minimum sentences; if a defendant establishes the existence of one of these exceptions, the mandatory minimum sentence does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">\u00b612  The Legislature clearly intended the 4-year mandatory minimum sentence contained in \u00a7 45-5-503(3)(a), MCA (1997), to apply to a person convicted of sexual intercourse without consent when the victim is less than 16 years old and the offender is 3 or more years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>older than the victim. That is precisely the factual scenario before us in the present case. Fauque was 53 years old at the time of the offense and his daughter was 14. Thus, while the 4-year mandatory minimum sentence contained in \u00a7 45-5-503(3)(a), MCA (1997), is not applicable to any factual circumstances not set forth therein, it applies by its terms to all offenders \u2014 like Fauque \u2014 convicted on the facts set forth <em>\u201cexcept as provided in </em>... <em>46-18-222.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Here, the District Court determined that none of the \u00a7 46-18-222, MCA (1997), exceptions applies and Fauque does not challenge that determination on appeal. Consequently, the 4-year mandatory minimum sentence contained in \u00a7 45-5-503(3)(a), MCA (1997), is clearly applicable in sentencing Fauque.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">\u00b613  Aplain reading of \u00a7 46-18-201(8), MCA (1997), on the other hand, reflects the Legislature\u2019s intent that, on a conviction for sexual intercourse without consent involving a victim less than 16 years old, the first 30 days of any mandatory minimum sentence under \u00a7 45-5-503, MCA (1997), may not be deferred or suspended under any circumstances and, specifically, that the exceptions provided in \u00a7 46-18-222, MCA (1997), do not apply to the first 30 days. In other words, even where a \u00a7 46-18-222, MCA (1997), exception to the mandatory minimum sentence set forth in \u00a7 45-5-503(3)(a), MCA (1997), exists, a district court may not suspend the first 30 days of the term of imprisonment if the victim is less than 16 years old. In a situation like that before us in the present case, \u00a7 46-18-201(8), MCA (1997), simply does not come into play because no \u00a7 46-18-222, MCA (1997), exception to the 4-year minimum sentence mandated by \u00a7 45-5-503(3)(a), MCA (1997), exists. As a result, no conflict exists, the statutes are clear and unambiguous and we need go no further than their plain language. <em>See Christensen, </em>265 Mont. at 377, 877 P.2d at 469 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">\u00b614  We hold that the District Court did not err in applying the 4-year mandatory minimum sentence for sexual intercourse without consent set forth in \u00a7 45-5-503(3)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">\u00b615 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b335-10\">JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART, HUNT and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
