The District Court granted DPHHS long-term legal custody of T.Z. and J.Z. with the right to assign guardianship to the children\u2019s grandmother. Christina appeals the District Court\u2019s order. We affirm the order of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">\u00b62 The following issues are presented on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err when it failed to make specific find-</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">ings to support its award of long-term custody of T.Z. and J.Z. to DPHHS with the right to assign custody to the children\u2019s grandmother?</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err by deciding to award long-term legal custody without requiring a separate petition limited to that issue?</p>\n<p id=\"b547-12\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b547-13\">\u00b65 Christina Osterloth is the mother of two children, T.Z. and J.Z. T.Z. was born in March 1985 and J.Z. was born in April 1986. The children\u2019s father is deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-14\">\u00b66 On November 1,1996, the District Court found that T.Z. and J.Z. were youths in need of care, and granted the Broadwater County Department of Health and Human Services temporary custody of the children. Between 1996 and the time of this appeal, T.Z. and J.Z. have lived intermittently with both their mother and their grandmother, Phyllis Potter, under the supervision of DPHHS.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>\u00b67 On August 19,1999, the State petitioned the District Court for an order terminating the parental rights of Christina, or in the alter-ative, an order granting long-term custody of the children to DPHHS with the right to assign guardianship to Potter.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">\u00b68 Following a hearing, the District Court filed its findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order on November 3,1999.The District Court did not terminate Christina\u2019s parental rights; rather, the court granted DPHHS long-term custody with the right to assign custody to Potter. The District Court found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-5\">[Christina] is currently under a ten year Department of Corrections supervised sentence as of July 14, 1999. Christina has two felony drug convictions on her record and is currently attending Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-6\">In October 1996, a social worker for the Department of Family Services found [J.Z.] sitting in Christina\u2019s front yard. [J.Z.] indicated that his mother had locked up the house and was on an extended trip with her boyfriend. The children were left to fend for themselves. The children were under the \u201csupervision\u201d of [a] 17-year-old male who had pending drug charges against him in Helena, Montana. The social worker noted that the house was filthy, with beer cans strewn around and that the children had not attended school that week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-7\">It clearly appears to this Court that Christina has failed in her treatment plan. On February 11,1999, she failed a drug test at St. Peter\u2019s Community Hospital.... It should be noted that Christina did pass a subsequent drug screen on July 6,1999.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-8\">The Court must also note that, of the four people residing in Christina\u2019s house in October 1996, all four of them have been since convicted of felonies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-9\">The Court notes that the past is the best predictor of the future. Christina has been given many chances to straighten herself out and retain custody of her children. However, she is unable to focus on anything other than her own needs, be they emotional or chemical. She was warned by Wendy Cook that this last treatment plan was her last chance but despite that she has failed to comply with the treatment plan and has continued to attempt to sabotage her children\u2019s stability and peace of mind. The Court has no trouble at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>all in entering a finding that Christina is unable to distinguish between the children\u2019s best interests and her own perceived interests.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">The District Court also found that since J.Z. began living with Potter he became involved in the community and improved in school; and that J.Z. expressed a desire to continue living with Potter. With respect to T.Z. the District Court found that, although Christina was overtly manipulating T.Z. to resist placement with Potter, T.Z. improved in school and became involved in the community. The District Court then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-5\">The Court finds that the continuation of the parent/child legal relationship will likely result in continued abuse or neglect if the children are returned to Christina, and that the conduct and condition of Christina renders her unfit, unable and unwilling to give the children adequate parental care.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Nevertheless, the District Court did find that \u201cit would be in the best interest of the children if their mother were allowed to visit with them, but only as directed and determined by the Department of Public Health and Human Services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">\u00b69 Based on these findings the District Court granted DPHHS long-term legal custody of J.Z. and T.Z. The District Court also granted DPHHS the right to assign guardianship of J.Z. and T.Z. to Potter. Christina appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">\u00b610 We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>In re J.N. and A.N., </em>1999 MT 64, \u00b6 11, 293 Mont. 524, \u00b6 11, 977 P.2d 317, \u00b6 11. We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether the court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous. <em>In re </em>J.N., \u00b6 11. A finding of fact is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence; if the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence; or if, after reviewing the record, this Court is left with a definite and firm conviction that the district court made a mistake. <em>In re J.N., </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b549-11\">\u00b611 Were the District Court\u2019s findings sufficiently specific to support its award of long-term custody of T.Z. and J.Z. to DPHHS with the right to assign custody to the children\u2019s grandmother?</p>\n<p id=\"b549-12\">\u00b612 Christina contends that when the District Court granted DPHHS long-term legal custody, it did so based on evidence offered in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>support of the petition to terminate parental rights and that there was insufficient evidence to support long-term custody. She argues that the District Court based its decision on law applicable to termination of her parental rights, not \u00a7 41-3-412, MCA, the statute for long-term custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">\u00b613 The State responds that the youth in need of care statutes give the district court broad discretion to act in the children\u2019s best interest and to make certain that children who are unable to return to their parents do not remain in temporary foster care.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">\u00b614  A natural parent\u2019s right to custody of a child is a fundamental liberty interest, which must be protected by fundamentally fair procedures. <em>In re J.N., </em>\u00b6 12. However, if the State follows fundamentally fair procedures, the State can divest a parent of custody. Section 41-3-406(5), MCA, provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-6\">Before the expiration of the order for temporary legal custody, the county attorney, the attorney general, or an attorney hired by the county shall petition for one of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-7\">(b) termination of the parent-child legal relationship and either; [or]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-8\">(c) long-term custody pursuant to 41-3-412;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">The procedure for termination of the parent-child legal relationship is set forth in \u00a7 41-3-601, MCA, et. seq. The procedure for long-term custody is set forth in \u00a7 41-3-412, MCA, which provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-10\">(6) If the permanency plan hearing results in a finding that reunification of the child with the child\u2019s parent or guardian is not in the best interests of the child, <em>a subsequent petition filed </em>must be one of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-11\">(c) long-term custody of a child if the evidence demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence, <em>which is reflected in specific findings by the court, </em>that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-12\">(i) the child has an emotional or mental handicap that is so severe that the child cannot function in a family setting and the best interests of the child are served by placement in a residential or group setting;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>(ii) the child is at least 16 years of age and is participating in an independent living program and that termination of parental rights is not in the best interests of the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-4\">(iii) the child\u2019s parent is incarcerated and circumstances, including placement of the child and continued, frequent contact with the parent, indicate that it would not be in the best interests of the child to terminate parental rights of that parent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-5\">(iv) the child is in a group of siblings, at least one of whom meets the requirements of subsections (6)(c)(v)(A) through (6)(c)(v)(D), and the best interests of the child will be met by continued placement in the sibling group in long-term foster care; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-6\">(v) the child is at least 12 years of age and meets the following criteria:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-7\">(A) the child has been adjudicated a youth in need of care;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-8\">(B) the department has made reasonable efforts to reunite the parent and child, further efforts by the department would likely be unproductive, and reunification of the child with the parent or guardian would be contrary to the best interests of the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-9\">(C) termination of parental rights to the child is not in the child\u2019s best interests; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-10\">(D) the child has been in a placement in which the foster parent has committed to the long-term care and to a relationship with the child, and it is in the best interests of the child to remain in that placement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-11\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b551-12\">\u00b615 The narrow issue in this case is whether the District Court\u2019s findings were sufficiently specific pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-412(6)(c)(v), MCA. Christina does not contend that the District Court\u2019s findings are erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-13\">\u00b616  The District Court found that J.Z. and T.Z. were youths in need of care on November 1, 1996. The District Court found that DPHHS developed treatment plans for Christina; that Cook warned her that the last treatment plan was her last chance; and that \u201cChristina has been given many chances to straighten herself out and retain custody of her children.\u201d The District Court also found that \u201ccontinuation of the parent/child legal relationship will likely result in continued abuse or neglect if the children are returned to Christina, and that the conduct and condition of Christina renders her unfit, unable and unwilling to give the children adequate parental care.\u201d These findings are sufficiently specific with respect to \u00a7 41-3-412(6)(c)(v)(A) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>and (B), MCA, to satisfy the \u201cspecific findings\u201d requirement of \u00a7 41-3-412(6)(c), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">\u00b617 Although the District Court found that it was not in J.Z. and T.Z.\u2019s best interest to live with Christina it found that \u201cit would be in the best interest of the children if their mother were allowed to visit with them.\u201d This finding is sufficiently specific with respect to \u00a7 41-3-412(6)(c)(v)(C), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">\u00b618 Finally, the District Court found that since J.Z. and T.Z. began living with Potter, they improved in school and became more socially involved. The District Court also found that Potter\u2019s home was thoroughly reviewed by the State of Idaho and that Potter is willing to act as the children\u2019s guardian. This finding is sufficiently specific with respect to \u00a7 41-3-412(6)(c)(v)(D), MCA. Accordingly, we hold the District Court\u2019s findings were sufficiently specific to support its award of long-term custody of T.Z. and J.Z. to DPHHS with the right to assign custody to the children\u2019s grandmother, Potter.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">\u00b6 19 Did the District Court err by deciding to award long-term legal custody without requiring a separate petition limited to that issue? \u00b620 Christina contends that following the November 1999 hearing, the State failed to file a subsequent petition p\u00farsuant to \u00a7 41-3-412(6), MCA, and that she was, therefore, denied sufficient notice. However, the language of \u00a7 41-3-412(6), MCA, which states \u201ca subsequent petition filed must be one of the following,\u201d must be read in conjunction with the language of \u00a7 41-3-412(1), MCA, which states \u201c[t]he permanency plan hearing may be combined with a hearing that is required in other sections of this part.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">\u00b621  In this case, since the permanency hearing was combined with the termination hearing, the petition for long-term legal custody was not filed subsequent to the November 29, 1999, hearing. The State\u2019s petition was for termination of parental rights or in the alternative, for long-term legal custody. Therefore, \u00a7 41-3-412(6), MCA, does not require that the State\u2019s petition for long-term legal custody be filed subsequent to the hearing. The State filed its petition for long-term legal custody of T.Z. and J.Z., which is permitted pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-412(c), MCA, at the same time that it filed its petition to terminate Christina\u2019s parental rights on August 19,1999. The District Court held a combined hearing on November 29,1999. Therefore, the alternative petition provided Christina with sufficient notice of the issues that would be raised at the hearing. We hold that the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>Court did not err when it awarded long-term legal custody without requiring a separate petition limited to that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">\u00b622 Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b553-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES REGNIER, NELSON and GRAY concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
