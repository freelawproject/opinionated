Watters and Janet M. Watters (Watters), and denying its cross-motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">\u00b62 We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">\u00b63 Guaranty has raised two issues which we restate as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-6\">1. Once clear liability was established and damages undisputedly exceeded policy limits, did Guaranty violate Montana\u2019s Unfair Trade Practices Act by conditioning the payment of policy limits on the Watters\u2019 agreement to provide a full and final release of all liability in favor of its insured?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-7\">2. Did Guaranty have a reasonable basis in law or in fact for contesting the Watters\u2019 claim, and therefore may not be found liable for violating Montana\u2019s Unfair Trade Practices Act?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">\u00b64 Generally, the underlying facts are not in dispute and have been stipulated to pursuant to a November 2, 1998 judgment issued by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">\u00b65 On October 31, 1993, the Watters suffered serious physical injuries following a collision between their car and one driven by Robert O. Moore (Moore), near Bozeman, Montana. At the time, Moore was insured by Guaranty for the statutory mandatory minimum amounts of $25,000 for bodily injury per person, $50,000 for bodily injury per accident, and $10,000 for property damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-11\">\u00b66 Guaranty investigated the accident and determined that Moore was at fault and that the Watters\u2019 personal injury claims entitled them to Moore\u2019s policy limits of $50,000. By January 4, 1994, medical bills for the Watters had reached approximately $90,000. Ultimately, the Watters incurred in excess of $100,000 in medical bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-12\">\u00b67 Within one week of the accident, on November 5, 1993, Guaranty informed Moore that \u201cshould the claimant pursue recovery through a lawsuit, the possibility does exist that a judgment could be awarded against you in excess of your insurance coverage.\u201d Guaranty further informed Moore that he could obtain an attorney at his own expense to represent him regarding \u201cany excess exposure which now exists or may exist in the future.\u201d Guaranty emphasized its insurance policy provision that \u201csettlement of any claim or suit remains within the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>cretion of our company.\u201d This notice to Moore was followed up in a letter, dated February 17, 1994, in which Guaranty again advised Moore that Guaranty would not be liable for a judgment in excess of policy limits, and that Moore may wish to retain counsel at his expense, recognizing that \u201cyou or your attorney may disagree with the approach taken by Guaranty National.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">\u00b68 With liability and entitlement to the policy limits clearly established, the Watters, in a December 23, 1993 letter, demanded payment of Moore\u2019s bodily injury policy limits of $50,000. The Watters would not, however, agree to execute a full and final release of all liability in favor of Moore. Counsel for Watters also notified counsel for Guaranty that \u201cany attempt to withhold payment to force a release would bean Unfair Claims Settlement Practice.\u201d Guaranty refused to pay the policy limits without a full and final liability release.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">\u00b69 On January 5, 1994, the Watters filed suit for personal injuries against Moore in the Eighteenth Judicial District Court. In his February 22, 1994 Answer, filed by counsel for Guaranty on his behalf, Moore admitted fault for the accident. By this time, both Guaranty and the Watters realized that Moore had no assets to contribute to an excess judgment. During this time, counsel for Watters reached a claim settlement with Guaranty for $9,161.07 under Moore\u2019s $10,000 property damage coverage. This settlement, however, apparently did not involve an absolute liability release that affected the bodily injury coverage portion of Moore\u2019s policy with Guaranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">\u00b610 In an exchange of letters of negotiation during 1994, Guaranty continued to offer to pay the policy limits, but not unless the Watters agreed to execute a full and final liability release in favor of Moore. Throughout this period, Guaranty asserted that its primary obligation was to protect the interests of its insured. Guaranty informed the Watters that if it paid them Moore\u2019s policy limits, it would no longer have an obligation to defend Moore in the lawsuit. Moore\u2019s policy with Guaranty stated that \u201c[o]ur payment of the limits of liability ends our duty to defend or settle, but the tender of the limits of liability before a judgment or settlement does not relieve us of our duty to defend.\u201d Under the same Part, the policy provided that \u201c[w]e will defend any such suit at our own expense, with counsel of our choice, or, as we deem appropriate, we may settle any claim or suit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">\u00b611 In turn, the Watters offered to accept $49,950 \u2014 $50 below the policy limits \u2014 thereby allowing Guaranty to continue its obligation to defend its insured, yet still make a prompt payment to the Watters. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>The Watters further offered that they would execute a partial release to the extent of this payment by Guaranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">\u00b612 Guaranty rejected this offer, and reaffirmed that a full and final release must be agreed to before any policy proceeds would be released to the Watters. Guaranty also asserted that paying the policy limits without a full release would essentially place it in the role of funding the Watters\u2019 litigation against Moore, which would be an act of bad faith. Guaranty did, however, suggest two other options: (1) depositing the $50,000 with the court pending a declaratory judgment action to determine the respective party\u2019s rights and obligations; and (2) deposing Moore so that the Watters could be satisfied that he did not have sufficient assets to pay any excess judgment against him.</p>\n<p id=\"AVy\">\u00b613 On October 14, 1994, the Watters filed suit against Guaranty, alleging breaches of Montana\u2019s Unfair Trade Practices Act (UTPA), under \u00a7 33-18-201(6) and (13), MCA. Guaranty asserted in its Answer that, due to Moore\u2019s and his attorney\u2019s demand that Guaranty secure a full release for Moore, its primary obligation was to protect his interests and provide him with a defense in the underlying lawsuit. The Answer also included an admission that Moore was \u201cresponsible for reasonable damages proximately resulting from the accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">\u00b614 By December of 1994, Guaranty retained an attorney to defend Moore in the personal injury lawsuit pursuant to its contractual obligations under Moore\u2019s policy. Consequently, Moore, through his counsel, demanded that Guaranty continue to defend Moore until he received an unconditional release. Contrary to Guaranty\u2019s October 14th Answer, however, it is unclear that Moore ever made a demand for an absolute release prior to this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">\u00b615 The Watters filed for summary judgment in their UTPA claim against Guaranty on January 25, 1995. Guaranty filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on March 13, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">\u00b616 On March 8, 1995, the policy limits of $50,000 were \u201ctendered\u201d by Guaranty to the court in the Watters\u2019 personal injury lawsuit against Moore. At this time, counsel for Moore also asserted that Moore was considering bankruptcy, hoping to discharge any judgment that exceeded the policy limits. The Watters were also informed that the $50,000 policy limits may be exposed to demands by other creditors should the bankruptcy action proceed. Although denied at oral argument before this Court, the record indicates that counsel for Moore believed that Guaranty was willing to pay the costs and fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>associated with Moore\u2019s bankruptcy, and testified to this fact in his deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-3\">\u00b617 On May 11, 1995, approximately one-and-a-half years after the accident, the Watters executed a full and final liability release in favor of Moore, reserving any and all claims against Guaranty. The Watters asserted they took this action because they were in financial need due to medical creditor claims, as well as the uncertainty presented by Moore\u2019s potential action in bankruptcy. On May 12, 1995, the parties signed a stipulation distributing the policy limits of $50,000 plus interest to the Watters.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">\u00b618 On June 7, 1996, the District Court granted the Watters\u2019 motion for summary judgment and denied Guaranty\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment. In doing so, the court determined that Guaranty had engaged in an unfair claims settlement practice in violation of UTPA, in that it had a \u201cduty to release the funds in this case.\u201d The court agreed with the Watters\u2019 argument that UTPA requires insurance carriers to effectuate prompt and fair settlements, and this requirement \u201ctakes precedence over the private contractual agreement to defend between a carrier and its insured.\u201d The court also relied on a similarly decided case from Massachusetts, <em>Thaler v. American Ins. Co. </em>(Mass.App.Ct. 1993), 614 N.E.2d 1021. With liability established, the only issue remaining for determination at trial was damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">\u00b619 On November 2, 1998, the court entered a judgment against Guaranty in favor of the Watters for $110,000, pursuant to the parties\u2019 stipulation on damages. The parties agreed to stipulate to this sum, pending the outcome of this appeal, in order to avoid trial if remand was necessary. Guaranty placed this sima with the District Court. This cause was heard on oral argument October 14, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">\u00b620 This Court reviews an order granting summary judgment <em>de novo </em>under Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P, by utilizing the same criteria as the district court. <em>See Treichel v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(1997), 280 Mont. 443, 446, 930 P.2d 661, 663. Summary judgment is a remedy which should be granted when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See </em>Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P. The procedure should never be substituted for trial if a material factual controversy exists. <em>See Payne Realty v. First Sec. Bank </em>(1993), 256 Mont. 19, 24, 844 P.2d 90, 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>\u00b621 Here, the parties have stipulated to all material facts. Therefore, we will review this matter to determine whether the Watters are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. On review, all reasonable inferences that might be drawn from the offered evidence should be drawn in favor of the party opposing summary judgment. <em>See Payne, </em>256 Mont. at 24-25, 844 P.2d at 93. Further, we have held that this Court may reverse a district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment and order it to enter summary judgment in favor of the other party when there are no issues of material fact and all of the facts bearing on the issues are before the court. <em>See Kenner v. Moran </em>(1994), 263 Mont. 368, 375, 868 P.2d 620, 624.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">\u00b622 Accordingly, if we determine that as a matter of law Guaranty violated UTPA as alleged and subsequently determined by the District Court, summary judgment in favor of the Watters will be proper. The stipulated judgment should then be entered as final in their favor. If, on the other hand, we determine subject to our <em>de novo </em>review that, as a matter of law, Guaranty did not violate UTPA when it refused to pay the policy limits to the Watters, or that its affirmative defense excuses any violation, this matter will be remanded for dismissal of the stipulated judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">\u00b623 The focal issue presented here posed a Hobson\u2019s choice for each party.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">\u00b624 Guaranty had to choose between either making payment of policy limits to the Watters without obtaining a full and final liability release \u2014 which allegedly would have given rise to a bad faith or breach of contract claim by its insured \u2014 or withholding payment pending the outcome of litigation, which potentially would have given rise to an unfair trade practice claim by the Watters. As case law from other jurisdictions makes clear, Guaranty is by no means the first insurer to find itself in this catch-22. <em>See, e.g., Lehto v. Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(Cal.Ct.App. 1994), 36 Cal.Rptr.2d 814, 823; <em>Gallagher v. Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(N.D.W.Va. 1999), 74 F.Supp.2d 652, 656.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">\u00b625 Relying on our decision in <em>Juedeman v. National Farmers Union </em>(1992), 253 Mont. 278, 833 P.2d 191, Guaranty chose the latter course of action, and, as predicted, the Watters brought this unfair trade practice claim. Guaranty asserts that by following the clear rule set forth in <em>Juedeman, </em>at the time, it did not act in bad faith in denying the Watters\u2019 claim because it had, pursuant to \u00a7 33-18-242(5), MCA, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>\u201creasonable basis in law\u201d for the difficult choice it made, and in good faith considered its insured\u2019s interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">\u00b626 The Watters\u2019 choices were equally unenviable. As innocent parties, the Watters were required to choose either incomplete compensation for severe and permanent injuries caused by another person who had admitted full liability, or proceed into potentially prolonged litigation without the resources necessary to fulfill their current obligations resulting from their injuries. Indeed, this dispute has now entered its sixth year and from the record it is clear that the Watters suffered potentially noncompensable damage to their economic well being, once medical-bill creditors pursued payment for the debts incurred. Further, agreeing to such a full and final release could have interfered with their own insurer\u2019s subrogation rights, and thereby jeopardized the Watters\u2019 rights to underinsured coverage pursuant to the terms of their policy. Equally clear, is the fact that staving off such damages factored into the Watters\u2019 agreement to release Moore in exchange for policy limits in May of 1995. Either choice seemingly defies the legal principles that for every wrong there is a remedy, <em>see </em>\u00a7 1-3-214, MCA; <em>STC, Inc. v. City of Billings </em>(1975), 168 Mont. 364, 372, 543 P.2d 374, 378, and that a tortiously injured party should be returned to his or her rightful position that \u201cthe party would have attained had the wrong not occurred.\u201d <em>Butler v. Germann </em>(1991), 251 Mont. 107, 110, 822 P.2d 1067, 1069.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">\u00b627 Regardless of the outcome here, this case requires that we clarify prior case law that does not squarely provide a clear rule upon which parties such as Guaranty and the Watters may rely under these specific factual circumstances. Namely, at the behest of the parties, we must reconcile today any conflict between our decisions in <em>Juedeman </em>and <em>Ridley v. Guaranty Nat. Ins. Co. </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 325, 951 P.2d 987, in the context of Montana\u2019s Unfair Trade Practices Act, which governs the business of insurance, as well as public policy under Montana\u2019s Motor Vehicle Safety-Responsibility Act. In doing so, we must determine several corollary legal issues pertaining to what constitutes bad faith on the part of insurers in Montana. Thus, we proceed to the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">\n<em>ISSUE 1</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">\n<em>Once clear liability was established and damages undisputedly exceeded policy limits, did Guaranty violate Montana\u2019s Unfair Trade Practices Act by conditioning the payment of policy limits on the </em>\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>\n<em>Watters\u2019 agreement to provide a full and final release of all liability in favor of its insured?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">\u00b628  As argued by both parties, this issue must first be properly cast within the framework of Montana\u2019s Motor Vehicle Safety-Responsibility Act. Specifically, under \u00a7 61-6-103, MCA, all owners and operators of motor vehicles must carry mandatory liability insurance, in the minimum amounts of $25,000 \u201cbecause of bodily injury to or death of one person in any one accident;\u201d $50,000 \u201cbecause of bodily injury to or death of two or more persons in any one accident,\u201d and $10,000 \u201cbecause of injury to or destruction of property of others in any one accident.\u201d See \u00a7 61-6-103(2)(b)(i)-(iii), MCA. Under this Act, the \u201cliability of the insurance carrier with respect to the insurance required by this part becomes <em>absolute </em>whenever injury or damage covered by the motor vehicle liability policy occurs.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 61-6-103(6)(a), MCA (emphasis added). This standard of absolute liability does not apply to insurance coverage that exceeds the mandatory minimum limits. <em>See </em>\u00a7 61-6-103(8), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">\u00b629  Further, we have held that \u201c[i]t is clear that the mandatory liability insurance law seeks to protect members of the general public who are innocent victims of automobile accidents,\u201d and that \u00a7 61-6-301, MCA, \u201cwas enacted for the benefit of the public and not for the benefit of the insured.\u201d <em>Iowa Mut. Ins. Co. v. Davis </em>(1988), 231 Mont. 166, 170-71, 752 P.2d 166, 169. <em>See also Ridley, </em>286 Mont. at 335, 951 P.2d at 993 (citingloica <em>Mutual </em>and interpreting UTPA, subsection (6) of \u00a7 33-18-201, MCA, as assuring prompt payment of damages for which an insurer is clearly obligated).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">\u00b630 The insurance policy at issue here provided only the statutory minimum amounts of insurance. Accordingly, the discussion and holdings herein are limited by the foregoing, and specifically limited to those claims for damages brought by a third-party claimant against a clearly liable party and his or her automobile liability insurer, and only for the mandatory coverage limits required under \u00a7 61-6-103(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">\n<em>A. Defining \u201cSettlements\u201d under UTPA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Al-\">\u00b631 In this matter, a preliminary battle of semantics is inevitable. Subsection (6) of \u00a7 33-18-201, MCA, provides that no insurer may \u201cneglect to attempt in good faith to effectuate prompt, fair, and equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become reasonably clear.\u201d The term \u201csettlement\u201d is not defined under UTPA, or under statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>provisions governing motor vehicles or the insurance trade in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">\u00b632 According to Guaranty\u2019s version of the insurance trade\u2019s lexicon, \u201cpayment\u201d of policy limits is not a \u201csettlement\u201d unless the third-party claimant executes a full and final release of all liability in favor of the insured. In support of its position, Guaranty relies on <em>Juedeman, </em>where this Court concluded that \u201cwithout an agreement to release, there is no offer for settlement,\u201d and consequently no viable claim of bad faith against the insurer for refusing such an offer, under \u00a7 33-18-201(6), MCA. <em>Juedeman, </em>253 Mont. at 281, 833 P.2d at 193 (citing <em>Thompson v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(1973), 161 Mont. 207, 219-20, 505 P.2d 423, 430).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">\u00b633 In <em>Thompson, </em>from which we derived this rule, we explained that even an insurance company\u2019s refusal of a claimant\u2019s offer of a covenant not to sue could not be construed as a bad faith refusal of a \u201csettlement offer.\u201d We stated that \u201c[h]ad State Farm accepted that offer, it would not have been protecting Thompson [its insured] under the circumstances.\u201d Accordingly, no \u201coffer of settlement\u201d was ever made by the third-party claimant. <em>Thompson, </em>161 Mont. at 219, 505 P.2d at 430.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">\u00b634 Guaranty also directs our attention to other jurisdictions, which also purportedly conclude that a full and final release of an insured is the <em>sine qua non </em>of a \u201csettlement.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Lazaris v. Metropolitan Property &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. </em>(Mass. 1998), 703 N.E.2d 205, 207 (stating that \u201cto pay without a release is not a settlement\u201d and \u201csettlement typically involves the \u2018release or termination of further claims against the tortfeasor\u2019 \u201d) (citations omitted); <em>Trinity Universal Ins. Co. v. Bleeker </em>(Tex. 1998), 966 S.W.2d 489, 491(stating that under the common law \u201cStowers\u201d doctrine, a settlement demand must propose to release the insured fully in exchange for a stated sum of money).</p>\n<p id=\"At4U\">\u00b635 Under the facts here, according to Guaranty, by definition no \u201csettlement\u201d was ever proffered from the Watters\u2019 side of the negotiation table. Thus, as a matter of law Guaranty could not have violated UTPA, under \u00a7 33-18-201(6), MCA, by flatly refusing any overtures of payment that did not provide an absolute release of all liability. Rather, Guaranty\u2019s argument suggests that under the holding in <em>Juedeman, </em>the party that should shoulder the blame for not effectuating a prompt settlement is the Watters, not Guaranty, because they are the ones who refused the only legitimate \u201csettlement\u201d offer: policy limits in exchange for a full and final release.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>\u00b636 Guaranty\u2019s position overlooks one minor facet of this matter: Guaranty promptly reached a \u201csettlement\u201d with the Watters in January of 1994. Guaranty agreed to pay the Watters $9,161.07 for property damage within Moore\u2019s mandatory minimum $10,000 policy limits. This \u201csettlement\u201d was apparently achieved without the Watters executing a full and final release of all further liability in Moore\u2019s favor, or Guaranty balking at such a settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">\u00b637 That circumstances may arise where a \u201csettlement\u201d may be reached without a full and final release of all liability, as the property \u201csettlement\u201d suggests, comports with our discussion of this term in <em>Ridley. </em>In that case, the appellant, Ridley, contended that Guaranty was liable for medical expenses caused by its insured when liability was reasonably clear, without regard to whether <em>a </em>final settlement was or could be agreed upon, because subsection (6) of \u00a7 33-18-201, MCA, by its plain language, makes no reference to a final settlement of all claims, but refers instead to \u201csettlements.\u201d <em>Ridley, </em>286 Mont. at 333, 951 P.2d at 991. We agreed with Ridley, and concluded that both subsections (6) and (13) of \u00a7 33-18-201, MCA, by their terms imposed an obligation to make payments for medical expenses in advance of final settlement. <em>Ridley, </em>286 Mont. at 334, 951 P.2d at 992. We further concluded that the language of \u00a7 33-18-201(6), MCA, did not impose a requirement that <em>all disputes </em>or <em>all claims </em>be resolved between two parties. <em>Ridley, </em>286 Mont. at 334, 951 P.2d at 992.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ag_\">\u00b638 We also noted in <em>Ridley </em>that the clear language of subsection (13), under \u00a7 33-18-201, MCA, provides that one auto accident or \u201coccurrence\u201d may produce more than one claim against an insurer, which in turn may produce more than one settlement under more than one portion of \u201cthe insurance policy coverage.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 33-18-201(13), MCA (prohibiting the failure to \u201cpromptly settle <em>claims, </em>if liability has become reasonably clear, under one portion of the insurance policy coverage in order to influence <em>settlements </em>under other <em>portions </em>of the insurance policy coverage\u201d) (emphasis added). <em>See also </em>46A C.J.S. <em>Insurance </em>\u00a7 1351 (1993) (stating that a settlement with respect to one item of loss does not preclude recovery on the policy with respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>other items, and \u201c[a]n insurance company by settling one claim arising from an occurrence, may still deny coverage as to another claim arising from the same occurrence\u201d). As explained above, this was precisely the nature of the \u201csettlement\u201d for property damage under Moore\u2019s policy, which partially discharged his obligation to the Watters for damages arising from the one accident without a full and final release of all other liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">\u00b639  The foregoing reasoning in <em>Ridley </em>accords with the general, governing principles of contract law from which the law of settlements is derived. A release, as a matter of law, is nothing more than an accord and satisfaction, or, one of several ways in which an obligation, contractually, may be discharged or \u201csettled\u201d for less than or for something different than what is owed. <em>See </em>\u00a7 28-1-1401 and 1402, MCA (describing accord and satisfaction); <em>Hetherington v. Ford Motor Co. </em>(1993), 257 Mont. 395, 401-402, 849 P.2d 1039, 1043-44 (distinguishing executory accord from substituted contract). <em>See also </em>\u00a7 28-1-1502 (describing kinds of novation); \u00a7 28-1-1601 (describing extinction of an obligation by a release); 66 Am. Jur.2d <em>Release </em>\u00a7 1 (1973) (distinguishing between a release and a \u201csettlement,\u201d and providing that a settlement often involves a \u201cpayment, a release, a covenant not to sue, a promise to discontinue a pending suit, or a receipt\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">\u00b640  On the other hand, the term \u201csettlement\u201d as used throughout UTPA is synonymous with an enforceable bilateral contract that discharges a future or existing obligation. <em>See Carlson v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(D.Mont. 1999), 76 F.Supp.2d 1069, 1079; 46A C.J.S. <em>Insurance </em>\u00a7 1348 (1993) (stating that a compromise or settlement \u201cmust have all the essential elements of a contract,\u201d and its validity is not affected \u201cby whether the settlement is favorable or unfavorable to the insured\u201d). Accordingly, a claim brought by a third party demanding payment of an insured\u2019s policy limits may be \u201csettled\u201d with the insurer within the meaning of UTPA, if the resulting agreement vests the parties with the right to enforce the \u201csettlement\u201d by bringing an action for breach of contract. <em>See Carlson, </em>76 F.Supp. at 1079. The early \u201csettlement\u201d for property damage in this matter epitomizes this very point.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">\u00b641 Based on the foregoing, we conclude that to absolutely require that a \u201csettlement\u201d between a third-party claimant and a clearly liable party\u2019s insurer, under all circumstances, must include as a material element a full and final release of all liability would add judicial gloss to the statutory language of \u00a7 33-18-201(6), MCA\u2014a gloss that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>has been applied, we might add, in other jurisdictions for the necessary sake of maintaining a bright, albeit harsh, line in their bad faith jurisprudence. <em>See, e.g., Lazaris, </em>703 N.E.2d at 206-207 (determining <em>sua sponte </em>in a case where liability was <em>unclear, </em>that payment of claims without a full release in cases where liability is <em>clear </em>does not constitute a \u201csettlement\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As this Court has often expressed, in a variety of applications, mere technicalities that threaten to diminish the ends of substantial right and justice must be avoided. <em>See, e.g., Waggoner v. Glacier Colony of Hutterites </em>(1953), 127 Mont. 140, 150, 258 P.2d 1162, 1167. Likewise, a statute is to be \u201cread as a whole and construed so as to avoid absurd results.\u201d <em>Clover Leaf Dairy v. State </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 380, 388-89, 948 P.2d 1164, 1169 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"AMu\">\u00b642 By concluding that a \u201csettlement\u201d between the Watters and Guaranty, under \u00a7 33-18-201(6), MCA, for the payment of policy limits was legally possible without the Watters executing a full and final release of all liability, we must necessarily turn to the issue of whether the execution of such a \u201csettlement\u201d by Guaranty would have <em>per se </em>breached its duty of good faith owed to its insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">\n<em>B. Guaranty\u2019s Potential \u201cBad Faith\u201d Liability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ApWO\">\u00b643 Guaranty strenuously argues that had it paid the policy limits to the Watters without obtaining in return a full and final release of all liability for its insured, \u201cit undoubtedly would have been sued by Moore for \u2018bad faith\u2019 and breach of the insurance contract.\u201d Thus, Guaranty contends that it had no choice but to protect the interests of its insured under the circumstances. The underlying rationale, Guaranty maintains, is that it simply cannot place the interests of a third-party claimant above those of its insured to whom it owes a fi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>duciary duty. We conclude that in this particular instance, Guaranty\u2019s \u201ccatch-22\u201d is illusory, at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">\u00b644 Guaranty\u2019s alleged liability for bad faith is based on a reasonable forecast of future events: after payment of the $50,000 policy limits, Moore would have been \u201chung out to dry\u201d for whatever judgment in excess of this amount the Watters could obtain, and quite possibly without the assistance of counsel provided under his policy with Guaranty. However, precisely on what grounds this predicament would have confounded Moore\u2019s reasonable expectations under his policy with Guaranty, and consequently given rise to a viable bad faith claim under UTPA is less than clear. <em>See generally American Family Mut. Ins. Co. v. Livengood, </em>1998 MT 329, \u00b6 32, 292 Mont. 244, \u00b6 32, 970 P.2d 1054, \u00b6 32 (providing that insured\u2019s expectations of policy \u201cshould be honored notwithstanding the fact that a painstaking study of the policy would have negated those expectations\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">\u00b645 First, several of the decisions from courts which Guaranty assert constitute a \u201cmajority rule\u201d do not address the same factual scenario as here. As mentioned earlier, one court resolved the issue <em>sua sponte. See Lazaris, </em>703 N.E.2d at 207. Others were concerned with the issue of multiple insureds under one policy. <em>See Lehto v. Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(Cal.Ct.App. 1994), 36 Cal.Rptr.2d 814 (insurer does not commit bad faith by refusing third-party claimant offer to release one of two joint tortfeasors); <em>Strauss v. Farmers Ins. Exch. </em>(Cal.Ct.App. 1994), 31 Cal.Rptr.2d 811 (claimant offers to release one of three joint tortfeasors); <em>Premier Ins. Co. of Mass. v. Furtado </em>(Mass. 1998), 703 N.E.2d 208 (multiple insureds).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">\u00b646 Still others do not address a common law or statutory claim for bad faith. <em>See Trinity Universal Ins. Co. v. Bleeker </em>(Tex. 1998), 966 S.W.2d 489, 491 (discussing common law \u201cStowers\u201d duty owed to insured under negligence theory).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">\u00b647 Further still, those \u201cmajority rule\u201d courts that were actually faced with similar facts as those identified here decided the issue based on the holdings from the foregoing courts without distinguishing the facts. <em>See, e.g., Gallagher v. Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(N.D.W.Va. 1999), 74 F.Supp.2d 652, 656 (citing <em>Strauss, Lehto, </em>and <em>Lazaris).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">\u00b648 Finally, others simply offered the \u201cmajority rule\u201d via dictum. <em>See Pareti v. Sentry Indem. Co. </em>(La. 1988), 536 So.2d 417, 424 (suggesting, but not holding, that payment of policy limits which does not release the insured from a pending claim raises \u201cserious questions\u201d as to whether insurer discharged its policy obligations in good faith); <em>Cook </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number><em>v. Trinity Universal of Kansas </em>(Ala. 1991), 584 So.2d 813, 815 (stating that it is \u201cwise\u201d to demand that the creditor, as a condition of settlement, sign a release acknowledging extinguishment of the debt).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">\u00b649 On the other hand, several courts which have addressed factual circumstances identical to those found here have decided the issue of \u201cfull liability release in exchange for policy limits\u201d in favor of the third-party claimant. <em>See Blank v. USAA Property &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. </em>(Wis.Ct.App. 1996), 546 N.W.2d 512, 514-15 (concluding that an insurer has \u201cno reasonable grounds to fear a bad faith claim\u201d where policy limits of $100,000 are paid without a full release, and jury awards third-party claimant plaintiff $7.5 million); <em>Dairyland Ins. Co. v. Herman </em>(N.M. 1997), 954 P.2d 56, 64 (concluding that the duty to an insured does not mandate an \u201call-or-nothing approach\u201d where recovery of third party likely will exceed policy limits); <em>Thaler v. American Ins. Co. </em>(Mass.App.Ct. 1993), 614 N.E.2d 1021, <em>overruled by Lazaris v. Metropolitan Property &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. </em>(Mass. 1998), 703 N.E.2d 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">\u00b650 Aside from the applicability of a \u201cmajority rule\u201d to the factual scenario here, all of the foregoing jurisdictions are clearly distinguishable from such disputes arising in Montana. In 1987, our Legislature provided insurers such as Guaranty with the following protection from bad faith claims under either the common law or UTPA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6V\">An insured who has suffered damages as a result of the handling of an insurance claim may bring an action against the insurer for breach of the insurance contract, for fraud, or pursuant to this section, but not under any other theory or cause of action. An <em>insured may not bring an action for bad faith in connection with the handling of an insurance claim.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Section 33-18-242(3), MCA (emphasis added). <em>See also O\u2019Fallon v. Farmers Ins. Exch. </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 233, 243-44, 859 P.2d 1008, 1014-15 (discussing the legislative history of \u00a7 33-18-242, MCA, and identifying the limitation ofthe types of claims that could be brought against insurers as one of its purposes). Section 33-18-242(3), MCA, is a unique feature in contrast to other states, such as Massachusetts and California, that have similar unfair trade practices acts governing their insurance businesses where bad faith claims remain virtually unimpeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">\u00b651  Confronted with such statutory plain language, we will not second guess the intent of the Legislature in its desire to explicitly limit the liability of insurers. <em>See State Bar of Montana v. Krivec </em>(1981), 193 Mont. 477, 481, 632 P.2d 707, 710 (citation omitted). <em>See also Meech v. Hillhaven West, Inc. </em>(1989), 238 Mont. 21, 32, 776 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>488, 494 (providing that the \u201claw of Montana has long recognized that the courts and the legislature establish the substantive law governing tort claims\u201d). Thus, we have stated that \u00a7 33-18-242(3), MCA, \u201cexplicitly prohibits bringing an action for bad faith in connection with the handling of an insurance claim.\u201d <em>Dees v. American Nat. Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 431, 450, 861 P.2d 141, 153 (Gray, J., concurring). We have distinguished this prohibition by concluding that the subsection \u201cprohibits an insured, but not a third-party claimant, from bringing an action for bad faith.\u201d <em>Brewington v. Employers Fire Ins. Co., </em>1999 MT 312, \u00b6 13, 297 Mont. 243, \u00b6 13, 992 P.2d 237, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"AMc\">\u00b652 Guaranty\u2019s reasoning is therefore unclear as to how Moore, as an insured who had yet to suffer damage as a result of Guaranty\u2019s \u201chandling\u201d of the Watters\u2019 claim, could bring an action for \u201cbad faith\u201d under UTPA had Guaranty paid the undisputed full policy limits without obtaining a full release of liability on his behalf. Although providing some evidence of veiled threats of litigation asserted by Moore\u2019s attorney, Guaranty has not provided one decision from Montana or elsewhere where such a claim was made under these particular facts, let alone one in which the insured prevailed. <em>See, e.g., Blank, </em>546 N.W.2d at 515 (reviewing Louisiana and California case law and concluding that \u201cno cases recognize a bad faith claim\u201d where damages are in excess of policy limits, liability is not in doubt, the insurer uses reasonable efforts to settle and then accepts claimant\u2019s offer to settle without a full release).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">\u00b653 Additionally, the demands made by counsel for Moore are rather hollow. First, these demands did not enter the picture until December of 1994, approximately one year into the negotiation process and several months after the Watters filed their UTPA claim. Secondly, Moore\u2019s attorney, although exercising independent judgment on behalf of Moore, was paid by Guaranty pursuant to its duty to defend, a duty that would certainly not include financing a bad faith or breach of contract action against Guaranty, nor, for that matter, an action in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">\u00b654 Guaranty, in fact, evidenced signs of acting in good faith toward its insured when it informed Moore within one week of the accident that he should consider seeking legal counsel, at his own expense, to address the issue of his own liability that would exceed the policy limits. There is likewise substantial evidence that Guaranty fully informed its insured throughout this matter, and dutifully investigated the Watters\u2019 claim for policy limits. Further, Moore purchased insur-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>anee coverage limited to the statutory minimums. If and when these limits were paid, he would have realized the full benefit of the coverage for which he had paid premiums: a reduction of the total personal injury damages he caused by $50,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">\u00b655 While we have recognized the reasonable expectations doctrine, see <em>American Family, </em>\u00b6 32, we have also concluded that this doctrine is inapplicable where the terms of the policy at issue clearly demonstrate an intent to exclude coverage. <em>See American Family, </em>\u00b6 33. Thus, Moore could not reasonably have expected under such circumstances that Guaranty would be obligated to, in effect, provide greater coverage than that purchased in the issued policy by demanding a full release of all liability as a condition of paying the limits of the minimum coverage which he had purchased.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">\u00b656  Undoubtedly, where the monetary consequences of a person\u2019s tortious conduct undisputedly exceed policy limits, and liability is clear, the only incentive for an injured third-party claimant to settle for policy limits and provide the insured with an absolute release is some form of coerced economic necessity. In <em>Ridley, </em>we addressed this very subject and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-7\">Medical expenses from even minor injuries can be devastating to a family of average income. The inability to pay them can damage credit and, as alleged in this case, sometimes preclude adequate treatment and recovery from the very injuries caused. Just as importantly, the financial stress of being unable to pay medical expenses can lead to the ill-advised settlement of other legitimate claims in order to secure a benefit to which an innocent victim of an automobile accident is clearly entitled. We conclude that this is not what was intended by the Montana Legislature when mandatory liability insurance laws and unfair claims practice laws were enacted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-8\"><em>Ridley, </em>286 Mont. at 335, 951 P.2d at 993. Absent such necessity, and where damages are twice, ten, or one hundred times the mandatory limits imposed by law, such an absolute release is an absurdity, and potentially raises the issue of whether such a release would be unconscionable as a matter of law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>\u00b657  Accordingly, we conclude that compelling an innocent third-party claimant, under the circumstances described here, to proceed to trial to recoup that which is already owed is entirely inconsistent with the declared public policy of Montana to encourage settlement and avoid unnecessary litigation. <em>See generally Augustine v. Simonson </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 259, 266, 940 P.2d 116, 120. While we agree with Guaranty that it must consider the interests of its insured, we hold that the payment of policy limits under these particular factual circumstances would not have exposed Guaranty to <em>per se </em>liability for bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">\n<em>C. Guaranty\u2019s Potential \u201cBreach of Contract\u201d Liability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A-a\">\u00b658 Whether a breach of contract may have occurred is equally unclear and of little concern here. As we have stated, it is \u201caxiomatic that laws established for the benefit of the public cannot be contravened by private contract.\u201d <em>Iowa Mutual, </em>231 Mont, at 171, 752 P.2d at 169. In light of this policy, the Montana Legislature has required that insurance companies in good faith promptly settle claims with third parties, such as the one brought here by the Watters, when liability has become reasonably clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">\u00b659 Furthermore, a contractual duty to secure a third-party\u2019s absolute release is not mentioned once in Guaranty\u2019s policy. Rather, the policy explicitly states that Guaranty would \u201cpay damages for which any insured person is legally liable because of bodily injury and property damage caused by a car accident...\u201d Guaranty had the right to \u201csettle any claim or suit\u201d and the \u201cpayment of the limits of liability ends our duty to defend or settle.\u201d As previously addressed, expectations which are contrary to a clear exclusion from coverage are not objectively reasonable. <em>See American Family, </em>\u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">\n<em>D. Summary</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">\u00b660  In summary, we hold that where liability resulting from an automobile accident is reasonably clear, and a third-party claimant\u2019s damages undisputedly exceed mandatory minimum policy limits pursuant to \u00a7 61-6-103, MCA, the prompt, fair, and equitable settlement of such claims cannot be forestalled by an insurer based on an illusory bad faith or breach of contract claim that its insured may bring. To refuse payment based on such unfounded potential liability is, in and of itself, a deceptive practice within the meaning of \u00a7 33-18-201(6), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">\u00b661  Further, we hold that where an insured\u2019s liability for damages caused to a third party in an auto accident is reasonably clear, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>and those damages undisputedly exceed the mandatory limits set forth under \u00a7 61-6-103(2), MCA, it is an unfair trade practice <em>per se </em>under \u00a7 33-18-201, MCA, for an insurer to condition the payment of the owed mandatory minimum policy limits on the third party\u2019s agreement to provide a full and final release of all liability in favor of an insured. To this extent, we affirm the summary judgment order of the District Court. To hold otherwise, under the specific facts here, would render our mandatory liability insurance law, which was \u201cenacted for the benefit of the public and not for the benefit of the insured,\u201d meaningless. <em>Iowa Mutual, </em>231 Mont. at 171, 752 P.2d at 169.</p>\n<p id=\"AOAe\">\u00b662  Accordingly, we conclude that an insurer, who pays mandatory minimum policy limits that are owed under the circumstances herein described, does not act in bad faith <em>per se </em>against its insured by not obtaining a full and final liability release on the insured\u2019s behalf. This ruling is by no means intended to foreclose any or all bad faith claims \u2014 including those related to the duty to defend \u2014 that an insured may bring against its insurer for conduct prior to or following the handling of an insurance claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">\u00b663 We overrule and distinguish <em>Juedeman </em>as well as <em>Thompson </em>to the extent those decisions are inconsistent with this opinion. Namely, the insurer in <em>Juedeman, </em>under our decision here today, would commit an unfair trade practice <em>per se </em>by withholding those policy proceeds under its coverage that are mandated pursuant to \u00a7 61-6-103(2), MCA. Thus, our decision here does not affect excess coverage that an insured chooses to carry, pursuant to \u00a7 61-6-103(8), MCA. <em>Thompson </em>is overruled to the extent it suggests that a third-party claimant\u2019s full and final release of an insured\u2019s liability is, as a matter of law, a material element of a \u201csettlement\u201d under the UTPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">\n<em>ISSUE 2</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">\n<em>Did Guaranty have a reasonable basis in law or in fact for contesting the Watters\u2019claim, and therefore may not be found liable for violating Montana\u2019s Unfair Trade Practices Act?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">\u00b664 Guaranty contends that even if we overrule <em>Juedeman, </em>and thereby broaden and clarify our decision in <em>Ridley, </em>we must nevertheless reverse summary judgment because although engaging in an unfair settlement practice, Guaranty had a \u201creasonable basis in law or in fact\u201d for contesting the Watters\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">\u00b665 In addition to limiting the liability of insurers for bad faith in 1987, the Legislature also provided insurers with an affirmative de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>fense under \u00a7 33-18-242(5), MCA. This provision provides that \u201c[a]n insurer may not be held liable under this section if the insurer had a reasonable basis in law or in fact for contesting the claim or the amount of the claim, whichever is in issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-3\">\u00b666 Guaranty maintains that at the very least, our decision in <em>Juedeman </em>during the relevant period of 1993-95, was the undisputed law in Montana. The Watters, on the other hand, assert that <em>Juedeman </em>did not at any time control the circumstances of this case, and therefore it could not provide a reasonable basis for Guaranty\u2019s refusal to pay the policy limits. The District Court, in its summary judgment order, did not explicitly determine whether Guaranty\u2019s defense, under \u00a7 33-18-242(5), MCA, failed as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">\u00b667 As we have stated before, the party asserting this defense has the burden of establishing it by a preponderance of the evidence. Dees <em>v. American Nat. Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 431, 451, 861 P.2d 141, 153 (Gray, J., concurring). Consequently, we have held that whether an insurer has a \u201creasonable basis\u201d is generally a question of fact, and cannot be made \u201cas a matter of law.\u201d <em>Dean v. Austin Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1994), 263 Mont. 386, 389, 869 P.2d 256, 258. The insurer in <em>Dean, </em>for example, contested coverage based solely on the fact that the insureds had been charged with felony arson, and subsequently argued that this served as a reasonable basis for it denying coverage up until the time that the Deans were acquitted, reasoning that the policy excluded from coverage acts of arson. <em>Dean, </em>263 Mont. at 387-88, 869 P.2d at 257. Under those circumstances, we concluded that whether the insurer had a reasonable basis in law or in fact was an issue properly presented for determination to the trier of fact. <em>Dean, </em>263 Mont. at 389, 869 P.2d at 258.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">\u00b668 In a recent <em>de novo </em>review of a district court\u2019s summary judgment, however, we determined that an insurer clearly had a reasonable basis in law for not paying its insured\u2019s claim for insurance proceeds, and affirmed without requiring that the insurer\u2019s conduct reach the trier of fact. <em>See Bartlett v. Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(1996), 280 Mont. 63, 70, 929 P.2d 227, 231 (concluding that claimant as a matter of law did not have an insurable interest in damaged property, and therefore insurer clearly had a reasonable basis for not paying claim). <em>See also Watts v. Westland Farm Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 256, 263, 895 P.2d 626, 630 (affirming summary judgment in favor of insurer where insurance policy was as a matter of law not in effect at time of insured\u2019s loss, and therefore denial of claim was reasonable).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>\u00b669 Thus, the \u201ctrier of fact\u201d rule set forth in <em>Dean </em>is not necessary in a summary judgment proceeding where the underlying \u201cbasis in law\u201d is grounded on a legal conclusion, and no issues of fact remain in dispute. Here, therefore, it is for the court, not the trier of fact, to determine whether our holding in <em>Juedeman </em>sufficiently provides an absolute defense as a matter of law in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">\u00b670 In <em>Juedeman </em>we unequivocally stated that \u201c[i]n substance, this Court has held that without an agreement to release, there is no offer for settlement.\u201d <em>Juedeman, </em>253 Mont. at 281, 833 P.2d at 193. This succinct rule rested soundly on our decision in <em>Thompson, </em>where we stated that \u201cthere was never an agreement to release Thompson fully .... [t]hus, no offer or demand for settlement within policy limits was made.\u201d <em>Thompson, </em>161 Mont. at 220, 505 P.2d at 430. In both instances, the third-party\u2019s bad faith claim based on the insurer\u2019s refusal to pay policy limits without a full and final release failed. Further, our decision in <em>Juedeman </em>was not subsequently addressed by this Court until 1997, when we decided <em>Ridley.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">\u00b671 We conclude that at the time this dispute arose, <em>Juedeman </em>was the lone precedent from Montana case law upon which Guaranty could rely under the circumstances. From early on in this dispute, counsel for Guaranty offered <em>Juedeman </em>as legal authority for its position. In contrast, counsel for the Watters, while insisting as early as December of 1993 that Guaranty was acting in bad faith pursuant to \u00a7 33-18-201(6), MCA, did not cite to one favorable Montana case that squarely addressed the issues here in its dialogue of negotiation with Guaranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">\u00b672  We must therefore conclude that a plain reading of the available case law at the time gave Guaranty a reasonable basis in law upon which it could deny payment of policy limits. That is, <em>Juedeman </em>was legally conclusive to the extent there was simply no other authority in Montana at the time suggesting that in order to effectuate a prompt, fair, and equitable settlement of a third-party claim in good faith, an insurer must, under certain circumstances, pay policy limits without a full and final release for its insured. Unfortunately for the Watters, this was simply not the law in Montana at the time. Now, it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">\u00b673 Accordingly, the District Court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of the Watters is reversed, and the court is ordered to grant summary judgment in favor of Guaranty pursuant to its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>cross-motion for summary judgment. This case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b137-3\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES HUNT, TRIEWEILER,-REGNIER and MIZNER, District Judge, JUSTICE LEAPHART.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b126-5\">. Our decision in <em>Ridley, </em>as both parties point out, was decided several years after Guaranty refused payment and the Watters brought this unfair trade practice action. Notwithstanding our decision in <em>Ridley, </em>Guaranty asserts that <em>Juedeman </em>is still good law on the issue of whether the refusal of policy limits without a full and final release is an act of bad faith.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b128-5\">. Guaranty points out that the <em>Lazaris </em>court overruled <em>Thaler v. American Ins. Co. </em>(Mass.App.Ct. 1993), 614 N.E.2d 1021, a case the district court followed here in determining that Guaranty, as a matter of law, committed an unfair trade practice. Like <em>Ridley, Lazaris </em>was decided well after this litigation commenced. Unlike <em>Lazaris, </em>however, the facts in <em>Thaler </em>were identical to those here. The <em>Thaler </em>court concluded that \u201cthe insistence on a release by an insurer as a condition of payment of the policy limits where liability of its insured is undisputed and damages clearly exceed the policy limits amounts to an unfair settlement practice ...\u201d <em>Thaler, </em>614 N.E.2d at 1023-24. The <em>Thaler </em>court, however, decided in favor of the insurer based on the insurer\u2019s reasonable reliance on the case law \u2014 or, rather, the lack of \u201capplicable precedent\u201d \u2014 at the time of its decision to refuse payment. <em>See Thaler, </em>614 N.E.2d at 1024.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b132-9\">. The Watters have, in fact, raised the issue that such a release is unconscionable. However, whether the release in this instance was, as a matter of law, unconscionable was not specifically raised or addressed by the parties, and is therefore not within the scope of our <em>de novo </em>review of this matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b137-4\">JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"ARD\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">\u00b674 I join in the Court\u2019s resolution of both issues in this case. With regard to its discussion of issue one, however, I cannot agree with the Court\u2019s decision that it is necessary to overrule any portion of <em>Juedeman </em>or <em>Thompson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">\u00b675 The Court goes to great lengths throughout its opinion, and properly so, to observe that this case must be resolved on its specific facts, including the material facts that this case involves the Unfair Trade Practices Act (UTPA), Montana\u2019s Motor Vehicle Safety-Responsibility Act and the mandatory minimum insurance coverages required thereunder. Neither <em>Thompson </em>nor <em>Juedeman </em>involved these facts. Indeed, <em>Thompson </em>does not discuss or apply any statutory requirements; that decision is based entirely on \u201cbad faith\u201d case law. <em>Juedeman, </em>on the other hand, involves the UTPA but not mandatory minimum insurance coverages under the Motor Vehicle Safety-Responsibility Act. Given these differences, it is possible to distinguish both <em>Juedeman </em>and <em>Thompson </em>on their facts and limit their holdings to the facts of those cases, and I would do so. Under such an approach, the <em>Juedeman </em>holding that there is no offer for settlement without an agreement to release would \u2014 and should \u2014 continue to apply to cases which do not involve the mandatory minimum coverages required under the Motor Vehicle Safety-Responsibility Act. Such an approach also would support the Court\u2019s conclusion \u2014 with which I agree \u2014 that \u00a7 33-18-201(6), MCA, does not require a settlement to include a full and final release of all claims \u201cunder all circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">\u00b676 Furthermore, the Court\u2019s decision to overrule <em>Juedeman </em>and <em>Thompson </em>does not meet our standard in determining whether to depart from the fundamental doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>which \u201creflects our concerns for stability, predictability and equal treatment....\u201d <em>See Formicove, Inc. v. Burlington Northern, Inc. </em>(1983), 207 Mont. 189, 194, 673 P.2d 469, 472. While we are not required to follow a manifestly wrong decision (Formicove, 207 Mont. at 194, 673 P.2d at 472 (citations omitted)), the Court does not point to any portion of either <em>Juedeman </em>or <em>Thompson </em>which is wrong, much less manifestly wrong. I simply cannot join the Court in overruling cases for no reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>\u00b677 Finally, I continue to disagree with the practice of overruling cases \u201cto the extent\u201d they are inconsistent with the opinion in a current case. In this regard, the Court purports to both \u201coverrule and distinguish\u201d <em>Juedeman </em>and <em>Thompson </em>\u201cto the extent those decisions are inconsistent with this opinion.\u201d As set forth above, the cases are readily distinguishable from the present case and should simply be distinguished. The Court provides no guidance for future cases by both overruling and distinguishing the earlier cases. Moreover, if there are portions of those cases which are actually inconsistent with something in the present case, the Court should clearly identify them and, if necessary, overrule those specific portions so that legal practitioners and trial courts are properly advised of the continuing viability or lack thereof of <em>Juedeman </em>and <em>Thompson. </em>In my view, the Court has taken the easy \u2014 but not the prudent \u2014 way out in its final discussion of those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">\u00b678 Aside from these concerns, I join in the Court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
