The Defendants filed a counterclaim in which they alleged interference with their road easement. Joe Quinlan was subsequently dismissed from the action. The District Court entered judgment for Espy on his claim and for Joan Quinlan on her counterclaim. The District Court ordered Quinlan to pay Espy\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and costs pursuant to \u00a7 70-17-112(5), MCA. Quinlan appeals the District Court\u2019s judgment and order. We affirm the judgment and order of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">\u00b62 The following issues are presented on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err when it found a written agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">which granted Espy an easement over Quinlan\u2019s property?</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err when it ordered Quinlan to pay</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">Espy\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and costs pursuant to \u00a7 70-17-112(5), MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b466-12\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b466-13\">\u00b65 The Plaintiff, Hugh Espy, owns real property which is contiguous with and adjacent to real property owned by the Defendant, Joan Quinlan. Both parcels of property are located within Rosebud County, Montana. Espy purchased his real property in February 1993 from the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) following the FmHA\u2019s foreclosure on the property while owned by Timothy Cox.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-14\">\u00b66 Prior to 1985, Espy\u2019s predecessor in interest, Cox, irrigated the property using ditch irrigation. This method required pushing the water uphill at two different points by using pumps. In his deposition, Cox testified that this method was inefficient due to the electricity costs and the amount of water loss. Cox\u2019s neighbor, Quinlan was also using a method of ditch irrigation which resulted in an unsatisfactory amount of water seepage.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-15\">\u00b67 On December 17, 1980, Cox and Quinlan executed a written Pooling Agreement with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) for the construction of an underground pipe irrigation system. The new irrigation system consisted of an underground pipeline originating on Quinlan\u2019s property and extending approximately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>600 feet to Espy\u2019s property where it extended approximately 1200 feet. According to the Pooling Agreement, the purpose of the project was to \u201cprovide a water delivery system that will prevent seepage of water and an efficient irrigation delivery system.\u201d The Pooling Agreement was approved by the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS) of the USDA on March 3, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">\u00b68 The Pooling Agreement, signed by both Cox and Quinlan, includes the following conditions:</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Each person signing ... this agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-6\">2. Agrees to perform the practice(s), in a professional manner within the specified general location, to repair, maintain, and use for the purpose authorized, the practice(s) covered by this agreement for which cost-sharing is given, and to obtain the authorities, rights, easements or other approvals necessary to perform, maintain, and repair such practices.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-7\">3. Grants such authorities, rights, easements, or other approvals to the other participants in this agreement to enter upon his land as may be necessary to install, maintain, and repair the practices.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">\u00b69 Additionally, Cox and Quinlan entered into a cost-sharing agreement with the United States Government, pursuant to which the government paid $9433 of the total $11,122 cost and Cox and Quinlan agreed to contribute 69 percent and 31 percent, respectively, of the remaining costs. It is the policy of the United States Government that cost-sharing is authorized only under certain circumstances, which includes permanently installed irrigation systems. The cost-sharing agreement defined the \u201clife-span\u201d of the irrigation system as 10 years. \u00b610 The irrigation system was permanently installed in 1985. Espy became the owner of Cox\u2019s real property in 1993. In June of 1996, Quinlan had a portion of the pipeline dug up, and threatened to cap the line at its approach to Espy\u2019s property if Espy continued to use the irrigation system. Shortly thereafter, Espy and Quinlan met to discuss the irrigation system. Quinlan told Espy that she would cut the pipeline if Espy did not agree in writing to certain conditions, including relinquishing all rights Espy had in the easement. Following consultation with his attorney, Espy declined to agree to Quinlan\u2019s conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>\u00b611 In July 1997, in an attempt to prevent Espy from using the irrigation system, Quinlan removed the start button for the irrigation pump and shut off the electricity for the irrigation system. In May 1998, Quinlan placed a padlock on the electrical box which provides electricity to the irrigation system. In response, Espy filed this action against both Joan and Joe Quinlan on June 1,1998, alleging interference with his easement. However, by stipulation of the parties, defendant Joe Quinlan was dismissed from the action. Espy additionally requested that the District Court issue a temporary restraining order to keep Quinlan from interfering any further with his use of the irrigation system. The District Court granted the temporary restraining order and on June 25,1998 granted a preliminary injunction against Quinlan.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">\u00b612 On November 13,1998, the parties stipulated to allow Quinlan to file a permissive counterclaim against Espy. The counterclaim was deemed filed on November 18,1998, and alleged that Espy had interfered with Quinlan\u2019s road easement over Espy\u2019s property. A bench trial was held on April 29, 1999 to consider Espy\u2019s claim and Quinlan\u2019s counterclaim. On June 4,1999, the District Court entered its findings of fact, conclusions of.law, and order, in which it concluded that Espy has a valid easement over Quinlan\u2019s property for the use and maintenance of the irrigation system and that Quinlan has a valid road easement over Espy\u2019s property. The District Court further concluded that both parties were entitled to a permanent order restraining the other party from interfering with their respective easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">\u00b613 On July 26,1999, the District Court held a hearing to consider the issue of awarding attorney\u2019s fees and costs. On September 3,1999, the District Court entered its order which required Quinlan to pay Espy\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and costs pursuant to \u00a7 70-17-112(5), MCA. Following successful motions to amend the findings of fact and conclusions of law, and the judgment the District Court entered its amended judgment on November 26,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">\u00b614 The standard of review of a district court\u2019s findings of fact is whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>See Daines v. Knight </em>(1995), 269 Mont. 320, 324, 888 P.2d 904, 906. A finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the trial court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if this Court is left with a definite and firm conviction that the district court made a mistake. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number><em>Daines v. Knight </em>(1995), 269 Mont. 320, 324, 888 P.2d 904, 906. The standard of review of a district court\u2019s conclusions of law is whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>See Carbon County v. Union Reserve Coal Co., Inc. </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 459, 469, 898 P.2d 680, 686. If a district court concludes that one party has prevailed and is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees, we review that conclusion to determine if it is correct. <em>Engel v. Gampp, </em>2000 MT 17, \u00b6 32, [298 Mont. 116, \u00b6 32], 993 P.2d 701, \u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Ajz\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">\u00b615 Did the District Court err when it found a written agreement which granted Espy an easement over Quinlan\u2019s property?</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">\u00b616 Quinlan asserts that the District Court erred when it concluded that the Pooling Agreement created an easement for an indefinite duration. Quinlan contends that the Pooling Agreement created a contract for the period of ten years based on the language which describes the \u201clife-span\u201d of the project as \u201cten years following the year of installation.\u201d Espy asserts that the District Court correctly concluded that he has an easement for the use and maintenance of the irrigation system for an indefinite period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">\u00b617 The District Court made the following findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-8\">7. That Quinlan did not seek legal advice before signing the Pooling Agreement, which clearly states that each participant in the agreement grants an easement or right to the other participants to enter upon their land to install, maintain and repair the irrigation system. Paragraph 4 of the Pooling Agreement refers to securing easements and other documents from other people who are not participants to the agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-9\">8. That while Quinlan testified that she never intended to give Cox an easement, that testimony is belied by the plain language of the Pooling Agreement and by Cox himself. The Court finds that Quinlan clearly gave Cox and Espy, Cox\u2019s predecessor in interest, an easement to repair and maintain the irrigation system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-10\">11. That the \u201clife span\u201d of the project is the minimum length of time the irrigation system must be used or a portion of the cost share refunded. It was not meant to limit the life expectancy of the easement, which is indefinite, as long as the irrigation system is properly used, maintained and repaired.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>16. That the plaintiff has an easement to use, maintain and repair the pipeline and the plaintiff\u2019s use of that easement should not be obstructed or impaired by the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">\u00b618 Our review of the record reveals that the District Court\u2019s findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence and therefore are not clearly erroneous. The language of the Pooling Agreement is clear. The Agreement states that a condition of the Agreement is that each person signing the Agreement \u201c[g]rants such authorities, rights, easements, or other approvals to the other participants in this agreement to enter upon his land as may be necessary to install, maintain, and repair the practices.\u201d Clearly, by signing the Pooling Agreement, both Cox and Quinlan granted each other such authorities, rights, easements, or other approvals to enter upon each other\u2019s land as may be necessary to install, maintain, and repair the irrigation system. \u00b619 Quinlan further asserts that the language of a subsequent condition to the Pooling Agreement required that the parties designated agent, Cox, secure the easement on Quinlan\u2019s property. The condition relied on by Quinlan states that each person signing the Pooling Agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-5\">4. Agrees that the person shown as such as designated agent and is authorized to act for the parties of agreement in securing the necessary easements, rights-of-way, labor and equipment, construction details, compliance determinations, reports, and certifications, and contracts with the COC and designated technicians.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AfU\">We agree with the District Court\u2019s finding that paragraph 4 of the Pooling Agreement refers to securing easements and other documents from people who are not participants to the agreement, and therefore does not affect an easement granted by participants to the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">\u00b620  Moreover, the District Court\u2019s finding that the ten-year \u201clife-span\u201d of the irrigation system was related to the government\u2019s cost-sharing involvement, and not a limitation on the duration of the easement, is supported by substantial evidence. The document which defines the \u201clife-span\u201d of the irrigation project as \u201c10 years following the year of installation\u201d is a document which sets forth the conditions for government cost-sharing. As explained by Rosebud County Farm Service Agency Program Assistant, Diane Wyrick, \u201c[e]ach conservation practice has a \u2018life-span\u2019 that requires the practice to be maintained for a minimum length of time or cost share must be refunded. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>The lifespan\u2019 is not the life expectancy of the practice.\u201d Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s finding that the \u201clife-span\u201d of ten years was for cost-sharing purposes only and that the easement itself lasted for an indefinite period of time was not clearly erroneous. \u00b621 Based on its findings of fact, the District Court made the following conclusions of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-4\">4. An easement may be created by grant, reservation, exception or covenant, by implication, or by prescription. <em>Kuhlman, v. Rivera, </em>701 P.2d 982,985 (Mont. 1985). To be a valid grant of an easement created by writing, it must satisfy the formal requirements of a grant. <em>Id. </em>The Pooling Agreement identified the participants, Joan Quinlan and Tim Cox, adequately described what was conveyed, had language of conveyance and was signed, thus satisfying the requirements of \u00a7 70-20-103, M.C.A., and granting a valid easement. <em>Id. </em>Specifically, the Pooling Agreement stated that each person signing the agreement granted to the other participants the right to enter onto their land as necessary to install, maintain and repair the irrigation system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-5\">5. The duration of the easement is indefinite since, with proper maintenance and repair, the underground irrigation system could last for an indefinite period of time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">\u00b622 We conclude that the District Court\u2019s conclusions of law are correct. The Pooling Agreement satisfied the requirements of a grant and created a valid easement for Espy to enter onto Quinlan\u2019s property to install, maintain, and repair the irrigation system for as long as the system lasts. Therefore, we further conclude that the District Comb did not err when it found that the Pooling Agreement created a valid easement on Quinlan\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">\u00b623 Did the District Court err when it ordered Quinlan to pay Espy\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and costs pursuant to \u00a7 70-17-112(5), MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">\u00b624 Section 70-17-112, MCA, states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-10\">(1) A person with a canal or ditch easement has a secondary easement to enter, inspect, repair, and maintain a canal or ditch.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-11\">(2) No person may encroach upon or otherwise impair any easement for a canal or ditch used for irrigation or any other lawful domestic or commercial purpose, including carrying return water.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>(5) <em>If a legal action is brought to enforce the provisions of this section, the prevailing party is entitled to costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">\u00b625 Quinlan contends that the District Court erred when it concluded that Esp/s interference with Quinlan\u2019s road easement was not related to Espy\u2019s suit against Quinlan for interference with his ditch easement pursuant to \u00a7 70-17-112, MCA. Quinlan asserts that because she prevailed on her counterclaim neither party can be considered a \u201cprevailing party\u201d within the contemplation of \u00a7 70-17-112(5), MCA. Quinlan contends that her counterclaim is related to the controversy over whether the Pooling Agreement created a ditch easement because had she not taken the position that Espy did not have a ditch easement, Espy would not have interfered with her road easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">\u00b626 In support of her position, Quinlan relies on <em>Knudsen v. Taylor </em>(1984), 211 Mont. 459, 685 P.2d 354. <em>In Knudsen, </em>the parties brought a claim and a counterclaim involving interference with a ditch. With respect to the issue of whether either party was entitled to attorney\u2019s fees and costs pursuant to \u00a7 70-17-112(5), MCA, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-7\">The injunctive order issued by the District Court is a victory and a loss for both sides. Knudsen prevailed on his contention that the culvert must be of sufficient size to carry fully the water from the headgate passing through the Ester Ditch. Taylor prevailed in that his right to install such crossing culverts was recognized in this case. In such circumstances, we determine that the District Court was correct in finding in effect there was no prevailing party in the contemplation of section 70-17-112(5), MCA, and properly denied attorney fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-8\"><em>Knudsen, </em>211 Mont. at 463-64, 685 P.2d at 357.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">\u00b627 In this case the District Court concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-10\">Here, the counterclaim involved interference with a road easement. It had nothing to do with the ditch easement and was not brought to enforce the provisions of \u00a7 70-17-112. The plaintiff, therefore, prevailed on all claims brought pursuant to \u00a7 70-17-112 and is entitled to his reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-11\">\u00b628  We agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion. Quinlan\u2019s counterclaim was not raised pursuant to \u00a7 70-17-112, MCA. It was a permissive counterclaim dealing with a road easement. Consequently, our analysis in <em>Knudsen </em>does not apply to this case. Further, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>we have previously held that \u201cin order to be deemed a \u2018prevailing party for purposes of \u00a7 70-17-112(5), MCA ... a party must successfully prevail on <em>all </em>claims raised pursuant to this statute.\u201d <em>Engel, </em>\u00b6 40. Accordingly, because Espy successfully prevailed on all claims raised pursuant to \u00a7 70-17-112, MCA, he is entitled to his attorney\u2019s fees and costs pursuant to \u00a7 70-17-112(5), MCA, regardless of the fact that he was not the prevailing party on Quinlan\u2019s counterclaim. Therefore, we conclude that the District Court did not err when it determined that Espy was entitled to attorney\u2019s fees and costs pursuant to \u00a7 70-17-112(5), MCA. Additionally, Espy\u2019s costs and reasonable attorneys fees include those fees incurred in this appeal. <em>See Sharon v. Hayden </em>(1990), 246 Mont. 186, 190, 803 P.2d 1083, 1086.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">\u00b629 The judgment of the District Court is affirmed and we remand for determination of Espy\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and costs on appeal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b473-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE TUENAGE, JUSTICES GRAY, HUNT and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
