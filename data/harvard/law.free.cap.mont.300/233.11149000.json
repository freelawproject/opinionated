(Appellants) appeal from the judgment entered in favor of the Montana Department of Revenue (Department) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>by the First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-3\">\u00b62 We restate the issues presented on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">\u00b63 1. Whether Rule 42.2.701, ARM, violates Article II, Section 9 of the Montana Constitution?</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">\u00b64 2. Whether the Department may declare coal severance tax information confidential when it had been disclosed for a number of years prior to the promulgation of Rule 42.2.701, ARM?</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">\u00b65 3. Whether Rule 42.2.701, ARM, violates the public records statutes?</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">\u00b66 In 1975 the Montana Legislature enacted a coal severance tax. <em>See </em>\u00a7 15-35-103, MCA. To facilitate collection of the coal severance tax, each coal mine operator is required to provide the Department with a quarterly statement containing the tonnage produced, the average Btu value of the production, the contract sales price received for the production, and such other information as the Department may require. <em>See </em>\u00a7 15-35-104, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">\u00b67 Following the enactment of the coal severance tax, the information provided to the Department by the coal mine operators was routinely made available to the public in the form of quarterly coal severance tax collection summaries prepared by the Department. The information contained in these summaries included the name of the coal company, the location of each coal mine by county, the total tons produced by each mine, the amount of tonnage exempt from taxation for each mine, the taxable production for each mine, the average contract sales price per ton for each mine, the total coal severance tax paid by each mine, the incentive tax credit (now expired), and the net tax paid by each mine.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-11\">\u00b68 On November 15, 1993, the Department adopted Rule 42.2.701, ARM, which declared information, such as tax returns, that taxpayers are required to provide to the Department and Department-prepared documents that identify taxpayers to be confidential. Pursuant to the adoption of the rule, the Department changed the quarterly coal severance tax collection summaries to include only the name of the coal company, the location of each coal mine by county, the total tons produced by each mine, the average sales price per ton for all Montana coal mines combined, and the total tax paid by all Montana coal mines combined.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>\u00b69 On January 3, 1994, a Helena law firm representing the Montana Freedom of Information Hotline requested copies of the 1992 and 1993 quarterly coal severance collection summaries from the Department on behalf of the Associated Press pursuant to Article II, Section 9 of the Montana Constitution. Relying on recently adopted Rule 42.2.701, ARM, the Department denied the request on February 10, 1994, claiming that it had a responsibility to protect the privacy rights of all Montana taxpayers. However, in light of the public\u2019s interest in this information, the Department indicated that it would be releasing a summary of statistical information including the total tons of coal mined by each company and the average price of coal and the total amount of severance tax paid for all Montana coal mines.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">\u00b610 On July 14, 1994, Appellants filed an Application for Writ of Mandate and Petition for Declaratory Judgment, requesting the following relief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-5\">1. A writ of mandate compelling the Department to provide Appellants with information and documents contained in the Department\u2019s files that were provided to the Department pursuant to \u00a7 15-35-104, MCA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-6\">2. An order declaring the provisions of Rule 42.2.701, ARM, to be invalid because it conflicts with \u00a7 2-6-102, MCA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-7\">3. An order declaring the provisions of Rule 42.2.701, ARM, to be unconstitutional.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-8\">4. An award of reasonable attorney fees and costs to Appellants pursuant to \u00a7 2-3-221, MCA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-9\">5. Any other relief the District Court deems just and proper.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">The Department responded to the Appellants\u2019 application by alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that it failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-11\">\u00b611 Subsequently, both parties moved for summary judgment regarding the validity of Rule 42.2.701, ARM. Appellants alleged that Rule 42.2.701, ARM, violates the public\u2019s constitutionally guaranteed \u201cright to know\u201d in two respects. First, 42.2.701, ARM, conflicts with Montana\u2019s public records statutes, which allow citizens the right to examine and copy all records held by the government. Second, Rule 42.2.701, ARM, directly conflicts with Article II, Section 9 of the Montana Constitution, which guarantees the public the right to inspect documents held by state agencies unless the demands of individual privacy clearly exceed the merits of public disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>\u00b612 Regarding the constitutionality of Rule 42.2.701, ARM, the Department contended that it was validly enacted as an interpretive rule pursuant to its general rulemaking authority under \u00a7 15-1-201, MCA, with respect to supervision of the administration of all revenue laws of the state, and as such, it is constitutional. The Department also asserted that its purpose for adopting the rule was to inform the public of the Department\u2019s procedures regarding the confidentiality of certain tax information.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-3\">\u00b613 The Department also asserted that Appellants were asking the District Court to ignore the taxpayers\u2019 right to privacy guaranteed by Article II, Section 10 of the Montana Constitution. The Department went on to state that prior to authorizing release of the requested information, the District Court must first determine whether a privacy interest exists and if it does, then balance that interest against the public\u2019s right to know. Further, the Department alleged that whether or not the taxpayers have a subjective expectation of privacy in the requested information is a factual question, necessitating the denial of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">\u00b614 After the motions for summary judgment had been fully briefed and orally argued by the parties, the District Court entered its Decision and Order denying summary judgment in all respects. The basis for the District Court\u2019s denial was that the issue of whether the taxpayers have a subjective expectation of privacy involves questions of fact, requiring an evidentiary hearing to determine the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">\u00b615 More than a year after the District Court had entered its Decision and Order, Appellants filed a Motion for Reconsideration. The basis for this motion was the Appellants\u2019 belief that the District Court\u2019s Decision and Order failed to address several dispositive arguments. Appellants stated that this case concerns the issue of whether Rule 42.2.701, ARM, is an invalid infringement on the public\u2019s statutory and constitutional right to examine government records. Appellants went on to state that they were not challenging whether they were entitled to receive the information at issue; they were simply challenging the rule itself on constitutional and statutory grounds. Appellants argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that Rule 42.2.701, ARM, is facially unconstitutional because it fails to provide for a case-by-case determination concerning whether the demands of individual privacy clearly exceed the merits of public disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">\u00b6 16 The Department opposed the Motion for Reconsideration on the grounds that Appellants\u2019 motion was not allowed under the Montana <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Rules of Civil Procedure; if allowed by Rules 59 or 60, M.R.Civ.P., it was time-barred; and Appellants had failed to provide the District Court with any new reasoning or legal precedent upon which the District Court should alter its decision. The Department also asserted that the District Court had previously determined Rule 42.2.701, ARM, to be valid as a matter of law. The Department further argued that the requisite balancing test was the foundation for the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">\u00b6 17 After the Motion for Reconsideration had been fully briefed by the parties, the District Court entered an Order denying the motion based upon its conclusion that the motion was untimely and without merit. At a subsequent scheduling conference, the District Court set the evidentiary hearing concerning the issue of the taxpayers\u2019 subjective right of privacy for August 27, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">\u00b6 18 Prior to the evidentiary hearing, the parties submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. In addition, the District Court entered a Pre-Trial Order, which was approved by the parties. Several witnesses testified at the hearing, including the former director of the Department during the time Rule 42.2.701, ARM, was promulgated; the former bureau chief for the Natural Resource Corporation Taxation Division of the Department; a certified public accountant; representatives from several Montana coal companies; and the Montana bureau chief for the Associated Press. At the conclusion of the hearing, the District Court offered the parties the opportunity to submit supplemental proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law within 30 days, which the parties did.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">\u00b619 On December 29, 1998, the District Court entered its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order awarding judgment to the Department. The District Court found that the Department adopted Rule 42.2.701, ARM, after balancing the public\u2019s right to know with the coal producers\u2019 right to privacy. In addition, the District Court concluded that the coal severance taxpayers had, and continue to have, a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to the information they provide to the Department, which exceeds the public\u2019s right to know. Appellants appeal from the District Court\u2019s Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order awarding judgment in favor of the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">\u00b620 \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct.\u201d <em>Brady v. Montana Dept. of Justice, </em>1999 MT 153, \u00b6 6, 295 Mont. 75, \u00b6 6, 983 P.2d 292, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b263-3\">\u00b621 Whether Rule 42.2.701, ARM, violates Article II, Section 9 of the Montana Constitution?</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">\u00b622 Appellants contend that Rule 42.2.701, ARM, directly conflicts with Article II, Section 9 of the Montana Constitution in that it fails to balance the competing interests of privacy and public disclosure on a case-by-case basis. Appellants also contend that the rule contains a facially unconstitutional presumption in favor of confidentiality. At oral argument, the Department alleged that its adoption of Rule 42.2.701, ARM, was premised on the balancing of the taxpayers\u2019 right to privacy and the public\u2019s right to know.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">\u00b623 Rule 42.2.701, ARM, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-6\">\n<em>PUBLIC ACCESS TO TAXPAYER INFORMATION</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-7\">(1) The Montana Constitution guarantees individuals and corporations the right to privacy in Article II, Section 10.

No person shall be deprived of the right to examine documents or to observe the deliberations of all public bodies or agencies of state government and its subdivisions, except in cases in which the demand of individual privacy clearly exceeds the merits of public disclosure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">This constitutional provision generally requires information regarding state government to be disclosed to the public, except in cases where the demand of individual privacy clearly exceeds the merits of public disclosure. Hence, the right to know is not absolute. <em>See Missoulian v. Board of Regents </em>(1984), 207 Mont. 513, 529, 675 P.2d 962, 971; <em>see also </em>Order Selecting the Fifth Member of the Montana Districting and Apportionment Commission (Aug. 3, 1999) (Regnier, J., specially concurring). It requires a balancing of \u201cthe competing constitutional interests <em>in the context of the facts of each case, </em>to determine whether the demands of individual privacy clearly exceed the merits of public disclosure.\u201d <em>Missoulian, </em>207 Mont. at 529, 675 P.2d at 971 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">\u00b625 Based on the assumption that most taxpayers have a reasonable expectation that income and financial information provided to the Department will remain private, the Department declared such information, including tax returns, to be confidential, unless it is clear that the taxpayer does not have a protected privacy interest in the information. <em>See </em>Rule 42.2.701(3), ARM. Information required to be provided to the Department by taxpayers, including tax returns, as well as some Department-prepared documents that identify taxpayers are deemed confidential under Rule 42.2.701, ARM. This is in direct conflict with the public\u2019s right to know contained in Article II, Section 9 of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">\u00b626 Rule 42.2.701, ARM, presumes that all taxpayers have a properly-recognized, constitutionally-protected right to privacy in the information they provide to the Department, which prevails over the merits of public disclosure. In order to determine whether the demands of individual privacy clearly exceed the merits of public disclosure, a balancing of the public\u2019s right to know with the individual\u2019s right to privacy in the context of the facts of each case is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>\u00b627 As conceded by the Appellants in their reply brief in support of their motion for summary judgment, if Rule 42.2.701, ARM, were struck down as facially unconstitutional the Department could, nevertheless, withhold some or all of the requested information if it properly determined in the context of the facts of each particular case that the taxpayer\u2019s right to privacy outweighed the merits of public disclosure. For instance, the type of taxpayer involved (i.e., individual, corporate, partnership, etc.), the source of the information provided by the taxpayer, and the public\u2019s interest in the information provided are only some of the factors that will need to be considered when determining whether a taxpayer\u2019s right to privacy outweighs the public\u2019s right to know.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">\u00b628 Conversely, Rule 42.2.701, ARM, declares information to be confidential on a wholesale basis for all taxpayers without balancing the taxpayers\u2019 right to privacy with the public\u2019s right to know. As a result, we conclude that Rule 42.2.701, ARM, is unconstitutional on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"Ajf\">\u00b629 In fight of our determination that Rule 42.2.701, ARM, is unconstitutional on its face, we need not address whether the rule violates the public records statutes. Therefore, Issue 3 will not be addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">\u00b630 Whether the Department may declare coal severance tax information confidential when it had been disclosed for a number of years prior to the promulgation of Rule 42.2.701, ARM?</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">\u00b631 Appellants assert that there can be no reasonable expectation of privacy in the information at issue in this case, the average contract sales price for each mine and the taxes paid by each mine. Due to the fact that this information had been made public for nearly 20 years, Appellants argue that this is not information in which members of the coal industry could have an actual expectation of privacy that society is willing to recognize as reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">\u00b632 The Department, on the other hand, asserts that the District Court correctly determined that the coal severance taxpayers had, and continue to have, a constitutionally protected right of privacy in the information provided to the Department. The Department also asserts that there is sufficient evidence in the record to support the District Court\u2019s findings of subjective and objective expectations of privacy on the part of the coal severance taxpayers in the information at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">\u00b633 Upon denying the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court conducted an evidentiary hearing to deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>mine whether the mine operators had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the information provided to the Department and, if so, whether there was a compelling state interest requiring disclosure of that information. Several coal company managers and officers, a certified public accountant, and a bureau chief for the Associated Press testified at the hearing. Based on the evidence and testimony presented, the District Court concluded that the coal severance taxpayers established a subjective and objective expectation of privacy with respect to the information provided to the Department in their coal severance tax returns. In addition, the District Court found that the taxpayers\u2019 expectation of privacy outweighed the public\u2019s right to know.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-3\">\u00b634 The fundamental issue presented by Appellants is whether the District Court erred when it determined that the coal severance taxpayers had, and continue to have, a constitutionally protected privacy interest in the information they provide to the Department. The issue of whether corporations or other business entities have a right of privacy pursuant to Article II, Section 10 of the Montana Constitution has not been raised by the parties on appeal. Therefore, for purposes of addressing this issue we will assume, without agreeing with the District Court, that corporations have a right of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">\u00b635 In discussing the adoption and scope of the privacy clause in <em>Montana Human Rights Division v. City of Billings </em>(1982), 199 Mont. 434, 440, 649 P.2d 1283, 1286, we noted that the Montana Constitution provides more privacy protection than the United States Constitution. To determine whether a constitutionally protected privacy interest exists under the Montana Constitution, we apply the following two-part test: \u201cwhether the person involved had a subjective or actual expectation of privacy and whether society is willing to recognize that expectation as reasonable.\u201d <em>Great Falls Tribune Co. v. Day, </em>1998 MT 133, \u00b6 20, 289 Mont. 155, \u00b6 20, 959 P.2d 508, \u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">\u00b636 Pursuant to \u00a7 15-35-104, MCA, each coal mine operator is required to compute the severance tax due on each quarter-year\u2019s worth of production. Each quarterly statement must include the amount of tonnage produced, the average Btu value of the production, the contract sales price received for the production, and any other information the Department may require. See \u00a7 15-35-104, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">\u00b637 Prior to the adoption of Rule 42.2.701, ARM, in 1994, coal mine operators had no assurance that the information submitted pursuant to \u00a7 15-35-104, MCA, would be kept confidential. Unlike the chapters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>in Title 15 of the Montana Code Annotated involving individual income tax and corporate license or income tax, the chapter involving the coal severance tax does not contain a statutory provision declaring tax records to be confidential. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 15-30-303 and 15-31-511, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">\u00b638 The record reflects that prior to 1994, the Department disclosed certain coal production information in the form of a quarterly coal severance collection summary. Despite this, the testimony of the mine managers and officers at the evidentiary hearing indicated that they were not aware this information had been disseminated by the Department prior to 1994 and that if they had known they would have objected to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">\u00b639 However, none of the coal mine managers or officers testified that prior to 1994 they expected the coal severance tax information submitted pursuant to \u00a7 15-35-104, MCA, to be kept confidential. They did testify that they would like this information to remain confidential because of the competition in the coal industry today, the problems it might cause with their customers who are paying more than the average price, and the possibility that the information could give their competitors an unfair advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">\u00b640 In response to the coal mine operators\u2019 economic concerns, we note that in <em>Great Falls Tribune </em>Co., we concluded that economic advantage is not a privacy interest. <em>Great Falls Tribune Co., </em>\u00b6 29. Furthermore, we fail to see how a competitor could determine the contract price of coal for a specific contract from the average contract sales price or the amount of severance tax paid by each mine. The information published before and after the adoption of Rule 42.2.701, ARM, does not reveal the number of contracts a coal mine has nor the type of contracts (i.e., short- or long-term or both). Several factors impact the price of coal paid by a purchaser, including the quality of the coal being purchased, whether the purchaser has a short- or long-term contract, and the transportation costs for delivery of the coal.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">\u00b641  Given the fact that the Department did not restrict access to this information for nearly 20 years and that the coal mine operators within a highly regulated industry were given no assurances that this information would be kept confidential nor did they request that it be kept confidential, we conclude that prior to 1994 the coal mine operators within Montana did not have an actual or subjective expec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>tation of privacy in the information submitted to the Department pursuant to \u00a7 15-35-104, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-3\">\u00b642  Following the adoption of Rule 42.2.701, ARM, the coal mine operators could assert a subjective expectation of privacy in the information provided to the Department pursuant \u00a7 15-35-104, MCA. However, a subjective expectation of privacy based on a facially unconstitutional rule is not one society would be willing to recognize as reasonable. We also note that this information had routinely been made available for nearly 20 years prior to the adoption of Rule 42.2.701, ARM. As a result, neither prong of the two-part privacy test has been met, ruling out the existence of a constitutionally protected privacy interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">\u00b643  Appellants also assert that they should be awarded their reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred in bringing this action in accordance with \u00a7 2-3-221, MCA. Section 2-3-221, MCA, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-7\">Costs to plaintiff in certain actions to enforce constitutional right to know. A plaintiff who prevails in an action brought in district court to enforce his rights under Article II, section 9, of the Montana constitution may be awarded his costs and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">We have already concluded that Rule 42.2.701, ARM, is unconstitutional on its face because it does not balance the public\u2019s right to know with the taxpayers\u2019 right to privacy on a case-by-case basis in violation of Article II, Section 9 of the Montana Constitution. Hence, the Appellants have performed a service for the citizens of the State by enforcing a portion of our Constitution that would otherwise be violated. Due to the public benefits gained by Appellants\u2019 efforts, the cost of the litigation should be spread among its beneficiaries. <em>See Associated Press v. Board of Pub. Educ. </em>(1991), 246 Mont. 386, 393, 804 P.2d 376, 380. Therefore, we remand this matter to the District Court pursuant to \u00a7 2-3-221, MCA, for an award of costs and reasonable attorney fees incurred by Appellants in bringing this action, including the fees and costs incurred on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">\u00b644 Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b269-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES HUNT, TRIEWEILER and GRAY concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b269-11\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"As3\">specially concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">\u00b645 I concur in the result of our opinion. I would, however, reach the issue of whether the corporate coal company taxpayers and other non-human entities in this state enjoy the right of <em>individual </em>privacy which is guaranteed under Article II, Section 10, of Montana\u2019s Constitution and which is excepted from the right-to-know provision, Article II, Section 9. Having reached this issue, I would hold that only individuals, not corporations and other non-human entities, enjoy this constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">\u00b646 It is necessary that we address this important issue for two reasons. First, the trial court\u2019s decision was premised on a legal conclusion \u2014 i.e., that the corporate taxpayers had and continue to have a reasonable expectation of privacy, guaranteed by Article II, Section 10, of Montana\u2019s Constitution, which must be balanced against and, as it turned out here, trumps the public\u2019s right to know, guaranteed under Article II, Section 9. While the court was following Montana case law as it presently exists, the legal underpinnings of the court\u2019s basic premise \u2014 that corporations enjoy a constitutionally-guaranteed right of privacy \u2014 is wrong, as I will demonstrate in this separate opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">\u00b647 Second, the Department\u2019s regulation, which we have now declared facially unconstitutional, likewise presupposes that non-human taxpayers are guaranteed the right to <em>individual </em>privacy under Montana\u2019s Constitution. It thus logically follows that when the Department adopts a new version of this regulation, presumably the replacement rule will be bottomed in this same fundamental, but legally flawed, premise. Just as important, while we have declared that the Department\u2019s regulation is facially unconstitutional for failing to incorporate an Article II, Section 9, balancing test, such a test, even if included in an amended rule, will be meaningless as to non-human taxpayers. These taxpayers have no constitutional privacy right to \u201cbalance\u201d against the public\u2019s right to know.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">\u00b648 Since the rule is the focus of our decision, I begin there.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">\u00b649 As our opinion and the plain language of the Department\u2019s regulation clearly demonstrate, Rule 42.2.701, ARM, purports to deny public access to taxpayer information because \u201c[t]he Montana Constitution guarantees individuals <em>and corporations </em>the right to privacy in Article II, Section 10.\u201d Rule 42.2.701(1), ARM (emphasis added). In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>deed, it is \u201c[u]nder this provision of the Constitution ...\u201d in conjunction with Montana statutes, that the Department has determined it \u201cwill protect the privacy interests of taxpayers.\u201d Rule 42.2.701(1), ARM. Further, it will balance the public\u2019s right to know against the individual right of privacy, and that it will opt for confidentiality \u201cunless it is clear that a taxpayer does not have a protected privacy interest in information found in the documents.\u201d Rule 42.2.701(2) and (3), ARM. Finally, grounding its determination in \u201cthe Montana Constitution,\u201d the Department then goes on to classify by way of example certain information as confidential and other information as not confidential. Rule 42.2.701(5), ARM.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-3\">\u00b650 While, as I will explain in more detail later, individuals are clearly guaranteed the right of privacy set out in Article II, Section 10, of Montana\u2019s Constitution (and excepted from the right-to-know provision, Article II, Section 9), it is equally clear that this right is constitutionally guaranteed <em>only </em>to individuals and not to other non-human entities \u2014 for example, corporations, firms, partnerships, associations, organizations, institutions, and governments, their agencies and subdivisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">\u00b651 Article II, Section 10, guarantees \u201cthe right of <em>individual </em>privacy;\u201d likewise, the Article II, Section 9 exception to the public\u2019s right to know applies only with respect to matters involving <em>\u201cindividual </em>privacy\u201d (emphasis added). While non-human entities may enjoy confidentiality in some of their property interests under Montana statutory law \u2014 the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, Title 30, Ch. 14, part 4, serves as one example \u2014 and under some sections of the federal and state constitutions \u2014 the protection against the \u201ctaking\u201d of private property for public use without just compensation, comes to mind \u2014 these rights of confidentiality are not grounded in \u201cprivacy\u201d under Article II, Section 10, nor are such rights excepted from public disclosure by reason of the individual privacy provision of Article II, Section 9. The privacy protection afforded by Article II, Sections 9 and 10, is limited to individuals \u2014 i.e, to human beings.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">\u00b652 It is for this reason that the Department\u2019s present regulation is fundamentally flawed in lumping human and non-human taxpayers together for constitutional privacy purposes. Notwithstanding, whatever rights of confidentiality the two different classes of taxpayers enjoy in their tax filings with the Department, as a matter of law, corporations and other non-human taxpayers may not look to Article II, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>Section 10, and Article II, Section 9, for protection of those filings from public disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">\u00b653 That the Department failed to recognize this legal distinction in drafting its regulation is understandable. The Department, no doubt, took its lead from this Court which, unfortunately, has been similarly indiscriminate in its jurisprudence and interpretation of Montana\u2019s constitutional right to know and right of individual privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">\u00b654 Therefore, and with that in mind, I will begin with some general observations about the Constitution itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">\u00b655 If it is anything, the 1972 Constitution of Montana and, in particular, its Article II Declaration of Rights is a compact with the people. The Declaration of Rights serves as a shield to protect each individual from the excesses of government, from the tyranny of the majority, and from the sorts of abuses perpetrated by persons, firms, corporations, associations, organizations, and institutions that, in pursuit of their own interests and agenda, effectively would deprive the people of those things essential to their humanity and to their lawful individual pursuits. As we observed in <em>Armstrong v. State, </em>1999 MT 261, 296 Mont. 361, 989 P.2d 364:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-8\">Montana\u2019s Constitution, and especially the Declaration of Rights, is not simply a cook book of disconnected and discrete rules written with the vitality of an automobile insurance policy. Rather, our Constitution, and in particular its Declaration of Rights, encompasses a cohesive set of principles, carefully drafted and committed to the abstract ideal of just government. It is a compact of overlapping and redundant rights and guarantees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-9\"><em>Armstrong, </em>\u00b6 71 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">\u00b656 In the words of the framers, Article II of the Constitution, contains the \u201cfundamental principles and rights guaranteed <em>to the people </em>by their government.\u201d Montana Constitutional Convention, Vol. II, at 579 (emphasis added). Indeed, from the context of the language used and, just as often, from the plain language itself, it is clear that many of the rights set out in Article II are rights guaranteed to human beings and not to non-human entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">\u00b657 To be specific, Article II, Section 2, provides that \u201c[t]he people\u201d have the exclusive right to govern themselves. Captioned \u201cInalienable rights,\u201d Article II, Section 3, while using the broader term \u201cpersons\u201d nonetheless, in context, refers to human beings: \u201cAll persons are born free ...\u201d Only human beings are \u201cborn free.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>\u00b658 Article II, Section 4, is even more explicit. Captioned \u201cIndividual dignity,\u201d this section guarantees that \u201c[t]he dignity of the human being is inviolable. No person shall be denied equal protection of the laws.\u201d And to drive this \u201cpeople\u201d right home, this same section explicitly prohibits discrimination against any person by the state \u201cany person, firm, corporation, or institution... in the exercise of his civil or political rights on account of race, color, sex, culture, social origin or condition, or political or religious ideas.\u201d Again, only human beings share attributes of race, color, sex, culture, and social origin or condition, and only human beings can be discriminated against on the basis of these attributes. In guaranteeing persons equal protection of the laws and in protecting them against discrimination based on human-only conditions, the framers specifically prohibited both human <em>and </em>non-human entities from engaging in discriminatory conduct. Again, in context, \u201cpersons\u201d refers to human beings.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-3\">\u00b659 Article II, Section 6, guarantees freedom of assembly to \u201c[t]he people.\u201d Article II, Section 7, guarantees freedom of speech, expression, and the press to every \u201cperson\u201d \u2014 person being qualified by the pronoun \u201che\u201d which can, again, only refer to human beings. Article II, Section 8, guarantees the right of public participation to \u201c[t]he public.\u201d Article II, Sections 9 and 10, will be discussed in more detail later but are similarly worded to refer only to human beings.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">\u00b660 Article II, Section 11, provides protection from unreasonable searches and seizures to \u201c[t]he people.\u201d Any \u201cperson\u201d has the right to bear arms in defense of \u201chis\u201d home, person and property under Article II, Section 12. Article II, Section 15, guarantees the rights of adults to \u201cpersons\u201d under age 18. Article II, Section 16, guarantees open courts, a speedy remedy and full legal redress to every \u201cperson\u201d for injury to \u201cperson, property, or character.\u201d Again, the word person is qualified by \u201chis\u201d indicating that the rights guaranteed are \u201cpeople\u201d rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">\u00b661 Similarly, Article II, Section 17, guarantees due process of law to \u201cperson[s]\u201d and Article II, Section 21, makes the guarantee of bail to \u201c[a]ll persons.\u201d Article II, Section 23 protects \u201cperson[s]\u201d from being imprisoned to secure testimony, except as specified. The rights of \u201cpersons\u201d accused of crimes set out in Article II, Section 24, are qualified by the pronoun \u201chim\u201d or \u201chis.\u201d Article II, Section 25, guarantees that \u201c[n]o person shall be compelled to testify against himself... [nor] again put in jeopardy for the same offense previously tried in any jurisdiction.\u201d Article II, Section 27, provides protection to \u201cperson[s]\u201d against imprisonment for debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>\u00b662 Article II, Section 30, protects \u201cperson[s]\u201d from being charged and tried for treason except as specified. This section also protects the estates of suicides \u2014 again, suicide being uniquely human. Article II, Section 34, reserves unenumerated rights to \u201cthe people.\u201d And, finally, Article II, Section 35, allows special consideration to servicemen, servicewomen, and veterans.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">\u00b663 There are, however, a few notable exceptions to the \u201cpeople\u201d orientation of the Declaration of Rights. Article II, Section 26, guarantees the right of a jury trial \u201cto all.\u201d This section also refers to the \u201cparties\u201d which can, of course, include human beings and non-human legal entities as well. Similarly, Article II, Section 29, prevents private property from being taken for public use without just compensation to the \u201cowner\u201d without qualification as to whether the owner is human or non-human. Likewise, Article II, Section 31\u2019s prohibitions against <em>ex-post facto </em>laws, irrevocable grants of special privileges, and franchises or immunities, and its protection of contractual obligations is not limited to human beings nor is Article II, Section 32\u2019s prohibition against quartering soldiers in a house without the consent of the \u201cowner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">\u00b664 I make the point that, in many respects, the Declaration of Rights is a guarantee of rights to <em>the people </em>\u2014 i.e., to human beings \u2014 because, in our task of interpreting and applying the various rights of Article II in actual cases and controversies, we occasionally lose sight of this fundamental principle. We fail to ask some threshold questions. Whose right is this? Who has standing to assert this right? Is this a right which protects just <em>people </em>or is this right also enj oyed by non-human entities, as well? With only a result; in mind and often driven by the issues as framed by the parties or the trial court\u2019s analysis; or, sometimes, to resolve some perceived, though false conflict, or to \u201cbalance\u201d theoretically competing rights, we, on occasion, grant wholesale to entities other than <em>the people, </em>fundamental Article II rights that such non-human entities are not entitled to enjoy under the plain language of the section or sections at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">\u00b665 I make this criticism being the first to admit that I have signed some of these opinions. Moreover, I acknowledge that the U. S. Supreme Court has, in certain circumstances, interpreted the Federal Constitution\u2019s Bill of Rights and amendments so as to include corporations within the term \u201cpersons.\u201d <em>See, e.g, First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti </em>(1978), 435 U.S. 765, 780 n.15, 98 S.Ct. 1407, 1418, 55 L.Ed.2d 707 (stating that \u201ccorporations are person within the meaning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>of the Fourteenth Amendment\u201d and citing <em>Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific R. Co. </em>(1886), 118 U.S. 394, 6 S.Ct. 1132, 30 L.Ed. 118). <em>But see United States v. White </em>(1944), 322 U.S. 694, 698-99, 64 S.Ct. 1248, 1251, 88 L.Ed. 1542 (identifying Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination as \u201cessentially a personal one, applying only to natural individuals\u201d and cannot be utilized by or on behalf of \u201cany organization, such as a corporation\u201d); <em>California Bankers Ass\u2019n v. Shultz </em>(1974), 416 U.S. 21, 65-67, 94 S.Ct. 1494, 1519-20, 39 L.Ed.2d 812 (denying constitutional right of privacy to corporation).</p>\n<p id=\"AyP\">\u00b666 Furthermore, I recognize that the decisions of this Court for more than a century have tracked with federal precedent regarding the inclusion of corporations as \u201cpersons\u201d under Montana\u2019s due process clause. <em>See Helena Consol. Water Co. v. Steele </em>(1897), 20 Mont. 1, 9, 49 P. 382, 384 (quoting Michigan court decision that \u201c[t]he constitutional principle that no person shall be deprived of property without due process of law applies to artificial persons as well as natural...\u201d); <em>Montana Power Co. v. Public Service Com\u2019n </em>(1983), 206 Mont. 359, 364, 671 P.2d 604, 607 (stating that corporations are included within the definition of \u201cpersons\u201d for purposes of Article II, Section 4 (equal protection) and Article II, Section 17 (due process), as well as the Fourteenth Amendment). <em>See also accord, GBN, Inc. v. Montana Dept. of Revenue </em>(1991), 249 Mont. 261, 815 P.2d <em>595; D &amp; F Sanitation Service v. City of Billings </em>(1986), 219 Mont. 437, 713 P.2d 977; and <em>Tipco Corp., Inc. v. City of Billings </em>(1982), 197 Mont. 339, 642 P.2d 1074.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-3\">\u00b667 It is not my purpose here to revisit these decisions \u2014 there may or may not be legally sufficient reasons why \u201cpersons\u201d in one section of Article II includes only natural persons, but in another includes both natural and non-natural persons. I only suggest that in resolving cases we sometimes paint the protections afforded by the Declaration of Rights with a broad brush and with little analysis of whether the right or rights at issue were meant to protect only human beings \u2014 in furtherance of the <em>people </em>orientation of Article II \u2014 or, more broadly, both human and non-human entities alike.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">\u00b668 The case at bar has brought this observation into glaring focus. It is for this reason I conclude that we must address the issue of judicially-created, constitutionally-guaranteed \u201ccorporate privacy\u201d or, in default of doing so, simply add further support to an already substantial body of flawed precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">\u00b669 Again, it is not my purpose here to take this argument beyond Article II, Sections 9 and 10. I am hopeful, however, that having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>raised this issue here, future cases will permit us the opportunity to address this argument in a majority opinion not only as to Sections 9 and 10, but, when appropriate, in other Article II contexts, as well. \u00b670 That said, I turn next to our case law, for that is where this problem began.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">\u00b671 The notion that corporations are guaranteed privacy under Article II, Section 9 (and, therefore, necessarily, under Section 10), was first introduced into Montana law in <em>Mountain States Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v. Department. of Pub. Serv. Reg. </em>(1981), 194 Mont. 277, 634 P.2d 181. There, the utility sought to preserve the confidentiality of claimed trade secrets and proprietary and confidential information in a rate proceeding before the Public Service Commission (PSC). The PSC \u2014 correctly in my view \u2014 ruled that a corporation is not entitled to the protection of the individual privacy exception under Article II, Section 9, of Montana\u2019s Constitution and, therefore, denied Mountain Bell\u2019s motion for protective order.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">\u00b672 In a proceeding for judicial review and declaratory relief, the District Court, the Hon. Gordon Bennett, agreed with the PSC, but concluded that other provisions of Article II were available to protect the utility\u2019s legitimate property interests. Moreover, the trial court observed that, even despite the utility being excluded from the protection of the privacy exception to Article II, Section 9, the PSC could still have issued a protective order to preserve Mountain Bell\u2019s other constitutional rights in its confidential and proprietary information. <em>See Mountain States, </em>194 Mont. at 280-81, 634 P.2d at 183-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">\u00b673 On appeal, we first determined that a trade secret is constitutionally protectable property. <em>Mountain States, </em>194 Mont. at 283-84, 634 P.2d at 185-86. Then, without reference to, much less any analysis of, the Constitutional Convention (Con-Con) history leading to the framers\u2019 inclusion of the right of individual privacy in Article II, Sections 9 and 10, we concluded that since an individual might claim a constitutional privacy interest in a trade secret and, thus, take advantage of the right to know exception in Article II, Section 9, that \u201ca corporate owner of a trade secret is entitled to the same exception.\u201d <em>Mountain States, </em>194 Mont. at 284, 634 P.2d at 186. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-8\">[T]he provisions of our state constitution and statutes, when applied to deny the protective order in this case, have the effect of violating, as applied, the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the federal constitution, and the due process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>clauses of the state and federal constitutions, [leaving] for decision to some other case and time whether the remaining constitutional arguments of Mountain Bell have validity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-3\"><em>Mountain States, </em>194 Mont. at 283, 634 P.2d at 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">\u00b674 We also stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-5\">Our state constitution also guarantees due process, 1972 Mont. Const., Art. II, \u00a7 17, and equal protection of the laws, Mont. Const., Art. II, \u00a7 4. The application by the PSC of Montana\u2019s right to know provision in this instance created a conflict of that provision with due process and equal protection clauses of the state constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7W\"><em>Mountain States, </em>194 Mont. at 288, 634 P.2d at 189.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">\u00b675 The <em>Mountain States </em>Court correctly asserted that the federal due process rights of Mountain Bell may very well have been at stake, in that the corporation was being deprived of its property \u2014 trade secrets \u2014 without due process. The Court could have and should have stopped there. We should have turned strictly to those provisions of the federal constitution and disposed of the case on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">\u00b676 We went further, however. We noted that \u201cthe due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution also conflict with Montana\u2019s right to know provision as applied here by the <em>PSC? Mountain States, </em>194 Mont. at 288, 634 P.2d at 189. We also concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-8\">By holding that the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment require us to provide protection to Mountain Bell for its trade secrets to the extent not necessary for regulation, we confirm the police power of the state to regulate utilities, we resolve the seeming internal conflict in our state constitution created by the PSC in the application of the right to know provision, and we pay due accord to the due process requirements of the U. S. Constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-9\"><em>Mountain States, </em>194 Mont. at 288-89, 634 P.2d at 189.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">\u00b677 The problem with this approach was that we did not need to find a conflict between the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments and Article II, Section 9, to resolve the case on federal due process grounds. We needed only to recognize that the privacy right included in this latter section did not provide protection to non-human entities; but that, by virtue of the Federal Constitution\u2019s Article III \u201cSupremacy Clause,\u201d Mountain Bell\u2019s trade secrets were, nevertheless, clearly protected under the federal constitution. We could have disposed of the case by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>simply remanding for entry of an appropriate protective order grounded in due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">\u00b678 Nevertheless, since the issue as framed by the PSC and Mountain Bell focused solely on the right of privacy under Article II, Section 9, we apparently felt compelled to resolve the case on that basis. Our vehicle to accomplish this, as already noted, was to find a conflict between Mountain Bell\u2019s federal and state due process and equal protection rights and the right of privacy in Article II, Sections 9 and 10. <em>See Mountain States, </em>194 Mont at 288, 634 P.2d at 188-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">\u00b679 Contrary to our analysis, however, there existed no irreconcilable conflict between Article II, Section 9, and either constitutional due process or equal protection. Article II, Sections 9 and 10, protect only individual privacy interests. Neither section protects \u201ccorporate privacy.\u201d More importantly, nothing in Article II, Section 9, requires disclosure of proprietary or confidential information where that data is protected from disclosure elsewhere in either the federal or state constitution. The right-to-now provision of Article II, Section 9, like other constitutional rights, is not absolute. \u201cIt can be properly circumscribed when the right or interest against which it competes is weighty or compelling.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Smith v. District Court </em>(1982), 201 Mont. 376, 383, 654 P.2d 982, 986.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">\u00b680 Instead of relying strictly on constitutional due process to protect Mountain Bell\u2019s trade secrets, we approached the case strictly as presented and with the mind set that Article II, Section 9, right to know trumped all other constitutional rights except the right to individual privacy. We thus created for ourselves a Hobson\u2019s choice. Unless we interpreted Article II, Section 9, so as to grant corporations the same right of privacy that individuals were constitutionally guaranteed under Article II, Section 10, then the legitimate corporate property interests of Mountain Bell could not be protected. This approach was wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">\u00b681 Indeed, this is the exact opposite of the approach we took in <em>Smith. </em>There we determined that Article II, Section 9\u2019s guarantee was \u201cnot absolute\u201d and held that the public\u2019s constitutional right to know did not abrogate the defendant\u2019s equally important constitutional right to a fair trial. <em>Smith, </em>201 Mont. at 383-385, 654 P.2d at 986-987. <em>See also State ex rel. the Missoulian v. District Court </em>(1997), 281 Mont. 285, 304, 933 P.2d 829, 841 (determining that the media\u2019s Article II, Section 9, right to know and First Amendment and Article II, Section 7, right to free speech may be restricted to the extent neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>sary to protect a defendant\u2019s Article II, Section 24, right to the selection of an impartial jury). In reaching our conclusion in <em>Smith, </em>however, we effectively \u201cbalanced\u201d Section 9 with the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-3\">Based upon the Right to Know provision of the Montana Constitution and the right of access recognized under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, we hold that the public and press may be excluded from a pretrial suppression hearing only if dissemination of information acquired at the hearing would create a clear and present danger to the fairness of defendant\u2019s trial and no reasonable alternative means can be utilized to avoid the prejudicial effect of such information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><em>Smith, </em>201 Mont. at 385, 654 P.2d at 987.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">\u00b682 <em>Smith </em>reached the correct result and established that \u2014 like all constitutional rights \u2014 the right to know under Article II, Section 9, is not absolute. This right is textually limited by the right to individual privacy and, as suggested above, may simply not trump, without more, other constitutionally protected interests. However, I also suggest that unless a person can establish that a right to a fair trial embodies a privacy interest, Section 9 \u201cbalancing\u201d is inappropriate. The right to a fair trial \u2014 like the right to due process \u2014 is an entirely separate issue, and the two should be kept separate.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">\u00b683 Had we used the correct approach in <em>Mountain States, </em>we could have protected Mountain Bell\u2019s legitimate trade secret information under the due process provisions of the federal constitution. More importantly, there would have been no necessity to read into Article II, Sections 9 and 10, a protection for \u201ccorporate privacy\u201d which clearly was neither supported by the plain language of either section nor \u2014 as we shall see \u2014 intended by the constitution\u2019s framers.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">\u00b684 But we did not use the correct approach and, as night follows day, bad decisions create bad precedents.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">\u00b685 The \u201ccorporate privacy\u201d issue next came before this Court in <em>Belth v. Bennett </em>(1987), 227 Mont. 341, 740 P.2d 638. That case \u2014 an appeal from a decision from the same District Judge as in <em>Mountain States </em>\u2014 involved the State Auditor and Commissioner of Insurance\u2019s refusal to furnish an Indiana resident and magazine editor access to rating reports filed with her office and prepared by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) to assist insurance company regulators nationwide. <em>See Belth, </em>227 Mont. at 343, 740 P.2d at 639-40. The trial court, consistent with its approach in <em>Mountain </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number><em>States </em>ruled, among other things, that a corporation could not assert the right of privacy exception to Article II, Section 9, and that, while \u201c \u2018[t]here is a constitutional presumption that all documents of every kind in the hands of public officials are amenable to inspection, regardless of legislation, special exceptions [are] made to accommodate the exercise of constitutional police power and other competing constitutional interests, such as due process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Belth, </em>227 Mont. at 344, 740 P.2d at 640. Again, Judge Bennet had it right.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">\u00b686 Notwithstanding, we summarily reversed the District Court, holding that a corporation, \u201cas well as a natural person,\u201d can assert the right of privacy exception to the constitutional right to know. <em>Belth, </em>227 Mont. at 345, 740 P.2d at 640-41 <em>(citing Mountain </em>States).</p>\n<p id=\"AzEX\">\u00b687 While our ruling simply perpetuated the erroneous approach of <em>Mountain States, </em>the quoted language suggests another apparent point of confusion in our opinions. In both <em>Mountain States </em>and in <em>Belth </em>we made the mistake of equating corporations as \u201cpersons\u201d with \u201cnatural persons\u201d\u2014 i.e., individuals. It is clear that a corporation is a \u201cperson\u201d for due process and equal protection purposes under federal constitutional law. <em>See Mountain States, </em>194 Mont. at 288, 634 P.2d at 188 (citing <em>First Nat. Bank of Boston </em>(1978), 435 U.S. at 780, 98 S.Ct. at 1418). But it is equally clear, as I will demonstrate later, that a corporation is not an individual (i.e., a natural person) for privacy purposes. Under the law, \u201cpersons\u201d and \u201cindividuals\u201d or \u201cnatural persons\u201d are not one and the same. This important distinction, though evidently overlooked by this Court, was not lost, as we shall see, on the framers of our state constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">\u00b688 <em>Belth, </em>however, was not the last case to make this mistake. Our decision in <em>PacifiCorp v. Department of Revenue </em>(1992), 254 Mont. 387, 838 P.2d 914, addressed whether the Department of Revenue (DOR) could refuse to disclose to the corporate taxpayer information about the taxpayer obtained by and from the Multistate Tax Commission (MTC). DOR sought to assert the MTC\u2019s right of \u201ccorporate privacy\u2019 against PacifiCorp\u2019s right to know in the same fashion that we had allowed the Auditor to assert NAIC\u2019s privacy right in <em>Belth. PacifiCorp, </em>254 Mont. at 394-95, 838 P.2d at 918.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">\u00b689 As we did in <em>Belth, </em>we simply acknowledged without further question that corporations enjoy the right to know and the right of privacy protected under Article II, Sections 9 and 10. We ruled, however, that MTC was not a corporation but was properly classified as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>an \u201cinstrumentality of state government.\u201d Having made that observation we then went on to state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-3\">PacifiCorp\u2019s right to know prevails because no individual or corporate privacy is involved. Montana, California, and MTC cannot assert the right to privacy. They are not \u201cindividuals\u201d under Montana law \u2014 they are government entities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-4\"><em>PacifiCorp, </em>254 Mont. at 395, 838 P.2d at 918-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">\u00b690 Obviously, we were correct in our conclusion that governmental entities are not \u201cindividuals.\u201d The point we failed to recognize was that corporations are not \u201cindividuals\u201d either. More importantly, had we not been hamstrung with the erroneous holdings of <em>Mountain States </em>and <em>Belth </em>confusing the status of corporations as \u201cpersons\u201d with \u201cindividuals\u201d (natural persons) and granting corporations rights to individual privacy under Montana\u2019s Constitution, neither DOR nor MTC would have been able to argue that right in improperly attempting to withhold from the taxpayer the taxpayer\u2019s own file.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">\u00b691 Our next case implicating the <em>Mountain States </em>\u201cconflict\u201d between Article II, Sections 9 and 10, came with our decision in <em>Great Falls Tribune Co., Inc. v. Great Falls Pub. Sch. </em>(1992), 255 Mont. 125, 841 P.2d 502 <em>(Great Falls Tribune T). </em>In that case we ruled the statutory exception to the open meeting law, \u00a7 2-3-203(4), MCA, was unconstitutional under the right-to-know provision of Montana\u2019s Constitution, Article II, Section 9. <em>Great Falls Tribune </em>1, 255 Mont. at 131, 841 P.2d at 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">\u00b692 In doing so we first noted that Article II, Section 9, is \u201cunambiguous and capable of interpretation from the language of the provision alone.\u201d <em>Great Falls Tribune </em>I, 255 Mont. at 129, 841 P.2d at 504 (citing <em>Great Falls Tribune v. District Court </em>(1980), 186 Mont. 433, 608 P.2d 116; <em>Associated Press v. Board of Education </em>(1991), 246 Mont. 386, 804 P.2d 376). We also rejected the School Board\u2019s invitation \u2014 grounded in <em>Mountain States </em>\u2014 to balance the public\u2019s right to know under Article II, Section 9, against the Board\u2019s Article X, Section 8, right to control and supervise schools within the district.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">\u00b693 We rejected this argument, for among other reasons, that in <em>Mountain States </em>we determined that \u201ca corporation\u2019s trade secrets were a matter of individual privacy and that because trade secrets are constitutionally protected property rights, on balance, they exceeded the merits of full public disclosure.\u201d We then summarily disposed of the argument observing that, in the matter at issue, no indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>vidual privacy rights were involved. <em>Great Falls Tribune </em>I, 255 Mont. at 129-30, 841 P.2d at 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">\u00b694 While that statement was correct as far as it went, there were no individual privacy rights at issue in <em>Mountain States </em>either. The right to individual privacy was no more constitutionally guaranteed to the Board (or to DOR or MTC in PaeifiCorp) than it was to Mountain Bell in <em>Mountain States </em>or to NAIC <em>in Belth. </em>Quite simply, the focus of the case should not have been on individual privacy rights. The school board did not have any. The real issue was whether the public\u2019s constitutional right to know would prevail against some other constitutional right that might arguably have allowed the school board to close its collective bargaining negotiations. <em>See Great Falls Tribune I, </em>255 Mont. at 131-139, 841 P.2d at 505-510 (Weber, J., dissenting). While I agree with the result reached by the majority in <em>Great Falls Tribune I, </em>I cannot agree with its rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">\u00b695 Our next decision, <em>Montana Health Care Ass\u2019n v. Board of Directors </em>(1993), 256 Mont. 146, 845 P.2d 113, needs to be mentioned only because we summarily reaffirmed that \u201ccorporations have a right of privacy.\u201d <em>Montana Health Care, </em>256 Mont. at 151, 845 P.2d at 116 (citing <em>Belth </em>and <em>Mountain States). </em>We concluded that the privacy rights of employers and employees in payroll and claims-specific information \u2014 as asserted by the State Fund \u2014 did not clearly exceed the merits of public disclosure of that information. We remanded for a <em>Mountain </em>States-type protective order. <em>Montana Health Care, </em>256 Mont. at 152, 845 P.2d at 117.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">\u00b696 The \u201ccorporate privacy\u201d issue aside, the extent to which actual individual privacy interests were implicated in the request for the particular information sought cannot be discerned from our decision. More to the point, however, if there were no individual privacy interests at risk, then, but for <em>Mountain States </em>and <em>Belth, </em>\u201ccorporate privacy\u201d would not have prevented disclosure of the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">\u00b697 Moreover, it is interesting to note that we began our discussion of the privacy issue by citing <em>Allstate Insurance Co. v. City of Billings </em>(1989), 239 Mont 321, 325, 780 P.2d 186, 188, for the proposition that \u201c[t]he only limitation on the public\u2019s right to receive information is the constitutional right of privacy.\u201d Actually the constitutional right is to <em>individual </em>privacy and if <em>individual </em>privacy rights were not at issue, then the right to privacy would not have precluded the State Fund from simply giving the Montana Health Care Association the information it requested. Again, the notion of \u201ccorporate privacy\u201d ere-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>ated from whole cloth in <em>Mountain States </em>merely served to frustrate and complicate the public\u2019s legitimate right to know.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-3\">\u00b698 Finally, in <em>Great Falls Tribune Co. v. Day, </em>1998 MT 133, 289 Mont. 155, 959 P.2d 508 <em>(Great Falls Tribune II), </em>we addressed a situation where the Department of Corrections sought to assert the privacy interests of private vendors in their proposals to build a private prison against the media\u2019s attempt to attend DOC committee meetings where these proposals were deliberated. <em>Great Falls Tribune II, </em>\u00b6 1. In our discussion we reiterated our previous holding that corporations do have an interest in privacy protected by the Montana Constitution and that a governmental agency can assert this right on behalf of a private interest. <em>Great Falls Tribune II, </em>\u00b6 21 (citing <em>Belth). </em>We also observed that, based on <em>Mountain States, </em>the plaintiff Great Falls Tribune had conceded that the corporate vendors did have a constitutional privacy interest in their trade secrets and that privacy interest was an exception to the Article II, Section 9, right to know. <em>Great Falls Tribune II, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">\u00b699 In that posture we decided the case on privacy grounds determining that the vendors had no actual expectation of privacy in their proposals, other than trade secrets, and that, therefore, there was no privacy interest to balance against the public\u2019s right to know. We did, however, reaffirm that corporations have a constitutional privacy interest in trade secrets under Mountain States. <em>Great Falls Tribune II, </em>\u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">\u00b6100 Once again, while we decided the case as presented and based on <em>Mountain States </em>and its progeny, the simple fact is that had <em>Mountain States </em>been decided correctly, the \u201ccorporate privacy\u201d argument would not have been at issue in <em>Great Falls Tribune II. </em>The vendors\u2019 legitimate trade secrets could have been protected from public access under other provisions of the United States Constitution or, perhaps, under the Montana Constitution, and we would not have had to engage in privacy analysis as regards the information in the proposals that were ultimately subject to public inspection. Again, there simply would have been no \u201cprivacy\u201d interest that the vendors or DOC on the vendors\u2019 behalf could have asserted in frustration of the public\u2019s legitimate right to know.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">\u00b6101 Given this jurisprudential history of \u201ccorporate privacy\u201d in Montana, it is long overdue that the decisions of this Court return to and give effect to the actual language of Article II, Sections 9 and 10, and to the framers\u2019 intent. My analytical approach requires that we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>examine both carefully. Having done so, I suggest that, once and for all, we dispose of the notion that corporations and entities other than individuals are guaranteed the right to individual privacy set out in those two sections of Montana\u2019s Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">\u00b6102 With that approach in mind, I now examine the plain language of Article II, Sections 9 and 10, and the Con-Con history of each.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">\u00b6103 Article II, Section 10, of Montana\u2019s Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqP\">Right of privacy. The right of individual privacy is essential to the well-being of a free society and shall not be infringed without the showing of a compelling state interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">\u00b6104 Article II, Section 9, of Montana\u2019s Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMm\">Right to know. No person shall be deprived of the right to examine documents or to observe the deliberations of all public bodies or agencies of state government and its subdivisions, except in cases in which the demand of individual privacy clearly exceeds the merits of public disclosure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">\u00b6105 The matter of who was guaranteed this right of privacy under Section 9 came directly before the framers at the Con-Con with the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-9\">DELEGATE HELIKER: Mr. Dahood, being an ignorant nonlawyer, what is an individual?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-10\">DELEGATE DAHOOD: What is an individual?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-11\">DELEGATE HELIKER: Is it by any chance also a corporation? DELEGATE DAHOOD: A person can, of course, Dr. Heliker, as you well know, be defined to include a corporation under the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUg\">DELEGATE HELIKER: I know a person can, but can 8m individual?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-12\">DELEGATE DAHOOD: An individual, in my judgment, would not be a corporation, no.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-13\">Montana Constitutional Convention, Vol. V, 1680. Following this discussion the Con-Con delegates adopted Section 9 in the language set out above. <em>See </em>Montana Constitutional Convention, Vol. V, at 1669-1680.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-14\">\u00b6106 They then proceeded to the discussion of Article II, Section 10, which, at that point in the proceedings read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-15\">The right of privacy is essential to the well being of a free society and shall not be infringed without the showing of a compelling state interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Montana Constitutional Convention, Vol. V, at 1680. The following discussion then took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-3\">DELEGATE CAMPBELL: Mr. Chairman, fellow delegates, the right of privacy is a right which is not expressly stated in either the United States or the Montana Constitution. It is our feeling, on the Bill of Rights Committee, that the times have changed sufficiently that this important right should now be recognized. If I may, Mr. Chairman, I would like to add an amendment which the committee has made, and I would like it voted on before I continue. This would be to the \u2014 add to Section 10 the right of individual privacy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-4\">% \u2021 *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-5\">DELEGATE CAMPBELL: Yes Mr. Chairman, and the committee has unanimously approved this amendment and would request a vote on it if necessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-6\">CHAIRMAN GRAYBILL: So many as shall he in favor of adding the word \u201cindividual\u201d so that it reads: \u201cthe right of individual privacy\u201d, as the committee wishes to have this matter considered, please say Aye.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">Thereupon, the delegates approved this amendment with no dissenting votes. Montana Constitutional Convention, Vol. V, at 1680-81.</p>\n<p id=\"AjO\">\u00b6107 The discussion continued, however.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-8\">DELEGATE BABCOCK: May I ask a question, please? Would this preclude a corporation made up of family members?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-9\">DELEGATE CAMPBELL: It\u2019s not \u2014 it is intended to protect the individual as we have described it. We do not feel that a corporation is an individual. It can be considered a person, but not an individual. We don\u2019t think that this would apply in that area.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">\u00b6108 Montana Constitutional Convention, Vol. V, at 1681. Accordingly, from the foregoing discussion of the delegates at the Con-Con it is clear that they carefully chose the constitutional right of privacy to be a guarantee applicable to individuals only. They adopted the language of Article II, Sections 9 and 10, fully aware of and intending that this right of individual privacy would not apply to corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"A4IJ\">\u00b6109 Unfortunately, this fundamental point of constitutional history was seemingly lost in our rush in <em>Mountain States, </em>to judicially grant corporations a constitutional right of privacy equivalent to that guaranteed to individuals. Nevertheless, it is crystal clear not only from the plain language of Article II, Sections 9 and 10, but also from the Con-Con deliberations that the framers never intended that cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>porations and entities other than individuals \u2014 i.e, human beings \u2014 would be guaranteed privacy rights under Montana\u2019s Constitution. That we summarily read such a right into Article II, Section 9, in <em>Mountain States </em>and that we judicially created from whole cloth the constitutional right of \u201ccorporate privacy\u201d was wholly improper and beyond our authority. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1-2-101, MCA (a judge must not insert into a statute that which is omitted or omit that which is inserted); and <em>State ex rel. Nelson v. Ninth Jud. Dist. Court </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 70, 79, 863 P.2d 1027, 1032 (stating that this Court employs the same rules of statutory construction in determining the meaning of a constitutional provision).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">\u00b6110 That necessarily leads me to suggest a different approach to cases that involve privacy interests under Article II, Sections 9 and 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">\u00b6111 I start from the premise, as demonstrated above, that the protection from disclosure under Article II, Section 9, is not available to corporations or any other non-human entity. This necessarily raises the issue supposedly laid to rest in <em>Montana Human Rights Div. v. City of Billings </em>(1982), 199 Mont. 434, 649 P.2d 1283, where we determined that a governmental entity could assert the privacy rights of its employees. If so, does this mean that all non-human entities may, in similar fashion, vicariously assert individual privacy rights? For example, may a closely-held corporation assert the privacy interests of its shareholder-director, and thereby, essentially, assert a corporate right to privacy even though, as I have set forth here, no such right exists? I suggest that the correct answer involves the doctrine of \u201cstanding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">\u00b6112 In <em>Gryczan v. State </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 433, 942 P.2d 112, a case involving the constitutional right to privacy under Article II, Section 10, we stated that the following criteria must be satisfied to establish standing: (1) the complaining party must clearly allege past, present, or threatened injury to a property or civil right; and (2) the alleged injury must be distinguishable from the injury to the public generally, but the injury need not be exclusive to the complaining party. <em>Gryczan, </em>282 Mont. at 442-43, 942 P.2d at 118 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"ASl2\">\u00b6113 This standard follows the general principles of standing under the federal constitution, that parties must \u201crely only on constitutional rights which are personal to themselves.\u201d <em>NAACP v. State of Alabama </em>(1958), 357 U.S. 449, 459, 78 S.Ct. 1163, 1170, 2 L.Ed.2d 1488. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Thus, we have regularly denied standing to a party bringing a constitutional challenge who could not demonstrate that he or she had or would suffer injury. <em>See Bowen v. McDonald </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 193, 204, 915 P.2d 201, 208; <em>Olson v. Department of Revenue </em>(1986), 223 Mont. 464, 470-71, 726 P.2d 1162, 1166-67; <em>Stewart v. Board of County Com\u2019rs </em>(1977), 175 Mont. 197, 203, 573 P.2d 184, 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-3\">\u00b6114 We followed this legal principle in permitting a municipality to assert the privacy interests of its employees in <em>Montana Human Rights Div. v. City of Billings. </em>In doing so, however, we established a questionable rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">\u00b6115 We permitted the City of Billings in that case to represent the privacy rights of its employees, whose records it held and wished to protect from disclosure. The records were sought by the Appellant, Montana Human Rights Division. Following the two-part test, we reasoned that because the City, as an entity, could potentially suffer economic harm should it be compelled to release its employees\u2019 records \u2014 i.e., a lawsuit by its employees \u2014 it too satisfied the requisite \u201cinjury\u2019 for establishing standing. <em>Montana Human Rights, </em>199 Mont. at 443, 649 P.2d at 1288. We followed this rationale in permitting a state entity to assert the privacy rights of insurance companies in <em>Belth. </em>Similarly, we recently permitted environmental organizations to assert the rights of their members to a clean and healthful environment under Article II, Section 3, a provision whose language, in context, affords rights to natural persons only, similar to the right of individual privacy. <em>See MEIC v. Department of Envtl. Quality, </em>1999 MT 248, \u00b6 45, 296 Mont. 207, \u00b6 45, 988 P.2d 1236, \u00b6 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">\u00b6116 The legal principle that affords standing under such circumstances, however, has nothing to do with the real or potential harm that may befall the entity itself should individual constitutional rights be violated. Rather, the principle is derived from the relationship between the entity and the individuals whose rights it seeks to protect. That the entity may be injured is but one factor, and by no means a decisive one, in determining whether it should be afforded standing to assert the rights of individuals who are not named parties. See <em>NAACP, </em>357 U.S. at 459-60,78 S.Ct. at 1170. Rather, the focus is on the nexus between the entity and the individuals whose rights it wishes to represent before a court. In other words, an entity has standing only to the extent that the individuals comprising the entity have standing, and the entity need not allege any injury to itself. <em>See UAW v. Brock </em>(1986), 477 U.S. 274, 281, 106 S.Ct. 2523, 2528, 91 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>L.Ed.2d 228 (citations omitted). The entity, under the doctrine of \u201crepresentational standing,\u201d merely serves as an appropriate vehicle to better assert the rights of individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">\u00b6117 \u201cRepresentational standing\u201d is a species of the standing rule we recently utilized in <em>Armstrong v. State, </em>where we determined that health care providers have standing to assert their own rights as well as those of their patients who were not named parties. <em>See Armstrong v. State, </em>1999 MT 261, \u00b6 13, 296 Mont. 361, \u00b6 13, 989 P.2d 364, \u00b6 13. Under the \u201crepresentational standing\u201d doctrine, as the U.S. Supreme Court has made clear, an organization or association does not have standing to assert individual rights without actual injury to individual members. <em>See Sierra Club v. Morton </em>(1972), 405 U.S. 727, 740-41, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 1369, 31 L.Ed.2d 636. Likewise, the U.S. Supreme Court has established a stringent test for determining whether there exists a sufficient nexus between the organization and the individuals. <em>See Hunt v. Washington State Apple Adver Comm\u2019n </em>(1977), 432 U.S. 333, 343, 97 S.Ct. 2434, 2441, 53 L.Ed.2 383 (requiring that (1) members must have standing to sue on their own, (2) the interests that the organization seeks to protect are germane to the organization\u2019s purpose, and (3) neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">\u00b6118 The foregoing distinction is critical if this Court eventually determines \u2014 as I believe it must \u2014 that the term \u201cindividual,\u201d under Article II, Sections 9 and 10, excludes corporations and all other non-human, non-natural-person entities. If we do so, then the principle that some entities, including corporations, may have standing to assert the privacy rights of individuals must be clearly delineated. Thus far in our jurisprudence, as evidenced by <em>Montana Human Rights Div. v. City of Billings, </em>a sound, workable rule has not been set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">\u00b6119 In accordance with the foregoing general principles articulated in federal case law, I suggest the following standard for establishing representational standing to assert individual privacy rights pursuant to Article II, Sections 9 and 10. First, the entity must be able to establish the individual\u2019s or individuals\u2019 standing under the standard set forth in Gryczan; second, the entity must be able to show that its relationship with the individual or individuals is one that protects those privacy interests as a regular function of its policies, obligations, or duties; and third, the entity must demonstrate that the rem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>edy sought will inure to the benefit of those individuals who have or potentially will suffer injury. This standard would strike an appropriate balance between the federal standard set forth in <em>Hunt, </em>and our own precedent where representational standing has been afforded but not identified as such. <em>See generally Warth v. Seldin </em>(1975), 422 U.S. 490, 511-518, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 2211-15, 45 L.Ed.2d 343; <em>Greater Cincinnati Coalition for the Homeless v. City of Cincinnati </em>(6th Cir. 1995), 56 F.3d 710, 717-18; <em>Legal Aid Society of Hawaii v. Legal Services Corp. </em>(9th Cir. 1998), 145 F.3d 1017, 1030-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-3\">\u00b6120 By taking the \u201cindividual-means-individual\u201d approach to Montana\u2019s Constitution as a first step, and then addressing the issue of standing as a second step, <em>Mountain States </em>and its progeny can be viewed through a much clearer lens. For example in <em>PacifiCorp v. Department of Revenue </em>(1992), 254 Mont. 387, 838 P.2d 914, the messy analysis \u2014 i.e., the corporation\u2019s right to know prevails because no individual or corporate privacy is involved, since MTC and DOR are government entities \u2014 could have been swept aside and replaced with the following analysis: First: were an individual\u2019s or \u201cnatural person\u2019s\u201d privacy rights at issue due to the potential disclosure? If yes, then did MTC or the DOR have a sufficient nexus between their function as an entity and the individual\u2019s right of privacy? If yes, then would the remedy sought directly benefit the individuals\u2019 alleged injuries? If yes, then MTC and DOR would have had standing to assert the individuals\u2019 privacy rights to preclude the corporate taxpayer from obtaining the files. In <em>PacifiCorp, </em>since \u2014 as we conceded \u2014 there were no individual privacy rights being protected, neither MTC nor DOR had standing to assert rights of privacy. PacifiCorp was entitled to its file \u2014 not because MTC and DOR were government instrumen-talities without \u201ccorporate\u201d privacy rights of their own, but because neither entity did or could establish standing to protect some individual privacy right.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">\u00b6121 Thus, this approach would do away with this \u201ccorporation vs. government\u201d confusion. For example, the Court in <em>PacifiCorp </em>seems to indicate that MTC, as a government entity, \u201ccannot assert the right of <em>privacy.\" PacifiCorp, </em>254 Mont. at 395, 838 P.2d at 918. The Court in <em>Belth, </em>however, stated that a government employer can assert the privacy rights of its employees. <em>Belth, </em>227 Mont. at 345, 740 P.2d at 641. In point of fact, if a corporation or a government entity, under the representational standing doctrine, can demonstrate it has the requisite relationship to protect the privacy rights constitutionally guaranteed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>to individuals, then it matters not which sort of non-human entity asserts those rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">\u00b6122 Similarly, such cases as <em>Great Falls Tribune Co., Inc. v. Great Falls Pub. Sch. </em>(1992), 255 Mont. 125, 841 P.2d 502, could be more cleanly decided. Absent the Board establishing standing to protect individual privacy rights, we would never have had to reach the argument of whether the Board could claim its own \u201cindividual\u201d privacy rights in attempting to keep the press out.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">\u00b6123 This same analysis clarifies the dispute in <em>Montana Health Care Ass\u2019n v. Board of Directors </em>(1993), 256 Mont. 146, 845 P.2d 113. There, the appellant corporation invoked the right to know, under Article II, Section 9; likewise, the government entity invoked the right to privacy under Article II, Sections 9 and 10. Both rights were, essentially, presumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">\u00b6124 Under the analysis suggested here, without initially demonstrating its standing to protect individual privacy rights, the government could not have refused to provide the information requested.</p>\n<p id=\"AoK\">\u00b6125 Most recently, in <em>Great Falls Tribune II, the </em>State Department of Corrections and its potential corporate prison \u201cvendors,\u201d simply would have no right of privacy under Article II, Section 10. The State, therefore, could only argue, in an Article II, Section 9, action brought on behalf of the \u201cpublic,\u201d that the information sought did not emanate from a \u201cdeliberation\u201d of a public body. Rather, the \u201cnegotiations\u201d between the State and the vendors were not the kind of deliberations that the framers intended to keep open to the public via Article II, Section 9. This argument failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">\u00b6126 In turn, the parties that should have brought an action were the vendors. The vendors could assert trade secrets, or a similar property interest, under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. This would have been the vendors\u2019 cause of action. The State had no standing, on the vendors\u2019 behalf, to assert \u201ccorporate privacy\u201d rights that the vendors themselves were not constitutionally guaranteed. Again, no <em>individual </em>privacy rights were at stake and, hence, the government could not claim standing to protect those rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">\u00b6127 Finally, applying this approach in the case at bar, the corporate taxpayers have no privacy rights in their tax information under Article II, Section 9. For that reason, DOR has no standing to assert, on the corporate taxpayers\u2019 behalf, constitutional privacy rights that such non-individual entities are not able to claim for themselves. That is not to say that the corporations, as plaintiffs in their own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>right, might not be able to demand some other form of constitutional protection to maintain the confidentiality of their tax information. No one has advanced such a claim, however, and, accordingly, the further development of that argument must await a future case. The case <em>subjudice </em>was litigated and argued on the basis of corporate privacy considerations, and that is how it must be resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-3\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">\u00b6128 In conclusion, and, with all due regard for <em>stare decisis, </em>I must agree with Winston Churchill who is reported to have observed: \u201cIf you simply take up the attitude of defending a mistake, there will be no hope of improvement.\u201d It is time to undo the mistake we made in <em>Mountain States. </em>Based on the foregoing, I would overrule <em>Mountain States </em>and its progeny to the extent that our decisions judicially created and granted the constitutional right of individual privacy to corporations and, by implication, to other non-human entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">\u00b6129 It is time that we re-interpret the plain and unambiguous language of Article II, Sections 9 and 10, in the manner originally intended by the Con-Con delegates. The right of privacy protected under Montana\u2019s Constitution is a right guaranteed to <em>individuals </em>only. It is uniquely a \u201cpeople\u201d right. It is a right which may be enjoyed only by \u201cnatural persons\u201d \u2014 i.e., by human beings.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">\u00b6130 If a corporation or other non-human entity seeks to claim rights of <em>individual </em>privacy then, necessarily, such claims must be based on the corporation or non-human entity demonstrating representational standing via a sufficient nexus with individuals \u2014 human beings \u2014 whose privacy rights are at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">\u00b6 131 It is on this basis that I would reach the \u201ccorporate privacy\u201d issue and would, thus, arrive at essentially the same result as the majority. I concur.</p>\n<judges id=\"b291-8\">JUSTICE LEAPHART concurs in the foregoing special concurrence.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
