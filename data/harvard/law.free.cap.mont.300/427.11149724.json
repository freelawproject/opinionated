Following a trial by jury, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Swick. Evert appeals based on the District Court\u2019s exclusion of evidence that Swick also touched her sister inappropriately. We affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">\u00b62 The sole issue presented on appeal is whether the District Court abused its discretion when it excluded Cheri Barfield\u2019s testimony that Swick had inappropriate sexual contact with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">\u00b63 The Plaintiff, Candice Evert, was born on December 6,1965, in California. Evert had two older sisters, Cheri Barfield and Lisa Mullen. Evert lived with her mother, Faye Barfield, in California until 1976. Prior to 1976, Evert had become familiar with the Defendant, Craig Swick, who was a family friend. Following Faye\u2019s divorce, Faye and Swick dated for a period of time while Swick lived in California. However, Swick ultimately moved to Sidney, Montana, and accepted a position working for the Montana Department of Livestock.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">\u00b64 During the summer of 1976, Swick returned to California for vacation and, at the end of his trip, visited Faye and her three daughters. Faye asked Swick to take her girls to Montana for a couple of weeks for a vacation. Swick agreed and Swick and the three girls traveled to Montana. According to Swick, Faye promised that she would send return plane tickets for the girls in two weeks, however, Faye did not send the tickets and the girls were unable to contact Faye for several weeks. After making contact with Faye on the telephone, Evert\u2019s two sisters returned to California. Evert remained with Swick in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">\u00b65 Swick and Evert moved to Lewistown, Montana in the fall of 1976. Evert attended the public elementary school and they lived in a house in town. Approximately six months later, Faye contacted Swick and requested that he allow Evert\u2019s sister, Barfield, to return to Montana to live with Swick and Evert. Swick agreed and subsequently became Evert\u2019s and Barfield\u2019s legal guardian in 1978. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>Barfield lived with Swick for a short period before being placed in foster care.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">\u00b66 In 1979, Evert began to get into trouble at school and with the law. John Foster, a youth probation officer, became involved with Evert and Swick. During the next couple of years, Evert was placed in foster care for a short period of time, spent time at the Mountain View School for girls, and attended several drug and alcohol treatment programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">\u00b67 In 1985, Evert married her first husband, John DeNeeve. Evert and DeNeeve had a daughter who has lived with DeNeeve since the couple\u2019s divorce in 1990. Evert subsequently married her current husband, Warren Evert, in 1994. Following personal problems in late 1995, Evert sought help and began counseling with Dr. Anne Pincus in February of 1996. At the time of trial she was being treated by Dr. Cindy Miller.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">\u00b68 On April 16, 1997, Evert filed a complaint against Swick, in which she alleged that Swick had sexually abused her as a child. Evert alleged that during the years she had resided with Swick, between the ages of 10 and 15 years, Swick had sexually abused her on numerous occasions. On January 28, 1998, Evert filed an amended complaint in which she added the allegation that Swick had committed a crime of violence motivated by gender in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 13981.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">\u00b69 On December 22,1998, Swick filed a motion in limine asking that the District Court exclude any testimony by Cheri Barfield that she had been abused by Swick. Following a hearing to consider the parties\u2019 several motions in limine on January 4,1999, the District Court granted Swick\u2019s motion to exclude all portions of Barfield\u2019s testimony which related to her alleged abuse by Swick.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">\u00b610 Following a jury trial on January 11 through 16,1999, the jury found in favor of the Defendant, Swick. Evert appeals the District Court\u2019s order excluding the portion of Barfield\u2019s testimony which dealt with alleged abuse by Swick towards Barfield.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">\u00b611 The standard of review for evidentiary rulings is whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>See State v. Gollehon </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 293, 301, 864 P.2d 1257, 1263. We have recently stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-11\">Trial courts are vested with broad discretion to determine whether evidence is relevant and admissible and this court will not overturn an evidentiary determination in the absence of an abuse of discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>tion. <em>See State v. Link, </em>1999 MT 4, \u00b6 20, 974 P.2d 1124, \u00b6 20. The fact that discretion is permitted, infers that there may be more than one permissible way to resolve an evidentiary issue and that the District Court is in the best position to make that decision. In other words, there is not a purely correct or incorrect answer to every evidentiary issue. This is particularly true regarding evidence of prior acts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-n\"><em>Benjamin v. Torgerson, </em>1999 MT 216, \u00b6 15, 295 Mont. 528, \u00b6 15, 985 R2d 734, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">\u00b612 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it excluded Cheri Barfield\u2019s testimony that Swick had inappropriate sexual contact with her?</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">\u00b613 Evert contends that the District Court abused its discretion by excluding the proffered testimony of her sister, Cheri Barfield, in which she alleged that she had been sexually and physically abused by Swick. Evert asserts that the testimony was admissible pursuant to Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid., to show opportunity, identity or absence of mistake, that the testimony was part of the res gestae, and that the testimony was admissible as rebuttal testimony. Evert asserts that the probative value of Barfield\u2019s testimony, therefore, outweighed the prejudicial effect of the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">\u00b614 Evert made the following offer of proof regarding Barfield\u2019s trial testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-8\">Q. During the time you lived with Craig Swick, did he ever touch the private areas of your body?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-9\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-10\">Q. What did he touch?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-11\">A. He would pretend to try to tickle me and would touch my breasts and between my legs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-12\">Q. On how many occasions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-13\">A. A couple of times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-14\">Q. What was your response?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-15\">A. I told him to stop.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-16\">Q. What was his response?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-17\">A. He quit that, but then started beating me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-18\">Q. Did he beat you more than once?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-19\">A. Yes, many times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-20\">Q. Did you have bruises from those beatings?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-21\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>Q. Did you report the physical abuse to anyone else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-4\">A. Yes, I finally reported it to John Foster.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">\u00b6 15 At the hearing to consider Swick\u2019s motion to exclude portions of Barfield\u2019s testimony, the District Court explained its reasoning as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-6\">This is one of those issues I believe falls -under the probative value outweighed by the prejudicial effect.... I think that would be tantamount to directing the verdict to-to the Plaintiff, and I realize that if in fact this did happen that, you know, that that\u2019s very powerful evidence for-for the Plaintiff that the Defendant perhaps committed the sexual abuse, but, you know, I \u2014 looking under the character evidence rules as well as the 404 rules I-I would have a real difficult time based upon the fourth step of the <em>...Just </em>and the <em>Matt </em>notices, that the-probative value of the other act must not be outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, and I \u2014 I\u2014I just think it would.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">\u00b616 However, the District Court did allow Barfield to testify to observations of Swick\u2019s conduct with Evert. At trial, Barfield gave the following testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-8\">Q. During the time that you lived in Lewistown did you observe the Defendant touch Candice?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-9\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-10\">Q. Did that happen frequently?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-11\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-12\">Q. And where would he touch her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-13\">A. In inappropriate places.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-14\">Q. And what do you mean by that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-15\">A. Near her breast area and between her legs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-16\">\u00b617 Rule 404(b), M.R. Evid., provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-17\">Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-18\">\u00b618 First, Evert contends that the excluded portion of Barfield\u2019s testimony was admissible pursuant to Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid., to prove the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-19\">Cheri\u2019s testimony is admissible to prove the identity of the person who abused Candice. Further, if Swick had the opportunity to as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>sault Cheri, he also had the opportunity to assault Candice. Finally, the fact that Swick also abused Cheri shows an absence of mistake on the part of Candice as to who was assaulting her and the abuse to which she was subjected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">\u00b619 We have previously developed four criteria, referred to as the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule, to be used in determining the admissibility of such evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-5\">(1) The other crimes, wrongs or acts must be similar.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-6\">(2) The other crimes, wrongs or acts must not be remote in time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-7\">(3) The evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity with such character; but may be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-8\">(4) Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, misleading of the jury, consideration of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-9\"><em>State v. Matt </em>(1991), 249 Mont. 136, 142, 814 P.2d 52, 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">\u00b620  Our review of the record discloses no issue about identity, opportunity, or mistake. Swick clearly had the opportunity to abuse Evert. She lived with him. His defense was not that she was mistaken about the identity of her assailant. It was that she was not telling the truth. The only issue was the credibility of the Plaintiff and the Defendant. The evidence was offered to impugn Swick\u2019s credibility and bolster Evert\u2019s by proof of Swick\u2019s character. However, Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid. does not permit evidence of prior acts for that purpose. \u00b621 Evert also contends that Barfield\u2019s proffered testimony was admissible as part of the \u201cres gestae.\u201d Recently, in <em>State v. Hansen, </em>1999 MT 253, 296 Mont. 282, 989 P.2d 338, we clarified use of the term \u201cres gestae\u201d, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-11\">Res gestae generally refers to spontaneous declarations that are so closely connected to an occurrence that they are considered part of the occurrence. \u201cThe \u2018res gestae\u2019 rule is that where a remark is made spontaneously and concurrently with an affray, collision or the like, it carries with it inherently a degree of credibility and will be admissible because of its spontaneous nature.\u201d Black\u2019s, at 1305.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>Today these statement fall into four specific exceptions to the hearsay rule: (1) statements of present sense impressions, (2) excited utterances, (3) statements of present hodily condition, and (4) statements of present mental states and emotions. These four exceptions are found in Rule 803, M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">The concept of res gestae has not always been associated only with spontaneous declarations.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Such is the case in Montana where the concept of res gestae has also been associated with the \u201ctransaction rule,\u201d which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0r\">Declaration, act, or omission which is a part of the transaction. Where the declaration, act, or omission forms part of a transaction which is itself the fact in dispute or evidence of that fact, such declaration, act, or omission is evidence as part of the transaction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Section 26-1-103, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">The phrase res gestae, in itself, adds nothing but confusion to an already complex area of the law. The better practice isto abandon the use of the phrase altogether and to, instead, use the specific rule of evidence or statute that applies to the particular factual situation presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\"><em>Hansen, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 73-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">\u00b622 In this case, Barfield\u2019s testimony that Swick had inappropriate sexual contact with her, clearly does not fall within one of the four Rule 803, M.R.Evid. exceptions to hearsay. Nor does Barfield\u2019s testimony that she was tickled by Swick in inappropriate places a couple of times and when that stopped that she was physically abused by him, involve part of the same transaction as set forth in \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA. Therefore, the proffered testimony was not admissible pursuant to Rule 803, M.R.Evid. or \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">\u00b623 Finally, Evert asserts that the testimony should have been allowed to impeach the testimony of John Foster or in rebuttal. Evert contends that Foster testified that \u201che was not made aware of any abuse on the part of Swick.\u201d Evert asserts that Barfield should have been allowed to testify that Barfield had reported to Foster that she was physically abused by Swick. However, the record reveals that Foster\u2019s testimony was limited to his contact with Evert, and he did not testify regarding his dealings with Barfield:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>Q. During this entire period of time when you were dealing with Candi and in your conversation with Candi did she ever once make a report to you that Mr. Swick was sexually abusing her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-4\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-5\">Q. Did she ever once make a report to you that Mr. Swick was physically abusing her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-6\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-7\">Q. During this entire period of time did you ever concern yourself or feel concerned that Candi was being physically abused, sexually abused, or battered while in the presence or living with Mr. Swick? A. No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">Foster did not testify that Barfield did not report physical abuse to him. Foster testified that Evert did not report abuse to him. Therefore, Barfield\u2019s testimony would not have impeached Foster. Nor is it clear from our review of the record that it had any other rebuttal value which would have outweighed its prejudicial effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">\u00b624 The District Court noted the danger of unfair prejudice which would be produced by allowing Barfield to testify that she too had been sexually and physically abused by Swick. In denying Evert\u2019s second request to allow Barfield to testify following Evert\u2019s offer of proof, the District Court stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-10\">I think the most telling statement was in the Plaintiff\u2019s brief where she states, \u201cThe fact that Swick sexually abused Candice\u2019s sister in addition to Candice during the same time period while living in the same household certainly tends to support Candice\u2019s claim that he sexually abused her.\u201d To me that is exactly what we try to get away from under 404(b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-11\">\u00b625  For these reasons, we conclude that the District Court properly limited Barfield\u2019s testimony to the allegations contained in Evert\u2019s complaint and excluded the portion of Barfield\u2019s testimony about other acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-12\">\u00b626 The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b458-13\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES NELSON, HUNT and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
