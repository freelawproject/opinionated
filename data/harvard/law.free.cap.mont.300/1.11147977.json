Although Catharine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>raises several issues pertaining to the District Court\u2019s contempt power, we conclude that under the authority of our recent decision in <em>Lee v. Lee, </em>2000 MT 67, [299 Mont. 78], 996 P.2d 389, we are without jurisdiction to address the questions presented. Thus, we dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">\u00b62 A party is permitted to appeal from a civil judgment or order \u201cexcept when expressly made final by law.\u201d Rule 1(b), M.R.App.P. In turn, \u00a7 3-1-523, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-5\">The judgment and orders of the court or judge made in cases of contempt are final and conclusive. There is no appeal, but the action of a district court or judge can be reviewed on a writ of certiorari by the supreme court or a judge thereof....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">Section 3-1-523, MCA; <em>see also </em>State <em>ex rel. Anderson v. District Court </em>(1980), 188 Mont. 77, 79, 610 P.2d 1183, 1185 (holding that a writ of supervisory control may be granted in contempt cases where the party is barred from using a writ of <em>certiorari).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">\u00b63 Notwithstanding the foregoing statutory mandate, this Court has for years recognized a judicially created \u201cexception\u201d permitting direct appellate review of contempt orders in the family law context, including marital dissolution proceedings. <em>See In re Marriage of Sessions </em>(1988), 231 Mont. 437, 441, 753 P.2d 1306, 1308 (citing <em>In re Marriage of Smith </em>(1984), 212 Mont. 223, 225-26, 686 P.2d 912, 914) (acknowledging the \u201cfamily law exception\u201d to the writ of <em>certiorari </em>mandate in the context of dissolution of marriage proceedings). Nevertheless, we have also recognized in the family law context, as a matter of public policy, that \u201cthe best remedy to insure respect for the law and the orderly progress of relations between family members split by dissolution is to give effect to the contempt powers of the District Court <em>\u201d Milanovich v. Milanovich </em>(1982), 201 Mont. 332, 336, 655 P.2d 963, 965.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-8\">\u00b64 Because discretionary review of a petition for <em>certiorari </em>or supervisory control is \u201cfar more efficient and effective in upholding the \u2018family law\u2019 policy set forth in Milanovich,\u201d we sought in <em>Lee </em>to better define the family law direct appeal exception so that it could be \u201cproperly narrowed\u201d in light of the underlying public policy. <em>Lee, </em>\u00b6 34. In <em>Lee, </em>we began by noting that there are two distinct circumstances under which a court\u2019s contempt power may be challenged: first, where the court acts without jurisdiction; and second, where the court acts within its jurisdiction but in an arbitrary and tyrannical manner. <em>See Lee, </em>\u00b6 35. Since a writ of <em>certiorari </em>cannot be used to correct errors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>within a lower court\u2019s jurisdiction, we explained that where a court finds one party in contempt but also acts within its jurisdiction in adjudicating ancillary matters between the parties vis-\u00e1-vis the contemptuous conduct (e.g., marital property division, maintenance, child custody, visitation, etc.), the judgment must stand and may not be attacked by writ of <em>certiorari. Lee, </em>\u00b6 36. A writ of <em>certiorari </em>would be barred, under such circumstances, because the lower court did not exceed its jurisdiction in issuing the ancillary order. <em>See Lee, </em>\u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"A9R\">\u00b65 To illustrate, the contempt order at issue in <em>Lee </em>was reviewable on direct appeal under the \u201cfamily law exception\u201d because of the nature of the judgment in that case. <em>See Lee, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15-16 (discussing the judgment in some detail). In <em>Lee, </em>although one party was obligated pursuant to the underlying dissolution decree to transfer a horse and horse trailer to the other party as part of the distribution of the marital estate, the obligated party had sold those assets prior to final judgment while continuing to represent that she possessed them. Following appeal, the other party attempted to execute on the judgment and it was discovered that the obligated party had already disposed of the assets. The district court held the obligated party in direct contempt for her \u201c \u2018deceitful omission\u2019 \u201d concerning the marital assets and her refusal to comply with the terms of the precedent dissolution decree. <em>Lee, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 3, 15. Then, in the very same judgment, the district court calculated the money judgment due under the dissolution decree, factoring in the cash value of the horse and trailer and providing the other party with offsetting deductions to his maintenance obligations under the decree. <em>Lee, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 3, 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">\u00b66 Thus, where a court in a <em>single judgment, </em>issues an order of contempt against one party <em>and </em>an ancillary order within its jurisdiction in determining the rights of the parties as a result of the contemptuous conduct, a petition for writ of <em>certiorari </em>would necessarily be denied. <em>Lee, </em>\u00b6 37. Only this limited scenario triggers application of the family law exception to the writ of <em>certiorari </em>mandate contained in \u00a7 3-1-523, MCA. We held in <em>Lee, </em>therefore, that \u201cthe \u2018family law\u2019 direct appeal exception ... applies when, and only when, the judgment appealed from includes an ancillary order which effects [sic] the substantial rights of the involved parties.\u201d <em>Lee, </em>\u00b6 37. Conversely, \u201ca lone contempt order, regardless of the underlying law of the case, cannot be reviewed by this Court on direct appeal.\u201d <em>Lee, </em>\u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">\u00b67  Thus, the \u201cthreshold question\u201d in this case becomes whether \u00a7 3-1-523, MCA, bars a direct appeal by Catharine. <em>In re Marriage of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number><em>Harper </em>(1988), 235 Mont. 41, 44, 764 P.2d 1283, 1285. We conclude that it does. As stated in Catharine\u2019s appellate brief, she is appealing from the District Court\u2019s denial of her request to vacate its stay of a prior contempt and commitment order issued against Mark in 1996. While Catharine is not appealing from the court\u2019s initial finding of contempt, we determine that this direct appeal falls outside of the family law exception as narrowed in <em>Lee.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">\u00b68 Here, Catharine is appealing from the District Court\u2019s refusal to <em>enforce </em>its contempt power against Mark by lifting its stay on commitment and imprisoning him. As we have suggested in the past, however, a court\u2019s contempt power \u201cmust be exercised to its fullest extent to enable the court to discharge its high duty of administering justice between parties whose rights are put in issue before it, <em>or to enforce these rights after they have been determined\" State ex rel. Rankin v. District Court </em>(1920), 58 Mont. 276, 288, 191 P. 772, 774 (emphasis added). Without going into the merits, it is clear that the District Court has been discretionarily exercising its contempt power to properly enforce the parties\u2019 rights as determined in the 1991 dissolution decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">\u00b69 The order appealed from goes purely to the District Court\u2019s contempt power; the court did not adjudicate any ancillary matters falling within its continuing jurisdiction over the rights of the parties as determined under the 1991 dissolution decree. Catharine appeals from \u201ca lone contempt order\u201d and, therefore, her challenge \u201ccannot be reviewed by this Court on direct appeal.\u201dLee, \u00b6 37. Under the facts of this case, Catherine is precluded from challenging the District Court\u2019s enforcement of its contempt power on direct appeal. Rule 1(b), M.R.App.P.; \u00a7 3-1-523, MCA; Lee, \u00b6\u00b6 36-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">\u00b610 Asa result, this Court is without jurisdiction to reach the merits of Catherine\u2019s challenge on direct appeal. It is well settled that jurisdictional defects may be raised at any time by either party, as well as by the court <em>sua sponte. See Thompson v. Crow Tribe of Indians, </em>1998 MT 161, \u00b6 12, 289 Mont. 358, \u00b6 12, 962 P.2d 577, \u00b6 12. We decline, <em>sua sponte, </em>to entertain Catherine\u2019s direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">\u00b611 This appeal is dismissed without prejudice.</p>\n<judges id=\"b28-8\">JUSTICES GRAY, TRIEWEILER, NELSON and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
