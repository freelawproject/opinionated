Sprinkle pled guilty to each offense. The District Court sentenced Sprinkle to a term of 20 years in prison pursuant to \u00a7 45-9-101(3), MCA. Sprinkle appeals the District Court\u2019s sentencing order. We vacate and remand for findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">\u00b62 Although Sprinkle raised two issues on appeal, the following issue is dispositive:</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err when it failed to enter findings of fact to support its conclusion that Sprinkle was not excepted from the mandatory minimum sentence required by \u00a7 45-9-101(3), MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">\u00b64 Following Sprinkle\u2019s involvement in a drug transaction, the State charged Sprinkle with several offenses including criminal sale of dangerous drugs, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-9-101, MCA. Sprinkle pled guilty to each offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">\u00b65 On February 18,1999, the District Court, following a sentencing hearing, sentenced Sprinkle to a prison term of 20 years for the felony conviction pursuant to the mandatory minimum sentence requirement found at \u00a7 45-9-101(3), MCA. The District Court concluded that none of the exceptions to the mandatory minimum sentence found at \u00a7 46-18-222, MCA, applied to Sprinkle.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-11\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b430-12\">\u00b66 Sentencing is based on statutory law. <em>See State v. Stevens </em>(1993), 259 Mont. 114, 115, 854 P.2d 336, 337. We review the district court\u2019s application of the sentencing statutes to determine whether the district court was correct. <em>State v. LaMere </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 355, 358, 900 P.2d 926, 928.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">\u00b67 Did the District Court err when it failed to enter findings of fact to support its conclusion that Sprinkle was not excepted from the mandatory minimum sentence required by \u00a7 45-9-101(3), MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">\u00b68 Section 45-9-101(3), MCA, provides the following mandatory m\u00ednimums:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-6\">A person convicted of criminal distribution of a dangerous drug included in Schedule I or Schedule II pursuant to 50-32-222 or 50-32-224, except marijuana or tetrahydrocannabinol, who has a prior conviction for criminal distribution of such a drug shall be imprisoned in the state prison for a term of not less than 10 years or more than life and may be fined not more than $50,000, except as provided in 46-18-222. Upon a third or subsequent conviction for criminal distribution of such a drug, the person shall be imprisoned in the state prison for a term of not less than 20 years or more than life and may be fined not more than $50,000, except as provided in 46-18-222.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Section 46-18-222, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-8\">Mandatory minimum sentences prescribed by the laws of this state,... do not apply if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-9\">(4) the offender was an accomplice, the conduct constituting the offense was principally the conduct of another, and the offender\u2019s participation was relatively minor ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">\u00b69 It is conceded that Sprinkle had the necessary number of prior convictions to qualify for the mandatory minimum sentence, however, Sprinkle contends that he is excepted from the mandatory minimum sentence because his participation in the drug transaction was relatively minor, which he asserts qualifies him for the exception provided at \u00a7 46-18-222(4), MCA. Sprinkle also contends that the District Court erred when it did not enter findings of fact to support its conclusion. The State responds that substantial evidence supports the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Sprinkle did not qualify for the exception, but concedes that the District Court should have entered findings of fact to support its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-11\">\u00b610 Section 46-18-223, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-12\">(1) When the application of an exception provided for in 46-18-222 is an issue, the court shall grant the defendant a hearing prior to the imposition of sentence to determine the applicability of the exception.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>(2) The hearing shall be held before the court sitting without a jury. The defendant and the prosecution are entitled to assistance of counsel, compulsory process, and cross-examination of witnesses who appear at the hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-4\">(3) If it appears by a preponderance of the information, including information submitted during the trial, during the sentencing hearing, and in so much of the presentence report as the court relies on, that none of the exceptions at issue apply, the court shall impose the appropriate mandatory sentence. <em>The court shall state the reasons for its decision in writing and shall include an identification of the facts relied upon in making its determination. The statement shall be included in the judgment.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">\u00b611  In this case, the District Court did not comply with the requirements of \u00a7 46-18-223, MCA. The purpose of findings is to demonstrate the factual basis for the district court\u2019s judgment. <em>See Jones v. Jones </em>(1980), 190 Mont. 221,223-24,620 P.2d 850,851. Without findings we have no basis upon which to review that judgment. We, therefore, cannot review the merits of Sprinkle\u2019s first issue until the District Court complies with \u00a7 46-18-223, MCA. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court erred when it failed to enter findings of fact to support its conclusion that Sprinkle was not excepted from the mandatory minimum sentence found at \u00a7 45-9-101(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">\u00b612 We remand this case to the District Court for entry of findings to support its conclusion that the exception found at \u00a7 46-18-222(4), MCA, does not apply to the mandatory minimum sentence required by \u00a7 45-9-101(3), MCA.</p>\n<judges id=\"b432-8\">JUSTICES GRAY, REGNIER, HUNT and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
