The Petitioner, Safeco Insurance Company of Illinois (Safeco), one of the defendants in the underlying action, seeks review of the District Court\u2019s February 2, 2000 order, which granted summary judgment in favor of the Plaintiff, Pete Hill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>(Hill) on his declaratory judgment claim against Safeco. Safeco contends that in doing so, the court incorrectly interpreted current law governing an insurer\u2019s obligation to pay medical expenses incurred by an injured third party claimant in advance of final settlement or judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-3\">\u00b62 We assume supervisory control, and affirm the District Court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of Hill.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">\u00b63 The parties agree that on April 6, 1998, a motor vehicle collision occurred between a vehicle driven by Safeco\u2019s insured, Judith Bennett (Bennett) and a vehicle in which Hill was a passenger. It is undisputed that Bennett admits that her negligence caused the accident, and that Safeco was her liability insurer at the time. Hill suffered injuries as a result of the accident, and initially incurred medical expenses of approximately $15,000, a figure which he asserted in a statement of claim filed with the court in April of 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">\u00b64 Although Safeco apparently paid some of Hill\u2019s initial medical claims \u2014 according to Hill\u2019s July 7, 1999 affidavit \u2014 it eventually disputed the causal relationship between the accident caused by its insured and Hill\u2019s claimed injuries. It refused to pay any medical bills submitted for payment by Hill that were incurred beyond December 1, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">\u00b65 Hill filed suit on March 10, 1999, against Bennett for negligence damages, as well as against Safeco under three separate counts for its nonpayment of medical expenses. In part, Hill sought a declaratory judgment that he was legally entitled to advance payment of medical costs under Bennett\u2019s policy with Safeco prior to settlement or a final judgment, because Bennett\u2019s liability was reasonably clear. He asserted that such a declaratory judgment would be proper pursuant to Montana\u2019s Unfair Trade Practices Act (UTPA), as well as this Court\u2019s 1997 decision construing the Act, <em>Ridley v. Guaranty Nat\u2019l Ins. Co. </em>Hill moved for summary judgment on this declaratory judgment claim on July 7, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">\u00b66 Hill also brought an UTPA claim and a common law claim of bad faith against Safeco. The two counts were dismissed, however, by an order issued by the court on May 12, 1999, pursuant to a stipulation by the parties. On September 14, 1999, the court also granted Safeco\u2019s request to separate trials regarding Hill\u2019s negligence claim against Bennett and his declaratory judgment claim against Safeco.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>\u00b67 In support of his motion for summary judgment, Hill asserted that all of his medical claims made to date were causally related to the accident. Hill relied primarily upon the affidavit of his primary treating physician, Dr. Ronald Peterson. Dr. Peterson\u2019s affidavit attested that \u201cto a reasonable degree of medical certainty\u201d he believed that Hill\u2019s claimed injuries were sustained in, and were related to, the April 6, 1998 accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">\u00b68 Safeco, on the other hand, relied on the affidavit of its hired consultant, Dr. A. Craig Eddy, who stated that after his review of Hill\u2019s medical records he could not \u201cto a reasonable degree of medical certainty, make a causal connection between the April 6, 1998 car accident and Mr. Hill\u2019s continuing medical complaints.\u201d According to Hill\u2019s affidavit, he was never asked to submit to a medical examination by a doctor chosen or approved by Safeco. Additionally, Safeco contended that summary judgment in favor of Hill was inappropriate because any action \u2014 including a declaratory judgment \u2014 arising from an UTPA claim is expressly precluded from adjudication prior to a settlement or a judgment in the underlying action between the third-party claimant and the insured, pursuant to \u00a7 33-18-242(6)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">\u00b69 The District Court, in issuing summary judgment in favor of Hill, noted that \u201cnowhere in his affidavit does Dr. Eddy contradict the affidavits of Plaintiff or Dr. Peterson.\u201d Therefore, the court concluded that \u201cthe material facts as alleged by Plaintiff are not in dispute.\u201d The court further determined that \u201c[b]ecause this action does not directly seek bad faith damages for a violation of the Unfair Trade Practices Act, there is no statutory bar under Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7 33-18-242(6)(b).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">\u00b610 The District Court ordered that Safeco \u201cmust advance the medical expenses Mr. Hill has incurred as a result of his injuries sustained in the wreck with Judith Bennett.\u201d The court specifically ordered that Safeco pay \u201cthe amount of Mr. Hill\u2019s medical expenses for treatment rendered from the date of the accident through November 1, 1999.\u201d The court further provided, however, that Safeco may nevertheless raise \u201creasonable defenses\u201d as to the \u201cvalidity for any expenses for treatment after that date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">\u00b611 From this order, Safeco seeks this Court\u2019s review pursuant to its petition for supervisory control.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b151-3\">\u00b612 Generally, our standard of review of a district court\u2019s summary judgment order is de novo. <em>See Auto Credit, Inc. v. Long, </em>1998 MT 327, \u00b6 8, 292 Mont. 238, \u00b6 8, 971 P.2d 1237, \u00b6 8. In this instance, however, the District Court determined there were no significant factual issues and granted summary judgment to Hill based on its interpretation of the law. The parties concede that no genuine issues of fact remain. Accordingly, we will narrow our review to determine whether the moving party, Hill, was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See Nimmick v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(1995), 270 Mont. 315, 319, 891 P.2d 1154, 1156. Our standard of review pertaining to a district court\u2019s conclusions of law, in rendering a declaratory judgment, is to determine if the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>See Ash Grove Cement Co. v. Jefferson County </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 486, 491, 943 P.2d 85, 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">\n<em>I. Propriety of Supervisory Control</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">\u00b613 Safeco contends that a writ of supervisory control is appropriate because a direct appeal of the District Court\u2019s February 2, 2000 order granting Hill summary judgment would be an inadequate remedy. Safeco sets forth a scenario whereby a jury may eventually find its insured, Bennett, not liable for some or all of Hill\u2019s medical expenses. In turn, Safeco may have already paid Hill some of these expenses pursuant to the court\u2019s order granting summary judgment. This \u201cprocedural paradox,\u201d as characterized by Safeco, is a direct result of the District Court\u2019s legal error in refusing to stay Hill\u2019s declaratory judgment until either a settlement had been reached or a judgment had been entered, which is required under \u00a7 33-18-242(6)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">\u00b614 Article VII, Section 2, of the Montana Constitution gives this Court \u201coriginal jurisdiction to issue, hear, and determine writs <em>...\u201d </em>The exercise of supervisory control by this Court is also authorized by Rule 17(a), M.R.App.P. Supervisory control is appropriate when a district court is proceeding under a mistake of law and in so doing is causing a gross injustice for which an appeal is not an adequate remedy. <em>See State ex rel. Missoulian v. Montana Twenty-First Judicial Dist. Court </em>(1997), 281 Mont. 285, 290-91, 933 P.2d 829, 832-33 (citations omitted). Our determination of whether supervisory control is appropriate is a case-by-case decision. <em>See Park v. Sixth Jud. Dist. Court, </em>1998 MT 164, \u00b6 13, 289 Mont. 367, \u00b6 13, 961 P.2d 1267, \u00b6 13 (ci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>tations omitted). It remains an extraordinary remedy, however, exercised only in extraordinary circumstances. <em>See State ex rel. Mazurek v. Fourth Jud. Dist. Court </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 349, 352, 922 P.2d 474, 476 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">\u00b615  Here, we conclude that Safeco\u2019s application presents a legal issue which is appropriate for this Court to resolve through a writ of supervisory control. As explained by Safeco, should the ordered payment of medical expenses be incorrect, or a \u201cmistake of law,\u201d the delay in awaiting the outcome of the corollary litigation that will determine damages could create an unfair prejudice for Safeco. Likewise, any further, unnecessary delay in the payment of Hill\u2019s medical costs \u2014 if the court\u2019s summary judgment was appropriate \u2014 would certainly prejudice Hill. Safeco contends that an appeal brought at some point in the future, as compared with a resolution of this matter now, would be inadequate. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">\u00b616 We recognize, however, that due to the September 14, 1999 order for separate trials which followed Hill\u2019s July 7, 1999 motion for summary judgment, the granting of summary judgment on February 2, 2000, was not, technically speaking, \u201cinterlocutory.\u201d <em>See generally Cechovic v. Hardin &amp; Assoc., Inc. </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 104, 118, 902 P.2d 520, 528 (stating general rule that summary judgment orders are interlocutory and therefore not appealable until final judgment is rendered) (citation omitted); <em>Knight and Co. v. Fort Belknap Indian Agency </em>(1980), 188 Mont. 218, 220-21, 612 P.2d 1290, 1291-92 (concluding that appeal must be dismissed without prejudice under Rule 1, M.R.App.P., where order of summary judgment is interlocutory). Although the trial court did not certify the summary judgment as final, -under Rule 54(b), M.R.Civ.P., there was nothing preventing Safeco, if it chose to do so, from directly appealing the order of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">\u00b617 Nevertheless, this Court has determined that where an appeal is not \u201can adequate remedy because of the time necessarily involved,\u201d the relief of an aggrieved party should properly be pursued through a writ of certiorari, habeas corpus, or supervisory control. <em>See Matter of K.H. </em>(1985), 216 Mont. 267, 268, 701 P.2d 720, 721 (treating appeal as a writ of certiorari). In light of the central issue \u2014 the timely payment of medical claims \u2014 Hill does not resist our review of this matter. Specifically, he requests that this Court accept jurisdiction \u201cfor the purpose of clarifying and enforcing the law so that he is not further prejudiced by Safeco\u2019s ongoing delay tactics.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>\u00b618 Accordingly, Safeco\u2019s application for a writ of supervisory control is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-3\">\n<em>II. Issue Presented</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-4\">\n<em>Can a plaintiff litigate a declaratory judgment claim against an insurer for advance payment of medical expenses prior to the final settlement or judgment on the underlying claim against \u00e1n insured?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3x\">\u00b6 19 The issue raised by Safeco\u2019s application for supervisory control revisits the issues addressed in this Court\u2019s decision, <em>Ridley v. Guaranty Nat\u2019l Ins. Co. </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 325, 951 P.2d 987. In that case, this Court decided that when certain criteria are met, an insurer must pay an injured third-party claimant\u2019s medical expenses prior to final settlement. <em>See Ridley, </em>286 Mont. at 334, 951 P.2d at 992. We concluded that Montana\u2019s Unfair Trade Practices Act, specifically subsections (6) and (13) of \u00a7 33-18-201, MCA, imposed an obligation on insurers to pay an injured third party\u2019s medical expenses \u2014 which were provided for under its insured\u2019s policy \u2014 prior to final settlement when liability is reasonably clear. <em>See Ridley, </em>286 Mont. at 334, 951 P.2d at 992.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">\u00b620 In this instance, the court followed <em>Ridley </em>and determined that Bennett\u2019s liability was reasonably clear \u2014 she admitted to negligence in her Answer. The court concluded that no material facts were in dispute concerning the causal relationship between the accident and Hill\u2019s medical claims, because Safeco\u2019s lone piece of evidence, the affidavit of Dr. Eddy, did not contradict material facts. Therefore, Safeco \u2014 given an ample opportunity to do so \u2014 could not establish a reasonable basis for denial of the payment. Under the circumstances, the court determined that Safeco must, as a matter of law, pay those medical bills no longer in dispute in advance of settlement or judgment. In doing so, the court acknowledged that this would \u201cterminate the controversy or remove uncertainty,\u201d as required by the statutes governing declaratory judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">\u00b621 Before proceeding, we first find it necessary to address a portion of Safeco\u2019s argument, which suggests that the question here is actually \u201cwhether an insurance company can be forced to defend its decision on the advance pay issues <em>before its insured\u2019s liability for those expenses has been established\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">\u00b622  We agree with Safeco that Montana law does not allow a plaintiff to bring a direct action against an insurer until the liability of the insured has been established, unless such a right is \u201cexpressly sanctioned by the legislature and not merely inferentially deduced.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number><em>See, e.g., Ulrigg v. Jones </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 215, 224-25, 907 P.2d 937, 943 (citations omitted). How this principle is relevant in this matter, however, is unclear.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">\u00b623 In her answer, Bennett admitted to committing negligence \u2014 i.e., breaching a duty \u2014 as far as the accident was concerned, stopping short of admitting liability for any or all of Hill\u2019s claimed injuries. That her negligence was in turn the <em>cause </em>of those injuries initially claimed by Hill was determined by the District Court following the submission of affidavits by both parties attesting to the causal relationship between the accident and Hill\u2019s medical claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">\u00b624 Thus, the District Court determined that the only matter reserved for trial would be damages, which may or may not include damages in excess of the medical expenses at issue here. Nevertheless, Bennett is liable for injuries resulting from the accident, a portion of which are no longer in dispute, and the remainder of which remain to be proven by Hill.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">\u00b625 Whether Safeco, as a matter of law, must pay for that undisputed portion, and only that portion, in advance of settlement or judgment is the issue before this Court. Safeco\u2019s repeated assertions that Bennett\u2019s \u201cliability\u201d is somehow still at issue is therefore without merit and will be disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">\u00b626 Aside from the foregoing diversion, Safeco has carefully narrowed its summary judgment arguments here to the focal issue of whether the language of \u00a7 33-18-242(6)(b), MCA, under Montana\u2019s Unfair Trade Practices Act, requires that Hill\u2019s declaratory judgment must be stayed until after the settlement or final adjudication of his claim against Safeco\u2019s insured. The application of this statute, Safeco correctly points out, was not at issue or discussed in <em>Ridley.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">\u00b627 Section 33-18-242(6)(b), MCA, provides that a \u201cthird-party claim\u00e1nt may not file an action under this section until after the underlying claim has been settled or a judgment entered in favor of the claimant on the underlying claim.\u201d <em>See Poteat v. St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co. </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 117, 120, 918 P.2d 677, 679 (stating that a district court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over such an UTPA claim until final settlement or judgment is achieved). Thus, according to Safeco, the District Court failed as a matter of law to abide by the mandate of \u00a7 33-18-242(6)(b), MCA, by determining that Hill could properly enforce a right provided by the UTPA, in an action seeking advance payments on his medical claims prior to the settlement or adjudication of his negligence claim against Bennett.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>\u00b628  As we recently explained in <em>Fisher v. State Farm Gen. Ins. Co., </em>however, section 33-18-242(1), MCA, expressly provides that an UTPA claim against an insurer is an independent cause of action <em>See Fisher, </em>1999 MT 308, \u00b6 16, 297 Mont. 201, \u00b6 16, 991 P.2d 452, \u00b6 16. We agree with Safeco that a third-party claimant who wishes to bring such an independent action under UTPA is required, by statute, to wait until \u201cafter the underlying claim has been settled or a judgment [is] entered in favor of the claimant on the underlying claim.\u201d <em>See generally Peris v. Safeco Ins. Co. </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 486, 491-92, 916 P.2d 780, 784 (discussing legislative intent of subsection (6)(b)). The language of the statute itself provides the underlying reasoning. Only those third-party claimants who are able to achieve a settlement or prevail at trial may, in turn, bring an UTPA action \u2014 meaning meritless UTPA claims are theoretically extinguished before a claim is ever filed. This provision serves to both protect insurers from frivolous claims and facilitate judicial economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">\u00b629 Safeco\u2019s brief provides little assistance in our search for sound legal authority, however, that the District Court incorrectly concluded that subsection (6)(b) does not apply to Hill\u2019s declaratory judgment action, and that the court therefore erred as a matter of law by not staying the proceedings. Rather, Safeco\u2019s position is premised on the imaginative reasoning that Hill\u2019s declaratory judgment action is nothing more, really, than an UTPA claim under a different name. For example, on page 10 of its brief, Safeco argues that Hill\u2019s declaratory judgment claim against Safeco \u201carises\u201d under \u00a7 33-18-242(1), MCA, and this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Ridley. </em>We will not dispute this. Hill requested that the court apply the governing law as expressed in <em>Ridley </em>and under UTPA in determining the parties\u2019 legal status and rights respecting Bennett\u2019s insurance policy with Safeco, and Hill\u2019s status as an innocently injured third-party claimant. By page 14, however, Hill\u2019s declaratory judgment claim is interestingly transformed into an actual \u201cUTPA claim against Safeco.\u201d By page 15, Hill\u2019s claim ripens into a bona fide \u201cbad faith case.\u201d Then, Safeco reaches its conclusion by claiming that Hill could not bring \u201chis <em>claim </em>against Safeco until he settles or adjudicates his underlying <em>claim </em>against Safeco\u2019s insured,\u201d as required of <em>all UTPA claims </em>under \u00a7 33-18-242(6)(b), MCA, (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">\u00b630 Noticeably absent from this slight-of-hand chronology is the fact that as a result of Safeco\u2019s own motion before the District Court, Hill\u2019s UTPA and common law bad faith claims were dismissed pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>ant to the parties\u2019 stipulation. Accordingly, the District Court did not award damages for bad faith, or an unfair trade practice. Rather, the court simply instructed Safeco to pay those medical expenses provided for under Bennett\u2019s policy that were no longer in dispute \u2014 those that Hill had incurred up to November 1, 1999. Beyond that date, the court clearly afforded Safeco the right to \u201craise reasonable defenses, which can be substantiated with a clearly stated, good faith argument....\u201d Further, the court correctly omitted any determination regarding Hill\u2019s claim to lost wages, which clearly falls outside the scope of our decision in <em>Ridley. </em>In every respect, the court narrowly tailored its declaratory judgment to those medical expenses that, under <em>Ridley, </em>a third-party claimant is unequivocally entitled to prior to settlement or entry of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">\u00b631  The purpose of the Declaratory Judgment Act, after all, is to \u201csettle and to afford relief from uncertainty and insecurity with respect to rights, status, and other legal relations.\u201d Section 27-8-102, MCA. While the focus of the Act is on construing rights under written instruments, <em>see </em>\u00a7 27-8-202, MCA, a court is not restricted in \u201cany proceeding where declaratory relief is sought in which a judgment or decree will terminate the controversy or remove an uncertainty.\u201d Section 27-8-205, MCA. Thus, a court has the liberal discretion to \u201cdeclare rights, status, and other legal relations whether or not further relief is or could be claimed.\u201d Section 27-8-201, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">\u00b632 In accordance with the foregoing statutory language, the declaratory judgment sought by Hill, in theory, actually removed the necessity of his pursuing a <em>Ridley-based </em>UTPA claim. Indeed, Hill did in fact pursue such a claim, insisting that it would be an unfair trade practice for Safeco to withhold advance payment of Hill\u2019s medical claims in light of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Ridley. </em>In turn, this claim no doubt would have led to a lengthy dispute over the underlying facts of the parties\u2019 respective conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">\u00b633 Where an insurer\u2019s duties turn on a question of law, however, especially where those duties have been previously and conclusively determined by either the Legislature or this Court, such a protracted affair would be imprudent from both parties\u2019 standpoints, in that the cost of litigation could certainly be reined in by a declaratory judgment that produces the same result. In fact, such a tactical decision is routinely made by insurers. <em>See, </em>e.g., <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Cumiskey </em>(1983), 204 Mont. 350, 358, 665 P.2d 223, 227 (discussing insurers\u2019 use of declaratory judgment to obtain a determination of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>validity, continuance, or coverage of an insurance policy; a determination of the extent of liability; or a determination of the insurer\u2019s duties under the policy). In this sense, Safeco should be grateful that what amounts to a question of law could be resolved in such an efficient manner \u2014 especially in light of the potential for awarding the successful third-party claimant far more than the actual medical costs under Montana\u2019s UTPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-3\">\u00b634  We therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s conclusion that because Hill\u2019s declaratory judgment claim did not directly seek bad faith damages for a violation of the UTPA, there was no statutory bar under \u00a7 33-18-242(6)(b), MCA. In doing so, we again emphasize that the District Court did not determine that Safeco violated UTPA, or acted in bad faith, or that the ordered payment of advance medical expenses constitutes a money judgment for \u201cdamages\u201d in the ordinary sense. To the contrary, the District Court merely removed all uncertainty and controversy over the issue of <em>when </em>the inevitable policy proceeds are due.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">\u00b635 The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b157-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICE HUNT, REGNIER, TRIEWEILER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b157-6\">JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"Ayh\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">\u00b636 While I do not disagree with the Court\u2019s analysis of the substantive legal issue presented in this application for a writ of supervisory control, I would not reach that issue because this case does not meet the test pursuant to which we exercise supervisory control. In my view, we must maintain that test \u2014 and apply it consistently \u2014 lest we become so overwhelmed by original proceedings such as this that we are unable to address cases on appeal in any relatively expeditious way. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s exercise of supervisory control in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">\u00b637 The Court states that supervisory control is appropriate when a district court is proceeding under a mistake of law and in so doing is causing a gross injustice for which an appeal is not an adequate remedy. It goes on to observe that, even under that test, supervisory control is an extraordinary remedy exercised only in extraordinary circumstances. I could not agree more. Having properly stated the applicable principles, however, the Court fails to apply them.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">\u00b638 In the first instance, it is clear from the Court\u2019s analysis of the substantive legal issue that the District Court was not \u201cproceeding under a mistake of law.\u201d Since the test for supervisory control is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>stated in the conjunctive by use of the word \u201cand\u201d \u2014 that is, both prongs of the test must be met \u2014 this should end our inquiry about whether to accept this case and exercise our supervisory control jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">\u00b639 Even ignoring the conjunctive nature of the test, however, no gross injustice is being caused by the District Court\u2019s order on summary judgment. As the Court states, Safeco\u2019s argument in this regard is <em>that </em>\u2014 if the District Court is <em>incorrect </em>as a matter of law \u2014 delay in awaiting the outcome of the corollary litigation <em>could </em>create unfair prejudice against Safeco. This is a far cry from the requirement of the second prong of the test, which is \u201ccausing gross injustice for which an appeal is not an adequate remedy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">\u00b640 Nor is the Court correct in suggesting that there would be further delays in the payment of Hill\u2019s medical costs \u2014 in the event the District Court was <em>correct </em>as a matter of law \u2014 which \u201cwould certainly prejudice Hill.\u201d In granting Hill\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the trial court ordered that Safeco <em>\u201cshall </em>pay ... Hill\u2019s medical expenses for treatment rendered from the date of the accident through November 1, 1999.\u201d Under that order, it is clear that Safeco must pay those expenses at this time, not at some time in the future. Thus, there can be no further delays in those payments and no prejudice to Hill.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">\u00b641 Finally, I do not follow the Court\u2019s logic or analysis in \u00b6\u00b6 16 and 17. There, the Court states that the order granting summary judgment was not, technically speaking, interlocutory and Safeco could have taken a direct appeal from that order. It cites to no authority for this proposition and I am aware of none. Moreover, if the order was appealable, it should have been appealed rather than raised via this original proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">\u00b642 It is clear that both parties to the underlying case want this Court to resolve the substantive legal issue at this time. That fact, however, has no bearing on whether our test for exercising supervisory control is met. It also is clear that the Court is interested in addressing the substantive legal issue at this time. That, too, should have no bearing on whether our test for exercising supervisory control is met. Here, there is no error of law which is causing a gross injustice for which an appeal is not an adequate remedy. Nor is this a case involving extraordinary circumstances calling for the extraordinary remedy of supervisory control.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">\u00b643 By its action here, it is my view that the Court has unnecessarily blurred the lines between appeals and applications for supervi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>sory control and has obliterated any test for exercising supervisory control. In essence, it has decided that, while continuing to state the requirements to be met before supervisory control will be exercised, it will accept any application for supervisory control involving an issue it wants to address immediately. Parties litigant in ordinary appeals will feel the impacts of the Court\u2019s decision today, as we invite unlimited applications for supervisory control which consume more and more of our time. Trial courts will feel the impacts doubly: 1) as more and more of their cases, long scheduled and moving toward trial, are disrupted by applications for supervisory control; and 2) by having rulings which may have become moot by further proceedings raised and resolved in this Court on supervisory control.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-3\">\u00b644 I cannot join in this course of action. I dissent from the Court\u2019s decision to exercise supervisory control in this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
