We invited briefs by <em>amicus curiae </em>and classified the case for oral argument. We now vacate the District Court\u2019s determination that documents sought to be discovered by the petitioner, the Estate of George Huether, Jr., are not discoverable under the hospital peer review statutes codified at Title 50, Chapter 16, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>part 2, MCA, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">\u00b62 The issue is whether the District Court erred in denying the Estate\u2019s discovery request pursuant to Title 50, Chapter 16, part 2, MCA, and this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Sistok v. Kalispell Regional Hosp. </em>(1991), 251 Mont. 38, 823 P.2d 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">\u00b63 In June 1992, seventy-eight year old George Huether, Jr., underwent surgery for colon cancer at Holy Rosary Hospital in Miles City, Montana. An hour after being returned to the surgical floor from the recovery room, Huether stopped breathing. Although he was successfully resuscitated, he suffered severe brain damage and died when he was taken off life support a few days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">\u00b64 Huether\u2019s son, as the personal representative of his estate, filed a wrongful death action against the Hospital, asserting that the Hospital staff did not monitor Huether closely enough following his surgery. As part of discovery, the Estate asked the Hospital to produce \u201cany incident reports or similar reports prepared with regard to any aspect of the care and treatment of George Huether, Jr., while a patient at Holy Rosary Hospital.\u201d Specifically, the Estate was interested in any documents indicating that Huether\u2019s vital signs were being recorded at least every fifteen minutes by an automatic monitor called a \u201cCritikon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">\u00b65 The Hospital objected to the discovery request on grounds that any such documents would not be subject to discovery under \u00a7\u00a7 50-16-201 through -205, MCA, which provide for confidentiality of information and proceedings of in-hospital medical staff committees, also known as peer review committees. The Estate moved to compel production in compliance with its request. The District Court denied the motion to compel, reasoning that the privilege for data of hospital peer review committees, as set forth in the above statutes and interpreted in this Court\u2019s <em>Sistok </em>opinion, is absolute.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">\u00b66 The Estate filed an application for this Court\u2019s supervisory control. At the Court\u2019s invitation, five <em>amicus curiae </em>briefs were submitted prior to the oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">\u00b67 Did the District Court err in denying the Estate\u2019s discovery request pursuant to Title 50, Chapter 16, part 2, MCA, and this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Sistok v. Kalispell Regional Hosp. </em>(1991), 251 Mont. 38, 823 P.2d 251?</p>\n<p id=\"b239-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>\u00b68 The Estate argues that the District Court\u2019s order denying the motion to compel gives unconstitutional application to Title 50, Chapter 16, part 2, MCA. It asks this Court to clarify whether <em>Sistok </em>stands for the rule that an absolute privilege surrounds medical staff committees, and, if so, to expressly overrule <em>Sistok </em>or to declare that Title 50, Chapter 16, part 2, MCA, violates the right of access to the courts as set forth at Article II, Section 16 of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-3\">\u00b69 Montana\u2019s hospital peer review statutes are typical of the statutes adopted by various states to encourage candor in hospital staff committees which review and evaluate the quality of medical care provided in their hospitals. The goal is to promote continuous improvement in the quality of health care delivery through review of standardized health care operations and the performance of doctors and staff. <em>See Sistok, </em>251 Mont. at 40-41, 823 P.2d at 253; American Medical Association, <em>A Compendium of State Peer Review Immunity Laws </em>(1988 &amp; Supp. 1994); Charles D. Creech, <em>The Medical Review Committee Privilege: A Jurisdictional Survey, </em>67 N.C.L. Rev. 179 (1988). Because the language used in statutes is the first basis for their interpretation, we set forth Title 50, Chapter 16, part 2, MCA, in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-4\">50-16-201. Data defined. As used in this part, \u201cdata\u201d means written reports, notes, or records of tissue committees or other medical staff committees in connection with the professional training, supervision, or discipline of the medical staff of hospitals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-5\">50-16-202. Committees to have access to information. It is in the interest of public health and patient medical care that in-hospital medical staff committees have access to the records, information, and other data relating to the condition and treatment of patients in such hospital to study and evaluate for the purpose of evaluating matters relating to the care and treatment of such patients for research purposes and for the purpose of reducing morbidity or mortality and obtaining statistics and information relating to the prevention and treatment of diseases, illnesses, and injuries. To carry out such purposes, any hospital, its agents and employees may provide medical records, information, or other data relating to the condition and treatment of any patient in said hospital to any in-hospital medical staff committee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-6\">50-16-203. Committee information and proceedings confidential and privileged. All such records, data, and information shall be confidential and privileged to said committee and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>members thereof, as though such hospital patients were the patients of the members of such committee. All proceedings and in-hospital records and reports of such medical staff committees shall be confidential and privileged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-4\">50-16-204. Restrictions on use or publication of information. Such in-hospital medical staff committees shall use or publish information from such material only for the purpose of evaluating matters of medical care, therapy, and treatment for research and statistical purposes. Neither such in-hospital medical staff committee nor the members, agents, or employees thereof shall disclose the name or identity of any patient whose records have been studied in any report or publication of findings and conclusions of such committee, but such in-hospital medical staff committee, its members, agents, or employees shall protect the identity of any patient whose condition or treatment has been studied and shall not disclose or reveal the name of any such in-hospital patient.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-5\">50-16-205. Data confidential \u2014 inadmissible in judicial proceedings. All data shall be confidential and shall not be admissible in evidence in any judicial proceeding, but this section shall not affect the admissibility in evidence of records dealing with the patient\u2019s hospital care and treatment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">\u00b610 <em>Sistok </em>represented this Court\u2019s first opportunity to interpret Montana\u2019s hospital peer review statutes. In that case, Victor Sistok brought suit against the Kalispell Regional Hospital, arguing that the hospital negligently allowed a doctor with a history of alcoholism to perform surgery upon him. In connection with his lawsuit, Sistok sought to depose the former chairman of the hospital committee charged with supervision and discipline of the medical staff, and to discover records and information concerning the committee\u2019s prior actions taken against the doctor.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">\u00b611 This Court held that Sistok\u2019s deposition subpoena sought information that was clearly privileged and that the District Court had properly quashed the discovery request. In the context presented, the Court stated that \u00a7 50-16-203, MCA, \u201cunambiguously confers an absolute privilege on medical staff committees.\u201d <em>Sistok, </em>251 Mont. at 40, 823 P.2d at 253.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">\u00b612 The District Court concluded that this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Sistok </em>governs in the present case. We disagree. As counsel conceded at oral argument, the facts in <em>Sistok </em>are clearly distinguishable from those in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>the present case. The records which plaintiff Sistok sought to discover concerned prior disciplinary actions taken against his treating physician. In contrast, the records sought in the present case relate to the care and treatment of the plaintiff Estate\u2019s decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">\u00b613  This Court\u2019s role in statutory construction is to \u201cascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA. Section 50-16-205, MCA, provides that \u201cdata\u201d of medical staff committees shall be confidential and not admissible in evidence, \u2018Taut this section shall not affect the admissibility in evidence of records dealing with the patient\u2019s hospital care and treatment.\u201d The right of confidentiality created under \u00a7 50-16-205, MCA, is plainly subject to the patient\u2019s right of access to records concerning his or her own hospital care and treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">\u00b614  This is consistent with the provisions of another segment of Montana law, the Uniform Health Care Information Act (the Act), enacted in 1987. The Act enumerates patients\u2019 rights, including the right to examine or copy all or part of the patient\u2019s recorded health care information. <em>See </em>\u00a7 50-16-541, MCA. \u201cHealth care information\u201d is any information relating to the patient\u2019s health care, to which the patient\u2019s right will not be diminished no matter who else had access to the identical records. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 50-16-502(4) and -504(6), MCA. The Act further provides, at \u00a7 50-16-522, MCA, that \u201c[a] personal representative of a deceased patient may exercise all of the deceased patient\u2019s rights under this part.\u201d Therefore, under the Act, the Estate has the right to examine or copy all of Huether\u2019s recorded health care information.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">\u00b6 15 <em>Amici </em>point out that peer review committees do not themselves create evidence of what took place in the treatment of a patient. That evidence exists, instead, in the medical record of the patient and in the memories of those who provided treatment, all of which is discoverable and admissible under \u00a7 50-16-205, MCA. Such evidence is not shielded from discovery when given to a peer review committee.</p>\n<p id=\"AiL\">\u00b616 Section 50-16-203, MCA, analogizes the confidentiality of peer review committee proceedings to the confidentiality between a doctor and a patient. It is argued that we may thus assume that a patient has the option of \u201cwaiving\u201d the confidentiality of peer review records, like a patient has the option of waiving confidentiality with his or her physician. <em>See </em>\u00a7 50-16-526, MCA. However, under \u00a7 50-16-542(1)(d), MCA, a health care provider may deny a patient access to health care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>information \u201ccompiled and... used solely for litigation, quality assurance, peer review, or administrative purposes.\u201d Were we to accept the argument that a patient has a wholesale right to \u201cwaive\u201d the confidentiality of peer review, \u00a7 50-16-542(1)(d), MCA, would be rendered meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">\u00b617 We here note an inconsistency. Section 50-16-542(1)(d), MCA, while not a subject of this appeal, on its face allows a health care provider to deny a patient access to \u201chealth care information\u201d used solely for peer review, among other purposes. The statute\u2019s use of the term \u201chealth care information\u201d is troubling. The denial of access to \u201chealth care information\u201d allowed under \u00a7 50-16-542(1)(d), MCA, conflicts with the provisions of the peer review statutes as we have interpreted them above, as well as with the very purpose of the Uniform Health Care Information Act, as set forth at \u00a7 50-16-502(2), MCA (\u201cpatients need access to their own health care information as a matter of fairness, to enable them to make informed decisions about their health care and to correct inaccurate or incomplete information about themselves\u201d). We bring this conflict to the attention of the Montana legislature and invite its consideration in reconciling the conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">\u00b6 18  We conclude that the net effect of the peer review statutes is that \u201chealth care information\u201d belongs both to the patient and to the hospital, while \u201cdata\u201d is a matter of internal administrative function. Accordingly, we conclude that all \u201chealth care information\u201d either reviewed or generated by medical staff committees should be made available to the subject patient. Only the \u201cdata\u201d are protected from disclosure. Section 50-16-201, MCA, defines the \u201cdata,\u201d which \u201cshall be confidential,\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-6\"><em>written reports, notes, or records </em>of tissue committees or other medical staff committees <em>in connection with the professional training, supervision, or discipline of the medical staff of hospitals.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AD3\">(Emphasis supplied.) Thus, for example, an \u201cincident report\u201d including a retrospective report of what occurred in the course of a hospital patient\u2019s care and treatment would be discoverable by the patient. Records of the discussion and recommendations of a peer review committee as to professional training, supervision, or discipline as a result of such an incident and report would not be discoverable.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">\u00b619 Because the records sought in <em>Sistok </em>related to prior disciplinary action by the hospital against Sistok\u2019s surgeon, they clearly met the definition of \u201cdata\u201d and were not subject to discovery. However, to the extent that the records sought by the Estate in this case relate to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>Huether\u2019s hospital care and treatment, they do not fall within the definition of \u201cdata.\u201d Such records are subject to discovery by the patient or, as here, by the patient\u2019s estate. The statements in <em>Sistok </em>that \u00a7 50-16-203, MCA, \u201cunambiguously confers an absolute privilege on medical staff committees,\u201d 251 Mont. at 40, 823 P.2d at 253, and \u201cconfers an absolute privilege,\u201d 251 Mont. at 41, 823 P.2d at 253, are limited to the facts of that case and are overruled inasmuch as they may be read to apply to a hospital patient seeking disclosure of information concerning his or her care and treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-3\">\u00b620 In so ruling, we realize that we are limiting the meaning of the last sentence of \u00a7 50-16-203, MCA: \u201cAll proceedings and in-hospital records and reports of such medical staff committees shall be confidential and privileged.\u201d This is necessary to give effect to all of the statutes discussed above. As we have stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-4\">[W]e presume that the legislature enacts a law with fall knowledge of all existing law on the same subject... and does not intend to abrogate or interfere with another law on the same matter unless the repugnancy between the two is irreconcilable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-5\"><em>Blythe v. Radiometer America, Inc. </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 464, 475, 866 P.2d 218, 225. On the other hand, were we to read the statutes as the Estate asks and open all records of peer review committees, we would gut the peer review confidentiality provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">\u00b621 In <em>Sistock, </em>we further mistakenly relied in part upon a criminal procedure statute, \u00a7 46-15-332, MCA, in addressing the question of privilege. Because that criminal law statute does not apply to a civil case like <em>Sistock, </em>our reliance upon the statute was erroneous. We therefore specifically overrule the one-sentence reference to \u00a7 46-15-332, MCA, in <em>Sistock, </em>251 Mont. at 41, 823 P.2d at 253.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">\u00b622  We conclude that to the extent that documents over which the Hospital seeks protection are relevant to Huether\u2019s hospital care and treatment, they are discoverable. However, to the extent the requested documents are \u201cin connection with the professional training, supervision, or discipline of the medical staff of [the] hospital[],\u201d they are not discoverable. We recognize that this may require that the court conduct an in-camera review and redact material in the documents relating to supervisory or disciplinary matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">\u00b623 Given our decision, we conclude that we need not reach the issue of the constitutionality of the peer review statutes. We remand this case for farther proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"A9d\">JUSTICES GRAY, LEAPHART and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b244-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>JUSTICE TRIEWEILER</author>\n<p id=\"AUX\">dissenting or concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">\u00b624 I concur or dissent from the majority opinion, depending on its meaning. I am not sure from the written opinion or our conference discussion of the opinion that I fully understand the majority\u2019s intent. Therefore, I write separately to make my intent clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">\u00b625 It is my opinion that no factual information related to a patient\u2019s care, treatment, or condition while at a healthcare facility is privileged from discovery by that patient regardless of where the information is stored or the purpose for which it was gathered.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">\u00b626 A principal problem with the majority opinion is the conclusion in paragraph 20 that the Petitioner may discover records \u201crelevant to the patient\u2019s hospital care and treatment\u201d but may not discover information gathered \u201cin connection with the professional training, supervision, or discipline of the medical staff.\u201d In reality, there may be records which are both relevant to the patient\u2019s care and treatment and gathered in connection with training, supervision, or discipline. In that event, it is my opinion that the records are discoverable. To hold otherwise, would deny Petitioners the right to due process and the judicial need for fair administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">\u00b627 I acknowledge the difficulty encountered by the majority when trying to reconcile Montana\u2019s statutory potpourri of privileges from disclosure and rights to discovery of records kept by a healthcare facility. However, in reconciling the provisions of Title 50, Chapter 16, Part 2, MCA, which pertains to information gathered by hospital committees and Part 5 of that same chapter which pertains to the confidentiality and disclosure of a patient\u2019s healthcare information in general it is necessary to keep the following rules of construction in mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">\u00b628 When a statutory scheme has several provisions, a construction is to be adopted which will, if possible, give effect to all. Section 1-2-101, MCA. A statute dealing with a particular subject will control over a general statute which is inconsistent with it. Section 1-2-102, MCA. And finally, an interpretation which gives effect to a statute is preferred to one which would make it void. Section 1-3-232, MCA, and <em>Mead v. MSB, Inc. </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 465, 474, 872 P.2d 782, 788. In particular, \u201cwhenever there are differing possible interpretations of [a] statute, a constitutional interpretation is favored over one that is <em>not Department of State Lands v. Pettibone </em>(1985), 216 Mont. 361, 374, 702 P.2d 948, 956.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">\u00b629 In this case, the particular statutes which deal with information gathered by peer review or other hospital committees, protect the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>confidentiality of that information from discovery by third persons, but clearly treat it no differently than other medical records when the person seeking disclosure is the patient with whom the records are concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-3\">\u00b630 Section 50-16-202, MCA, gives hospital medical staff committees access to records regarding the condition and treatment of patients to study and evaluate care and treatment of those patients. However, to make clear that disclosure of a patient\u2019s medical records to hospital committees does not waive the right of confidentiality, the patient would otherwise enjoy with regard to his or her medical record, \u00a7 50-16-203, MCA, provides that the records gathered by a committee maintain a confidential status as if the patient became a patient of the committee. It provides for nothing more. The exact language of \u00a7 50-16-203, MCA, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-4\">All such records, data, and information shall be confidential and privileged to said committee and the members thereof, as though such hospital patients were the patients of the members of such committee. All proceedings and in-hospital records and reports and reports of such medical staff committees shall be confidential and privileged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">\u00b631 Because information about a patient gathered by a hospital committee is no more privileged than the record of that person\u2019s care prepared by his treating physician, the patient has a right to discover that information.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-7\">Since the purpose of the statutory privilege protecting confidential communications between physician and patient is the protection of the patient, it is generally held that the privilege is personal to the patient or someone standing in his stead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-8\">The physician-patient privilege cannot be asserted by the physician, even for the benefit of the patient, or by the patient\u2019s opponent in a legal proceeding, including the prosecution, where the patient is on trial for a crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">81 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Witnesses </em>\u00a7 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">\u00b632 Section 50-16-204, MCA, limits the purposes for which information gathered about patients by hospital committees can be used. However, that section is clearly for the protection of the patient\u2019s privacy. It is not a shield to protect the hospital from discovery by the patient of all relevant information pertaining to his or her care.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">\u00b633 Finally, \u00a7 50-16-205, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>All data shall be confidential and shall not be admissible in evidence in any judicial proceeding, but this section shall not affect the admissibility in evidence of records dealing with the patient\u2019s hospital care and treatment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">\u00b634 Section 50-16-205, MCA, does not mean, as suggested in the majority opinion that \u201cdata\u201d gathered by a hospital committee is confidential, while records dealing with the patient\u2019s hospital care and treatment are discoverable. In fact, \u201crecords\u201d are included within the meaning of \u201cdata\u201d found at \u00a7 50-16-201, MCA. Section 50-16-205, MCA, simply continues the different treatment given by part 2 to records and other data when sought by third parties and records of a patient\u2019s own care and treatment when sought by that patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">\u00b635 Section 50-16-541, MCA, confirms a patient\u2019s right to discover his or her own healthcare information. While \u00a7 50-16-542(1)(d), MCA, makes an exception with regard to information gathered for \u201cpeer review, or administrative purposes,\u201d that section is a general provision which must be subordinated to the more specific provisions regarding discovery of records kept by hospital committees in part 2. Otherwise, this Court could not accomplish its required role of interpreting these inconsistent provisions in a way that gives effect to all of them. Furthermore, if \u00a7 50-16-542, MCA, was construed in a fashion that denied patients access to records of their care and treatment, when the quality of that care and treatment is directly at issue as it is in this case, it would, in my opinion, be an unconstitutional denial of the plaintiff\u2019s right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">\u00b636 The closest we have come to considering the due process implications of suppressing evidence in medical malpractice claims was our decision in <em>Linder v. Smith </em>(1981), 193 Mont. 20, 629 P.2d 1187. The principal issue on appeal in that case was the constitutionality of the Medical Malpractice Panel Act. While the court held that the act was not generally offensive to any constitutional provision, the Court did invalidate that part of the act which prohibited a party to a panel proceeding from using statements made at that proceeding to impeach a witness who testifies inconsistently at a subsequent proceeding. The court held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-8\">Section 27-6-704(2), MCA, provides that: \u201c(no) statement made by any person during a hearing before the panel may be used as impeaching evidence in court.\u201d In order to uphold the constitutionality of the panel act, we determine that this section must be severed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>from the act. It is fundamental to our adversarial system that litigants retain the right to impeach the sworn testimony of a witness testifying against them. We are mindful that this provision was enacted to aid the fact-finding by the panel and to preserve the confidentiality of the proceedings. But we cannot say that a litigant will receive a full and fair hearing if he is unable to fully cross-examine in court the witnesses that testified in the prior hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-4\"><em>Linder, </em>193 Mont. at 30, 629 P.2d at 1192.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">\u00b637 Further development of the facts illustrates that effective cross-examination is also the basis for the Petitioner\u2019s discovery request in this case. The Petitioner\u2019s decedent, George Huether, Jr., had surgery for removal of a malignant tumor from his cecum at Holy Rosary Hospital in Miles City, Montana, on June 10, 1992. His records indicate that following surgery and a normal recovery he was discharged from the recovery room and transferred to the medical-surgical floor at 12:15 p.m. on that date. His attending physician directed the nursing staff to monitor his condition at 15-minute intervals. His records also indicate that his vital signs were checked at 12:30 p.m. and 1:30 p.m. when he went into respiratory arrest. However, there was nothing in his medical chart to indicate that his vital signs had been checked at 15-minute intervals.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">\u00b638 After Mr. Huether was resuscitated he had severe anoxic encephalopathy. He was taken off life support systems and died three days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">\u00b639 On July 15, 1992, Mr. Huether\u2019s treating physician wrote to the decedent\u2019s family with the following concerns about the decedent\u2019s follow-up care:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-8\">The information that you and your family provided regarding the events in the room prior to the incident indicates to me a nursing problem and, therefore, I have referred your letter to the administration of the hospital and the Department of Nursing. They will be contacting you in the near future.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">\u00b640 Based on the attending physician\u2019s letter, the family\u2019s observations while present in the decedent\u2019s room, and the decedent\u2019s medical records, the Petitioners assumed that the medical chart accurately reflected the extent to which the decedent\u2019s vital signs had been monitored following his transfer to the medical-surgery floor and that those facts would be confirmed by the hospital\u2019s investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>\u00b641 On June 19, 1998, however, members of the nursing staff responsible for the decedent\u2019s care testified that his blood pressure and heart rate had been continuously monitored by a Critikon device following his transfer to the medical-surgery floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">\u00b642 The basis of the Petitioner\u2019s claim is that George Huether\u2019s condition was inadequately monitored. The medical records reflect one course of observation. The nurses\u2019 testimony indicates another course of observation. Presumably, the investigation conducted at the treating physician\u2019s request shortly after Mr. Huether\u2019s death will provide further information critical to this issue. To deny access to that information which may be dispositive of the primary issue in this case simply because it has now been included among peer review or other committee records, would be to deny Petitioners possible information necessary to effectively cross-examine the hospital\u2019s witnesses and to prove their case.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">\u00b643 This specific issue was considered by the Supreme Court of Kansas in <em>Adams v. St. Francis Regional Medical Center </em>(Kan. 1998), 955 P.2d 1169. In that case, the plaintiffs\u2019 decedent died as a result of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy while being treated at the defendant hospital. Plaintiffs alleged that the attending nurse did not recognize the seriousness of the decedent\u2019s condition and negligently failed to alert her physician to her need for immediate attention. The issue before the Kansas court was whether the plaintiffs could discover disciplinary action forms prepared by the hospital in conjunction with peer review. Peer review information was protected by statute in Kansas as it is in Montana by \u00a7 50-16-542, MCA. The court held that in resolving the issue with which it was presented, it had to weigh the privilege granted to healthcare providers against the plaintiffs\u2019 right to due process and the judicial need for the fair administration of justice. <em>Adams, </em>955 P.2d at 1187. It resolved that issue in favor of discovery and gave the following explanation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-6\">To allow the hospital here to insulate from discovery the facts and information which go to the heart of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim would deny plaintiffs that right and, in the words of the federal court, \u201craise significant constitutional implications.\u201d 129 F.R.D. at 551. The constitutional implication was stated by this court in <em>Ernest v. Faler, </em>237 Kan. 125, 131, 697 P.2d 870 (1985):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-7\">\u201cThe right of the plaintiff involved in this case is the fundamental constitutional right to have remedy for an injury to person or property by due course of law. This right is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>recognized in the Kansas Bill of Rights \u00a7 18, which provides that all persons, for injuries suffered in person, reputation or property, shall have a remedy by due course of law, and justice administered without delay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-3\">In the present case, we conclude that although the interest in creating a statutory peer review privilege is strong, it is outweighed by the fundamental right of the plaintiffs to have access to all the relevant facts. The district court\u2019s protective order and order granting other discovery relief denied plaintiffs that access and thus violated plaintiffs\u2019 right to due process and a fair determination of their malpractice action against the defendants. The information generated by the peer review committee, detailing the committee\u2019s decision-making process, the officers\u2019 or committee\u2019s conclusions, or final decisions, is not subject to discovery by the plaintiffs. The district court has a duty to conduct an in camera inspection and craft a protective order which will permit the plaintiffs access to the relevant facts. Forms and documents containing factual accounts and witnesses\u2019 names are not protected simply because they also contained the officers\u2019 or committee\u2019s conclusions or decision-making process. The court can simply redact that which is protected and grant plaintiffs access to the portions containing the relevant facts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-4\"><em>Adams, </em>955 P.2d at 1187-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">\u00b644 The State of Montana, through the Office of the Attorney General, and the Respondent in this case, argue that <em>Adams </em>is unpersuasive because it is based upon a fundamental right found in the Kansas Constitution to full legal redress for all injuries. They argue that although Montana has a similar provision at Article II, Section 16 of the Montana Constitution, we have held that that right is not fundamental and the parameters of the right are as defined by the legislature. <em>See Meech v. Hillhaven West, Inc. </em>(1989), 238 Mont. 21, 776 P.2d 488. Assuming, without agreeing, that the State\u2019s and Respondent\u2019s position is correct, it has no relevance to the facts in this case because the legislature has not acted to deny victims of negligent medical care, recovery for their injuries. Therefore, the damages sought by the Petitioners in this case are constitutionally protected by Article II, Section 16 and the reasoning in the <em>Adams </em>decision would render the peer review statutes invalid, were they not interpreted in a way that permits discovery by the Petitioners of all facts pertaining to the dece<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>dent\u2019s care and treatment, regardless of where those facts are kept or how and why they were gathered.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">\u00b645 To the extent that the majority opinion permits discovery by the Petitioners of all facts pertaining to the decedent\u2019s care and treatment, I concur in that opinion. To the extent that discovery of those facts is limited, I dissent from the majority opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b250-5\">JUSTICE HUNT and JUSTICE NELSON, join in the foregoing concurring or dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
