We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-16\">\u00b62 The Carsons raise the following issue: Whether the District Court erred in granting partial summary judgment in favor of the Dittos?</p>\n<p id=\"b303-17\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b303-18\">\u00b63 On June 28,1991, Rosemary Sewell entered into a Contract for Sale of Cabin with Dean and Cheryl Kipp. Sewell agreed to sell and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>assign to the Kipps property described as a \u201ccabin, all structures and improvements as well as the leasehold on the property known and described as Canyon Ferry Cabin Site #92.\u201d The parties also entered into a Security Agreement with respect to both the cabin and the leasehold, and a Financing Statement was filed with the Secretary of State on July 3, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">\u00b64 On January 26, 1994, Sewell assigned her interest in the contract for sale to Gerald and Maijorie Ditto. On February 15, 1994, a Notice of Assignment of Vendor\u2019s Interest Under Contract for Sale of Cabin reflecting Sewell\u2019s assignment of her interest in the contract for sale to the Dittos was filed with the Clerk and Recorder of Lewis and Clark County. The Dittos filed a Financing Statement with the Clerk and Recorder of Lewis and Clark County on March 22, 1994. Another Financing Statement was filed with the Clerk and Recorder on July 8, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">\u00b65 Kipps defaulted on their payments on the contract for sale and failed to pay property taxes on the cabin. According to the tax deed issued on October 21,1997, Lewis and Clark County attached a property tax lien to the property because of unpaid taxes. A certificate of tax sale was issued to Lewis and Clark County. The County assigned the certificate to the Carsons who purchased the property tax lien by paying the property taxes owed and mailed notice of the pending tax deed to various interested parties, but not to the Dittos. The Carsons also published notice of the pending tax deed. On October 21, 1997, the County issued a tax deed to David and Holly Carson.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">\u00b66 On May 21, 1998, the Dittos filed a complaint in the First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Kipps had defaulted on the contract for sale and seeking to repossess the collateral, and also contending that the Carsons\u2019 notice of the issuance of a tax deed was insufficient because Dittos did not receive notice by certified mail. The Kipps failed to appear and the court issued a default judgment against them on July 13, 1998. On February 8, 1999, the Dittos filed a Motion for Summary Judgment. The parties briefed the motion and the court heard oral argument on April 14, 1999. On July 9, 1999, the District Court granted partial summary judgment in favor of the Dittos, concluding that the tax deed issued by Lewis and Clark County to the Carsons was void because the Dittos were entitled to, but did not receive, notice of the issuance of the pending tax deed pursuant to \u00a7 15-18-212(1), MCA. The Carsons appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">\u00b67 We review a district court order granting summary judgment <em>de novo </em>applying the same evaluation as the district court pursuant to Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P. <em>See Bruner v. Yellowstone County </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 261, 264, 900 P.2d 901, 903. <em>In Bruner, </em>we set forth our inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6k\">The movant must demonstrate that no genuine issues of material fact exist. Once this has been accomplished, the burden then shifts to the non-moving party to prove, by more than mere denial and speculation, that a genuine issue does exist. Having determined that genuine issues of fact do not exist, the court must then determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We review the legal determinations made by a district court as to whether the court erred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-5\"><em>Bruner, </em>272 Mont. at 264-65, 900 P.2d at 903 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">\u00b68 Whether the District Court erred in granting partial summary judgment in favor of the Dittos?</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">\u00b69 The District Court concluded that the Dittos\u2019 interest in the cabin and leasehold were properly recorded and, as a result, they were entitled as \u201cinterested parties\u201d to notice of the pending issuance of the tax deed pursuant to \u00a7 15-18-212(1), MCA. The court held that the tax deed issued by Lewis and Clark County to the Carsons was void because the Dittos did not receive notice of its issuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">\u00b610 On appeal, the Carsons contend that the Dittos were not entitled to notice of the tax deed by certified mail as required under \u00a7 15-18-212, MCA, because they failed to file their claimed secured interest in the cabin with the proper filing authority to secure their interest under the Uniform Commercial Code. The Carsons\u2019 argument is as follows. The original seller, Sewell, filed a UCC financing statement with the Secretary of State with an expiration date of July 3, 1996. Sewell assigned this security interest to the Dittos, but the Dittos never renewed the financing statement. Instead, the Dittos erroneously filed UCC financing statements with the Clerk and Recorder of Lewis and Clark County. Accordingly, Sewell\u2019s filing, and thus the Dittos\u2019 security interest, lapsed. As a result, the Dittos were not interested parties entitled to notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">\u00b611 We have previously held that an interested party\u2019s right of redemption continues until such time as proper notice is given and that failure to provide proper notice renders a tax deed void. <em>See Kneedler </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number><em>v. League Wide, </em>Inc., 1999 MT 80, \u00b6 16,294 Mont. 101, \u00b6 16, 979 P.2d 163, \u00b6 16. Section 15-18-212, MCA, requires that the purchaser or as-signee of a tax sale certificate notify \u201call persons considered <em>interested parties </em>in the property, if any, that a tax deed will be issued to the purchaser or assignee unless the property tax lien is redeemed prior to the expiration date of the redemption period.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In order to comply with this requirement, the purchaser must notify interested parties by certified mail, return receipt requested. Section 15-18-212(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">\u00b612 Whether the Dittos were entitled to notice by certified mail depends on whether they were \u201cinterested parties.\u201d An interested party for purposes of the tax lien redemption provisions includes a \u201cvendor of a contract for deed or the vendor\u2019s successor in interest... or other person who has a properly recorded interest in the property\u201d but does not include \u201c[a] person who has an interest in property on which there is a, property tax hen but which interest is not properly recorded.\u201d Section 15-18-111, MCA. Consequently, the Dittos were entitled to notice if their interest in the cabin and leasehold was \u201cproperly recorded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">\u00b613 The statutory provisions governing the recording of interests in real property are contained in Title 70, Chapter 21 of the Montana Code. Section 70-21-201(1), MCA, provides that \u201c[a]ny instrument or judgment affecting the title to or possession of real property may be recorded under this part.\u201d The contract for sale between Sewell and the Kipps, as well as Sewell\u2019s assignment of her interest to the Dittos, affected title to or possession of the cabin and leasehold at issue. For instance, the provisions of the contract for sale include a transfer of possession and a right to repossess on default.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">\u00b614  The issue then becomes whether the cabin and leasehold are \u201creal property.\u201d Real property, as defined under Title 70, includes land, that which is \u201caffixed to land,\u201d and that which is \u201cincidental or appurtenant to land.\u201d Section 70-1-106, MCA. A leasehold interest in land is an estate for years which is classified as an interest in real property. <em>See </em>\u00a7 70-15-202(3), MCA. The cabin is real property if it is affixed, incidental, or appurtenant to land. \u201cAffixed to land\u201d has been defined as things which are \u201cpermanently resting upon [land], as in the case of buildings.\u201d Section 70-15-103(3), MCA. Accordingly, an instrument affecting title to or possession of the cabin and leasehold is an interest in real property which may be recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">\u00b615 The remaining issue is whether that interest was <em>properly </em>recorded. \u201cInstruments entitled to be recorded must be recorded by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>county clerk of the county in which the real property affected thereby is situated.\u201d Section 70-21-208, MCA. An instrument is deemed recorded when \u201cbeing duly acknowledged or proved and certified, it is deposited in the county clerk\u2019s office with the proper officer of record.\u201d Section 70-21-209, MCA. In order for the Dittos to be \u201cinterested parties\u201d who are entitled to notice by certified mail of the issuance of a tax deed, an instrument describing their interest in the cabin and leasehold must have been deposited in the Clerk and Recorder\u2019s office of Lewis and Clark County. In this regard, the Dittos refer us to the Notice of Assignment of Vendor\u2019s Interest under Contract for Sale of Cabin recorded by the Clerk and Recorder of Lewis and Clark County on February 15,1994. This instrument reflects the Dittos\u2019 interest as assignees of the vendor\u2019s interest in the contract for sale of the cabin and leasehold.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">\u00b616  We conclude that the Dittos\u2019 interest in the cabin and leasehold as reflected in the Notice of Assignment of Vendor\u2019s Interest under Contract for Sale of Cabin is an interest in real property which was properly deposited in the appropriate county clerk\u2019s office pursuant to \u00a7 70-21-208 and -209, MCA. Accordingly, the Dittos were interested parties entitled to notice by certified mail pursuant to \u00a7 15-18-212, MCA. The Carsons did not notify the Dittos by certified mail of the pending issuance of the tax deed. As an interested party entitled to notice, the Dittos\u2019 right to redeem the property tax lien on the cabin and leasehold continues indefinitely until such notice is given. <em>See Kneedler, </em>\u00b6 16. Furthermore, the tax deed issued by Lewis and Clark County is void for failure to comply with the notice provisions of \u00a7 15-18-212, MCA. <em>See Kneedler, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">\u00b617 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b307-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES HUNT, GRAY and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
