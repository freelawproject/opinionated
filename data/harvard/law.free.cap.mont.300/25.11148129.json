The court denied Pyatt\u2019s motion for a new trial. Pyatt contends that the court erred in not directing the jury to further deliberate or declaring a mistrial in response to the juror\u2019s statement and further erred in not granting Pyatt\u2019s motion for a new trial. We reverse and remand for retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-12\">Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b50-13\">\u00b62 The dispositive issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in determining that the jury verdict was unanimous.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-14\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b50-15\">\u00b63 Whether the jury verdict was unanimous constitutes a question of constitutional law. Our review of questions of constitutional law is plenary. <em>See, e.g., State v. Anderson, </em>1998 MT 258, \u00b6 6, 291 Mont. 242, \u00b6 6, 967 P.2d 413, \u00b6 6 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-16\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b50-17\">\u00b64 Pyatt was charged by Information with felony stalking. Following a trial and deliberation, the jury indicated to the bailiff that a verdict had been reached. At Pyatt\u2019s request, the jury was polled in open <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>court. The judge asked each juror whether he or she agreed with the verdict. Specifically, the judge told the jurors, \u201cWhen your name is read, if you agree with the verdict, answer yes. If you don\u2019t agree with the verdict, answer no.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">\u00b65 One of the jurors, Duane Jerome (Jerome), answered \u201cNo\u201d when his name was called. The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-5\">The Court: Wait a minute. You\u2019re saying that you do not agree with the verdict?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-6\">Jerome: No. I was a hold out. I didn\u2019t agree with it, but I went along with it because everybody else did. I was outnumbered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-7\">The Court: Well, a unanimous verdict is required for either finding of guilt or finding of not guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-8\">Foreman: No one was coerced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-9\">The Court: I don\u2019t want to get into any discussion about it. What we have to know at this point we are polling the jury and each juror has to answer yes, do they agree with the verdict, or no, do they not agree with the verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-10\">Just the same as you did, supposedly did, in the jury room in indicating that you had a verdict. So Mr. Jerome, I\u2019m going to ask you again. Do you vote in favor of the verdict or do you vote against? Jerome: I did vote in favor of the majority in the end. So I give him the yes vote.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-11\">The Court: Your answer is yes. All right. The clerk will go forward and call the other names.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-12\">\u00b66 The other jurors responded \u201cyes\u201d to the court\u2019s inquiry, and the court announced that the verdict was unanimous. Pyatt\u2019s counsel suggested to the court outside the presence of the jury that the jury had not reached \u201ca conscientious determination of guilt on the facts.\u201d He requested that the jury be repolled or that the matter be resubmitted for further deliberation. The court found that the verdict was unanimous and that the jury should be discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-13\">\u00b67 Pyatt moved the District Court for a new trial, arguing that Jerome had not expressed \u201cadequate concurrence with the verdict,\u201d because he had indicated voting guilty to go along with the majority. The State responded that Pyatt was improperly attempting to impeach the verdict based on Jerome\u2019s statement that he voted guilty to go along with the majority and that such impeachment was prohibited by Rule 606(b), M.R.Evid. The court denied Pyatt\u2019s motion for a new trial. Pyatt was sentenced to the Montana Department of Corrections for five years, with credit for time served.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">\u00b68 Did the District Court err in determining that the jury verdict was unanimous?</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">\u00b69  Article II, Section 26 of the Montana Constitution and \u00a7 46-16-603(1), MCA, require that jury verdicts in criminal actions be unanimous. The jury here was instructed in accordance with Montana law that \u201c \u2018no juror should surrender his or her honest opinion as to the weight or effect of evidence or as to the innocence or guilt of the defendant because the majority of the jury feels otherwise, or for the purpose of returning an unanimous verdict or to prevent a mistrial.\u2019 \u201d <em>See State v. George </em>(1986), 219 Mont. 377, 382, 711 P.2d 1379, 1382.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">\u00b610  To ascertain unanimity, a defendant has the right to have the jury polled following return of the verdict. Section 46-16-604, MCA. \u201cIf upon the poll there is not the required concurrence, the jury may be directed to retire for further deliberations or may be discharged.\u201d Section 46-16-604, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">\u00b611 Pyatt contends that Jerome\u2019s statements during the jury poll revealed that he did not unequivocally consent to a guilty verdict and that he had voted guilty during the jury deliberations for the impermissible reason of returning a unanimous verdict. Pyatt contends that the court should have directed the jury to further deliberate or should have discharged the jury once Jerome indicated that he had only voted in favor of the guilty verdict for the sake of unanimity.</p>\n<p id=\"AD\">\u00b612 Pyatt further contends that the court\u2019s subsequent directive to Jerome to vote as he had in the jury room was improper and that the court should have instead focused its inquiry on whether Jerome presently assented to the verdict. Pyatt contends that the court sought to rehabilitate the verdict rather than allow Jerome to fully express his dissent or direct the jury to further deliberate.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">\u00b613 The State contends that the record reflects that Jerome assented to the verdict by telling the court, \u201cSo I give him the yes vote.\u201d The State argues that Pyatt misread the transcript as Jerome stating \u201cI gave him the yes vote,\u201d and that a correct recitation of Jerome\u2019s statement indicates that Jerome unequivocally consented to the guilty verdict at the time of the jury poll.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-11\">\u00b614 The State cites <em>State v. Asher </em>(1922), 63 Mont. 302, 307, 206 P. 1091, 1092 (citation omitted), for the proposition that \u201c \u2018[t]he law does not inquire as to the degree of reluctance or willingness with which a juror\u2019s mind assents to the verdict. Its only inquiry is: Does he agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>with it? If he does, that is sufficient.\u2019 \u201d However, there, the juror said he agreed with the verdict provided that the sentence would be suspended. He did not equivocate on the question of guilt. <em>See Asher, </em>63 Mont. at 304-05, 206 P. at 1091.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">\u00b615 We agree with Pyatt that the New Mexico Court of Appeals decision, <em>State v. Holloway </em>(N.M.App. 1987), 740 P.2d 711, is persuasive authority in this case. There, one of the jurors responded to the court\u2019s polling question, \u201cIs this your verdict?\u201d with \u2018Yes, can I qualify it? Can I just say...?\u201d The court cut the juror off and asked again, \u201cIs this your verdict?\u201d The juror then responded \u2018Yes.\u201d The court thereupon accepted the guilty verdicts. <em>Holloway, </em>740 P.2d at 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">\u00b616 The <em>Holloway </em>court held that when a juror\u2019s response indicates uncertainty about unanimity, the court must further inquire to ascertain whether the juror in fact assents or dissents to the announced verdict. The court noted that the polling judge should question the juror about his or her present state of mind regarding the verdict, being cautious to avoid influencing or coercing the juror\u2019s verdict. <em>Holloway, </em>740 P.2d at 716. The court there remanded for a new trial, concluding that the polling revealed uncertainty about unanimity, which called for further inquiry or other remedial action. <em>Holloway, </em>740 P.2d at 716.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">\u00b617  Section 46-16-604, MCA, requires that the District Court determine, \u201cupon the poll,\u201d whether there is the required concurrence with the verdict. We interpret this to mean that in polling the jury, the District Court is to inquire into the jurors\u2019 present states of mind, as of the time of the poll. To fulfill the jury poll\u2019s purpose of safeguarding the defendant\u2019s right to a unanimous verdict, the jury poll must \u201c\u2019[afford] the juror the opportunity to make an unambiguous reply as to his present state of mind.\u2019\u201d <em>Holloway, </em>740 P.2d at 715 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">\u00b618 Here, unanimity was not merely uncertain; Jerome\u2019s reply to the court\u2019s polling question regarding his present state of mind was unambiguous. Jerome responded \u201cNo\u201d when his name was called after the jurors had been instructed, \u201cIf you don\u2019t agree with the verdict answer no.\u201d Jerome further stated that \u201cI didn\u2019t agree with [the verdict], but I went along with it because everybody else did. I was outnumbered.\u201d Jerome\u2019s statements indicated that he did not agree with the guilty verdict at the time of the polling and that he had voted guilty during the jury deliberations in violation of the jury instruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>that stated a juror should not vote for the sake of reaching a unanimous verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">\u00b619  The court did not need to question Jerome further whether he assented to the announced verdict of guilty; Jerome\u2019s response clearly indicated that he did not. The court\u2019s continued conversation with Jerome thereafter was inappropriate under these circumstances. Once Jerome indicated that he did not agree with the verdict, the court should have either directed the jury to further deliberate or discharged the jury pursuant to \u00a7 46-16-604, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">\u00b620 Because we hold that the verdict was not unanimous, we do not address the issue of whether the District Court abused its discretion in denying Pyatt\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">\u00b621 The judgment of the District Court is reversed and this case is remanded for retrial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b54-8\">JUSTICES GRAY, NELSON, HUNT and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
