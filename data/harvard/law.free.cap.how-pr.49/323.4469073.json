Boach, simultaneously therewith, gave back two notes, dated May 11, 1868, for $1,000 each, payable one at six months and one at twelve months after date (for part of the purchase-money), and, to secure said notes, executed a chattel mortgage on the said barge, recorded in the New York custom-house on May 12, 1868.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-9\">This mortgage contained a provision that, \u201cIn - case of default in payment, it should be lawful for the mortgagees to enter into, and upon the said vessel, in any dock or waters-she might be, and to take and carry her away, and to sell and dispose of her at public or private sale, for the best price they might obtain.

The bill of sale by Spaulding, the collector, to Tracy, recited that on June 2d, 1868, he caused the barge Franklin (of 160 tons burden) to be seized opposite Weehawken, in the \u00a1North river, she being at that time fitted up for, and actually engaged in, the business of illicitly manufacturing spirits, in violation of internal revenue laws. That the said barge was, by order of said collector, moored to the dock, foot of Thirty-first street, city of New York, and placed in charge of a keeper, and that the expense of keeping her was very great; .and in consideration thereof, the said collector applied to Anthony J. Bleecker, assessor, on June 22d, 1868, to have said barge appraised. That on June 26th, 1868, said Bleecker appraised said barge. That on June 27th, the collector notified the owner or owners of said barge to execute a bond equal to assessed value, on or before July 1st, 1868, which they neglected and refused to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>do. On July 9th, 1868, said collector applied by letter to Thomas B. Asten, successor in office to Anthony J. Bleecker, for an o^der to sell said barge on the 10th July, 1868, Asten, assessor of said district, issued an order authorizing collector Spaulding to' sell the barge and he, the collector, duly advertised her at public auction, and on 3d of August, 1868, to which day the sale was adjourned, it was sold to John Tracy, Jr., for $1,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b332-5\">Eo proof was introduced on the trial below of the facts stated in such recital, other than the correspondence between the collector and the assessor, and an information filed in the United States district court, at the suit of the United States, by the United States district attorney, against $618.20, the proceeds of a .quantity of distilled spirits, of one still and other distilling apparatus, of certain articles of raw materials, and certain tools, vessels, utensils, implements, instruments, &amp;c., and of the barge Franklin.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b332-6\">This information was filed on the 22d day of December, 1868, and process issued thereon against that money, returnable January 12th, 1869. Under that process the marshal impounded the said $618.30, and made return on January 29th, 1869, which was some time after the respondent acquired his title. A final decree was entered on that information, adjudicating on and forfeiting the $618.30, and confirming said sale. But the respondent was no party to said suit, nor did the United States authorities, on that information, seize or hold in possession the <em>\u201c rem\u201d </em>viz., the barge Franklin, which was in dispute, and all of said proceedings were unknown to the respondent.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b332-9\"><em>A.

The proceedings by the collector against the vessel and the decree of the district court United States of forfeiture, are conclusive, and cannot be questioned in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b332-11\">1. The seizure by the collector was based upon revenue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>laws of United. States, as follows: Law of 1864, section 48 (2 <em>Brightly\u2019s Big., </em>307) : All goods and articles or objects subject to taxes which are being sold or removed in fraud of revenue laws, or with design to avoid payment of taxes, may be seized by the collector of the district, and shall be forfeited to the United States; so also all raw materials to be manufactured and sold with design to evade the payment of such taxes, and all personal property within the yard or inclosure where such materials shall be found. Such forfeiture to be enforced by a proceeding <em>in rem, </em>in .the circuit or district court United States. If the property is perishable it shall be appraised by the assessor, and, if a bond be not given by the owner, may be ordered by the assessor to be sold. Law of 1866, section 14 (2 <em>Brightly, </em>310): \u2022 Any goods, &amp;c., upon which a tax is imposed, or any materials, utensils, or vessels to be used in the making of such goods, &amp;c., that shall be removed or concealed with intent to avoid the tax, and any vessel, boat, carriage, horses, &lt;fcc., used for such removal or concealment, to be -forfeited <em>(See, also, Law of </em>1868, <em>see. </em>5 [2 <em>Brightly, </em>326] ; <em>Law of </em>1864, <em>sec. </em>179 [2 <em>Brightly, </em>306]).

The vessel was connected with and formed a part of the distillery. It was in fact the outer structure, or frame and environment, of the apparatus. It is embraced within the terms \u201cpersonal property within the inclosure,\u201d as used in the same section of the statute of 1864.

When forfeiture is declared by statute of United States for an offense, it attaches <em>in rem </em>from the time the offense is committed, and the right of property is immediately divested. The final decree relates back to the original offense, and is conclusive of the whole subject, and paramount to any adju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>dication of a state court <em>(Slocum </em>agt. <em>Mayberry, </em>2 <em>Wheat., </em>1; <em>Gelston </em>agt. <em>Hoyt, 3 Wheat., </em>246).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-5\">3. Ho change, therefore, in the rights or interests of parties subsequent to the seizure, can have any effect as against the government.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-6\">So, also, it is held that all interests existing at the time of such seizure, are subject to the forfeiture that may be finally decreed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-7\">The light of the government is superior to that of a prior mortgagee out of possession (U. <em>S. </em>agt. <em>Distilled Spirits, </em>8 <em>Internal Revenue Rep., </em>81; <em>U.

After the seizure, the possession of the government cannot be interfered with by any claimant, and if a sale shall be ordered under the provisions of the law before referred to, the purchaser takes the title divested of the claims of all parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-10\">5. The regularity of the seizure or proceedings thereupon, until final decree, cannot be questioned in any other court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-11\">When jurisdiction has once attached, the decision of every question in the case, whether correct or incorrect, is binding upon every other court until reversed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-12\">Errors or irregularities in such cases can be corrected only by some direct proceeding before the same court to set them aside, or by appeal to a superior court <em>(Elliott </em>agt. <em>Piersol, </em>1 <em>Peters, </em>328; <em>Thompson </em>agt. <em>Tolme, </em>2 <em>id., </em>157; <em>Tolme </em>agt. <em>Thompson, 3 Cranch, Cir.

S., </em>16 <em>Pet., </em>342, <em>supra</em>; <em>Taylor </em>agt. <em>U.

S., the decree relates back to the original seizure and overreaches all irregularities if there had been any, including any informality in the sale of the vessel. But no such formality is to be presumed. It should have been proved by the claimant. Again, the decree is effectual as against the vessel itself, and all interests attaching thereto. The loss of possession after seizure does not divest jurisdiction <em>(U. S. </em>agt. <em>Little Charles, </em>1 <em>Brock., Marsh, </em>347)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-7\">To the same effect are the decisions of our state courts <em>(D\u2019Ivernois </em>agt. <em>Leavitt, </em>8 <em>Abb., </em>59; <em>Chemung Canal Bank </em>agt. <em>Judson, </em>8 <em>N.

Applying to the case before the court, the following propositions are sustainable:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-12\">1. The seizure on the 2d of June, 1868, divested all legal right, of all parties, subject only to the final decree to be made in respect thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-13\">2. The act of the collector was the inception of the proceeding <em>in rerre </em>for the enforcing\" of the forfeiture. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>validity and effect of this act are exclusively determinable by the courts of the United States.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b336-5\">3.

Neither is it admissible to question that the parties interested in the vessel, which was sold, were sufficiently before the court. The proceeding being' <em>in rem, </em>personal service of process is not, <em>yper se, </em>necessary unless prescribed by statute. The seizure and possession thereafter constituted a visible notice to all who were previously in possession. According to the return of the marshal, due notice was given to all persons claiming the proceeds of the vessel. If this was a false return, any party damnified thereby could have had relief on application to the court at any time thereafter when the act complained of was discovered. And so also in respect to the omission of any notice supposed to be required by statute for the purpose of sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-10\">6. But relief could be had only in that court, not in another, leaving this proceeding and the decision thereon unrevoked.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-11\">But the parties claiming the vessel chose to repudiate wholly all regard to the proceedings by the collector and United States court, retook possession of the vessel after sale by the collector, and attempted a removal of it out of the jurisdiction of that court, and now, when possession is reclaimed by the purchaser at the collector\u2019s sale, it is set up in answer that the whole proceeding, seizure, sale and adjudication of the United States court are a nullity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number><em>1. </em>The sale of the vessel on the 3d of August, 1869, vested an absolute title in the purchaser upon the affirmance thereof by the decree, and in the mean time the purchaser had the right of possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-5\">8. Again, if any question could be made as to the sale, the possession of the vessel would have rightfully remained with the collector, and he could have replevied it, if taken at any time before the decree; then on affirmance of the seizure all title of the claimants would have been extinguished, could defendant against such a decree have maintained any right of possession ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-6\">9. The retaking possession by Cunningham <em>&amp; </em>Tompkins from plaintiff was wrongful, and plaintiff had a right of action without waiting for the decree.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-7\">10. The purchaser at the pretended sale under the mortgage of Cunningham <em>&amp; </em>Tompkins, acquired no right even if it should be conceded that the mortgage was <em>bona fide.* </em>The final decree, establishing the validity of the seizure and sale, is conclusive against Cunningham &amp; Tompkins as mortgagees, and defendant as purchaser at the mortgage sale.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b337-8\"><em>D. </em>McMahon, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b337-9\">I.

The ninth section of the act of Congress, July 13, 1866 (14 <em>Stat, at Large, p. </em>112), amending what was originally section 48 of the act of June 30, 1864 (13 <em>Stat. at Large, p. </em>238), under which it can only be claimed to have been made, and under which it was avowedly made, contains this . proviso, namely:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b337-11\">\u201c Provided, that when the property so seized may be liable to perish, or become .greatly reduced in price or value by keeping, or when it cannot be kept without great expense, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>the owner thereof, the collector, or the marshal of the district, may apply to the assessor of the district to examine said property, and if, in the opinion of said assessor, it shall be necessary that the said property shall be sold to prevent such waste or expense, he shall appraise the same, and the owner thereupon shall have said property returned to him upon giving bond in such form as,may be prescribed by the commissioner of internal revenue, and in an amount equal to the appraised value, with such sureties as the said assessor shall deem good and sufficient, to abide the final order, decree, or judgment of the court having, cognizance of the case, and to pay the amount of said appraised value to the collector, marshal, or otherwise,' as he may be ordered and directed by the court,\u201d which bond shall be filed by said assessor with the United States district attorney for the district in which said proceedings <em>in rem </em>may be commenced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b338-5\">\u201c Provided, further,\u201d etc., etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b338-6\">\u201c But if said owner shall neglect or refuse to give said bond, the assessor shall issue to the collector or marshal aforesaid an order to sell the same, and the said collector or marshal shall thereupon advertise and sell the said property at public auction, in the same manner as goods may be sold on final execution, in said district, and the proceeds of the sale, after deducting the reasonable costs of the seizure and sale, shall be paid to the court aforesaid, to abide its final order, decree or judgment.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b338-7\">On looking at the first'part of that section, the amendment of section 48, contained in it, it will be found that the property therein referred to are \u201cgoods, wares, merchandise, articles or objects on which taxes are imposed by the provisions of law, which are found in the possession of, or within the control of, any person for the purpose of being sold or removed by such persons in fraud of the internal revenue laws, or with design to avoid payment of such taxes\u201d <em>{By the aot of July, </em>13, 1866, \u00a7 <em>10,14th Stat. at Large, </em>148, <em>hulls of ships and other vessels arre'exempted from, taxation).</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number><em>\u201c </em>Also, all raw materials \u201d (this does not include the barge in question); also, all tools, implements, instruments and personal property whatsoever, in the place, or building, or within any yard, or inclosure where such articles, or such raw material shall be found\u201d (P.

The appellant below introduced no proof of any of the proceedings under which Tracy claimed title. He relied on the papers on file, which were put on the file <em>ex parte, </em>after the seizure and sale on the purchase-money mortgage, under which the respondent drew title; the dates of Spaulding\u2019s affidavit, and the filing of the order of sale, and of the decree itself, are about the 29th of January, 1869, long after the seizure and sale by the purchase-money, mortgagee, and of the decree, shows that the same was made, not on legal evidence, but on the <em>ex parte </em>report of the collector and the affidavits and papers filed therewith, and these reports and papers were not a compliance with the law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-7\">II.

It had been rendered after the seizure of and sale by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>mortgagee, and the respondent\u2019s (a <em>tona fide </em>purchaser\u2019s) right had intervened, and no notice given to such <em>tona fide </em>purchaser of any of the proceedings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b340-5\">The <em>rem, (i. e., </em>the barge) was not in the custody of the United States court or its marshal, and never had been. The only proceeding in court'of a judicial character was an information filed on the 22d day of December, 1868, by the United States district attorney, over five months after the sale, seeking to confiscate \u201c $618.30, proceeds of a quantity of distilled spirits, one still and other distilling apparatus, certain articles of raw material, and certain tools, vessels, utensils, implements, &amp;c., &amp;c., and the barge Franklin.\u201d Upon that information, a monition had been issued on 22d December, 1868, to the marshal of Uew York, to seize said $618.30 on 12th January, 1869, which was after the purchase by the respondent. The marshal made return of seizure of the $618.30, and upon that return, without any seizure or actual custody of the barge, the court proceed and make the condemnation of the $618.30.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b340-6\">2. A condemnation of a <em>rem </em>by a court of exclusive jurisdiction, to be binding on all the world, must be upon actual custody of the \u201c <em>o'emfi </em>or upon personal service of the owner <em>(The </em>Mary, 9 Cranch, 126, 144).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b340-7\">3. A distinction must be made between the effect of the condemnation, so far as regards the $618.30, the proceeds of sale, which were .before the court, and the barge itself, which was not in custody.

The sale herein sought to be made effective was not a sale made under the order of a court of exclusive jurisdiction, but only of certain officials, armed with a limited and temporary authority, and no court of competent jurisdiction could confirm or make valid that sale, so as to affect the rights of <em>tona fide </em>purchasers, without notice to, or appearance by, the party whose rights were affected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b341-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>The objections taken to the introduction of that record and to its effect, by the respondent\u2019s counsel, were valid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b341-5\">1.

The intent of the revenue acts was to condemn the goods liable to taxation, and the distilling apparatus which made them. .Never to condemn and forfeit the right of property of third parties in a house, a lot of ground or a vessel, in which the work was done.

That section declares that the collector or deputy collector of internal revenue may seize any goods, articles or objects on which taxes are imposed by law, found in the possession or within the control of any person in fraud of the internal revenue laws, or with design to avoid the payment of taxes, and that the-same shall be forfeited to the United States, and also all raw materials found in the. possession of any person under the circumstances specified in the statute, \u201c and all fools, implements, instruments of personal property whatsoever in the place or building, or within any yard or inclosure, where such articles or such raw materials shall be found.\u201d The section also provides that proceedings io <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>enforce the forfeiture shall be in the nature of a proceeding <em>i/n rem </em>in the circuit or district court of the United States where the seizure is made, or in any other court of competent jurisdiction. The articles seized, the section declares, may at the option of the collector be delivered to the marshal of the district, and shall remain in his care and custody until he shall obtain possession by process of law ; but a proviso is made, that when the property so seized may be liable to perish, or become greatly reduced in value by keeping, or when it cannot be kept without great expense, a sale may be had on the application of the collector to the assessors and upon the proceedings being taken as provided in the section ; and the proceeds of the sale, after deducting costs of the seizure and the sale, are to be paid into court to abide its final order, decree or judgment. It is quite obvious, I think, that the sale of the barge was not authorized by the section of the statute. It was not liable to seizure under it. It was not an object or thing' upon which a tax was imposed, nor was it a tool, implement or instrument within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">The sale provided for in the forty-eighth section is a sale of property liable to seizure under that section. The barge, perhaps, was liable to seizure under the fourteenth section of. the act of 1866, as a vessel used for the deposit or concealment of taxable articles in fraud of the statute, but this does not appear to have been the ground of seizure, and if it had been the collector is, only authorized to make, a summary sale of property seized in the cases mentioned in the forty-eighth section. The sale was therefore void. The power of sale conferred upon a collector is ministerial and not judicial, and a sale made by a collector in a case not within the statute neither divests nor confers any title. It is to be assumed, in view of the proof offered on the trial and rejected, that the barge was liable to forfeiture when the seizure was made, and that the seizure was lawful. But the title of the owner of property to which an act of forfeiture has been committed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>under the internal revenue laws is not divested <em>eo mstcmti </em>upon the commission of the offense, or by the seizure, but by the judgment or decree of a court, having jurisdiction in the premises, ascertaining and declaring the forfeiture. It is true that the statute declares that property under certain circumstances shall be forfeited, but it also provides that proceedings to enforce the forfeiture shall be taken in the courts of the United States. Whatever may be the true view as to the time when the forfeiture takes place, it is by the judgment alone that it can be ascertained and determined. If the \u2022 o government may be deemed to have an inchoate title from the time the offense is committed, it is not consummated until after a judicial condemnation ; and if a\u00f1era seizure the possession is abandoned by the government, and a decree of forfeiture is not obtained, the title and the right of possession is in the original owner. This is, I think, a fair deduction from the authorities <em>(Slocum </em>agt. Maybery, 2 <em>Wheat., </em>1; <em>Gilston </em>agt. <em>Hoyt, </em>4 <em>id., </em>246; U. <em>S. </em>agt. <em>Grundy, </em>3 <em>Cr., </em>350; <em>Same </em>agt. 1,960 <em>bags of coffee, </em>8 <em>id., </em>398; <em>Caldwell </em>agt. <em>U. S., </em>8 <em>How., </em>366, 381).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">The defendant derives title from the person who owned the barge when the seizure was made. The plaintiff, as has been shown, acquired no title under the collector\u2019s sale. He cannot therefore recover possession of the barge <em>from </em>the defendant, unless he can show that that title has in some way been confirmed, and made conclusive upon the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">The plaintiff, to establish this, produces ip evidence the record of a decree of the district court of the United States for the southern district of Hew York, made January 29, 1869, in proceedings by information commenced in that court December 22d, 1868, \u00bfgainst $618, alleged to be the proceeds of the barge \u201cFranklin,\u201d &amp;c. The information recited the seizure by the collector of the barge and also of a quantity of distilled spirits, as forfeited to the United States, and the special grounds upon which it was made, and it also alleged that the proceeds were in the custody of the collector and prayed pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>cess of attachment to bring the property within the custody of the court and of monition to the parties interested, that due proceedings being had the barge and property might be condemned by decree of forfeiture and the proceeds distributed, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The marshal, in his return of the monition, January 12, 1869,- certifies that he had attached the proceeds therein described and had given due notice to all persons claiming the same, that the court on a day named would proceed to the trial and condemnation thereof, should no claim be interposed to the same. The decree recites the return of the monition, and that the default of all persons had been entered, and adjudges that the \u201c $618, proceeds of the barge Franklin,\u201d &amp;c., be condemned as forfeited. The decree then recites the seizure by the collector, and the sale to the plaintiff, and concludes by declaring and adjudging that the seizure and the sale and all proceedings therein be in all things confirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">This decree, it is insisted, conclusively establishes, against all the world, the forfeiture of the \u201cFranklin\u201d and the validity of the collector\u2019s sale. Without entering, to any considerable extent, into the difficult and perplexing bearing upon the subject of the estoppel of judgments, and the distinction between those <em>in rem </em>and <em>in </em>personam, there are, I think, two reasons against giving to this decree the effect claimed for it against the defendant:</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">First, the court pronouncing it did not have the custody of the barge, nor was it subject to its process and the decree does not adjudicate directly that it was forfeited; and, second, the only persons summoned or notified by the marshal to appear were those claiming an interest in the proceeds of the collector\u2019s sale. The collector on the sale delivered the barge to the plaintiff, and it was never afterward in the possession of the government, nor was it any time within the custody of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">The general principle is well established, that a court, proceeding <em>in </em>rem, must have the custody of the res, in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>pronounce a valid judgment. The purpose of a proceeding <em>in rem </em>is to fix the <em>status </em>of the property or thing, which is the subject of the inquiry, irrevocably as to all the world, and to ascertain the right of all possible claimants, and possession of the thing by the court which pronounces upon it is in general indispensable <em>(The Josefa Segunda, </em>10 <em>Wheat., </em>312; <em>Taylor </em>agt. <em>Carryl, </em>20 <em>How., </em>599; <em>Jennings </em>agt. <em>Carson, </em>4 <em>Cr., </em>2; <em>The Mary, </em>9 <em>id., </em>144).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">The defendant did not claim the proceeds of the sale of the barge. Such a claim was adverse to the title which he asserted. He had neither actual or constructive notice that the court claimed any jurisdiction, or would proceed to pronounce the forfeiture of the vessel, and indeed it did not do so. The judgment of the district court was conclusive on the question before it, viz., the ownership of the proceeds, and however essential it may have been in the determination of that question to pass upon the <em>status </em>of the barge, and its liability to forfeiture, the barge itself was not the <em>res, </em>and the title to it was not affected by the decree. That the proceeding is not <em>in rem </em>does not dispense with the rule of universal justice, that a party shall not be condemned without, an opportunity to be heard! It is true that he is not entitled to personal notice before a court can adjudge the forfeiture of his property, but he must have notice, either actual or constructive, of the proceeding or it will be void. The custody of the <em>res </em>may be constructive notice that the court having possession will proceed to adjudicate upon it, and notice may be given in this way or by publication, according to the usual practice of the court, and then he is bound to defend or assert his rights, if he has any. Ho tice in this way may never in fact reach him. In many cases the giving of personal notice is impracticable, nor is it required, but the rule requiripg notice either actual or constructive is fundamental and ought never to be departed from. The question as to who was entitled to the proceeds of the barge was one with which the defendant had no concern, if in fact, as he claimed, the sale from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>which the proceeds came was void. He was not called upon to defend his title to the barge, under a proceeding to determine the right to the proceeds <em>(Bradstreet </em>agt. <em>Neptune Ins. </em>Co., 3 <em>Sum., </em>607; <em>Lessee of Boswell </em>agt. <em>Dickerson, </em>4 <em>McLean, </em>267; <em>Woodruff </em>agt.
