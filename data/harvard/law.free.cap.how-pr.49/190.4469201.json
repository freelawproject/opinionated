The facts are contained in a stipulation and may be briefly stated as follows: The defendant is a corporation founded January 10, 1860, under which the subscribers associated themselves together \u201c for the general purpose of improvement and welfare \u201d of themselves <em>\u201c </em>and others \u201d by signing their names to the constitution and by-laws of the association, \u201c and for the particular object of mutual relief of the members of the association in time of sickness and distress.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s husband and the husband of her assignors each signed the constitution and by-laws and became members of the society. One of the articles of the association contained this provision, viz.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-10\">\u201c Upon the death of one who has been a member of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>association for six months \u2018last prior to his death his widow shall be entitled to receive the sum of four dollars monthly during widowhood.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s husband and the husband of her assignors died after a membership of six months immediately prior to their decease. Subsequently to their decease the article above set forth was revised under authority of a provision which read as follows, viz.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-6\">\u201c A revision or alteration of the articles of the association can be had at a general meeting of the members thereof by a majority of the votes of the members present.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-7\">The revised article, adopted in conformity with this provision, reads as follows, viz.: <em>\u201c </em>Upon the death of a member each person who may be a member of the society shall pay to the widow of the deceased member the sum of one dollar.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-8\">The arrears due to the plaintiff under the original article were allowed by the decision of the court against the defendant\u2019s objection and exception.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b197-9\"><em>W. C. </em>Ruger, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b197-10\"><em>Hunt (&amp; </em>Weaver, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b197-11\">Morgan, <em>J</em>.</author>\n<p id=\"A9\">No question is made as to the right of the plaintiff to maintain a suit to recover her allowance under the original article, unless that right is taken away by the subsequent revision. A point is however made that the provisions for the benefit of the widow of the deceased member is <em>ultra </em>vires, and not within the scope of the powers of the society under the articles of association. The objects of the society are not very artistically defined. The general purpose was declared to be the welfare of the associates and others; and particularly the mutual relief of the members in times of sickness and distress. I am of opinion that the society could extend its benefits to the families of its members, and that such provision in favor of the widows of deceased members <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>was not only meritorious but fairly within the scope of the general purposes of the organization. Indeed the revised article -is just as objectionable as an excess of power as the original article itself. The constitution and by-laws should have a liberal interpretation for the purpose of promoting the general objects of the society, and as such a provision for the benefit of the families of the members is in no way hostile or opposed 'to the general plan of the oiganization, I am of opinion it should be upheld as a proper exercise of the powers conferred upon the association. The main question is, whether the allowance to the plaintiff was not cut off by the adoption of the new article after the death of her husband. It does not in terms attempt to do so by any language which points to such a result. It is not in form retroactive, and upon familiar rules qf interpretation ought not to be so construed as to cut off rights already fixed <em>(Dart </em>agt. <em>Van Kleek, </em>7 <em>John. R., </em>477; <em>Quackenbush </em>agt. <em>Danks, </em>1 <em>Denio, </em>128; 3 <em>id., </em>594; <em>Johnson </em>agt. <em>Burrell, </em>2 <em>Hill, 239; Wood </em>agt. <em>Oakley, </em>11 <em>Paige, </em>403). It must be conceded, I think, that the provision in favor of the plaintiff was, in all respects, binding as a contract between her husband and the association. The association undertook to pay to his widow a monthly allowance after- his death, if, at the time of his death, he was a member and had been such member for the preceding six months. After his death, it is not perceived how the association can, by adopting a new article, or by repealing the old one, relieve itself from this obligation. But, independent of this consideration, it is safe to say that the new article does not, in form or substance, attempt to repudiate its obligations when they had already been fixed by the death of one of its members.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
