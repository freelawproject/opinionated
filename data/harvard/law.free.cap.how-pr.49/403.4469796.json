On the trial of said action the complaint was dismissed, and the defendant asked to have judgment entered against the plaintiff for his costs, and also that the guardian of the plaintiff pay the costs, or on default that an attachment issue against said guardian. On that motion judgment was directed to be entered against the infant plaintiff, and judgment was thereafter so entered. The defendant issued an execution against the property of the plaintiff, and after the return thereof obtained an order for the examination of the plaintiff. The plaintiff moved to set aside and vacate the order on the ground that he was an infant at the time the judgment was entered.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b409-11\"><em>Kinzman &amp; Yeaman, </em>for motion.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b409-12\"><em>A.
