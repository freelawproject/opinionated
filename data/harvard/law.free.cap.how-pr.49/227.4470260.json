This contract was made on the 31st of April, 1873. A short time ago the company presented a bill for $2,865.12, amount due on- the contract from January, 1874, which the comptroller refused to pay. Suit for its recovery was brought in the supreme court, and the city put in an answer that the appropriation was exhausted, and that the claim had been incurred, if at all, by the department of parks in excess of the amount appropriated. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel moved to strike out portions of the answer as frivolous and irrelevant, and to make it more definite.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b233-10\">Donohue, <em>J</em>.</author>\n<p id=\"Ajp\">I.
