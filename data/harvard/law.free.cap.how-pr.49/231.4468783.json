F. Daly, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYk\">An offer to allow judgment under section 385 of the Code may be made in an action to foreclose a mortgage on real property <em>(Bettis </em>agt. <em>Goodwill, </em>32 <em>How. Pr. R., </em>137; <em>Penfield </em>agt. James, 56 <em>N. Y., </em>659); and such an offer will cut off the plaintiff\u2019s right to an extra allowance under section 309 of the Code <em>(Penfield </em>agt. <em>James, </em>56 <em>N. Y., </em>659). The offer must be in writing, and made at least ten days before the trial or verdict <em>(Pomeroy </em>agt. Hulin, 7 <em>How. Pr. R., </em>161; <em>Walker </em>agt. Johnson, 8 <em>id., </em>240). In the present case defendant served no written offer, but made a tender of the amount due on the mortgage,-with costs to date, while the reference to compute amount due is pending. A tender will not cut off the right to an extra allowance under section 309 of the Code in a foreclosure suit, the statute applying only to actions at law (2 <em>R. S., </em>553; <em>N. Y. Fire Co. </em>agt. <em>Burrell, </em>9 <em>How. Pr. R., </em>398 ; <em>Barton </em>agt. <em>Cleveland, </em>16 <em>id., </em>364).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>On the merits of plaintiff\u2019s application for an extra allowance : The plaintiff is certainly entitled to an allowance, a great part of the labor for which it was intended to be compensation having been performed. As, in respect of the other allowance <em>(sec. </em>308 <em>of the Code), </em>a difference of one-half in the amount allowed is made in cases where the action is settled before judgment, there would seem to be reason for making a distinction on that ground in this case; and I therefore order an extra allowance of one and a quarter per cent, under section 309 of the Code, on the whole amount of principal and interest; this being in addition to the half rates allowed by section 308.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
