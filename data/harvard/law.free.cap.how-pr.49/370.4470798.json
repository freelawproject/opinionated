Jacobs was committed in December, 1874, for thirty days, and an additional fine of $2,470.54, for the contempt in question. The counsel for the relator moved on the <em>habeas corpus </em>proceedings for his discharge, on the ' ground that the court exceeded its powers in the punishment inflicted. In opposition it was contended that the prisoner was held for a contempt specially charged in the commitment.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b376-12\">Westbrook, <em>J</em>.</author>\n<p id=\"AWd\">On the 20th day of December, 1874, the relator, Aaron Jacobs, was committed to the common jail of the city and county of Rew York, for the space of thirty days</p>\n<p id=\"ATS\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>and until he should pay a fine of $2,470.54, imposed upon him by the superior court of the city of Eew York, for an alleged contempt. The relator having been brought before the court upon a writ of <em>habeas </em>corpus, upon the return thereto by the sheriff, showing that Jacobs was held by virtue of a commitment issued by the superior court for a contempt therein charged, moves for his discharge, upon the ground that the punishment inflicted was in excess of the power of the court to impose. The counsel for the parties who oppose the discharge insists that, as it appears, the said Jacobs is held for a <em>\u201c </em>contempt specially and plainly charged in the commitment,\u201d he cannot be discharged, but must be forthwith remanded. It is not to be denied that our <em>habeas corpus </em>act in plain words (3 <em>R. </em>S., 88, <em>sec. </em>55, <em>5th edition) </em>makes it <em>\u201c </em>the duty of such court or officer \u201d before whom the writ is returnable \u201c forthwith to remand such party, if it shall appear that he is detained in custody, either * * * (2), by virtue of a final judgment, a decree of any competent court of civil or criminal jurisdiction, or of any execution issued upon such judgment or decreeor (3), for any contempt specially and plainly charged in the commitment by some court, officer or body having authority to commit for the contempt so charged.\u201d It is also true that another section of the <em>habeas corpus </em>act (3 <em>R. S., </em>888, <em>sec. </em>57, <em>5th edition) </em>declares: \u201c But no court or officer, on the return of any <em>habeas corpus </em>or <em>certiorari </em>issued under this article, shall have power to inquire into the legality or justice of any process, judgment, decree or execution specified in the preceding twenty-second section; nor into the justice or propriety of any commitment for a contempt made by any court, officer or body according to law, and charged in such\u00bb commitment as hereinbefore provided.\u201d In obedience to the plain language of our statutes, as expressed in <em>People ex rel. Phelps </em>agt. <em>Fancher </em>(9 <em>N. Y. S. C. R., by Hun, </em>226) and in <em>People ex rel. William M. Tweed </em>agt. <em>Liscomb </em>(10 <em>N. Y. S. C. R., by </em>Hun, 760),' I concurred in holding that neither \u201c the justice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>or propriety of any commitment for a contempt\u201d or the \u201clegality or justice of any * * * judgment \u201d by or of a competent court could be questioned in a proceeding of this character. My own views of these statutes are fully given in the cases to which I have referred; and, if I should follow the inclination of my .own judgment, I should hold (unless section 56 of the act, regulating the conduct of,the court or officer when the party is confined by \u201c civil process,\u201d applies) that there is no power in this court on this proceeding to review the action of the superior court in this matter. My own convictions cannot, however, prevail. I understand the court of appeals to have recently held, in the Tweed Case, that when the judgment under which the party is held was in excess of the power of the court to award, it is remediable by this writ. That is to say, though the court pronouncing the judgment has held it had the power to pronounce it, the party claiming it to be illegal need not resort to a writ of error to arrest or reverse it,, but may apply for this writ to any court or officer empowered to grant it; and if such court or officer (and it may be a county judge- or special county judge) adjudge that the judgment was in excess of the power of the court, the prisoner may be discharged. Following our court of dernier resort, I am constrained to overrule the objection founded upon our <em>habeas corpus </em>act, and examine the question of the power of the superior court to make the order complained of. The commitment shows that the fine of $2,470.54 imposed upon the relator was made up by the value of certain real \u2022 estate sold by Jacobs contrary to the mandate of the court, the costs and expenses of the plaintiff in the proceedings to punish the said Aaron Jacobs for the contempt, which were made t\u00f3 appeay by affidavit to the satisfaction of the court \u201d to be $252.25, and the further sum of $150, which the court in the, commitment declares it is satisfied, \u201c is a reasonable allowance to be made to the plaintiff for counsel fee in these proceedings.\u201d As the commitment is to detain the prisoner until he pays the entire sum of $2,470.54, if any part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>amount was illegal, it follows that the commitment is void, because as a whole it is bad. The commitment is for the whole sum. It is not until he shall pay separate sums named, but until he shall pay every dollar of the gross amount. There is no power to separate. It is good as a whole or bad as a whole. In <em>Ludlow </em>agt. <em>Knox </em>(7 <em>Abbott\u2019s Practice Reports, page </em>411, <em>N. S.) </em>the court of appeals held that in proceedings of this character the costs which may be imposed are there fixed and allowed by statute, and not those which are usually called <em>\u201c </em>counsel fees,\u201d and which rest in discretion. The opinion of GIbovek, J., fully covers the point, and to it <em>(pages </em>418, 419, 420) reference ife made. It is very questionable whether the item of $252.25, which the commitment states is .proven \u201c byu affidavit \u201d to be \u201c the costs and expenses \u201d of the proceeding to punish for a contempt, does not contain objectionable items. Waiving this, however, it is entirely clear that the one of $150, which the court says it is satisfied \u201cis a reasonable allowance to be made to the plaintiff for counsel fee in these proceedings,\u201d is just such a charge as the decision of the court covers. It was improper, and could not be allowed, and, as it makes up a part of the gross fine imposed, such fine was illegal and improper. It follows that the prisoner is entitled to be discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
