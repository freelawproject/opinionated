F. Daly, <em>J</em>.</author>\n<p id=\"A47\">The statute <em>(Laws qf </em>1863, <em>chap. </em>500, <em>section </em>5) prescribes the notice to he given in order to commence proceedings to foreclose the lien, and\"requires that it shall state <em>\u201c </em>the liens and times of filing, and he served upon all persons having filed notices of lien,\u201d &amp;c. The liens thus required to be stated, with times of filing clearly refer to those liens filed by others than the claimant commencing the ' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>proceeding. The omission to state such liens and times of filing is not a merely formal -defect or irregularity, but a failure to comply with the statute in matter of substance, and cannot be cured by amendment, but is jurisdictional and fatal to the proceeding if not waived by a general appearance. As to all parties, therefore, who have not entered shell appearance, these proceedings must be dismissed. No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
