Art. 689a, secs. 9 and 11, V. T. C. S.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">At the time of making the budget it was contemplated that the method of holding elections in the county would be, as was then the vogue, by means of marking and counting paper ballots. Accordingly the budget contained, among numerous funds set up and appropriated for various county purposes, a fund of $16,000.00 to cover the expense of holding the elections in the county, itemized as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-10\">\u201cJudges and Clerks______________________________________________$ 9,275.00 Repairing booth and ballot boxes____________________ 100.00 Delivering ballot boxes ____________________________________ 600.00 Rent chairs, tables &amp; Supplies__________________________ 800.00 Hauling election equipment______________________________ 800.00 Printing, stationery, stamps____________________________ 4,200.00 Advertising ________________________________________________________ 25.00 School Judges and Clerks________________________________ 200.00 $16,000.00</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-19\">Several months thereafter the commissions court (on April 25, 1940) made an order purporting to adopt voting machines for use in elections in the county, and looking to the procuring of the necessary voting machines.

The rental proposal contains, among others, the following stipulations :</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">\u201cThe Automatic Voting Machine Corporation further agrees that in the event the' County of Bexar, Texas, elects to so purchase such voting machines and purchases same during such rental period (June 1, 1940 to June 1, 1941), in the manner provided by law, said company will credit the amount of rentals paid by the county, including the transportation charges which shall have been paid by the county, on the purchase price of such voting machines so rented.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Both proposals contain substantially the following stipulation, which is set out in the second proposal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"A2L\">\u201cUpon the ward and the execution and delivery of contract to purchase voting machines by the county * * * to the Automatic Voting Machine Corporation, <em>we do further agree to accept for such voting machines purchased * * </em>* <em>as herein provided, cash in payment of the total purchase price, or in lieu of cash, and/or certificates of indebtedness or obligations other than bonds, </em>or bonds for not less than par on the faith and credit of said county for the purpose of paying for such voting machines and the necessary expense incident ' thereto. Such * * * obligations * * * if issued shall bear interest at the rate of * * * 2 1/2%, payable annually or semi-annually, and not exceeding \u25a0 the principal sum of * * * $305,000.00, payable serially not exceeding fifteen years from the date thereof, the maximum maturity date to be not later than 1955, and which * * * obligtaions or bonds will be paid by the levy and collection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>of a continuing direct annual ad valorem tax on all taxable property in said County (out of the $.25 Constitutional General Fund Tax authorized by Section 9, Article 8 of the Constitution of Texas). Such * * * obligations * * * which may be issued * * * shall be issued in strict accordance with the Con-situation and the laws of the State of Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-3\">\u201cIn the event the County * * * awards contract to purchase * * * not less than * * * 210 voting machines under and by virtue of the proposal hereinabove made, we hereby offer to furnish without charge to Bexar County, * * * delivered at San Antonio, * * * for the July and August Primary elections of the Democratic Party to be held within Bexar County, * * *, in July and August, 1940, * * * 90 voting machines of the type as shall be purchased by the County; provided and except, however, that the county * * * shall agree to pay the return transportation charges of such voting machines, not exceeding * * * 90 in number and will return such voting machines, within thirty days after such primary elections, * * * to the factory of the company at Jamestown, New York, transportation charges prepaid, and the county * * * upon accepting the above proposal of sale and the use of such additional voting machines not exceeding * * * 90 in number shall agree to be responsible for the safety and good care of such voting machines * * * and the county shall further agree that if any of said machines shall in any way become damaged during such time, the county will pay for such repairs as shall be necessary to put said machines in perfect condition and to have the machines amply covered by insurance against loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">\u201cAny and all voting machines which shall be purchased * * * pursuant to the above mentioned proposal and including the voting machines not exceeding * * * 90 in number to be furnished by the company without charge to the county, shall be delivered on or before June 1, 1940, provided * * * there is no delay of such shipment caused by strikes, fires or other causes over which this Corporation has no control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">On May 13, 1940, the above dual proposal made by the voting machine company was filed with the county auditor and on May 17, 1940, the county, pursuant thereto, entered into a rental agreement, items first, second, ninth and tenth of which are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">\u201cFirst: The company hereby rents * * * 300 voting machines of its latest model current top lever, new all-metal hoist type, (here follows detailed description) for use in the elections to be held in such county during the term of one year from June</p>\n<p id=\"b370-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>1, 1940, for the rental price of * * * $125.00 per machine for the first * * * 210 voting machines herein rented by the county, f. o. b.

San Antonio, * * * su'ch rentals to be paid in cash within * * * 120 days after the date of delivery to the county of such voting machines at the office of the company <em>* </em>* *. And the company further agrees to deliver such machines within 30 days from the date of this contract * * *, transportation charges prepaid, * * * and the transportation charges for the first * * * 210 * * * at $29.05 per machine, shall be added to the amount of rentals above stipulated, * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">\u201cSecond: The company agrees, that, should the * * * court * * * deem it to be to the best interest of such county that any number, not exceeding 300 * * * machines so rented under this contract be purchased and that the same be <em>purchased by such county by the county\u2019s electing so to do, </em>the company hereby specifies the maximum purchase price of such voting machines to be the sum of * * * each $1040.89, and * * * in the event the county * * * elects to so purchase such voting machines, <em>and purchases same during rental period, </em>* * * the company will credit the amount of rentals paid by the county, including the transportation charges which shall have been paid by the county, on the purchase price of such voting machines. The company agrees further that, upon the awarding and the execution and the delivery of a contract of purchase of such voting machines to the company by the county * * * in the manner provided by law, to accept (here follow the terms of the agreement applicable in event of subsequent acceptance of the option to purchase, wffiich terms are in the language of the second proposal above set out) * *</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">\u201cNinth: The county hereby rents from the company the said 300 voting machines for use in the elections to be held in such county and for the period of one year from June 1, 1940, at the rental price of * * * $125.00 per machine for the first * * * 210 * * * rented by the county herein and further rents * * * 90 * * * machines in addition to such * * * 210 * * * at the rental price * * * $1.00 per machine, f. o. b. San Antonio, Texas, for use at elections and primary elections in such county until the commissioners court of same shall redistrict voting precincts of such county as authorized by law, provided, however, that such term of rental for such * * * additional machines shall not exceed the term of one year from June 1, 1940, such rentals to be paid in cash within * * * 120 days after the date of delivery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>to the county * * * at the office of the company * * * and the county further agrees to pay the amount of transportation charges for the first * * * 210 * * * herein rental at the transportation charge of * * * $29.05 per machine to the company at Jamestown, * * *, in cash within ten days after delivery to. the county * * *. It is understood and agreed by and between the parties hereto that Bexar County shall have all of the rights and privileges to lease and/or rent the voting machines herein described to any political subdivision or party of Bexar county, Texas, within the discretionary powers of the commissioners court of Bexar County, Texas, according to the laws of the State of Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-3\">\u201cTenth: The county further agrees to be responsible for the safety and good care of the voting machines so rented during the term of this contract of rental and while same are in the possession of the county, and if any of said machines shall in any way become damaged during such time, the county agrees to pay for such repairs as shall be necessary to put said machines in perfect condition; and the county further agrees to have such voting machines amply covered by insurance; and the county agrees further that, in the event it shall not purchase said voting machines * * * it will, on or before May 31, 1941, return such * * * 300 * * * machines * * * to Automatic Voting Machine Corporation, f. o. b. cars, Jamestown, * * *, with transportation charges prepaid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">On June 5, 1940, the commissioners court passed an order amending its budget theretofore adopted so as to provide \u201cfor the rental of 300 voting machines, with an option to purchase.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">On June 20, 1940, Roy O. Hatley and five other taxpayers filed suit against the county and the members of the commissioners court, and other county officials, seeking the issuance of a temporary injunction to restrain defendants from complying with the terms of the contract. Fourteen other county taxpayers intervened on the side of defendants, asserting the validity of the proceedings of the commissioners court.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Plaintiffs attached to their petition and made a part thereof copies of the series of orders and judgments of the commissioners court above referred to, including the orders containing the acceptance of the bid of the voting machine company and the contract made pursuant thereto. Following such allegations and exhibits the petition proceeds to allege, among other things, the shipment and arrival of the voting machines; that the commissioners court had undertaken to obligate the county to pay $26,340.00 as rentals for the machines and that \u201cno <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>provision was contained in the current budget for the payment of said items or any of same,\u201d and that such order was void; that the language of the order purporting to adopt voting machines is not legally sufficient and that for this reason there had been \u201cno legal adoption of voting machines\u201d for use in the county; that in the absence of a valid order of adoption the commissioners court was without authority to enter into the contract and that for this reason, among others, the contract is void; that in any event the contract is not a contract of rental <em>with option to purchase </em>but is a contract for the <em>outright purchase </em>of the voting machines; that the provisions with reference to payment of return freight rendered the county\u2019s proposal too uncertain and indefinite.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-3\">It is unnecessary to state the allegations made upon information and belief as plaintiffs made no attempt to establish same, other than by offering in evidence their verified petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">The concluding allegations preceding the prayer are substantially that the current budget of the company showed \u201can excess of contemplated expenditures over estimated revenues in an amount of many thousands of dollars,\u201d and that the order purporting to amend the budget \u201cso as to make applicable the balance of said sum of '* * * $16,000.00 budgeted for election expense is wholly void\u201d; and that plaintiffs would suffer irreparable injury unless a temporary injunction be issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">There are other allegations attacking the validity of the proceedings but it is not deemed necessary, in the light of holdings subsequently to be made, to enumerate them.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The county and its officials and the voting machine company each filed a general demurrer and general denial. The interveners (members and directors of the Taxpayers Defense League, a voluntary association of taxpayers of the city who intervened on the side of the county and its officials), denied generally plaintiffs\u2019 allegations, and adopted the applicable allegations of the voting machine company. The company, in addition to its demurrer and general denial, filed a verified plea in abatement, alleging and pointing out, among other things* that it \u201caffirmatively appears from the face of plaintiffs\u2019 petition that the copies of orders and judgments attached thereto, are in compliance with law and in no wise in violation of the constitution and laws of the state. Plaintiffs filed a verified supplemental petition to the plea in abatement denying specifically that the county had received any benefits from the transactions alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">The trial court, upon hearing, refused to issue the temporary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>injunction prayed .for.. The Court of Civil Appeals \u25a0 reversed the order and remanded the cause, and directed issuance of a temporary injunction restraining defendants from paying out any money under the terms of the contract made between the county and voting machine company, pending a final disposition of the cause on its merits. 144 S. W. (2d) 695. Writ of error was granted upon application of defendants and interveners.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-3\">Did the commissioners court by its. order of April 25, 1940, adopt voting machines for use in elections in the county ?</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">Section 3 and 4 of Article 2997a (V. T. C. S., as amended) read:</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">\u201cSec. 3. The commissioners of any county in the State of Texas may adopt for use in elections and primary elections in at least three (3) of the largest voting precincts in voting strength in said county, any kind of voting machine approved by the Secretary of State and <em>may adopt such voting machine at any time for use in such additional voting precincts in the county as it may deem advisable, </em>and thereupon such voting machine shall be used at any and all elections and primary elections, municipal, county, district, or State held in that county or any part thereof, designated for voting, registering and counting votes cast at such elections and primary elections, all school and bond elections also shall be conducted by the use of voting machines in those counties or parts thereof where such machines have been adopted, where the law specifically makes their use obligatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">\u201cSec. 5. The County Commissioners of a county which has adopted voting machines for that county or any portion thereof, shall as soon as practicable, and in no case later than six (6) months after adoption thereof, provide for each voting precinct designated one or more approved voting machines in completed working order, and shall thereafter preserve and. keep them in repair.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">The order of adoption is in substantial compliance with the foregoing statute. It would be a sacrifice of substance to form to hold the above quoted language set out in preamble and decreeing clause of the order legally insufficient to adopt voting machines for use in elections in the county, especially in view of the succeeding provisions of the order relating to the procuring of the machines for such use.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">The next question, the determination of which will dispose of several of the subsidiary contentions of plaintiffs, is whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>the commissioners court, at the time of the filing of plaintiffs\u2019 petition seeking the issuance of a temporary injunction, was proceeding in the manner provided by law to procure voting machines for use in the county elections.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-3\">Before proceeding with an examination of this question it deemed helpful to direct attention to an additional section Article 2997a, supra, and certain provisions of Article 689a (V. T. C. S., Yol. 2, pp. 40-48).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Section 6 of Article 2997a authorizing the commissioners court to provide payment for the <em>rental and/or purchase </em>of the machines, reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">\"The County Commissioners Court shall provide for the payment of voting machines to be used in such county in such manner as the Court may deem for the best interest of the county, and for the purpose of paying for voting machines, such Commissioners Court is hereby authorized to issue bonds, and certificates of indebtedness, warrants, or other obligations to be used for this purpose and no other, which shall be a charge against the county, such bonds, certificates of indebtedness, or other obligations, may be issued with or without interest payable at such time or times as the Commissioners Court may determine, but shall never be issued nor sold for less than par; provided, however, that such Commissioners Court shall issue such bonds; certificates of indebtedness, warrants, or other obligations, to be used for the purpose of payment of voting machines in the same manner and with the same authority as provided for the issuance of warrants, bonds, certificates of indebtedness, or other obligations, by the General Laws of this State. <em>The necessary tax shall be set aside at the time of creating such obligation so as to meet the debt provisions of the Constitution; provided, however, that should the Commissioners Court of any county deem it for the best interest of such county, said Commissioners Court is hereby authorized to contract for the renting of voting machines by such county for use in elections for a term of not more than (2) years in any one contract of rental. Upon the expiration of such term of contract of rental such Commissioners Court may renew and/or extend same from time to time. </em>Such contracts shall be made only after advertising for bids in the manner provided by the General Laws controlling the purchase made by such county for county purposes, provided and except, however, <em>the Commissioners Court of any county is hereby authorized to accept proposals of rental and/or sale of voting machines </em>after advertising as provided by law wherein the rentals paid by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>such county for the use of such voting machines or a part thereof may be applied on the purchase price of such machines <em>upon such Commissioners Court determining that it is to the best interest of such counties so to do. </em>Such voting machines shall be the property of the county paying for same and/or renting same, subject to the terms of the rental contract, and when used in any election or primary election, the county is not charged by law with the holding of, such machines shall be leased to the authorities charged with holding such election or primary election, and payment shall be received by the county at such lease price per machine for each election day such machines are used in an election as the Commissioners Court shall fix, but not to exceed ten (10) per cent of the original cost of such voting machine, as may be required to hold each election or primary election. The term each election or primary election as herein used, shall mean each election day such machines are used for voting purposes in such elections, and the Commissioners Court in fixing such lease price shall fix a lease price, and payment for same shall be received by the county, for each day such machines are actually used for voting in such election or primary election, and in the event a runoff election or primary runoff election is held, such lease price shall be paid to the county for each whether the same be the first election or primary election or the second and/or runoff election or second and/or runoff primary; and those charged with the holding of such election or primary election shall pay the lease price whether it be a school board, a municipality, a political party, or any other organization or authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-3\">Article 689a provides, secs. 1 to 8, for making the annual state budget; secs. 9 to 11, for making the county budgets of certain counties (including Bexar County) ; secs. 13 to 16, for making budgets for incorporated cities or towns; and secs. 17 and 18 for making budgets for school districts. Sections 20, the concluding section of the article reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">\u201cNothing contained in this Act shall be construed as precluding the Legislature from making changes in the budget for State purposes or prevent the county commissioners court from making changes in the budget for county purposes or prevent the governing body of any incorporated city or town from making changes in the budget for city purposes, or prevent the trustees or other school governing body from making changes in the budgets for school purposes; * *</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The applicable part of section 11 is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b376-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>\u201c* * * When the budget has been finally approved by the commissioners court, the budget, as approved by the court shall be filed with the clerk of the county court, and taxes levied only in accordance therewith, and no expenditures of th\u00e9 funds of the county shall thereafter be made except in strict compliance with the budget as adopted by the court. Except that emergency expenditures, in case of grave public necessity, to meet unusual and unforseen conditions which could not by reasonably diligent thought and attention, have been included in the original budget, may from time to time be authorized by the court as amendments to the original budget.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\">It will be noted in this connection that the commissioners court prior to amending its original budget had been operating the county\u2019s business for several months without necessity of amendment; that in the meantime the court deeming it for the county\u2019s best interest to use voting machines in elections, had made effective its power and duty in the premises by passing an order adopting voting machines for such purposes; and that the concluding clause of the order decrees that the original budget be so amended that the fund remaining unexpended ($15,824.84) of the $16,000.00 (itemized above) budgeted to elections in the general fund, be reallocated and expended as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-4\">\u201cFreight on * * * 210 voting machines delivered to San.

Colonial Trust Co. v. Hill County (Com. App.), 27 S. W. (2d) 144; Anderson v. Parsley (wr. ref.), 37 S. W. (2d) 358. See in this connection Gillis v. Rosenheimer, 64 Texas 243; Emde v. Johnson (wr. ref.) 214 S. W. 575; and Johnson v. Ferguson, 55 S. W. (2d) 153. It is pointed out in this connection also that this Court recently affirmed a judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals upholding the action of the trial court in refusing an application of complaining taxpayers for temporary injunction against the local officers of a municipality to restrain them from making contemplated expenditures, on the ground that no funds were available from which such expenditures could lawfully be made. Spears v. City of South Houston (Civ. App.), 137 S. W. (2d) 197; Id. (Com. App.), 136 Texas 218, 150 S. W. (2d) 74, T. S. C. R. Vol. 9, p. 222.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">It is pointed out in the opinion of the Court of Civil Appeals in the case cited that plaintiffs, \u201care seeking to control the city officials in the exercise of powers of government which has been intrusted to them by law,\u201d citing and quoting Mayer v. Kostes (wr. ref.) 71 S. W. (2d) 398 with respect to the drastic nature of plaintiffs\u2019 procedure in seeking the temporary injunction. In the opinion of this Court upholding the action of the trial court and Court of Civil Appeals it is stated that the judgment of the officials as to what would constitute the creation of obligations against the general fund beyond the reasonably anticipated revenues for such purpose, is a matter of judgment and that the judgment of the officials \u201cmust be controlling without hindrance until it is clearly made to appear that they are acting unlawfully or fraudulently or in abuse of their discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">We cannot agree with the contention of plaintiffs that the commissioners court was without authority to amend its budget.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">It is apparent from the act requiring the court to adopt - an annual budget for carrying on the county\u2019s business that the Legislature recognized some latitude must be allowed, within the restrictions imposed with respect to the mode of operation, to make the budget plan workable; and that a budget as originally made and adopted, because of expenditures necessitated by \u201cunusual and unforesen conditions which could not by reasonably diligent thought and attention have been included in the original budget,\u201d might \u201cfrom time to time\u201d be amended to meet such \u201cemergency expenditures, in case of grave public necessity.\u201d Art. 689a, secs. 11 and 20, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">Recurring to the question whether the commissioners court proceeded lawfully in amending its original budget it is well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>to note that under our system of county government the holding therein of the elections required by law to be held, is not only a <em>\u201cgrave public necessity\u201d </em>but is an <em>absolute public necessity. </em>Accordingly the commissioners court made provision in its original budget for expense of elections in the county in the sum of $16,000.00, so allocated, however, as to its various items (see itemization at outset of this opinion) as to cover the usual expense under the paper ballot system then in vogue.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\">It can hardly be said conclusively that the court was lacking in \u201creasonably diligent thought and attention\u201d in not adopting voting machines for election purposes at the time it made the original budget, or that it was an abuse of their discretion to adopt them when it did so. It is fair to assume that the circumstances making it advisable and to the county\u2019s best interest to adopt voting machines, came about after the original budget had been set up and were not then forseen. The commissioners court, having authority to adopt voting machines, and having done so, had \u201ca broad discretion to accomplish the purpose intended,\u201d so long as it observed the constitutional and statutory limitations imposed upon it. Dodson v. Marshall, 118 S. W. (2d) 621. Certainly it would be unfair to assume against the members of the court, who are presumed to have acted lawfully in the discharge of their duties, that they intended to act unlawfully.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">It will be noted also that the order amending the budget did not require the expenditure of any fund not already set up for expense of elections in the county. In other words the appropriation made by the amendment was within an object (election expense) of the budget as originally adopted. The order recites that \u201cthe rental of voting machines is an expense of election,\u201d which obviously it was. The order further recites that the current budget, as adopted and then existing, contains provisions appropriating a sufficient fund for the payment of rentals of such machines, and that of the amount originally set up for election expense, $15,824.84 was then unexpended, and that such appropriation then contained \u201ca sufficient fund for the payment of rentals of such machines,\u201d <em>thus judicially declaring the court\u2019s purpose to pay the rentals for the machines out of current funds provided in the budget. </em>The effect of the amendment was merely to provide, consistent with the budget plan provided by the Legislature, for use of the fund then available for the \u201celection expense object\u201d of the budget..</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">If no item had been set up originally to meet the expense of elections and the amendment had sought to set up and provide for a new budget object, another question would be presented, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>Southland Ice Company v. City of Temple, 100 Fed. (2d) 825. In that case it is held that under the budget law \u201cthe city could not transfer funds and <em>apply them to a new object not mewtioned in the budget. * * </em>Whether this holding is correct is not necessary to be determined in the present case, since it appears from the recitals of the orders and contract set out above that sufficient funds were available under the tax levy made on the basis of the original budget to pay the rental expense on the voting machines.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-3\">The county had been operating under the original budget for eight months at the time voting machines were adopted, and it does not appear, other than as recited in the orders and contract above referred to and set out, what the result of that operation was. While the terms of the budget law are to be complied with strictly, such compliance is subject by specific provision to the exception with respect to the emergency expenditures, such as disclosed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">The court recites in its order of adoption that the funds for the payment of rentals were available. The burden was upon plaintiffs as a prerequisite to the issuance of the temporary injunction applied for, to establish they were not available. Plaintiffs\u2019 verified allegations whereby plaintiffs infer the funds are not available, do not bind the trial court as against judicial declaration of the commissioners court that they were available. In Spears v. City of South Houston, supra, this Court stresses the fact in its opinion that it was stated in defendants\u2019 answer there was in the fund called in question by plaintiffs, then available, more than sufficient \u201cto service the outstanding bonds of the city.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Sufficient time remained (to June 1, 1941) at the time plaintiffs filed their petition seeking the issuance of a temporary injunction, in which to further amend the original budget, if necessary to use available funds for the payment of rentals. Neither had the period then expired within which the county could exercise its option to purchase the machines outright. The present contract is not void, as contended by plaintiffs for lack of definiteness in its terms. It will be noted also that section 6 of Article 2997a provides that the court \u201cmay renew and/or extend\u201d the \u201ccontract of rental <em>from time to time.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">The procedure followed by the court in amending its original budget instead of paying the election expenditures out of the election funds then remaining, without amendment, was not only authorized under the circumstances of the present case, but made a proper record of the reason for the reallocation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>fund in harmony with the budget plan as set forth in the act making provision therefor. The court was authorized to amend its budget and acted lawfully in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-3\">It appears from what has been stated that we hold that since the debt sought to be created is payable out of current revenues, the contract is not void and unenforceable under the rule stated in McNeal v. City of Waco, 89 Texas 83, 33 S. W. 322, and the other cases cited by the Court of Civil Appeals in connection therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">Attention is directed in conclusion to Taxpayers Association v. Houston Independent School District, 81 S. W. (2d) 815, in which the Court of Civil Appeals held it lawful under the budget law for the trustees to amend the school district\u2019s budget, under circumstances not so much calculated to create a necessity for an emergency expenditure as in the present case. The judgment was permitted to stand but not necessarily upon that holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">That part of the judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals setting aside in effect that of the trial court and directing the issuance of the temporary injunction, is reversed and set aside and judgment is here rendered affirming the interlocutory order of the trial court refusing the injunction. The part of the judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals reversing and remanding the cause, thus reformed, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Opinion adopted by the Supreme Court April 16, 1941.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">Rehearing overruled May 21, 1941.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
