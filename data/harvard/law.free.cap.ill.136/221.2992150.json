Easement\u2014in what way created. An easement in one tract of land in favor of another, which is an incorporeal hereditament, can be created only by grant. It can not be created by declarations or by an oral agreement, and if it could, such declarations or agreement could not affect the equitable rights of others, acquired prior to their being made.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b221-17\" pgmap=\"221\">2.

Nor will the continual assertion of a party\u2019s right to have the free passage of air and light to his windows over the adjoining land of another, without any acts on his part in support of his claim; nor will the mere acquiescence of the owner of the adjoining land, without any act of recognition of such right, estop the latter from disputing such alleged prescriptive right.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b221-19\" pgmap=\"221\">4. Same\u2014evidence\u2014whether establishing an easement. The fact that an easement may be shown which renders a lot servient to another joining it on the east, has no tendency to establish a similar easement in such lot appurtenant to another lot on the west.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b221-20\" pgmap=\"221\">5.

Forbes, to restrain him from erecting a building on the east half of lot 9, in the south block of the Rockford Water Power Company\u2019s lots, west of Rock River, in the city of Rockford. The pleadings on the part of the complainant as finally passed upon by the court consisted of the original bill and two elaborate amendments thereto, and the facts thus alleged, when properly arranged, are, in substance, as follows: That the complainant is, and ever since October 15,1875, has been, the owner in fee of the west half of said lot 9, and the east half of lot 10 in said block, and two hundred twenty-thousandths of all the water in Rock River, according to the legal tenor and effect of a deed of that date, executed by Franklin M. Needham and wife to her; that acting in reliance upon the terms and conditions of a\" certain deed of conveyance from said Water Power Company to Duncan Forbes and the defendant, dated June 26,1866, the complainant, about the year 1877, caused to be erected upon her said premises a substantial stone building, three stories high, about eighty feet in length and about forty feet in width, ojiposite and westerly from said east half of said lot 9, at an expense of at least $10,000, and has since caused said building to be used and occupied by the Rockford Bolt Works, a corporation for whose use said building was expressly constructed, as her tenant; that in the construction of said building for said corporation, it was necessary that a large amount of window space should be left and a very considerable amount of light afforded to the workmen therein, and that without such light the value of said building for the purposes for which it was designed would be greatly diminished.</summary><summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-7\" pgmap=\"223(117) 224(49)\">The deed of June 26,1866, from the Water Power Company to Duncan Forbes and the defendant, a copy of which is attached to the bill as an exhibit, granted four hundred twenty-thousandths of the water of Rock River and also conveyed \u201clots 12 and 13, in west block, and also for the purpose of locating proper water-wheel and races to draw said water, the east half of lot 9, in the south block, all in.the Rockford Water Power Company\u2019s lots west of Rock River, in said city, as per last recorded plat. * * * Also, no building-is to be erected or business carried on on said east half of said lot 9 in the. south block that shall materially increase the fire exposure of the building on either side of said half lot.

Taleott the west half of said lot 9 and the east half of said lot 10, said two half lots constituting one lot abutting on said east half of lot 9 on the west; that about November 15, 1867, said Emerson and Taleott conveyed .their two half lots to Franklin M. Need-ham, and that on the 15th day of October, 1875, said Needham conveyed the same to the complainant as above stated; that said Water Power Company, in making its said deed to said Emerson and Talcott, represented to and agreed with them that the east half of lot 9 was dedicated to the uses aforesaid, so that it could not be used for any building that would obstruct the light or air of the lots so conveyed to them, and that it would be used only for the purposes of a race-way and water-wheel, and such fire-proof building as should be needed for the mere protection of the water-wheel, and that said Emerson and Talcott took said property relying upon said representation and agreement; that said Emerson and Talcott, when conveying to said Needham, made the same representations and agreement, and he took said property relying thereon, \u2022and that said Needham, in conveying said property to the complainant, made the same representations, and that she took said property in good faith relying thereon; that all of said parties have, during the time of their ownership, continually, openly, notoriously and adversely asserted their right to have the east half of said lot 9 used only for race-way and water-wheel purposes, and to have the same kept unobstructed and clear of all buildings as aforesaid; that the owners of all interests and rights in the east half of said lot 9 have directly, positively and continually recognized said right in the east half of said lot 9 as appurtenant to the property conveyed to the complainant, and as appurtenant to the property east of said half lot, from before the date of said conveyance by said Water Power Company to said Emerson and Talcott down to about July 1, 1889, when for the first time the defendant commenced to deny said right and the existence of said easement; that the complainant, for a space of more than twenty years, has enjoyed said easement of air, light and safety from fire exposure under an asserted claim of right, and in a manner open and notorious to all and recognized by all.</summary><summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-5\" pgmap=\"225(37) 226(300)\">The bill further alleges that in the year 1865, a question arose on the part of the then owners of lots 7 and 8 in said half block, being the lots lying immediately east of the east half of said lot 9, as to the right of any person to erect a building on said half lot, or to permit or cause any building to stand thereon other than a waterwheel cover; that said question arose in relation to a building known as the Rockford File Factory, which had been moved on to said half lot; that William Dyson, who was then the owner of said lots 7 and 8, applied to said Emerson, who was supposed to be the secretary of the Water Rower Company, and was informed by him that the purpose and policy of said company was to leave a portion of said lot 9 for a water raceway, and to prevent the spread of fire and to give an avenue for use in case of a general fire in that locality; that said Emerson acting on the suggestion of said Dyson and others interested, remonstrated against the continuance of said -building on said half lot and brought its existence to the notice of the officers of the Water Power Company, who decided that the existence of said structure on said half lot was an encroachment upon the rights of the landowners adjoining said halflot, and thereupon said Dyson caused a written notice to be served oh said Duncan Forbes and the defendant, who were then charged with being responsible for placing said structure on said half lot, and that upon service of said notice, said Duncan Forbes and the defendant caused said building to be removed from said half lot, since which time no building or structure has been placed thereon except an ordinary covering for the waterwheel, which does not rise more than three feet above the surface of the street in front of said premises.</summary><summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-5\" pgmap=\"226(92) 227(133)\">It is further alleged that the'Rockford Woolen Mills, a corporation, has succeeded\" to the rights of s\u2018aid Dyson in said lots 7 and 8, and now owns a building sixty-two feet long, fifty feet\" wide' and three stories high standing thereon within four feet of the e\u2019ast line of said lot 9, said building having been constructed about April, 1865, in reliance upon the fact that a space would be left on the east half of said lot 9 unincumbered by. any building or structure except that of a low water-wheel cover; that said building has been used as a .woolen factory, in the progress of which business the use of oils is necessary, making the business somewhat exposed to fire, and making it desirable and exceedingly necessary that means of escape for operatives employed in said building, in case of fire, should not be obstructed; that a large amount of light is essential to the business carried on in said building, and that there are in the west side of said building thirty windows which would be materially darkened by the erection of a building on the east half of said lot 9 ;' that the easement reserved by said Water Power Company over and upon said half lot is appurtenant to the property on either side of said half lot.</summary><summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-5\" pgmap=\"227(252) 228(15)\">That at the time of the execution of the deed from the Water Power Company to Duncan Forbes and the defendant, a discussion arose between the parties thereto, as to the location of a water-wheel, flume and race-way to carry the water about to be granted and intended for use by said grantees in their manufacturing business north of said lot 9, and that out of such discussion arose that portion of their agreement which was expressed by the clause of the deed above quoted; that before and at the time of said conveyance the objects and .purposes for which the east half of said lot 9 was granted were fully discussed and ivell known by all the parties to said deed, and in order to restrain and limit said grantees with respect to the use of said half lot, they were required to join in said deed and become bound thereby, and they did in fact sign and execute the same for such purpose; that at about the same date said Water Power Company in like manner reserved the .west half of said lot 10, and since that time that half lot has been used and known as Trahern\u2019s race-way, and is used for the purpose of conveying water from Trahern\u2019s shops north of Mill street, the street in front of the property in question, into Kent\u2019s Creek, and that the reservation of the race-way on the east half of lot 9 was only a carrying out of the policy adopted by said Water Power Company with respect to the lots in said south block.</summary><summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-5\" pgmap=\"228\">The bill further alleges that the complainant, in erecting her said building, relied upon the terms and conditions of said deed from said Water Power Company to Duncan Forbes and the defendant permitting the use of the east half of said lot 9 for the purpose of locating a proper water-wheel and water race for the use of the grantees and for no other purpose whatever, and also upon the verbal statements to the same effect, made to her agents by said Needham at the time of the conveyance of the west half of lot 9 from him to her, and that at \u2022 the time of said conveyance it was generally understood and-believed by those having business relations with said Water Power Company that the premises immediately east of the lots so conveyed to her were to be used and devoted to no purpose which would interfere with the light essential to the proper \u25a0use and enjoyment of said building to be erected by the complainant for the purpose aforesaid, and were not to be built upon except for water-wheel purposes.</summary><summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-6\" pgmap=\"228(176) 229(113)\">It is further alleged that the complainant caused her said .building to be erected ten feet back from the street line on the north, in the belief and expectation that should any structure 'be erected there, it would be similar to the then existing structure which was a mere covering for a water-wheel located on \u00a1said lot 9; that on or about July 12, 1889, she became advised that the defendant was contemplating the erection on \u00a1the east half of said lot 9, and immediately east of the eom\u2022plainant\u2019s building, of a stone building seventy-five feet long, \u00a1nineteen feet wide and three stories high; that thereupon the .complainant gave notice in writing of her claim that the eonweyance from the Water Power Company to Duncan Forbes and the defendant of said half lot was for the purpose of locating a water-wheel and races and for no other purpose, and that in reliance upon the limitations in said grant, she had erected her building, and that said notice was given with a view of having the rights of the parties ascertained and deter- \u2018 mined before the expenditure by the defendant of any money in the erection of his proposed building; that afterward the defendant and the complainant\u2019s agent conferred together with reference to the construction of said proposed building, the defendant insisting upon his right to build it in the manner aforesaid, and the complainant\u2019s agent maintaining the contrary; that after the stone foundation of said building had been laid, the defendant agreed with the complainant\u2019s agent that work on said building should be suspended until the whole matter could be presented to the court for determination on application for a preliminary injunction.</summary><summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-5\" pgmap=\"229(238) 230(110)\">The bill further alleges that said easement in the east half of said lot 9 was created and retained by said Water Power Company for the benefit of the complainant and other surrounding property owners, and that valuable and substantial improvements have been made' with respect thereto, and but for the language contained in the deed under which the defendant' claims title, and the statements and representations of the officers of said company respecting the use and purpose to which the east half of said lot 9 was to be put, the complainant would not have built in the manner aforesaid, and that the defendant is now estopped from devoting said half \u2022lot to any other purpose than that of a water-wheel and water-race location; that the provisions of said deed were in accordance with the general plan and policy of said Water Power Company in respect to leaving easements'for light for business '.purposes on its property, and that the restrictions of said grant to water-wheel and race purposes were in fulfillment of said company\u2019s obligation to other persons who had purchased or should thereafter purchase adjoining property and build thereon for business purposes requiring a large amount of light; that said Duncan Forbes and the defendant paid for the east half of said lot 9 a diminished price because of said restrictions imposed upon their use of said half lot; that if the defendant' be permitted to construct the building proposed as contemplated by him, such building will substantially diminish the light which now enters her building and will render the same untenantable for the use and purpose for which the same was constructed and ever since has been used, and also that the erection of the defendant\u2019s proposed building will materially increase the exposure of the complainant\u2019s building to fire. It is also alleged that said Duncan Forbes has departed this life, and that the defendant has in some manner become successor to the title and interest of said Duncan Forbes in the east half of said lot 9.</summary><summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-5\" pgmap=\"230\">The prayer of the bill is, that the defendant be restrained from proceeding with the erection of his proposed building on the east half of said lot 9, and from the erection of any building on said half lot other than a suitable covering for a waterwheel and water-race, and a general prayer for relief. The defendant demurred to the bill, as amended, for want of equity, which demurrer was sustained, and a decree was thereupon entered dismissing the bill at the complainant\u2019s costs. From that decree the complainant has appealed to this court.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b230-6\" pgmap=\"230\">Mr. N. C.

The order of the Circuit Court allowing an appeal directly to this court must undoubtedly have been allowed upon the assumption that the case involves a freehold, and our jurisdiction must depend upon whether that assumption is well founded. The bill asserts and seeks to maintain a right in the nature of a perpetual easement, in respect to which the west half of lot 9, in the south block, etc., is the dominant and the east half of said lot is the servient estate. The alleged easement consists of the perpetual right of the owners of the west half of said lot to have the east half kept free from buildings of every character, other than those necessary to provide a proper shelter and covering for a water-w'heel and water-race, so that light coming from the east half of said lot to the windows of the building on the west half shall not be obstructed or diminished, and so that said building shall not be subjected to any increased exposure to fire. This right or easement, if it exists, is clearly an incorporeal hereditament, in which the complainant sets up and is seeking by her bill to establish an estate in fee. A perpetual easement appurtenant to an estate in fee is a freehold.</p> <p id=\"b235-4\" pgmap=\"235\">In Oswald v. Wolf, 126 Ill. 542, we held that an easement appurtenant to one tract of land, in the nature of a right of way over an adjoining tract, was a freehold, and that a suit to recover the possession and enjoyment of such easement was a suit involving a freehold, within the meaning of the statutes fixing the respective appellate jurisdiction of this court and the Appellate Court. See also Oswald v. Wolf, 25 Ill. App. 501. We are of the opinion that the same rule applies here. The right which the complainant is seeking to assert and recover, if it exists at all, is a freehold, and the appeal therefore was properly taken to this court.</p> <p id=\"b235-5\" pgmap=\"235\">Assuming then that we have jurisdiction, the only question presented by the appeal is whether the court properly sustained the demurrer to the bill. It is not claimed that the complainant is entitled to any application of the common law doctrine of \u201cancient lights, \u201d even if that doctrine was recognized as in force in this State, nor is it pretended that the Rockford Water Power Company, the common source from which both parties derived their titles, in platting the tract of land of which said lot 9 forms a part, in any way set apart or dedicated the east half of said lot to either a public use or to the use of the owners of the adjacent property. On the plat lot 9 was marked and designated as one of the several lots in the block, and there was nothing there indicating that the east half of said lot was reserved or set apart for any particular uses or subjected to any special burdens. Nor do any of the deeds through which the complainant acquired her title purport to convey any easement or servitude in the east half of said lot, or any right to control the mode in which the east half of said lot should be occupied, used or built upon.</p> <p id=\"b235-6\" pgmap=\"235(53) 236(128)\">The complainant bases her right to relief upon the terms and limitations of the deed from the Water Power Company to Duncan Forbes and the defendant conveying to them, among other property, the east half of said lot; upon the fact that said half lot had been unoccupied by any building other than one built for the mere purpose of protecting the water-wheel and race, for a period of more than twenty years, the complainant and her grantors and the owners of the lot adjoining said lot 9 on the east during that time claiming as an easement the right to have the east half of said lot 9 kept free from all buildings, except as aforesaid, for the benefit of their respective lots; and upon the representations alleged to have been made by the officers of said Water Power Company, at the time of the conveyance by it to the complainant\u2019s remote grantor of the premises now owned by her, that the east half of said lot 9 would be perpetually kept free from buildings, except as aforesaid.</p> <p id=\"b236-5\" pgmap=\"236\">Considering these three propositions in the reverse order of their statement here, it will be observed by reference to the bill, that the deed from the Water Power Company to Duncan Forbes and the defendant conveying to them the east half of said lot 9, and the deed from said company to Emerson and Talcott, the complainant\u2019s remote grantors, conveying to them the west half of said lot 9 and the east half of lot 10, were both executed on the same day, viz, June 26, 1866. There is no allegation as to which deed was executed at the earlier hour, thus leaving room for the presumption arising from the mere fact that there is no allegation to the contrary, that the Forbes deed was executed and delivered and the rights thereby granted vested in the grantees before any rights were acquired by Emerson and Talcott under the deed to them. But it appears affirmatively from the recitals in the Forbes deed that the execution of that deed was merely a compliance with and fulfillment of a contract for such conveyance entered into by said parties February 14, 1865, thus showing that the equitable title of the grantees under the Eorbes deed accrued nearly a year and \u00e1 half before the execution of the deed to Emerson and Talcott.</p> <p id=\"b236-6\" pgmap=\"236(24) 237(158)\">There are at least two reasons why the easement in the east half of lot 9 claimed by the complainant can not have resulted from the representations or agreement alleged to have been made by the officers of the Water Power Company at the time of the conveyance of the west half of said lot to Emerson and Talcott. Said easement is an incorporeal hereditament which could be created only by grant, and there is no pretense that there was anything more than an oral agreement in relation to it. In the second place,-the equitable title of the grantees in the Forbes deed certainly, and their legal title presumably, had become vested in them before said representations were made or said agreement by the officers of the Water Power Company entered into. Whatever effect then might be given to said representations or agreement as against the Water Power Company, they can not be held to affect the rights of the grantees in that deed, or to create an easement upon property or property rights which had already become vested in them.</p> <p id=\"b237-5\" pgmap=\"237\">Nor does the bill in our ojiinion make out a case of twenty years\u2019 adverse enjoyment of the easement sufficient to establish a prescription from which a previous grant will be implied. The tendency of the decisions in this country for a considerable time has been against the doctrine of gaining a prescriptive right to the enjoyment of light and air as an easement appurtenant to an estate, on the ground that it is incompatible with the condition of a country which is undergoing such radical and rapid changes in the progress of its growth. 2 Washburn on Real Property, (5th ed.) 365, and decisions cited in note. This view was adopted by this court, after full consideration of the question, in Guest v. Reynolds, 68 Ill. 478.</p> <p id=\"b237-6\" pgmap=\"237(77) 238(349)\">But an attempt is made to take the case out of the rule thus established by alleging that, for the period of twenty years, the complainant and her grantors had continually, openly and notoriously asserted their adverse right to have the east half of said lot 9 kept unobstructed and clear of all buildings except a covering for a water-wheel, and that the owners of said half lot have continuously recognized that right. There is no allegation, however, of any acts done by the complainant or her grantors by way of asserting their right to an easement in said half block, or of any acts done by the owners of the servient estate by way of recognizing such right. On the contrary, the averments of the bill show that, on the 26th day of June, 1866, the date of the conveyance by the Water Power Company of both the dominant and servient estates, the east half of lot 9 was used for a water-wheel and water-race, and had no building on it except a mere covering for the water-wheel, and that it so continued up to July 12, 1889, the date at which the defendant commenced the erection thereon of his proposed building. During all that time, covering the entire period of the alleged prescription, the owners of said half lot made no attempt, and presumably had no .occasion, to assert their dominion over said half lot by way of occupying it in any other mode or of building upion it in any other form. Nothing transpired during that period by which the complainant\u2019s right to her alleged easement was raised or called in question, and we are therefore unable to see how any amount of assertion on her part of her right to such easement could be of any avail. If she had made public proclamation of her right every day, nothing would have been gained. The owners of the servient estate were called upon to give heed to her assertions of her rights only when they came into collision with them in the exercise of their dominion over their own property, and their failure to respond or deny her claims, so long as they had no occasion to change their mode of occupancy\u2014and that is all, in the- absence of any averment of acts of recognition, the allegation in the bill of their continual recognition of her rights can be held to amount to\u2014can not be set up in aitl of her alleged prescription or pleaded by way of estoppel.</p> <p id=\"b238-5\" pgmap=\"238(42) 239(311)\">There is an allegation, however, that in 1865, the year before the complainant\u2019s and defendant\u2019s title passed Out of the Water Power Company, a question arose between the owner of the lots lying immediately east of said lot 9 and Duncan Forbes and the defendant in relation to a building which the latter had then lately caused to be moved on to the east half of lot 9, and that on complaint being made to the officers of said company, they decided that the maintenance of said building on said half lot was -an encroachment upon the rights of the owner of the lots east, and that upon notice to Duncan Forbes the defendant, they caused said building to be removed. It is difficult to see how the acts of the parties in relation to that building can throw any light upon the rights of the parties here. The rights or easements which may have been granted by the Water Power Company to the owner of said lots east are not shown, and we therefore can not tell upon what claim of right his complaints were based. The Water Power Company then owned both halves of lot 9, and its assenting to or ordering the removal of said building, whatever may have been its reason for doing so, could have had no tendency to create an easement or servitude upon the east half of said lot 9 in favor of the west half of said lot. Furthermore, there is nothing in the bill showing any privity between the. complainant and the owner of the lots east of lot 9. Her rights are in no way dependent upon those of such owner, and receive no aid from any assertion of right which he may have made. Even if it should be admitted that there is an easement which renders the east half of lot 9 servient to the lots \u00abadjoining it on -the east, that fact would have no tendency to establish a similar' easement in said half lot appurtenant to the lots adjoining it on the west.</p> <p id=\"b239-5\" pgmap=\"239(91) 240(240)\">It remains to \u2018be considered whether the easement set up by the complainant results from the terms and limitations of .'the Forbes deed. That deed granted a certain interest in the grantor\u2019s water-power On Rock River, and also conveyed to the grantees lots 12. and 13 in the west block of the grantor\u2019s lots, \u201cand also, for the purpose o*f locating proper water-wheel and races, to draw said water, the east half of lot 9 in the south block,\u201d etc. I't can not be doubted that the effect of this deed was to convey to the grantees the fee in said half lot. By reference to the operative words of the deed it will be seen that by it the grantor granted, bargained, sold and conveyed, for the purpose above indicated, the east half of said lot 9, the title or interest thus sought to be conveyed being, not an easement or servitude, but the lot itself. What effect then is to be given to the words, \u201cfor the purpose of locating proper water-wheel and races to draw said water ?\u201d It is plain that they do not constitute a condition, as there is no provision for re-entry for condition broken, nor is there anything in the instrument indicating an intention on the part of the grantor that the appropriation of said premises to any other purpose should -have the effect of defeating -the estate granted. Nor can said language be construed as a covenant on the part of the grantees to use the property granted for the purpose indicated and none other. No terms are used by which a covenant is ordinarily expressed, nor are there any negative words forbidding the appropriation of the property to other purposes. The contention, however, is, that said language constitutes a limitation on the use to which the grantees are at liberty to appropriate said half lot, thus, in effect, creating a servitude or easement in favor of the adjoining property.</p> <p id=\"b240-5\" pgmap=\"240(148) 241(73)\">Even if it should be admitted that the clause above quoted, if standing alone, would have had the effect of a limitation or restriction upon the use of the property granted to the mere purpose of furnishing a proper location of a water-wheel and water-race, the conclusion contended for would not follow, as there is other language in the deed which shows that the parties really contemplated a much less restricted use of said half lot. The clause above mentioned has no negative words forbidding the erection on said half lot of a building for business purposes, but in the same part of the deed in which said clause is found, viz, the part usually known as the premises, is the further clause that, \u201cno building is to be erected or business carried on on said east half of said lot 9, in the south block, that shall materially increase the fire exposure of the building on either side of said half lot; al\u00e9o, no building or erection is to be put up on said half lot that shall darken any light, within three feet of the west line of said half lot.\u201d In determining therefore what restrictions the grantor intended to place upon the use of said half lot, all of these clauses must be construed together.</p> <p id=\"b241-5\" pgmap=\"241\">In considering them together, we scarcely find room for doubt that the limitation or restriction upon the use of said half lot intended to be imposed was not, as the complainant contends, to the mere location of a water-wheel and race, and such structure as might be fairly necessary to cover and protect the water-wheel, but that the parties contemplated the erection on said half lot of a business building, to be occupied and used for business purposes, subject to two limitations or restrictions, viz, 1. that the building to be erected should be one which would not materially increase the fire exposure of the buildings on either side, and, 2. that no building which would darken any light should be placed within three feet of the west line of said half lot.</p> <p id=\"b241-6\" pgmap=\"241\">The question then arises whether the building which the defendant proposes to erect is shown by the bill to be violative of either of these limitations. There is no averment that the west wall of said building will be within three feet of the west line of said half lot, and therefore, even though it may darken the windows of the complainant\u2019s building, it is not shown to be within the terms of the second limitation; but it is directly and positively alleged that said building will materially increase the fire exposure of the complainant\u2019s building. This brings it within the first limitation above mentioned, and entitles the complainant to relief, if she is in a position to avail herself of the limitation in the Forbes deed.</p> <p id=\"b241-7\" pgmap=\"241(33) 242(103)\">The limitation in that deed is in the nature of an exception or reservation to the grantor of an incorporeal right in the land granted, and the reservation- being made for the benefit of the adjoining half lot, such right is in the nature of an equitable easement appurtenant to that half lot. Fuller v. Arms, 45 Vt. 400; Ayling v. Kramer, 133 Mass. 12; 2 Washburn on Real Property, 2. The conveyance of the west half of said lot through mesne conveyances to the complainant, vested said easement in her .as appurtenant to the property thus conveyed. Where an easement has become appurtenant to a dominant estate, a conveyance of that estate carries with it the easement .belonging to it, whether mentioned in the deed or not. 2 Washburn on Real Property, 317.</p> <p id=\"b242-5\" pgmap=\"242\">As to all other grounds of relief we think the demurrer to the bill was properly sustained, but the defendant should have been required to answer whether his proposed building would materially increase the fire exposure of the complainant\u2019s building. The decree will be reversed and the cause remanded with instructions to overrule the demurrer to the extent and in. the manner above indicated, and for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. ,</p> <p id=\"b242-6\" pgmap=\"242\">Decree reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
