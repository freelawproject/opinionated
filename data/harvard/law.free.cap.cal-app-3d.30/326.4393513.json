J.</author>\n<p id=\"Asr\">George Washington Barber and his wife Linda Marie Barber are charged with possessing narcotics (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11500), possessing narcotics for sale (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11530.5), both while armed with a deadly weapon (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022), with possessing marijuana (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11530), possessing a sap or blackjack (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12020), carrying a loaded firearm in a vehicle (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12031, subd. (a)), and carrying a concealable weapon in a vehicle (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12025, subd. (a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Their motions under Penal Code sections 995 and 1538.5 were denied. This petition, brought under Penal Code section 1538.5, seeks mandate to compel suppression of evidence found in a search of their automobile on the ground the search occurred during an unlawful detention. Their contention is meritorious. The petition should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">On September 12, 1972, about 2:45 a.m., while on routine patrol, Escondido Officer Santibanez saw a car parked on the dirt shoulder of Via Rancho Parkway east of Highway 395. Santibanez\u2019s routine procedure was to \u201ccheck\u201d vehicles in the area like that, his purpose being to check on the occupants\u2019 well-being to see \u201cif he could aid in their assistance in any way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">After stopping his patrol vehicle behind the parked car, Santibanez walked up to Barber\u2019s automobile. Although he saw all persons in the car were sleeping and were in no obvious need of assistance, he nevertheless rapped on the left front window. George Barber rolled it down. The officer asked if everything was all right; Barber said it was. Nothing indicated otherwise. Santibanez then probed further: he asked to see some identification. Barber showed him his social security card. Santibanez asked if Barber had any identification with his birth-date, preferably a driver\u2019s license. Barber did not produce other identification, but said he thought his driver\u2019s license was in some clothing he had in the trunk. Barber went to the trunk, checked some clothing, but came up with no identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">Other officers arrived and began talking to Barber. Santibanez radioed for warrant checks. The other officers left. Santibanez told Barber he was running a check, and while it was being run Barber could wait in his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">Within two minutes, the dispatcher notified Santibanez there were no local warrants outstanding, but said she was still checking the San Francisco area. Upon learning this, the officer drove about two blocks away. Within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>three or four minutes, Santibanez learned there were five misdemeanor warrants outstanding for Barber in the San Francisco area, called a cover unit, returned to Barber\u2019s car and arrested him. Barber was handcuffed and placed in the back seat of the police car.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">Santibanez then went back to Barber\u2019s car and beamed his flashlight inside. He saw an automatic pistol on the driver\u2019s seat, picked it up and learned it was loaded. Continuing his search, in the console area he found seven .38 caliber live rounds. Santibanez then told Barber a charge of carrying a loaded weapon would also be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Searching further, the officer found a sap, or blackjack, in Mrs. Barber\u2019s purse. Searching the trunk, Santibanez saw a light blue cotton shirt wadded in a large ball. He felt something in it, unwrapped it and recognized three tinfoil-wrapped packages of heroin. Ten small bindles of heroin were within one. At the police station, officers found more heroin sewn into the pockets of the shirt; they also found a very small amount of marijuana (18.7 grams) loose and rolled into a cigarette, in a small tool box.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">When Santibanez approached Barber\u2019s legally parked car and awakened him, he neither suspected nor had any reason to suspect any illegal behavior. His purpose, to ascertain the well-being of the occupants, was accomplished when he looked in the car and saw the family asleep, and at most when Barber told him everything was all right.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">Santibanez\u2019s further actions had nothing to do with any suspicion or hunch, articulable or otherwise (see <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>1 Cal.3d 423, 426-427 [82 Cal.Rptr. 484, 462 P.2d 12]) that Barber and his family were doing anything other than resting by the roadside, as do many drivers, sleepy from travel, before continuing safely and alertly in traffic on the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\"> \u201c. . . Substantial circumstances [are required] to justify the detention and questioning of persons . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>69 Cal.2d 674, 683 [72 Cal.Rptr. 800, 446 P.2d 800]). \u201c[T]he police officer must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which . . . reasonably warrant that intrusion.\u201d <em>(Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, 392 </em>U.S. 1, 21 [20 L.Ed.2d 889, 906, 88 S.Ct. 1868].) \u201c \u2018There must be a \u201crational\u201d suspicion by the peace officer that some activity out of the ordinary is or has taken place . . . some indication to connect the person under suspicion with the unusual activity . . . [and] some suggestion that the activity is related to crime.\u2019 [Citation.] Where the events are as consistent with innocent activity as with criminal activity, a detention based on those events is unlawful.\u201d <em>(Irwin </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>supra, 1 Cal.3d 423, 427.)</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\"> What Santibanez- saw\u2014a family asleep in its car by the road-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>side in the middle of the night\u2014was not merely \u201cas consistent with innocent activity as with criminal activity,\u201d it was only consistent with innocent activity. Officers are not at liberty to stop, intrude upon and detain individuals they happen to come upon to determine if there are warrants outstanding against them. After Barber told him everything was all right, Santibanez had no justification to detain Barber and his family for any reason. His request for further identification and his detention of Barber, by telling him he could wait in the car while the warrant checks were being run, were prompted only by \u201cgeneral curiosity, were unrelated to probable cause and violated both the spirit and letter of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>20 Cal.App.3d 590, 592 [97 Cal.Rptr. 815].)</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Let a writ of mandate issue as prayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Ault, J., and Coughlin, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Retired Associate Justice of the Court of Appeal sitting under assignment by the Chairman of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
