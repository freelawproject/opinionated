Section 243(b) relates to disabilities <em>not </em>arising in the performance of duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Section <em>100\u00bd, </em>as relevant, provides: \u201cAny member of the Fire Department sustaining an injury while in the performance of his duty shall be entitled to receive [certain benefits]; and the [Oakland City] Council shall allow the member so injured full pay during the continuance of his disability or until such time as he may be retired on a pension.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">Section 92\u00bd contains similar provisions relating to members of the city\u2019s police department.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">It will be seen that, at least ordinarily, the Oakland City Council is the body authorized to determine the eligibility of a disabled member for such full pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">Section 243(a) of the charter provides that any member \u201c. . . who becomes incapacitated for the performance of duty by reason of any injury received in, or illness caused by or arising out of the performance of duty and which disability continues without interruption of one (1) year, may be retired, . . .\u201d on a retirement allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">Section 243(b), as relevant, states, \u201cAny member . . . who becomes incapacitated for the performance of duty from any cause not included in the provisions of the preceding paragraph (a) and who shall have completed at least ten (10) years of service in the aggregate, shall be retired upon a retirement allowance . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-11\">The retirement allowance under section 243(b) for disability <em>not </em>incurred in the performance of duty is smaller than that authorized by section 243(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-12\">The charter creates the Oakland Police and Fire Retirement Board (hereafter \u201cBoard\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-13\">Another provision of section 243(b) states: \u201cThe question of retiring a member under this section [243(a), (b)] may be brought before the Board on the Board\u2019s own motion, by recommendation of the City Manager or by petition of said member . . . .\u201d Section 236 of the Charter provides: \u201cThe Board may and in disputed matters shall hold public hearings in all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>proceedings pertaining to retirement and to the granting of retirement allowances, ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">Thus, jurisdiction over retirement of members, and the granting or denial of retirement allowances, is conferred upon the Board by the charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Respondent Robert W. Williams was a member of the fire department of the City of Oakland. Concededly he became permanently disabled from performing the duties of such employment. Within one year of the onset of his disability he applied to the Board for retirement for reasons \u201carising out of the performance of duty\u201d as permitted by section 243(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Following a hearing the Board found and determined \u201cthat the said Robert W. Williams is incapacitated for the performance of duty in the Fire Department because of heart injury, and that the said disability arose out of injury received in and caused by, the performance of duty in the Fire Department and is service connected; . . .\u201d The Board then determined that \u201csince said disability has not continued without interruption for one year, the <em>application for disability retirement is denied without prejudice.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Williams then, in accordance with section <em>IOOV2, </em>applied to the city council for \u201cfull pay during the continuance of his disability or until such time as he may be retired on a pension.\u201d His application was based on the determination of the Board that his disability arose out of \u201cthe performance of duty in the fire department and is service connected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">The city council, feeling that Williams\u2019 disability was <em>not </em>incurred in \u201cline of duty,\u201d refused to allow him \u201cfull pay\u201d as requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">Williams then, \u201cindividually and on behalf of all others similarly situated; and Mike Anthony as chairman of the Police and Fire Co-ordinating Council of the City of Oakland,\u201d petitioned the superior court for a writ of mandate (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 1094.5) against the City of Oakland and certain of its agencies and officers (hereafter collectively, \u201cCity of Oakland\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">The principal issues presented to the superior court were: (1) \u201cWhether the Board had jurisdiction\u201d to \u201cact upon Mr. Williams\u2019 application for service-connected disability retirement\u201d and if it did, (2) whether the Board\u2019s finding of \u201cservice-connected disability was\u201d binding on the city council; and (3) whether the proceedings constituted a \u201cproper class action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-11\">After a trial the superior court found in favor of Williams on each of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>the issues. Judgment was entered, and a writ of mandate issued accordingly. The City of Oakland has appealed from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">The obvious, and only, purpose of the superior court mandate proceedings was to obtain a judicial declaration that in Williams\u2019 and like cases the Board\u2019s finding of \u201cservice incurred disability\u201d under section 243(a), had binding, <em>or res judicata, </em>effect upon a subsequent application to the city council for \u201cfull pay\u201d under section <em>92Vi </em>or section <em>IOOV2.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">The issue presented for our consideration, then, <em>relates </em>to the res judicata effect of decisions of local administrative agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Few areas of our law are attended by such uncertainty as is this question. Citing authority, the editors of California Jurisprudence (2d ed.) tell us, \u201cThe doctrine of res judicata, as applied to the decisions of administrative agencies, is confused, and has received little systematic consideration by the courts.\u201d (2 Cal.Jur.2d, Administrative Law, p. 285, \u00a7 172.) Similar conclusions are expressed by other works. (See 2 Am.Jur.2d, Administrative Law, p. 305, \u00a7 496; 73 C.J.S., Public Administrative Bodies and Procedure, p. 480, \u00a7 147.) The problem seems to lie in the varying types of administrative agencies and their procedures, and widespread disagreement whether their decisions are judicial, quasi-judicial, or administrative only. But we find it unnecessary, ourselves, to here attempt to reconcile the divergent authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">It is certain that the doctrine of res judicata is much <em>less </em>freely applied in the area of administrative decisions, than as it relates to determinations of courts of record. It seems profitable to inquire whether treating the subject decision as judicial, rather than as administrative,'the doctrine of res judicata would even then apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">Certain fundamental and essential requirements must be met before the doctrine of res judicata will apply to a judgment. The judgment must have been a <em>final determination (Martin </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>2 Cal.3d 752, 758 [87 Cal.Rptr. 526, 470 P.2d 662]; <em>Goddard </em>v. <em>Security Title Ins. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>14 Cal.2d 47, 51 [92 P.2d 804]; <em>Scheeline </em>v. <em>Moshier, </em>172 Cal. 565, 571 [158 P. 222]; <em>Ball </em>v. <em>Rodgers, </em>187 Cal.App.2d 442, 448 [9 Cal.Rptr. 666]), and it must have been rendered on the <em>merits. (Dillard </em>v. <em>McKnight, </em>34 Cal.2d 209, 214 [209 P.2d 387, 11 A.L.R.2d 835]; <em>Gonsalves </em>v. <em>Bank of America, </em>16 Cal.2d 169, 173 [105 P.2d 118]; <em>Folden </em>v. <em>Lobrovich, </em>153 Cal.App.2d 32, 35 [314 P.2d 56].)</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">As we have pointed out the decision of the Board in <em>Williams\u2019 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>case was that \u201csince said disability has not continued without interruption for one year, the application for disability retirement is denied <em>without prejudice.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) It has repeatedly been held that: \u201cThe term <em>\u2018without prejudice,\u2019 </em>in its general adaptation, means that there is no decision of the controversy on its merits, and leaves the whole subject in litigation as much open to another application as if no suit had ever been brought.\" (Italics added; <em>Chambreau </em>v. <em>Coughlan, </em>263 Cal.App.2d 712, 718 [69 Cal.Rptr. 783]; see also <em>Jones </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, </em>217 Cal.App.2d 153, 157 [31 Cal.Rptr. 761]; <em>Wilkins </em>v. <em>Wilkins, </em>95 Cal.App.2d 611, 613 [213 P.2d 752]; <em>Fleishbein </em>v. <em>Western Auto S. Agency, </em>19 Cal.App.2d 424, 427 [65 P.2d 928].) It has been said that the \u201cpurpose and effect of the words \u2018without prejudice\u2019 in a decree dismissing a bill is to prevent the defendants from availing themselves of the defense of <em>res adjudicate </em>in any subsequent proceeding by the same plaintiffs on the same subject matter.\u201d <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>Schroeder, </em>88 Cal.App. 192, 208 [263 P. 325].)</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">In reason,, we must apply the same criteria to the Board\u2019s decision on Williams\u2019 application. Doing so we must, and do, hold that the Board\u2019s determination was without res judicata effect on Williams\u2019 subsequent application to the city council for \u201cfull pay\u201d under section <em>IQQV2.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">We recognize that although denying Williams\u2019 application without prejudice, the Board nevertheless had made a <em>finding </em>that his disability was duty-incurred.  But findings of themselves are not res judicata as to their content. \u201cThe judgment is the only real conclusion of law and displaces all former statements in the findings on the subject.\u201d <em>(Mason </em>v. <em>Del Valle, </em>213 Cal. 30, 32 [1 P.2d 419].)  \u201cIt is well settled that the findings and conclusions of the court do not have the force and effect of an adjudication where the subject matter is not disposed of by the judgment.\u201d <em>(Guardianship of Leach, </em>30 Cal.2d 297, 310-311 [182 P.2d 529].)</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">For the reasons stated, the superior court\u2019s conclusion of law, and judgment, that decisions and findings of the Board such as were made on Williams\u2019 application, \u201care binding on the Oakland City Council, and its delegated authorities, in any hearings under Sections <em>92\u00bd </em>and <em>100\u00bd </em>of the Oakland City Charter,\u201d was erroneous. The judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">We have, of course, made no determination as to the res judicata effect of final determinations on the merits by the Board. The issue whether the proceedings below were a proper class action becomes moot, and we find it unnecessary to the disposition of the appeal to resolve other points raised by the parties. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>The judgment is reversed; the superior court will enter judgment not inconsistent herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">Molinari, P. J., and Weinberger, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">A petition for a rehearing was denied February 16, 1973, and respondents\u2019 petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied March 29, 1973. Tobriner, J., and Mosk, J., were of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b82-6\"> Assigned by the Chairman of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
