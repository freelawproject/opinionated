Dunnick, tiled his petition in the court of common pleas to recover from Doney the value of real estate described in the petition. He alleged in substance that Dunnick died insolvent, August 11, 1890, that prior to the death of Dunnick while he was so insolvent, Dunnick and' Doney, for the purpose of hindering, delaying and defrauding the creditors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>of the former, entered into an agreement whereby Doney should, through the forms of legal proceedings, enforce a judgment rendered against Dunnick in foreclosure in favor of one Jaeger, that pursuant to said agreement Doney, with moneys furnished him by Dunnick, procured an assign- \u201c ment of said judgment, caused the lands to be sold and himself became the purchaser, agreeing to hold the title thereto for the use and benefit of Dunnick who furnished all the money which Doney paid in the transaction. Prior to the death of Dunnick, in May, 1889, Doney, in violation of said agreement and of the rights of Dunnick\u2019s creditors, sold and conveyed said lands to one Lena G. Miles, under circumstances which gave validity to ' the title acquired by her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-6\">A general demurrer to this petition was overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-7\">In his answer Doney denied the alleged agreement by which he was to hold the title in trust for Dunnick and that the latter furnished any portion of the funds used by him in the transactions mentioned in the petition, and alleged that he purchased the premises in good faith with his own funds and for his own use.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-8\">There was a judgment for the plaintiff for $2,240 and costs. This judgment was af&amp;rm\u00e9d by the circuit court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-9\">The record in the court of common pleas shows that the case was set for trial in one of the civil jury rooms, and that when it was called for trial the defendant moved that it be tried to the court. This motion was allowed, the court holding that neither party was entitled to a jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-10\">On the trial of these issues the defendant, Doney, was called as a witness in his own behalf. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>was permitted to testify in contradiction of a witness who had testified to admissions made by him. Questions were then put to him concerning his transactions with Dunnick, and to elicit his denials of the alleged contract, and to show that Dunnick had not furnished any of the moneys used in making the purchase. On objection by counsel for the administrator, he was not permitted to testify generally or in answer to such questions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b332-5\"><em>J.

The validity of the deed to Doney is impeached by the petition and the question of its validity was the issue made in the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b332-8\">The decree finds that Doney had no interest in the real estate, notwithstanding the deed to him, and the effect of that finding was that his deed was invalid and void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b332-9\">We contend that Doney was a competent witness under the statute as to the transaction between him and Dunnick, which involved the validity of Doney\u2019s deed. Plaintiff offered testimony tending to show that Dunnick furnished the money to purchase the Jaeger judgment, and that judgment was the foundation of Doney\u2019s title, and that was the gist of the whole case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b332-10\">If the case did involve the validity of the deed to Doney and the validity of his title, it is clear that the trial court erred in ruling out the questions before referred to, and that the circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>court erred in holding that Doney was not a competent witness upon that point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b333-6\">When the objection is that the <em>witness- is incompetent </em>to testify, and the objection is sustained, it is not necessary for the party to set out in his bill of exceptions the matters he. expected to prove by the witness. <em>Hollister </em>v. Reznos, 9 Ohio St., 1-7; <em>Wolf v. </em>Powner, 30 Ohio St., 472.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b333-7\">We contend that the petition is insufficient, and that the trial court erred in overruling the demurrer to it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b333-8\">1. The action was brought by Dun nick\u2019s administrator to recover the' value of lands claimed to have been fraudulently conveyed by Dunnick, or through his procurement, to Doney and for the purpose of paying the' debts of the decedent. The transaction between Dunnick and Doney, if fraudulent, cannot be impeached by Dunnick\u2019s administrator, unless the property so transferred by Dunnick is actually required for the payment of his debts. <em>(McCall, Administrator, </em>v. <em>Pixley, </em>48 Ohio St., 379.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b333-9\">This action, if it can be maintained at all, is analogous to. an action brought by the administrator to sell real estate of his decedent for the purpose of paying debts of the estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b333-10\">In this case the action is to recover the value of the real estate, the defendant having sold and transferred it to a third party.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b333-11\">We suppose that it logically results from this view of the court, that the administrator cannot recover the value of the real estate from a fraudulent grantee unless authorized by statute so to do, because in order to a recovery it is necessary to impeach the fraudulent \u25a0 conveyance of his intestate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>2. The petition is defective because it does not state when the debts existing at the death of Dunnick accrued. For anything that the petition shows to the contrary, all of the existing debts may have accrued long after the fraudulent transfer. If the transfer was not with intent to defraud future creditors, there could be no recovery by the administrator, for the purpose of paying debts that accrued after the transfer. <em>Creed </em>v. <em>Lancaster Bank, </em>1 Ohio St., 1; <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>30 Ohio St., 11.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-5\">Subsequent creditors must, generally speaking, elicit facts showing contemplation of future indebtedness. * * A specific intent to defraud subsequent creditors will, of course, avoid the transfer as to them.

Section 6139. There is no provision for recovering the value of the land, where it has passed out of the the hands of fraudulent grantee. It is not alleged in the petition that Lena G. Miles, Doney\u2019s grantee, purchased the property for a valuable consideration, in good faith, and without knowledge of fraud. We think that such averments should have been made. There are averments in the petition from which the fair inference is that Lena G. Miles was not an innocent purchaser. If such was the case, the administrator should have pursued the property, and the court has no authority to render <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>a personal judgment against Doney, for its value.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-6\">We contend that the petition does not, for the reasons above stated, make out a case of a personal judgment against Doney.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-7\">A fraudulent transfer is good against the grantor, his heirs, executors, administrators, etc. Bump Fraudulent Conveyances, p. 444; <em>Crawford </em>v.

Stats. That section relates to the duties and powers of executors and administrators with respect to the sale of lands of decedents for the payment of their debts, and provides: \u201cThe real estate liable to be sold as aforesaid, shall include all that the deceased may have conveyed with intent to defraud his creditors, and all other rights and interests in lands, tenements and hereditaments; provided, that lands so fraudulently conveyed, shall not be taken from anyone who purchased them for a valuable consideration, in good faith, and without knowledge of the fraud; and no claim to lands so fraudulently conveyed shall be made unless within four years next after the decease of the grantor. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Nor can it be doubted that the powers of executors and adminstrators are such only as may be conferred upon them by statute. This, however, does not forbid the application to remedial statutes conferring such power of the familiar rule that, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>the extent which their language will permit, statutes of that character are to receive such construction as will accomplish the apparent object of the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">The course of decisions in this state shows a rigid adherence to the rule\" that a grantor who creates a trust for his own benefit to hinder or delay his creditors cannot maintain any form of action to enforce the trust. The rule results from the turpitude of the transaction. The same rule logically should, and under our authorities does, apply to the administrator of a solvent decedent who, in his lifetime, executed a deed for such fraudulent purpose. The estate being solvent, such suit would, in its substantial aspect, inure to the benefit of the heirs at law of the fraudulent grantor whose rights are not superior to his. <em>McCall, Admr., </em>v. <em>Pixley et al., </em>48 Ohio St., 379.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">But no logical or ethical consideration would justify the extension of that rule to the defrauded creditors of the grantor or to any one standing in their rights. .They are in no sense <em>participes oriminis. </em>Accordingly we have express provisions of statutes authorizing suits to subject property so conveyed to the payment of the grantor\u2019s debts. Such suit may be brought by the creditor, or by the assignee of the grantor for the benefit of . creditors, or by the administrator under the section quoted. In none of these statutes is there express authority for an action against the fraudulent grantee for the value of the lands when the rights of a <em>bona ficle </em>purchaser intervene. But that such action may be maintained by the proper party seems clear on both reason and authority. Although the trust which the parties attempt to establish by their contract is void, the property in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>the hands of the fraudulent grantee is, by the terms of the statute, impressed with a valid trust in favor of the grantor\u2019s creditors. It may be that the fraudulent grantee is required only to surrender the land so held, but when by his own act he has made that impossible there attaches the usual incident of a personal liability for the value of the subject of the trust. Wait on Fraudulent Conveyances, section 177; <em>Solinsky </em>v. <em>The </em>Bank, 85 Tenn., 368; <em>Chamberlin </em>v. <em>Jones et </em>al., 114 Ind., 458; <em>Mason, Admr., </em>v. Pierron, 69 Wis., 585; <em>Post </em>v. Stiger, 29 <em>N. </em>J. Eq., 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">. It is true that upon the subject of the right of the administrator to maintain anaction for the recovery of property fraudulently transferred by his decedent the decisions in other states are not uniform. The decisions have been much influenced by statutory provi sions. Where the administrator is regarded as succeeding only to the rights of his decedent a recovery has, of course, been denied. Where he is regarded as standing in the rights of creditors also, it has been allowed. Here in veiw of the insolvency of the estate, and the provisions of the statute, the administrator asserts the rights of creditors. This sufficiently distinguishes the case under consideration from <em>Benjamin </em>v. <em>Le Baron's admr, </em>15 Ohio, 518, which related to personal property and was not influenced by such statutory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">In answer to the observations of counsel as to the statute of limitations, it is sufficient to say that the special limitation prescribed in the section under consideration is exclusive. It limits the action to four years after the decease of grantor. The present action was brought within less than two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>The common pleas court did not err in overruling the demurrer to the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">This was an action for the recovery of money only. In view of the fact that the fraudulent grantee had conveyed a valid title to the subject of the trust no decree in equity was needed or sought. Although the principles upon which a recovery was sought may be of equitable cognizance, either party is entitled, in an action for the recovery of money only, to have the issues determined by a jury. The erroneous ruling of the trial court to the contrary is, however, not aground of reversal since it was made at the instance of the party who complains of the final judgment there rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">The question yet to be considered relates to the ruling of the trial court that the defendant is not, in a case of this character, competent to testify generally. The general rule prescribed by section 5242 of the Rev. Stat., would sustain that ruling because the plaintiff is an administrator. But the last paragraph of the section contains the following: \u2018\u2018Nothing in this section contained shall apply to * * actions or proceedings involving the validity of a deed. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">The foundation of this action is the invalidity of the deed to Doney. If the apparent title had remained in him the appropriate remedy would have been a decree to subject the lands conveyed. In a suit for that purpose, it is conceded, the grantee would have been competent to testify generally. The difference in the form of the action and the remedy results from the voluntary act of the fraudulent grantee in divesting himself of such title. No reason is suggested why the defendant should be competent in one form of action and not in the other, nor do the terms of the ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>eeption restrict it to suits to set aside deeds or to subject lands fraudulently conveyed by the testator. Neither action could be sustained if the deed were valid to convey an absolute title according' to its purport. The action, therefore, involves the validity of a deed, and it is within both the letter and the reason of the exception. It follows that in actions of this character the defendant is within the general rule of competency prescribed by section 5240 of the Rev. Stat.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">\n<em>For error in excluding the testimony of the plaintiff in error the judgments of the circuit court and the court of common pleas are reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
