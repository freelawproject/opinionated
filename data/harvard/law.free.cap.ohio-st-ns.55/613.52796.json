Wyoming, 49 Ohio St., 202; <em>Bronson </em>v. <em>Oberlin, </em>41 Ohio St., 481; <em>Commissioners </em>v. <em>Rosch eBros., </em>50 Ohio St., 103; City <em>of Fenton </em>v. <em>State ex rel. </em>52 Ohio St., 59.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b652-10\">The rule prescribed by section'2 of Art. XII, of the constitution, by implication furnishes the governing principle as to equality and uniformity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>of taxation. <em>City of Zanesville </em>v. <em>Auditor, </em>5 Ohio St., 592.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b653-4\">Irrespective of constitutional limitation, taxes must be uniform or equal on .the same class of property or privileges. <em>Loan Assoc. </em>v.

Any other exaction does not come within the legal definition of a tax. Cooley\u2019s Const. Lim., 6th ed., 598, 607, 608, 615; Dillon on Municipal Corp., section 736; Desty on Taxation, section 10; Cooly on Taxation, 2d ed., p. 54; <em>People </em>v. <em>Salem, </em>20 Mich., 452; <em>Albany Bank </em>v. <em>Maher, </em>9 Fed. Rep., 884.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b653-7\">It' has been said that no comprehensive statement of what constitutes a valid classification is to be found in any one reported case, though they all agree that it must not be arbitrary. But an effort has been made to embody such statement in five rules, all of which are supported by judicial decisions, though some authorities rely more exclusively upon one ground, and others upon' another. These rules are as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b653-8\">1. All classification must be based upon substantial distinctions, which make one class really different from another. \u2022</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b654-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>2. The classification adopted in any law must be germane to the purpose of the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b654-5\">3. Classification must not be based upon existing circumstances only, or those of limited duration, except where the object of the law is itself a temporary one.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b654-6\">4. To whatever class a law may apply, it must apply equally to each member thereof.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b654-7\">5. If the classification be valid, the number of members in a class is wholly immaterial. <em>State </em>v. Hammer, 42 N. J. L., 436; <em>Commissioners of Hamilton Co. </em>v. <em>Rosche Bros., </em>50 Ohio St., 103; <em>State </em>v. <em>Cal. Min. Co., </em>15 Nev., 234; <em>State </em>v. <em>Judges, </em>21 Ohio St., 1; <em>State </em>v. <em>Covington, </em>29 Ohio St., 102; <em>McGill </em>v. <em>State, </em>34 Ohio St., 228; <em>State </em>v. <em>Shearer, </em>47 Ohio St., 275; <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Hyde, </em>37 Cal., 366; <em>McCormick </em>v. <em>Busch, </em>15 Iowa, 127; <em>Randolph </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>49 N. J. L., 85; <em>Dundee Mortgage Co. </em>v. <em>School District, </em>10 Sawy., 52; <em>People Cent. Pac. Ry. Co., </em>83 Cal., 393.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b654-8\">All authorities agree that the class to which the general laws' are applicable must be real and substantial, and the following description of a general law as contra-distinguished from a special or local law, has been deduced from the authorities:</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b654-9\">1. ' A g\u2019eneral law is one which applies to and operates uniformly upon all members of any class of persons, .places or things, requiring legislation peculiar to itself'in the matter covered by the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b654-10\">2. A special law is one which relates either to particular persons, places or things, or to persons, places or thing\u2019s which, though not particularized, are separated, by any method of selection, from the whole class to which the law might, but for such limitation, be applicable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b655-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>3. A local law is one whose operation is confined within territorial limits other than those of the whole state or any properly constituted class of localities therein.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b655-6\">It does not make an act the less local or special that its operation is general as far as it goes, nor because it applies to many persons or things. If the persons or things be regarded by the law as individuals, be they few or many, this stamps it as special. <em>Topeka </em>v. <em>Gillett, </em>32 Kan., 431; <em>Miller </em>v. People, 100 Mo., 439; <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Walter, </em>37 Minn., 264; <em>Home Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>People of New York State, </em>134 U. S., 594.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b655-7\">Uniformity in taxation requires uniformity in the mode of assessment, as well as in the rate of percentage charged. <em>County of Santa Clara </em>v. <em>Southern Pac. R. Co., </em>18 Fed. Rep., 385; 13 Fed. Rep., 722; <em>Northern Pac. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>47 Fed. Rep., 681; <em>Strode </em>v. <em>Com., </em>52 Pa. S., 181; Mixter\u2019s Estate, 10 Pa. Co. Ct. Rep., 409.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b655-8\">But, if it be held that the distinction may be made between collateral kindred on the one hand, and kindred in the direct line on the other, in reference to the assessment of such a tax, by exempting the kindred in the direct line, upon the ground that such a distinction has a sanction in reason, on the theory that the moral claim of collaterals is less than that of kindred in the direct line, and the privilege therefore greater, as held, in <em>Minot </em>v. <em>Winthrop, </em>162 Mass., 116, the exemption or discrimination ceases when the reason of the distinction ceases; and, therefore, a succession tax upon collateral kindred must include all collateral kindred. If any of such kindred can be ex\u00e9mpted, then all of them except those of a single particular degree of relationship may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>exempted. Exemption of persons of a class taxed, produces inequality. Cooley on Taxation, 128.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b656-5\">It is peculiarly a province of the court to determine that such unreasonable exemptions cannot stand. <em>Ry. Co. </em>v. Minnesota, 134 U. S., 418; <em>Reagan </em>v. <em>Trust Co.. </em>154 U. S., 362.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b656-6\">Under this constitutional provision, a law which applies to an individual, or to a number of individuals selected out of a class to which they belong, is a special law. <em>State </em>v. <em>California Min. Co.. </em>15 Nev.. 234; <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Hyde. </em>37 Cal., 366; <em>People </em>v. <em>Judges. </em>17 Cal., 547; <em>Ewing </em>v. Hoblitzell, 85 Mo., 64; <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Philadelphia, 777 </em>Pa., 338; <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Railway </em>Co., 86 Mo., 540; <em>McAunich </em>v. <em>Railroad Co.. </em>20 Iowa, 338; <em>State </em>v. Mitchell, 31 Ohio St., 592; <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilcox, </em>45 Mo., 458.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b656-7\">If the exemptions are invalid, the whole act must fail. Virginia Coupon Cases, 114 U. S., 270; <em>Baldwin </em>v. <em>Franks. </em>120 U. S., 678; <em>California </em>v. <em>Pacific R. R. </em>Co., 127 U. S., 1; <em>Spraigue </em>v. Thompson, 118 U.

Singer, 15 Wall., 111; <em>Township </em>v. Talcott, 19 Wall., 666.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b656-8\">Moreover, the act authorizes a tax to be collected on the estate of a decedent situated in several counties, for the use and benefit of only the county in which the estate is probated. This question was not decided in the Ferris case. The burden of a tax must be made to rest upon the state at large, or upon any particular district of the state, according as the purpose for which it is levied is of general concern to the whole state, or, on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>other hand, pertains only to the particular district. Cooley on Taxation, 105. It is therefore, a general tax for state purposes, and not at all a local tax for local objects. <em>State ex rel. </em>v. Auditor, 15 Ohio St., 482; Revised Statutes, sections, 236, 2820, 3951, 10116, 181a, 2834, 2822, 2823, 2824, 2826, 2827.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b657-4\"><em>Joseph H. </em>Dyer., Prosecuting Attorney and <em>Henry A. </em>Williams, First Assistant Pros. Atty., for defendant in'error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b657-5\"><em>First </em>\u2014 By a comparison of the language used in the law passed taxing direct inheritances in this state (91 O. L., 166), and the law in question in this case, taxing collateral inheritances, it will be found that the exact language is used in both, with the exception that in the law under discussion, the features are absent, which were declared as being obnoxious to the constitutional provisions by this court in the case of <em>State ex rel </em>v. <em>Ferris </em>(53 O. S., 314).</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b657-6\">This court in the Ferris ease reached the conclusion that the direct inheritance act was intended by the legislature to be a tax upon the right or privilege to receive property and not a tax upon the property itself, and as a result of that conclusion held to be constitutional all the provisions of the law sought to be assailed upon the ground that it was a tax on property..</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b657-7\"><em>Second </em>\u2014 It was next urged that this law was unconstitutional for the reason that it. was an attempt to impose a tax upon the right or privilege to receive property, for general revenue purposes \u2022 only, and that therefore it was in conflict with section 2 of article 12 of the constitution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b658-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>It was urged in that case, as in this, that the law was unconstitutional, for the reason that it was in conflict with section 26 of article 2 of the constitution. The court does not discuss this question at length, .but simply cites the case of <em>The State v. Nelson </em>(52 O. S., p. 88): and this, for the reason that through a long line of decisions, whenever this section of the constitution has been questioned, this court has uniformly held that a law was of a general nature when the subject matter of the law was general jn application, and that its operation was uniform when all persons in all parts of the state affected by it, were not exempt from its operation. This is substantially the definition given in the case of <em>Heck </em>v. <em>The State, </em>44 Ohio St., 536; <em>Adler </em>v. <em>Whitbeck, </em>44 Ohio St., 539; <em>Driggs </em>v. <em>State, 52 </em>Ohio St., 37.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b658-5\">We thereto re conclude that this feature of the case is perfectly secure under the former decisions of this court from the objection made as to its being unconstitutional on account of being in conflict with section 26 of article 2.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b658-6\"><em>Third </em>\u2014 The only remaining question to consider is the one upon which this court declared the direct inheritance tax law unconstitutional, and that was for the reason that section 1 of that act was in conflict with section 2 of the bill of rights which provides that \u201cAll political power is inherent in the people. Government is instituted for their equal protection and benefit.\u201d (53 Ohio St., 314, 336.) The graduated scale of assessing taxes and also the exemption of the first twenty thousand dollars was held to be not for the equal protection and benefit of all the people upon whom this law operated, and therefore the law was not upheld. These two particular features are absent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>from the act under discussion, and in place of the graduated scale, the legislature substituted a tax of five per centum of the value of said estate, and substituted in place of the exemption of the first twenty thousand dollars, the exemption of the first two hundred dollars, which is the constitutional exemption allowed to all persons in the state. (Article 12, section 2.) It is only the property that passes to such collateral heirs, or to a stranger that is taxed, that this property, is to be divided only after administration on the estate. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hamlin, Exr., </em>86 Me., 496; <em>Scholey </em>v. <em>Rew, </em>23 Wall., 331; <em>State </em>v. <em>Telegraph Co.; Brewer Brick Co. </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>62 Me., 74; 2 Blackstone, Com., 10, 11, 12, 13, 515; <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>2 P.

That all the property within the jurisdiction of this state, and any interest therein, whether belonging to inhabitants of this state or not, . and whether tangible or intangible, which shall pass by will or by the inter-state laws of this state, or by deed, grant, sale or gift made or in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>tended to take effect in possesion or enjoyment after the death of the grantor, to any person in trust or otherwise, other than to or for the use of the father, mother, husband, wife, brother, sister, niece, nephew, lineal descendant, adopted child, or person recognized as an adopted child, and made a legal heir under the provisions of section 4182 of the Revised Statutes of Ohio, or the lineal descendant thereof, or the lineal descendant of any adopted child, the wife or widow of a son, the husband of the daughter of the decedent, shall be liable to a tax of five per centum of its value, above the sum of two hundred dollars, seventy-five per centum of such tax to be for the use of the state, and twenty-five per centum for the use of the county wherein the same is collected and all administrators, executors and trustees, and any such grantee under the conveyance made during the grantor\u2019s life, shall be liable for all such taxes, with lawful interest as hereinafter provided, until the same shall have been paid as herein after directed. Such taxes shall become due and payable immediately upon the death of the decedent, and shall at once become a lien upon said property, and be and remain a lien until paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Most of the objections urged against the validity of the act are answered in <em>State ex rel </em>v. Ferris, 53 Ohio St., 314. The act there held invalid made an inhibited distinction as to the value of the property received, the right to receive being there, as here, the real subject of the imposition. No such distinction appears in this act, which lays a uniform tax upon the reception of all amounts above 4 two hundred dollars, and that exemption is expressly authorized by the constitution in the levying of taxes upon property.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>This act* is said to be invalid because of its discriminations among the collateral kindred, the tax being imposed upon the value of the property-received by some and not upon that received by others. rI he power exercised by the general assembly in this instance is legislative and vested by the first section of the second article of the constitution. Since the right to receive property by inheritance is not guaranteed by the constitution, it prescribes no limitation upon the power of the general assembly to designate the persons who may thus receive. The discrimination is based upon, and justified by, the fact that there are degrees in collateral kinship.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">It is further objected that the act is invalid because the provision that all property \u201cwhich shall pass by will * * * sale or gift\u201d shall be subject to the imposition, invades the owner\u2019s guaranteed right to sell and convey property, which right is embraced within its enjoyment. But the meaning of the word \u201csale,\u201d as used in the statute, is to be determined by the maxim <em>noscitnr a sociis, </em>and it includes only transactions which, though, in form sales, are in fact gifts. Since the act is within the legislative power granted, and not within the letter or spirit of any limitation hereon, it is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">The conclusion of the circuit court is well sustained by its opinion in the ease. 12 C. <em>C. </em>R., 606.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
