Stiles and Abram Stiles, brothers, who were clothing merchants, having a store in the village of Ashley, in Delaware county, where they carried on business as partners under the name of the \u201cAshley Clothing Company,\u201d and another store in the village of Cardington, in Morrow county, where they carried on a like business under the partnership name of \u201cThe Carding-ton Clothing Company. \u201d Becoming involved and unable to meet their debts, judgments were obtained against them by a large number of their creditors, executions were issued on these judgments, and the fund in question is the proceeds of the sale of the property in the two stores, seized on these writs. The controversy relates to the order in which distribution shall be made of the fund among the creditors.- The first judgments obtained, were two recovered by the First National Bank of Cardington, in the court of common pleas of Ashland county, at its September term, 1893. They were so obtained on the 20th day of September, 1893, on notes signed by George P. Stiles, and Abram Stiles, with warrants of attorney attached, upon which the judgments were taken by confession. On the same day that these two judgments were recovered, executions were. issued on them to the sheriffs of Delaware and Morrow counties, respectively, who, on the same day, levied the writs on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>stock of goods in their respective counties. These were the first levies on the property. On the next day, September 21, 1893, the same bank obtained two judgments in the court of common pleas of Franklin comrty, upon notes executed by George P. Stiles and Abram Stiles, and on that day caused executions issued on them to be levied on the same property; and on that day, Sperry &amp; Wormstaff also recovered a judgment in the same court, against the /same defendants, on notes executed in the same way, and caused an execution issued thereon to be levied on the same property, on the same day. These three levies were the next in point of time. All of these judgments weie rendered against George P. Stiles and Abram Stiles, without any mention of a partnership existing between them, but upon indebtedness contracted in the business and for the benefit of the firm, and on its credit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-5\">On the 23rd day of September, 1893, in the court of common pleas of Ashland county, which was during its' September term of that year, other creditors who are plaintiffs in error here, recovered judgments against George P. Stiles and Abram Stiles, described as partners, and on the same day caused executions issued on their respective judgments to be levied on the same property that was taken on the executions issued on the judgments recovered in that court by the bank; and these levies were the next or third in point of time. These judgments of the plaintiffs in error exceed in the aggregate the sum of $7,000.00.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-6\">Afterward, but still at the Septemer term, 1893, of the court of common pleas of Franklin county, others of the plaintiffs in error, creditors of the Stiles Brothers, recovered judgments in that court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>and caused executions to be issued thereon and levied on the same property, during that term of the court. These were fourth in point of time, and amount to a large sum.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-6\">The property was sold, producing a fund amounting to $6,996.27, which, by agreement of all parties, was paid over to the clerk of Franklin county for distribution, as might be ordered by the court. Whereupon the First National Bank of Cardington filed its petition in the court of common pleas of Franklin county, to marshal the liens, and bring about a distribution of the fund according to the rights of the parties, making all the creditors who caused executions to be levied on the property, parties to the action. The case went to the circuit court on appeal, and was there submitted upon an agreed statement of facts, which, so far as they are deemed material, are substantially as above set forth; and upon these facts that court ordered distribution to be made of the fund as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-7\"><em>\u201cFirst </em>\u2014 To the payment of the costs of this suit, and the costs on the order of sale in the case of Oppenheimer, Strauss &amp;Co., amounting to the sum of \u00a7372.46.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-8\"><em>\u201cSecond </em>\u2014 To the plaintiff, the amount of its said four several judgments and \u2022 costs, amounting in the aggregate to the sum of $3,895.00.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-9\"><em>\u201cTImxl </em>\u2014 To Sperry &amp; Wormstaff, the amount of their said judgment and costs, $566.50.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-10\"><em>\u201cFourth </em>\u2014 That the balance of said fund, being found insufficient to pay the remaining judgments in full, be distributed <em>pro rata </em>among the defendants who recovered judgments in the Ashland common pleas, on the 22nd day of September, 1893, the said pro <em>rata </em>amounts being as follows, to wit: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>To Lewis Meier &amp; Co., the sum of $66.26; E.

That doctrine seems to us absurd, and the claim wholly without merit. It was conceded that neither of the partners had any individual property; no election can be had without an intent; the levy was made upon partnership property the same day the judgments were taken, which certainly shows a disposition to make the judgments out of the partnership property. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>That it is not an election, <em>Trowbridge </em>v.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEt\">The plaintiffs in error contend that distribution according to the judgment of the circuit court is erroneous: (1) In directing payment of any part of the fund to the defendants in error, the First National Bank of Carding-ton, and Sperry and Wonnstaff; or if not to that extent, then (2) in awarding them the full amount of their judgments out of the fund in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">1. It is contended that the above named defendants in error, are not entitled to any share of the fund, because the notes upon which their judgments were recovered were executed in the individual names of the makers, George P. Stiles and Abram Stiles, without subscribing the- firm name, or otherwise indicating the existence of any partnership relation between them, or intention to bind the firm; and the judgments were rendered in the same way; from which it is argued that these defendants in error must be treated as the individual creditors of George P. and Abram Stiles, and excluded from participation in the fund, under the familiar rule which gives firm creditors of an insolvent partner<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>ship priority, in the distribution of the firm, effects, over the individual creditors of its members. It is conceded, however, that the notes were given in partnership transactions, with the intention of binding the firm, and for considerations which went to its benefit; and it seems indisputable that they created partnership obligations. It is well settled that a partnership debt may be created by the execution of a note by all of the members of a firm, as fully as by one member subscribing the partnership name. Chitty on Bills, pp. 52, 53; <em>Woolen Company </em>v. Juillard, 75 N. Y., 535; <em>Mix </em>v. Shattuck, 50 Vt., 421; <em>Austin </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>2 Ohio 61. The adoption of a firm name is largely for convenience in making contracts binding on all the members by its use, thus obviating the necessity of securing the individual assent of, and execution by each of the partners, which, when the members are numerous might not only be inconvenient, but sometimes impracticable.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">But, it is contended that, as the individual \u25a0creditors have priority of right to the individual property of the partners, as against the partnership creditors, the former cannot, at the same time, be allowed the advantages, of partnership creditors, and be thus enabled to share equally with creditors of both classes; and that by putting their notes in judgment against George P. Stiles and Abram Stiles, without any designation of their partnership character, or reference to their partnership relation, the Bank and Sperry &amp; Wormstaff have conclusively elected to stand as individual, and not as partnership creditors. It is not claimed that they have sought satisfaction of their judgments out of any individual property of the partners, nor that there is, or was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>any property of that kind which could be reached. The judgments follow the notes, and rendering-judgments in that form did not extinguish the character of the not\u00e9s as partnership obligations, nor defeat their legal effect as such. Courts of equity look behind the forms of judgments and inquire into the nature of the demands on which they are founded, and the relations of the parties, when necessary to the preservation of equitable rights; so that, if from the form of the notes as executed, a presumption should arise that they were intended to create an individual obligation of the makers, and nothing more, such presumption is not conclusive, but it may nevertheless be shown that they were in fact given for considerations which went to the use of the firm, and which were parted with on its credit, and thus show that they represent partnership debts; and there can be no reason why that may not be done after judgment rendered on them., as well as before, especially as against other creditors, in a proceeding in equity involving the right, as between the creditors, of participation in a fund produced by the partnership property. The rights of the creditors, on that state of facts, against the firm, are in no respect different from what they would be if the firm name were attached to the notes; and an execution upon the judgments must, therefore; be as available against the partnership property. Whether, if the members of this firm were possessed of individual estates which these defendants in error were endeavoring- to have applied to the satisfaction of their judgments, they would be denied participation in the partnership effects, or put to an election as to the fund they would pursue, is a question not presented; there is nothing in the case to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>indicate an intention on their part to seek satisfaction of their judgments out of any individual estate of either of the partners, or abandon any rights against the partnership effects; on the contrary, their proceedings on their judgments were promptly and exclusively against the partnership property, and on those of the Bank, prior in order of time to any lien acquired by any other creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">2. The -method of making- distribution among the execution creditors entitled to share in the fund is controlled by section 5382, of the Revised Statutes, which provides that:</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">\u201cWhen two or more writs of execution against the same debtor are sued out during the term in which judgment was rendered, or within ten days thereafter, and when two or more writs of execution against the same debtor are delivered to the officer on the same day, no preference shall be given to either of such writs; but if a sufficient sum of money be not made to satisfy all executions, the amount shall be distributed to the several creditors in proportion to the amount of their respective demands; in all other cases the writ of execution first delivered to the officer shall be first satisfied; and the officer shall indorse on every writ of execution the time when he received the same; but nothing herein contained shall be so construed as to affect any preferable lien which a judgment on which execution issued has bn the lands of the judgment debtor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">The general rule established by that section is, that as between execution levies, that of the writ first delivered to the officer shall have priority; and subsequent levies shall have precedence in the order in which the writs are received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>by the officer. This is in accordance with the general principle which accords the preference to the diligent creditor, over one less diligent. But to this general rule the statute has prescribed two qualifications; one is to the effect that there shall be no priority as between executions sued out during the term of the court in which the judgments are rendered or within ten days after the term; and the other applies the same rule of equality as between all executions that are delivered to the officer on the1 same day. The first of these qualifications governs the ease before us; and it is clear the equality of right as between the executions there referred to, relates to those issued on judgments rendered in the same court and at the same term. Executions issued from different courts, though on judgments rendered at the same time, and during corresponding terms, do not come within the provision, but take priority,as between each other, from the time of their delivery to the officer. But when several executions issued on judgments rendered in the same court and \u25a0at the same term are delivered to the officer during-that term, or within ten days thereafter, they are, by the express terms of the statute, made equal in right, and that equality is not disturbed by the intervention between the judgments or levies of another lien which becomes superior to the judgments or levies that are subsequent thereto. The statue makes no exception to the rule it prescribes with respect to such executions, on account of intervening, liens, but includes all executions against the same debtor sued out and delivered to the officer at the term of the rendition of the judgment, or within the designated time thereafter; and in plain and unequivocal terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>forbids any preference between them on any account, and distinctly requires that, if a sufficient amount is not made to satisfy all the writs, it shall be distributed to the execution creditors in proportion to the amounts of their several demands. When different creditors place executions in the hands of the officer on the same day, the last one doing so is not regarded as so lacking in diligence as to postpone his writ until the first one delivered to the officer shall be satisfied; and there is no manifest impropriety in extending the same rule of equality to creditors who recover judgments against the same debtor at the same term of court and cause executions to be issued thereon and levied during the term, or within a short time thereafter. A similar rule has been adopted by another provision of the statute which denies priority to liens obtained by filing transcripts of justices\u2019 judgments with the clerk of the court during vacation, over judgments rendered at the next ensuing term. Revised Statutes, section 5377. <em>Babbett </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>31 Ohio St., 273. A like principle is also adopted in that provision of the statute which makes judgments recovered at the same term of the court equal as liens on the debtors real estate situated in the county where the judgment is rendered. The race between creditor\u2019s generally begins with the apparent or actual insolvency of the debtor; and when several judgments are procured at the same term of the court, followed by executions, the insolvency of the debtor is usually obvious or rapidly approaching; and in such case, equality among creditors of equal merit works no injustice. But whatever may have been the reason for the adoption of the statutory provision under consideration, the courts are not at liberty to disre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>gard it; and when applied to the case in hand, it requi res a distribution of the fund involved, different from that ordered by the judgment below. That distribution should be as follows: After the payment of the costs of the action in the courts below, and the costs of the sale, as ascertained by the circuit court, there should first be set aside out of the fund, the amount of the two executions issued on the judgments recovered by the Oardington Bank in the Ashland county common pleas on the 20th day of September, 1893; those executions being the first levied, and superior in right to the executions issued from Franklin county and levied the next day. Next, there should be deducted from the remainder of the fund, the amount of the executions issued on the judgments recovered by the Bank, and Sperry &amp; WormstafE, in the Franklin county common pleas on the 21st day of September, 1893; they being superior in right to the executions sued out on the judgments rendered on the following day in the Ashland county common pleas, in favor of the plaintiffs in error. This amount should be set aside for distribution as hereafter directed. The balance of the fund then remaining being insufficient to satisfy the executions of the plaintiff in error, issued on their judgments recovered in the Ashland county common pleas, which are next in order of priority, must be added to the amount set aside for the two Ashland county executions of the Bank, and the aggregate amount they produce applied toward the satisfaction of all these Ashland county executions, in proportion to their respective amounts; and the amounts set aside for the Franklin county executions of the Bank and Sperry &amp; WormstafE, must be distributed in like proportions among all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>the executions that were sued out on judgments rendered at the same term of the court of common pleas of that county, and levied during that term. This distribution is in accordance with the rule laid down in <em>Babbitt </em>v. Morgan, <em>supra, </em>and with a recent decision of this court in the unreported case of the <em>Carriage Company </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>from Licking county. The judgment of the circuit court must therefore be reversed, and judgment rendered for the plaintiffs in error, in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\"><em>Judgment </em>accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
