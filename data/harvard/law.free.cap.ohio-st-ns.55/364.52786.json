The edition of the book in use when the act above referred to was passed, and when it took effect, was the edition of 1880. The drug sold by the accused was equal to the standard of strength, quality and purity laid down in that edition. In 1890, the book was revised by an association or cong\u2019ress of pharmacists of the United States and Canada, A new and revised edition known as the edition of 1890, was published in 1893, which purports to be official from January 1, 1894. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>edition made numerous changes in that of 1880J among others, raising the standard of cochineal, so that the article sold by the accused was inferior to that standard; and being so, the state claimed the sale was in violation of the statute. On the trial the state was permitted, over the objection of the accused, to give in evidence a copy of the edition of the Pharmacopoeia published in 1893; and for the admission of that evidence, the court of common pleas reversed the sentence passed on the accused, he having\u2019 been convicted before the justice. To this action of the court the prosecuting attorney took the bill of exceptions which is now submitted to the court, according to the provisions of sections 7305 and 7306 of the Revised Statutes.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b402-5\"><em>F.

The book might have been compiled and published by ignorant or vicious persons. Mistakes might have occurred, and for all we know have occurred, in the 1890 edition, and yet it was sought to convict this defendant in error under the penal laws of this state for violating the provisions of the Pharmacopoeia of 1890, which was not in existence at the time the statute was passed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-8\">It certainly is not necessary to cite authorities to the proposition that the power delegated to the legislature of Ohio to enact laws cannot be delegated by that body to any other person or association.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-9\">Article II, section 1 of the Ohio Constitution. Section 26 of the same article; <em>Railroad </em>v. <em>Commissioners, </em>1 Ohio St., 77; <em>O'Neil et al. </em>v. <em>American Ins. Co., </em>166 Pa. St., 72; <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Manchester Fire Ins. Co., </em>63 N. W. Rep., 241.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>If the courts hold that the legislature has no power to delegate authority such as that specified in the above cases to state officials, how much less can the legislature delegate power to irresponsible bodies, conventions and congresses not held under authority of the state, or indeed of any state or of the United States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-6\">The construction of this law, contended for on behalf of the state, would render it unconstitutional.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-7\">The law is constitutional if given the construction contended for by the defendant in error below, namely that the edition of the Pharmacopoeia which was in existence at the time the law was passed is the edition upon which the prosecution must rely.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-8\">If the legislature desires to adopt the new Pharmacopoeia as the standard it is only necessary for it to amend the law and so state. This it will no doubt do if there is any good reason for doing so. Until it does so the edition of 1880 is the only Pharmacopoeia which can be introduced in evidence in prosecutions in this class of cases.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b405-9\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">The reference in the statute to the United States Pharmacopoeia, could be to no other than the edition of the book in use and recognized when the statute was enacted and went into effect, which was the edition known as that of 1880. It is not to be supposed that the legislature intended to adopt, by reference, as part of the penal laws of the state, an edition of the book not then in existence, and of the contents of which the legislature could then have no knowledge. The drug, with the sale of which the accused was charged, was recognized in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>the edition of 1880, by the name under which it was sold, and a standard of strength, quality and purity therein laid down. It is not claimed the drug sold was below that standard; and the sale could' not be rendered unlawful because it is below a higher standard laid down in a subsequently revised edition of the book, though that edition' was in use at the time of the sale. To hold that the sale could thus be made unlawful, would be equivalent to holding that the revisers of the book could create and define the offense, a power which belongs to the legislative body, and cannot be delegated.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
