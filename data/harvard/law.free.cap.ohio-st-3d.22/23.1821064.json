We hold that the issue was properly submitted, and thus we affirm the election validation.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-19\">The sole contention of appellants is that the beer-sale issue was required to be submitted on a separate ballot, and that failure to do so invalidates the election. This contention has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-20\">R.C. 4305.14<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sets forth the legal requirements for a local option elec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>tion dealing with the sale of beer. There is no requirement in the statute to the effect that the issue must be submitted on a separate ballot. Certain required procedures are detailed in the statute, but ballot segregation is not included therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">R.C. 4301.35<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> prescribes the procedure for elections involving wine, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>mixed beverages, and/or spirituous liquor. This statute does require that these issues be submitted on separate ballot, to be segregated from any other issues to be decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">The ballot submitted in Clay Township on November 6,1984 combined the beer-sale issue with the four questions presented under R.C. 4301.35. However, the only election being contested is the beer-sale election. Since there is no statutory requirement of segregation as to the beer sale issue, the election must stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Accordingly, we- affirm the judgment of the court of common pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b57-7\">Celebrezze, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, C.
