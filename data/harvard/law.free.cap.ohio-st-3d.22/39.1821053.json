Upon review of the record, we concur with the findings and conclusions of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">It is clear that respondent received insurance proceeds belonging to his client, maintained these funds in an inappropriate fashion, and failed to deliver the funds in a timely manner. Respondent violated DR 9-102(A) by failing to preserve the identity of the funds and property of a client; violated DR 9-102(B)(l) by failing to promptly notify the client of receipt of funds; and violated DR 9-102(B)(4) by failing to promptly pay or deliver client funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">Additionally, we find that respondent failed to cooperate with the investigation as required by Gov. Bar R. V(4) and DR 1-102(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">Lastly, respondent did not timely register with the Clerk of the Supreme Court as a practicing attorney as required by Gov. Bar R. VI(1) and is thereby subject to discipline pursuant to Gov. Bar R. VI(6) and V.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-11\">We agree with the recommendation of the board that the appropriate sanction for respondent\u2019s conduct is an indefinite suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-12\">Accordingly, we adopt the findings, conclusions and recommendation of the board and hereby suspend respondent from the practice of law for an indefinite period.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-13\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b73-14\">Celebrezze, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, C.
