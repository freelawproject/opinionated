For the reasons to follow we hold that the adopted children may not inherit where the express intention of the testator is otherwise and, accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">Ordinarily R.C. 3107.15(A)(2) places adopted children on the same footing as natural children:</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">\u201cTo. create the relationship of parent and children * * * as if the adopted person were a legitimate blood descendant of the petitioner, for all purposes including inheritance and applicability of statutes, documents, and instruments, whether executed before or after the adoption is decreed, <em>which do not expressly exclude an adopted person from their operation or effect. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">As the last portion of the section indicates, however, the status of adopted children is not unequivocal in those instances where exclusion is express.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">While conceding that in 1925, when the will was executed, the term \u201cheirs of the body\u201d was commonly used to exclude adopted children, the court of appeals was singularly reluctant to accept the trial court\u2019s conclusions. Rather, the court of appeals analogized from <em>Tiedtke </em>v. <em>Tiedtke </em>(1952), 157 Ohio St. 554 [47 O.O. 411], wherein this court held in paragraph two of the syllabus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-12\">\u201cWhere, in providing for his \u2018heirs at law\u2019 after a life interest, a testator indicates his intention that such heirs should be determined at the date of the expiration of such life interest, then the statutory law in effect at the expiration of such life interest should be applied in determining such heirs of the testator unless by the provisions of the will or surrounding circumstances a contrary intention is indicated, even though such statutory law will permit an adopted child of the testator\u2019s daughter to take and the statutory law in effect at the testator\u2019s death would not have permitted such adopted child to take and even though such adopted child was not either born or adopted until long after the testator\u2019s death.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-13\">The court of appeals reasoned that \u201cheirs\u201d or \u201cheirs at law\u201d are indistinguishable from \u201cheirs of the body.\u201d This reasoning was applied notwithstanding G. C. 8030, in effect when the will was executed (109 Ohio Laws 179, 180), which expressly indicated that an adopted child \u201c* * * <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>shall not be capable of inheriting property expressly limited to the <em>heirs of the body </em>of the adopting parent or parents.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We decline to adopt the court of appeals\u2019 view.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">In <em>Alley </em>v. <em>Strickland </em>(1983), 279 S.C. 126, 302 S.E. 2d 866, the Supreme Court of South Carolina, under a statute wherein \u201can adopted child\u201d is \u201cconsidered a natural child of the adopting parents for all inheritance purposes * * *,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 127, held that a distinction had to be made between such terms as \u201cheirs,\u201d predicated upon the statutes of descent and distribution, and \u201cheirs of the body,\u201d a term of art used to limit remainders. Similarly, it has been held that the term \u201cheirs of the body\u201d is an expression that \u201c* * * has a biological overtone which excludes a wife or husband and also adopted children.\u201d <em>In re Trust Estate ofKanoa </em>(1964), 47 Hawaii 610, 620, 393 P.2d 753, 759; Casner, Construction of Gifts to \u201cHeirs\u201d and the Like (1939), 53 Harv. L. Rev. 207, 222-223. There is a distinct difference between the term \u201cheirs of the body\u201d and the term \u201cheirs at law\u201d as used in <em>Tiedtke. </em>Moreover, both <em>Tiedtke </em>and the present R.C. 3107.15(A)(2) recognize the supremacy of the testator\u2019s intent over the judicial and legislative policy that adopted children be treated the same as natural children.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">In our view there is no ambiguity in the will of Allen Evans as to the meaning of \u201cheirs of the body.\u201d Unlike the court of appeals we cannot eschew the issue by suggesting that the meaning of technical terms of limitation in 1925, such as \u201cheirs of the body,\u201d would change at some future period of time without specific legislative directive. Moreov\u00e9r, the term \u201cheirs of the body\u201d is not used interchangeably with \u201cheirs,\u201d used in the residuary clause in Item Eighth of the will,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or \u201cchildren,\u201d used in Item Second or Item Seventh of the will.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Additionally, the term \u201cheirs of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>the body\u201d was explicitly defined by G. C. 8030, as noted <em>supra. </em>The particular context of the term \u201cheirs of their bodies\u201d prefaced by the words \u201cand then to\u201d is also of value in ascertaining its use as a term of limitation. In the absence of contrary evidence, the use of the term \u201cheirs of the body\u201d in anything other than its former statutorily defined meaning is without legal justification.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">While we are mindful of, and sympathetic to, the legislative concern that adopted individuals be treated in most instances as if they were legitimate blood descendants, we are compelled to give effect to the testator\u2019s express intent. In <em>Townsend\u2019s Exrs. </em>v. <em>Townsend </em>(1874), 25 Ohio St. 477, this court stated in paragraph one of the syllabus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-6\">\u201cIn the construction of a will, the sole purpose of the court should be to ascertain and carry out the intention of the testator.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">This court reaffirmed the primacy of testator\u2019s intent in <em>Sandy </em>v. <em>Mouhot </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St. 3d 143, 144:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-8\">\u201cThe court\u2019s sole purpose in an action seeking construction of a will is to ascertain and carry out the intention of the testator. See, also, <em>Wills </em>v. <em>Union Savings &amp; Trust </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St. 2d 382, 385 [23 O.O.3d 350].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"abr-dedup-0\">It is hornbook law, however, that technical terms in a will must be given their technical meaning and the testator will be presumed, absent differing intent, to be cognizant of that existing legal meaning. <em>Rehm </em>v. <em>Core </em>(App. 1948), 54 Ohio Laws Abs. 535; <em>Holt </em>v. <em>Miller </em>(1938), 133 Ohio St. 418, 420 [11 O.O. 85]. The term \u201cheirs of the body\u201d (or their bodies), under the circumstances of this case, is a term of limitation with respect to a class and in our view represents the kind of express exclusion recognized by R.C. 3107.15(A)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>Having accepted that \u201cheirs of the body\u201d is a term of limitation,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we must next determine when the class of contingent remaindermen closed. This is important because the contingent remainders in a life estate cannot become vested until the class is closed, <em>i.e., </em>with the death of the final life tenant. <em>Casey </em>v. <em>Gallagher </em>(1967), 11 Ohio St. 2d 42 [40 O.O.2d 55]. The final life tenant, Verna Tootle, died in January 1983. Roxanna Tootle Abbott, however, had predeceased Verna before any interest could vest in her or her adopted children. Consequently, only Allen Tootle had a vested remainder after the class closed by virtue of Allen Evans\u2019 explicit instruction that the remainder interest go to the heirs of the bodies of his children. Further, even if we were to assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that Thomas and Megan succeeded to their mother\u2019s position by virtue of R.C. 2107.52, the anti-lapse statute, they still would not take because the statute may be avoided by sufficient expression of intent. <em>Shalkhauser </em>v. <em>Beach </em>(P.C. 1968), 14 Ohio Misc. 1 [43 O.O.2d 20]; Bensing, The Ohio Anti-Lapse Statute (1959), 28 U. Cin. L. Rev. 1, 29. Such intent, in view of our prior discussion, was manifested by the use of the term \u201cheirs of their bodies\u201d as a term of limitation. But, cf., <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>Bredbeck </em>(1946), 147 Ohio St. 49 [33 O.O. 243].</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Accordingly, the adopted children could neither inherit through nor from their mother. We therefore uphold the trial court\u2019s decision and reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b280-7\">Celebrezze, C.J., Holmes and Connors, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b280-8\">Wright, J., concurs separately in the syllabus.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b280-9\">Sweeney and Douglas, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<judges id=\"A9j\">Connors, J., of the Sixth Appellate District, sitting for C.

We disagree with such an interpretation of the trial court\u2019s decision and expressly do not endorse, utilize, or adopt the stranger-to-the-adoption rule in today\u2019s decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b280-13\"> While use of the term \u201cheirs of the body\u201d as words of limitation, and not of purchase, should be sufficient to exclude adopted children, the careful drafter would be advised to specifically set forth the intention that adopted children not take under the will, in as many words to avoid the possibility that the term could be misconstrued or taken out of its intended context.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b280-11\">Wright, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_2\">concurring. The majority finds, and I agree, that Allen Evans\u2019 will reveals a general intention to benefit his natural children for their lives, and to further devise his property in his bloodline.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-12\">The court\u2019s function in a will construction case is to determine and apply the testator\u2019s intention as expressed from the language of the whole will, the general scheme of the disposition, and the circumstances surrounding its execution. One such circumstance is the original statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>setting. Under G.C. 8030, which was effective at the time of the execution of Allen Evans\u2019 will and at the time of his death, an adopted child was incapable of inheriting property expressly limited to the \u201cheirs of the body\u201d of the adopting parent or parents. Because Allen Evans\u2019 will employs the term suggested by statute, \u201cheirs of their bodies,\u201d the logical and probable conclusion is that he intended to use the term in its traditional, common meaning to insure that his property passed to his natural descendants.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">The traditional meaning of \u201cissue\u201d and \u201cheirs of the body\u201d was lineal descendants by blood. <em>Casey </em>v. <em>Gallagher </em>(1967), 11 Ohio St. 2d 42 [40 O.O.2d 55]; <em>Third National Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Davidson </em>(1952), 157 Ohio St. 355 [47 O.O. 257]. Although the meaning of \u201cissue\u201d has been expanded to include adopted children, <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>Bredbeck </em>(1946), 147 Ohio St. 49 [33 O.O. 243], this trend has never affected \u201cheirs of the body,\u201d which still means lineal descendants by blood. Therefore, the will herein, bequeathing a life estate in property to children and, on their death, to heirs of their bodies, manifested the testator\u2019s intention to limit the estate to the lineal blood descendants of such children. This construction excludes adopted children of the testator\u2019s granddaughter from taking her deceased parent\u2019s share.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>Neither Roxanna Tootle, nor anyone claiming through her, can now claim an interest in the trust corpus. When the testator died, the re-maindermen acquired only a contingent interest in the realty. This interest could not vest until the life tenants, Verna and Merton Tootle, died because only at <em>that </em>time could their \u201cheirs\u201d be determined. Because Rox-anna predeceased her mother, Verna, her contingent remainder never vested. Further, Roxanna left no lineal descendants who could claim directly as heirs of the body of Verna Tootle.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">I agree with the majority that Ohio\u2019s anti-lapse statute, R.C. 2107.52, is inapplicable to the instant case, but for a different reason. R.C. 2107.52 preserves a gift in favor of heirs or descendants of persons who fall within the class description, and are alive at the date of the execution of the will, but predecease the testator. This statute does not operate where the class member survives the testator but dies before the date of vesting or distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">In the instant case, the testator\u2019s intention that his property be distributed only to those in his bloodline was sufficiently indicated to require his intention to be given effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">Accordingly, I concur.</p>\n<judges id=\"b282-8\">Connors, J., concurs in the foregoing concurring opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b281-7\"> The testator\u2019s intention was formulated under a clear statutory and judicial rule that gradually evolved to a different state of law. G.C. 8030, effective August 5, 1921 (109 Ohio Laws 179-180), a part of the Adoption Act, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-8\">\u201c* * * [A]nd the child shall be invested with every legal right, privilege, obligation and relation in respect to education, maintenance and the rights of inheritance to real estate, or to the distribution of personal estate on the death of such adopting parent or parents as if born to them in lawful wedlock; provided, such child shall not be capable of inheriting property expressly limited to the heirs of the body of the adopting parent or parents; * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">G.C. 10512-19 was enacted as part of the new Probate Code effective January 1,1932. At that time, the following language was added to the provisions of what was formerly G.C. 8030: \u201c* * * but shall be capable of inheriting property expressly limited by will or by operation of law to the child or children, heir or heirs at law, or next of kin, of the adopting parent or parents, or to a class including any of the foregoing * * (114 Ohio Laws 474.)</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">A presumptive rule formerly existed in Ohio that an adopted child was deemed excluded from a class of beneficiaries when the testator was a stranger to the adoption and had not otherwise manifested an intent to include adopted children. <em>Third National Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Davidson </em>(1952), 157 Ohio St. 355 [47 O.O. 257], Presently, R.C. 3107.15, effective January 1, 1977, creates a presumption of inclusion for adopted children unless affirmatively excluded by language in the instrument. It provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-11\">\u201c(A) A final decree of adoption and an interlocutory order of adoption that has become final, issued by a court of this state, shall have the following effects as to all matters within the jurisdiction or before a court of this state:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-13\">&lt;&lt;* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-14\">\u201c(2) To create the relationship of parent and child between petitioner and the adopted person, as if the adopted person were a legitimate blood descendant of the petitioner, for all purposes including inheritance and applicability of statutes, documents, and instruments, whether executed before or after the adoption is decreed, which do not expressly exclude an adopted person from their operation or effect.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b282-9\">Douglas, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A2R\">dissenting. This court, by its decision today, has rendered R.C. 3107.15(A)(2) void of meaning and effect as a statute enacted to place adopted children in the same position in matters of inheritance as naturally born children. This is in direct conflict with the intent of the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">Prior to January 1, 1977, Ohio\u2019s adoption statutes contained a provision which denied adopted children the right to inherit property limited to \u201cheirs of the body.\u201d However, by omitting this provision from its enactment of R.C. 3107.15, Ohio\u2019s legislators removed the former restriction against adopted persons and finally afforded such persons the same rights to inheritance as natural born children.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-11\">This statute, in clear, concise and unambiguous language, needs no construction ;or interpretation by this court, but should be applied to give full effect to its intent. Thus, pursuant to R.C. 3107.15(A)(2), unless an adopted <em>person </em>is <em>expressly </em>excluded from the operation or effect of a testator\u2019s will, he or she should benefit as if the adopted person were a legitimate blood descendant of the benefactor.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-12\">The remaindermen in this testator\u2019s (Evans\u2019) will were described not individually, but as members of a class, <em>i.e., </em>the heirs of the body of the life tenants. As noted by the appellate court, \u201c[a] gift to persons not individually named but conforming to a general description is usually a gift to those persons as a class.\u201d Thus, Evans\u2019 gift of the remainder interest to the heirs of the body of Merton and Verna Tootle, was a gift to a class of persons and not to a particular individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>Although in 1925, the class of persons created by the term \u201cheirs of the- body\u201d did not include adopted children, it is not necessarily valid to presume that the use of the term indicates Evans\u2019 intent to expressly exclude or bar adopted children who later, by operation of statute, become members of that class and thereby eligible to take under his will. While I agree with the majority that a testator is presumed to know the law, and that technical terms in a will must be given their technical meaning, our analysis cannot stop there. A testator is also presumed to know that the law is subject to change. Accordingly, as this court stated in <em>Holt </em>v. <em>Miller </em>(1938), 133 Ohio St. 418, at 421 [11 O.O. 85], \u201c[h]e [the testator] must also be charged with knowledge that the persons who would be * * * [his] heirs at his demise might be entirely different from those who were his prospective or presumptive heirs when the will was executed, either through natural processes <em>or by legislative enactment.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Additionally, as this court held in relevant part in paragraph two of the syllabus of <em>Tiedtke </em>v. <em>Tiedtke </em>(1952), 157 Ohio St. 554 [47 O.O. 411], \u201c* * * the statutory law in effect at the expiration of such life interest should be applied in determining * * * [the] heirs of the testator * * *, even though such statutory law will permit an adopted child of the testator\u2019s daughter to take and the statutory law in effect at the testator\u2019s death would not have permitted such adopted child to take and even though such adopted child was not either born or adopted until long after the testator\u2019s death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">By statutory enactment the legislature has changed the persons who are to be included within the term \u201cheirs of the body.\u201d Without express language, excluding these adoptees, the application of R.C. 3107.15(A)(2) requires that Thomas Abbott and Megan Knisley take under this will as legitimate members of the class provided for by this will.</p>\n<judges id=\"b283-6\">Sweeney, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
