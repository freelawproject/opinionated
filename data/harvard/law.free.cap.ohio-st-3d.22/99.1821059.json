Relic, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b132-7\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AE8\">The issues presented in this appeal are: (1) whether Local Rule 11(C) is unconstitutional, and (2) whether the trial court abused its discretion in dismissing the case with prejudice. We hold that Local Rule 11(C) is constitutional, but that the trial court improperly dismissed the case with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">Local Rule 11(C)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sets forth a seven-day limitation period within which responses to motions must be filed. This rule was passed under the authority of Section 5, Article IV of the Ohio Constitution<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and R.C. 2505.45.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant filed its response to appellee\u2019s February 1984 motion to dismiss five days late. Appellant claims that the seven-day response limitation is unconstitutionally brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">Although shorter than other response-limitation periods throughout Ohio,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the seven-day period is not significantly shorter. Seven days is certainly a sufficient amount of time within which to respond to motions filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>by an opponent. We find that such a limitation is not violative of the Due Process Clause of the Ohio Constitution. Local Rule 11(C) is reasonably related to the goal of efficient judicial administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">We must next determine whether the trial court properly dismissed appellant\u2019s claim with prejudice for failure to comply with discovery orders. Appellee based his motion to dismiss on Civ. R. 37(B)(2)(c),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which permits the court to dismiss a party\u2019s suit if that party failed to obey a discovery order.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Civ. R. 41(B)(1) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-7\">\u201cWhere the plaintiff fails to prosecute, or comply with these rules or any court order, the court upon motion of a defendant or on its own motion may, <em>after notice to the plaintiffs counsel, </em>dismiss an action or claim.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">We hold that the notice requirement of Civ. R. 41(B)(1) applies to <em>all </em>dismissals with prejudice, including those entered pursuant to Civ. R. 37(B)(2)(c) for failure to comply with discovery orders. A dismissal on the merits is a harsh remedy that calls for the due process guarantee of prior notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">Accordingly, the two rules should be read <em>in pari materia </em>with regard to dismissals with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">This holding stems from and reflects \u201ca basic tenet of Ohio jurisprudence that cases should be decided on their merits.\u201d <em>Perotti </em>v. <em>Ferguson </em>(1983), 7 Ohio St. 3d 1, 3. Notice of intention to dismiss with prejudice gives the non-complying party one last chance to obey the court order in full. The moving party should not be allowed to circumvent this protection by simply framing his motion in terms of a Civ. R. 37 sanction. Nor should a trial court on its own motion dismiss on the merits without prior notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-11\">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the cause to the court of common pleas, since appellant did not receive prior notice of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-12\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b133-13\">Celebrezze, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, C.

Brown, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A1ML\">concurring. I concur with all aspects of today\u2019s decision, but I write separately to express my concern over the seven-day time period for responses to motions provided by Local Rule 11(C). Although I agree with the majority\u2019s holding that the rule is not so unreasonable as to violate due process, I nevertheless disfavor a rule which provides so short a time for response. Often, the entire outcome of a case may hinge entirely on the response to a particular motion. I prefer a system which gives the parties at least ten days, if not fourteen, to formulate the best possible response. Allowing sufficient time for the best response may actually prevent judicial complications later in the case, and will certainly promote justice.</p>\n<judges id=\"b134-5\">Wright, J., concurs in the foregoing concurring opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
