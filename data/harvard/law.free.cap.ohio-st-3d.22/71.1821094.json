Brown, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AaX\">The proper resolution of this case depends upon the interpretation and interrelationship of two documents. The first document, labeled an \u201cAgreement and Plan for Reorganization,\u201d provided for GLE/Richfield to issue certain stock but restricted the \u201cdisposal\u201d of that stock until certain conditions were satisfied. The second document, labeled a \u201cTrust Agreement,\u201d detailed an agreement whereby Stanley Lo-jek would lend $300,000 to James Pedler, who would then purchase certain shares of stock and transfer those shares to James Rondy as Lojek\u2019s agent pending Pedler\u2019s repayment of the debt to Lojek.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>The trial court held that the alleged Trust Agreement was a contract to create a trust. The court of appeals disagreed, finding that no trust could have been contemplated by the parties because the legal and equitable ownerships of the shares were never to be severed.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">The court of appeals held that, rather than creating a trust, \u201cthe parties intended to pledge the shares to secure Pedler\u2019s debt to Lojek.\u201d We agree. We also agree that \u201c[sjince the shares were never delivered, either to Lojek or to Rondy as Lojek\u2019s agent, the security interest was not perfected pursuant to R.C. 1309.23.\u201d However, the court of appeals erred in its conclusion that Lojek lost all rights granted by the Agreement because of his failure to perfect his security interest. Prior to the effective date of present R.C. 1308.36,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> attachment of a security interest in securities was governed by R.C. 1309.14. Under that section, so long as the debtor had granted a valid security interest in securities to the creditor as collateral for a debt and that security interest had attached, the creditor\u2019s failure to perfect that security interest was irrelevant to the validity of the security interest as between the parties to a security agreement; perfection was relevant only to disputes among secured creditors as to the relative priorities of their security interests in the securities as collateral. Thus, at the time Lojek attempted to enforce the security interest at issue in this case, Lojek had obtained a valid security interest in certain securities as collateral. When an intended pledge of those securities failed for lack of delivery to Lojek or his agent prior to Pedler\u2019s death, that failure of delivery did not prevent Lojek from enforcing the terms of the security agreement against the Pedler estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">R.C. 1309.01(A)(12) defines \u201csecurity agreement\u201d as \u201can agreement which creates or provides for a security interest.\u201d The Agreement in this case refers to Lojek\u2019s security interest as a \u201cpresent assignment\u201d of the stock \u201cpursuant to a pledge of said stock\u201d as collateral for Lojek\u2019s loan to Pedler. Thus, the Agreement in this case clearly meets that statutory definition. Further, the security interest attached to the collateral as provided by R.C. 1309.14: (1) the debtor signed a security agreement which contained a description of the collateral (the Agreement); (2) value was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>given (Lojek\u2019s transfer of $300,000 to Pedler); and (3) Pedler, the debtor, had rights in the collateral.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">The courts below have analyzed the security interest in this case as though the security interest could not attach pending Pedler\u2019s right to transfer legal title to the stock, which right was restricted by the Reorganization Plan. However, nothing in the Agreement requires that analysis. Despite the parties\u2019 acknowledgement that transfer of <em>ownership </em>of the shares was restricted, the Agreement nonetheless evidenced the parties\u2019 intention to make an \u201cimmediate pledge\u201d of the stock. The Agreement did not require that title to the shares be transferred to Rondy, but merely that Rondy take possession of the shares. On the other hand, the Reorganization Plan restricted \u201cdisposal\u201d of the shares, not the mere transfer of possession of the shares to effect a pledge as contemplated by the Agreement. The issuance of the shares in Pedler\u2019s name, thus resulting in Pedler having title to the stock, gave Pedler sufficient rights in the collateral to enable the security interest to attach for purposes of R.C. 1309.14(A). Thus, pursuant to R.C. 1309.14(B), since the Agreement did not explicitly postpone the time of attachment, Lojek\u2019s security interest in the stock attached and became effective between Lojek and Pedler at the moment the above three statutory requirements for attachment were met.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">The parties agree that Lojek failed to perfect his security interest in the stock according to the terms of R.C. 1309.23. To so perfect his security interest, either Lojek or Rondy on Lojek\u2019s behalf would have had to take physical possession of the shares. By the terms of the Agreement, the parties intended that Pedler would deliver physical possession of the shares to Rondy who would act as Lojek\u2019s agent for purposes of perfection. However, \u201c* * * a security agreement is effective according to its terms between the parties, * * *\u201d R.C. 1309.12. Therefore, as between Lojek and Pedler (and, by extension, Pedler\u2019s estate), and under the law both at the time the Agreement was executed and at the time Lojek attempted to enforce the Agreement, the terms of the Agreement governed Lojek\u2019s rights in the collateral.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The Agreement contemplated the very situation which eventually occurred: \u201cIn the event of the death of * * * [Pedler] prior to the delivery of said shares to * * * [Rondy], then said stock certificates shall be immediately the property of * * * [Lojek], in full satisfaction of said note.\u201d Thus, for purposes of the Agreement, Pedler\u2019s death became a default-like event which triggered Lojek\u2019s legal right to take immediate possession of the collateral, both by the terms of the Agreement and by R.C. 1309.46. Finally, we note that Lojek\u2019s Agreement to accept the collateral in full satisfaction of the debt was consistent with his rights pursuant to R.C. 1309.48(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>Accordingly, we hereby reverse the judgment of the court of appeals, and enter final judgment in favor of plaintiff Lojek.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b107-6\">Celebrezze, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, Douglas and Wright, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b105-7\"> We note that, effective September 20, 1984, R.C. 1308.36 governs the enforceability and attachment of security interests in securities. By enacting R.C. 1308.36(A), the General Assembly has, in essence, mandated the very result found by the court of appeals below: \u201cA security interest in a security is enforceable and can attach only if it is transferred to the secured party or a party designated by him pursuant to division (A) of section 1308.28 of the Revised Code.\u201d The current version of R.C. 1308.36 was adopted as part of Sub. S. B. No. 283\u2019s wholesale revision of R.C. Chapters 1308 and 1309, which was undertaken \u201c* * * to adopt the Uniform Laws Commissioners\u2019 1977 Amendments to Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code * * *.\u201d However, because present R.C. 1308.36 was not in effect at the time Lojek attempted to enforce his security interest in this case, the determination of whether Lojek\u2019s security interest attached and was enforceable must be made with reference to R.C. 1309.14.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
