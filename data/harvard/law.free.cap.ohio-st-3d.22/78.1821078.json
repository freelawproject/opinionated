Chapter 2907 (sex offenses) where such offenses might also constitute a violation of R.C. Chapter 2151 (juvenile court). Our answer is in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">Appellant relies on R.C. 2151.23(A)(5) which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-11\">\u201cThe Juvenile Court has exclusive original jurisdiction under the Revised Code:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-12\">ff* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-13\">\u201c(5) To hear and determine all criminal cases charging adults with the violation of any section of Chapter 2151 of the Revised Code.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-14\">Appellant was charged with and convicted of three counts of rape, in violation of R.C. 2907.02. R.C. 2151.23 is the legislative enactment conferring jurisdiction on the juvenile court and such enactment explicitly limits the court \u201c[t]o hear and determine all criminal cases charging adults with the violation of any section of Chapter 2151 of the Revised Code.\u201d While appellant might, for example, have been charged with and convicted of abusing a child under R.C. 2151.41, the fact is that he was not. R.C. 2151.23(A)(5) thus contradicts, rather than supports, appellant\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-15\">Inasmuch as appellant was convicted and sentenced by the court of common pleas, a court of competent jurisdiction, the judgment of the court of appeals dismissing the complaint is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-16\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b111-17\">Celebrezze, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, C. Brown, Douglas and Wright, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
