Stat. R. I. cap. 186, \u00a7\u00a7 14, 16. <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Gardner, 17 </em>R. I. 751, 755 ; Pub. Stat. R. I. cap. 186, \u00a7 19. The defendant has not rendered an account of his administration to the Municipal Court. Till such an account has been rendered and settled, it cannot be known whether or not he has a surplus in his hands. It is the opinion of the court, therefore, that the suit must be continued to await the settlement of the defendant\u2019s account as administrator.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
