They may be paid out of the book accounts and credits as well. No rule of law stands in the way of such a provision. Of course if an estate is insolvent .all legacies fail; or if the fund charged is insufficient, some or all of them must abate; and it is urged that the word \u201ccredits,\u201d as used here, should be restricted to such as are the proper subjects of hook account. We do not think the testator attached so restricted a meaning to the word. He says hook accounts and <em>other </em>credits by which we understand him to signify, if not all items on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>\u25a0credit side of the executor\u2019s account with the estate, at least all sums of money due the' estate by promissory notes or bonds as well as the charges on his account books. These together are more than sufficient to pay the pecuniary legacies.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AxvQ\"><em>Cyrus M. Van </em>Slyck, for complainants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AfD\"><em>Edward C: Dubois, </em>Attorney General, for the State of Rhode Island.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AH0j\"><em>Joseph C. Ely, Ezra K. Parker, James B. Richardson &amp; Herbert Almy, </em>for other and different respondents.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">So long as the estate is solvent it is immaterial to the \u25a0creditors out of what fund they are paid, and it is cpmpetent for a testator to charge a certain portion of his estate with legacies provided he leaves sufficient beside to pay his debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The second branch of the brief is an attempt to reargue \"the case, and is irregular at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">We have already very carefully considered the points presented, and see no reason to change our judgment upon them.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
