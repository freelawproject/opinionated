The defendant pleads to the jurisdiction of the Common Pleas Division, averring that the supposed cause of action is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the District Court of the Tenth Judicial District.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-16\">We think that the plea must be ovei\u2019ruled. The Judiciary Act, cap. 8, \u00a7 23, in force when the action was brought, confers on districts courts exclusive jurisdiction only in actions for the possession of tenements or .estates let or held at will or by sufferance. <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>18 R. I. 529. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>\u25a0declaration does not charge that the estate, for the possession \u2022of which the suit is brought, wa.s held by the city of Pawtucket by virtue of any letting, or as a tenant at will or by \u2022sufferance of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A3Pf\"><em>Hugh J. Carroll, </em>for plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AxH\"><em>J. L. Jenks, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">The case was properly brought under the Judiciary Act, cap. 3, \u00a7 4, which conferred upon the Common Pleas Division original jurisdiction over civil actions at law which relate to real estate, or to some right, easement or interest therein, except actions brought for possession of tenements or estates let or held by will or by sufferance, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
