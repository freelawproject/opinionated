It charges merely that the city of Pawtucket, by its agents and servants, \u201cwithout lawful authority so alter and from time to time continue to alter and suffered to be altered and kept .and continued to be altered,\u201d without stating what it was that was altered. We can guess that it was the intention of the plaintiffs to charge that the city of Pawtucket altered the grade of some street or streets, whereby water was collected and discharged on the plaintiffs\u2019 land in greater quantities than would have been discharged on it but for such \u25a0change of grade. But the declaration contains no such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>charge, nor in fact any charge whatever. The demurrer for this cause must therefore he sustained.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AeU\"><em>Hugh J. Carroll, </em>for plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AQLA\"><em>J. L. Jenl-cs, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b532-3\">The writ was served December 9, 1895, before Gen. Laws-R. I. cap. 194, \u00a7 16, took effect. At that time Pub. Stat. R. I. cap. 166, \u00a7 116, as amended by Pub. Laws R. I. cap. 120, ' \u00a7 2, was in force, which provided that in all actions relating to the property of any married woman the husband and wife-should jointly sue and be sued, except a trustee of the same should have been appointed, as provided in \u00a7 18 of said cap. 166. The suit therefore was properly brought by the plaintiffs as husband and wife jointly. <em>Merriam </em>v. <em>White, </em>18 R. I. 727.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">The rescript in <em>Corey </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>Equity 4011, referred te by the defendant, was filed February 8, 1896, after Gen. Laws R. I. cap. 194, \u00a7 16, had become operative. The bill in that suit had been filed August 24, 1895. The respondent\u2019s demurrer, because of the non-joinder of the husband of Mrs. Read, one of the complainants, was filed October 22, 1895. We did not sustain the demurrer because, by reason of the change in the law by the enactment of Gen. Laws R. I. cap. 194, \u00a7 16, the non-joinder of the husband not only did not render the bill defective, but on the contrary was in accordance with the statute; and if we had sustained the demurrer and a new bill had been filed, it would have been demurrable if the husband had been joined.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
