I. 324. The word \u201cconvict,\u201d as ordinarily used carries with it the idea that the person of whom it is spoken is guilty of crime of such infamous character as to be punishable by imprisonment in the state prison, and of such imprisonment, and, therefore, is to be taken <em>prima facie, </em>as importing guilt of such crime and imprisonment in consequence. ' The prefix \u201cex,\u201d denoting that the convict has served out a sentence for crime or been pardoned does not take away its libelous effect. In <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Tatam, </em>Cro. Jac. 622, it is said, \u201cIt is a great slander to be once a thief; for although a pardon may-discharge the punishment, yet the scandal of the offence remains.\u201d And see <em>Cuddington </em>v. <em>Wilkins, </em>Hobart 81; <em>Van Ankin </em>v. <em>Westfall, </em>14 Johns. 233 ; <em>Eastland </em>v. <em>Caldwell, </em>2 Bibb, 24; <em>Shipp </em>v. <em>McCraw, </em>3 Murph. 466; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>5 Barr, 372; <em>Beck </em>v. <em>Stitzel, </em>21 Pa. St. 524; <em>Poe </em>v. <em>Grever, </em>2 Sneed, 664.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">The natural import of the charge being defamatory no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number><em>colloquium </em>or prefatory statement is necessary. <em>State </em>v. <em>Spear &amp; </em>Corbett, 13 R.
