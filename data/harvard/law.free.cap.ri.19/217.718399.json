We are of the opinion that she is entitled to recover under the general counts, as upon a <em>quantum meruit, </em>the money due her, to wit, $12.19, that sum being presumptively what her labor was reasonably worth. <em>Gaffney </em>v. <em>Hayden, </em>110 Mass. 137; <em>Whitmarsh </em>v. <em>Hall, 3 </em>Denio, 375.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-16\">The statute referred to by the plaintiff, if such a statute exists, which it is claimed entitles an employee discharged without notice to recover double the amount due the em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>ployee at the time, has no application; and, moreover, the Common Pleas Division must have found that she was not discharged, and we cannot review that finding.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AL_S\"><em>Hugh J. </em>Carroll, for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AkT\"><em>Edward D.
