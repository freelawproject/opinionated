So far as appears, the respondents cannot now be put back into a position in which they can recover compensation from the estate of said Joseph Ereeborn for the services which they rendered. In view, therefore, of the apparent laches of the complainants, there seems to be a fundamental question whether they are entitled to maintain the bill, assuming the incapacity of said Joseph Freeborn, and their right to have the conveyance set aside if it had been applied for within the proper time. If this be so, there should he no need of a new trial of the issues of fact. And the court deems it proper to withhold its decision on the petition for a new trial, in order that the parties may he heard on the question above suggested, and also on other questions raised by the bill and answer.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ArR\"><em>Darius Baker &amp; P.
