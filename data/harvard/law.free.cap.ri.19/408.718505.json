The proof of a disseizin is not so clear as to show that the verdict is against the evidence.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ADE\"><em>Charles H. Page ancl Franklin P.

Mowry, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b457-3\">The only exception pressed at the hearing was that the law allowing a married woman to convey her property without her husband joining in the deed, Pub. Laws, cap. 1204, is unconstitutional because it operates to take away the husband\u2019s estate by marital right. This point is sufficiently disposed of by the fact that the land in question was not acquired until after December 2, 1872, when a husband\u2019s estate in-his wife\u2019s realty by marital right was abolished. <em>In re the Voting Laws, </em>12 R.
