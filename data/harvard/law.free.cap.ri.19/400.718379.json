The former decree determined the manner in which dower should be assigned; and the parties having waived their right to appeal from it, it became final on its entry. Gen. Laws E. I. cap. 264, \u00a7 23. The revocation of its action by a probate court, under Gen. Laws E. I. cap. 209, \u00a7 11, is to be made before the time for taking an appeal has expired.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
