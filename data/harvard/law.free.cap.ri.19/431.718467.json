In view of these so called advances, he leaves out of the distribution directed by the third clause of the codicil the defendant and other children to whom such larger advances had been made, thereby showing, that, in order to make <em>\u201ca </em>more just division\u201d of his estate, he did not intend that those debts which he termed advances should be paid, but that his other children should have what remained of his property. We think, therefore, that the plaintiff is not entitled to maintain her suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-13\">Judgment for the defendant for costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
