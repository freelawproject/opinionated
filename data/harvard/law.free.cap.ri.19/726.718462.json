Such a voter is clearly qualified to vote by Article VII of the amendments to the Constitution, \u00a7 l,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the only restriction upon his right to vote is that contained in the proviso to Article VII, \u00a7 1, viz., that he shall not be allowed to vote in the election of the city council of any city, or upon a proposition to impose a tax or for the expenditure of money in any town or city.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\">Charles Matteson,</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">John H.
