Horgan and Charles C. Peirce, as copartners doing business under the firm name of the Newport Laundry Co., and were the promises of said copartners and of the partnership ; that while said copartnership was in existence and said promises remained to be performed said Daniel Galvin died, and thereupon it became the duty of the plaintiff, before bringing any action against the defendant, to exhaust the partnership property towards the liquidation of its' said claim, averring that at the time of the death of Daniel Galvin there was, and now is, property of such copartnership, but that the plaintiff though well knowing the same had made no effort to subject such property to the payment of its claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-3\">To this plea the plaintiff demurred.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b618-4\"><em>July </em>20, 1896.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"ATc\">Matteson, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9c\">The note sued on does not purport to be a note of the N ewport Laundry Co., a partnership composed of the three persons who were the makers of the note. It is simply the joint note of those persons, of whom the defendant\u2019s testator was one. The Judiciary Act, cap. 13, \u00a7 IT, (Gen. Laws R. I. cap. 233, \u00a7 IT,) provides that, \u201cUnless otherwise provided in the contract upon the death' of any joint contractor his representatives may be chai\u2019ged in the same manner as such representatives might have been charged if such contract had been several instead of joint: <em>Provided, </em>that the plaintiff shall first exhaust the partnership estate, if such contract is a partnership contract.\u201d As the note does not purport to be a partnership contract, and does not provide in it that on the death of either of the makers his representatives shall not be charged as if the contract had been several instead of joint, we are of the opinion that the suit is in accordance with the statute quoted, and, therefore, that it is properly brought against the defendant, as the representative of the deceased. The demurrer to the first plea in bar is sustained, and plea overruled.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ABU\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number><em>William P.
