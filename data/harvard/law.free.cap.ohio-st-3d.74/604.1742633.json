Casalinuovo </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 367, 613 N.E.2d 177, and <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Carter </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 568, 629 N.E.2d 430. <em>Casalinuovo </em>and <em>Carter </em>were cases of attorneys who, after being found guilty of drug abuse, received treatment in lieu of conviction under R.C. 2951.041. But in those cases, the respondents were sanctioned solely for using illegal drugs. Fortado is guilty of other misconduct as well; he admits two violations each of DR 1-102(A)(6) and Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G), including the improper disbursement of $11,500 of a client\u2019s funds and repeated failures to cooperate with relator\u2019s investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-10\">Accordingly, we adopt the board\u2019s findings, conclusions, and recommendation. Matthew Fortado is suspended from the practice of law in Ohio for two years. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>One year of this sanction is stayed on the conditions recommended by the board as stated above.
