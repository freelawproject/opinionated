An applicant\u2019s commission or conviction of a crime, failure to provide complete and accurate information concerning his or her past, and abuse of the legal process are factors that must be considered in assessing the sufficiency of the applicant\u2019s character, fitness, and moral qualifications for bar admission. A significant deficiency in the honesty, trustworthiness, diligence or reliability of an applicant is a basis for oui' disapproval of the applicant. Gov.Bar R. I(11)(D)(3) and (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>Moreover, a prior felony conviction is not, <em>per se, </em>sufficient to show that an applicant presently lacks the moral character required to practice law. <em>In re Application of Davis </em>(1974), 38 Ohio St.2d 273, 275, 67 O.O.2d 344, 345, 313 N.E.2d 363, 364-365. \u201cHowever, where such [conviction] appears in the background of an applicant for admission to the bar, his burden of establishing his present good moral character takes on the added weight of proving his full and complete rehabilitation subsequent to the conviction.\u201d Rehabilitation must also be proved by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">We agree with the board that Sundiata Keita cannot establish the character, fitness and moral qualifications necessary to practice law in this state. The board was legitimately reluctant to initially recommend approval of Keita\u2019s application in view of his significant criminal record; his apparent history of serious psychological problems; his repeated filing, with little or no justification, of discrimination charges or other claims; and his suspicious explanation of his reaction to the alleged attack of a female student. Upon remand, the psychiatrist appointed to evaluate Keita assured the board that Keita did not suffer from any psychiatric disorder. Even so, the board was still legitimately concerned that (1) Keita had not disclosed to the appointed psychiatrist the most sordid details of the armed robbery he committed in 1972; (2) Keita had been reluctant to accept unmitigated responsibility for his crime during at least one interview with the psychiatrist, even suggesting that armed robbery could be an appropriate response to ill treatment by another; (3) Keita had failed to reveal at the first panel hearing, but had confessed to the psychiatrist, his use of a belt to strike the female student who had allegedly attacked him; and (4) Keita had refused to responsibly acknowledge the basis for disciplinary measures he had received as a teacher, repeatedly rationalizing his conduct or raising procedural defenses to the imposition of discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">In evaluating Keita\u2019s psychological condition, the appointed psychiatrist confirmed that Keita had \u201cengaged in passive-aggressive, antisocial, litigious, and impulsively aggressive behavior over the years.\u201d Moreover, Keita has been \u201cunwilling to accept responsibility for questionable past behaviors and lapses in judgment.\u201d This behavior is manifested by the record, and we consider such enduring conduct ample justification for the board\u2019s findings and recommendation. Therefore, we adopt the board\u2019s report and deny Sundiata Keita\u2019s applications for admission to the Ohio Bar and to take the Ohio Bar Examination. Furthermore, we order that Keita be forever precluded from reapplying for the privilege to practice law in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b292-8\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Wright, Resnick, F.E.
