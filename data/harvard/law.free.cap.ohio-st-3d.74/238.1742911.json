Claimant argues that an inability to return to his previous job is not a prerequisite to wage-loss compensation, and with this we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>agree. Ohio Adm.Code 4121-3-32(D)(2) permits wage-loss compensation, under certain circumstances, to claimants who have resumed their former employment. What is, however, a prerequisite to wage-loss payment is a medical inability to secure comparably paying work. <em>State ex rel. The Andersons v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 539, 597 N.E.2d 143.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Claimant\u2019s former position of employment is obviously \u201ccomparably paying work.\u201d A full release to return negates any assertion that claimant\u2019s inability to earn at his preinjury rate is medically precipitated. While it is true that claimant\u2019s layoff prevents his actual return, the involuntary nature of that employment separation is irrelevant, since claimant is medically capable of performing his former work. To hold otherwise is tantamount to permitting wage-loss compensation for the mere fact of a layoff.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Claimant criticizes the commission\u2019s failure to inquire into his efforts to find other work. This objection is baseless. Once the commission found that the injury did not impede claimant\u2019s ability to return to his former job, further analysis was unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b485-10\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Wright, Resnick, F.E.
