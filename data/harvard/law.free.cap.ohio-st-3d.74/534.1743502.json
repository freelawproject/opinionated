We express no judgment on appellant\u2019s contention that he was denied his constitutional right to defend himself. Rather, we are concerned solely with the standard of review to be applied when assessing a defendant\u2019s request for reopening an appeal under App.R. 26(B)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-10\">In denying the application for reopening, the court of appeals applied the <em>Strickland </em>standard for determining whether a defendant is entitled to a new trial. While this court has not expressed its view on adopting that standard for reopening appeals, the federal courts have used and now use <em>Strickland </em>to assess requests in cases alleging ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. See <em>Duhamel v. Collins </em>(C.A.5, 1992), 955 F.2d 962, 967; <em>Heath v. Jones </em>(C.A.11, 1991), 941 F.2d 1126; <em>Cross v. United States </em>(C.A.11, 1990), 893 F.2d 1287. We hold that the two-prong analysis found in <em>Strickland </em>is the appropriate level of review to determine whether an appellant has raised a \u201cgenuine issue\u201d in an application for reopening an appeal under App.R. 26(B)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-11\">In the present case, appellant contends that his appellate counsel was ineffective in failing to raise the trial court\u2019s denial of his constitutional right to represent himself. In <em>Faretta v. California </em>(1975), 422 U.S. 806, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562, the United States Supreme Court held, without equivocation, that a criminal defendant has a Sixth Amendment right to self-representation. In <em>McKaskle v. Wiggins </em>(1984), 465 U.S. 168, 177, 104 S.Ct. 944, 950, 79 L.Ed.2d 122, 133, at fn. 8, the court further held that the denial of the right to self-representation is reversible error <em>per se </em>and therefore that it may not be subjected to the harmless-error analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-12\">Upon examining appellant\u2019s appellate counsel\u2019s performance in its entirety, we find that appellant has met both prongs of the <em>Strickland </em>standard. The failure to raise a constitutional issue of such magnitude as self-representation clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>constitutes deficient performance. It is equally clear that, since appellant had a \u201creasonable probability\u201d of success if this claim had been asserted, appellate counsel\u2019s failure to do so was prejudicial. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s appeal must be reopened so the court of appeals can determine whether Reed was denied his right to represent himself. We reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand with instructions to grant appellant\u2019s application to reopen his appeal and consider the merits of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b780-6\">Moyer, C.J., Pfeifer and Cook, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"AWVv\">Douglas, Resnick and F.E.
