For the reasons that follow, we answer this question in the negative and, accordingly, reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">Handicap discrimination in employment situations is prohibited by R.C. 4112.02(A).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This statutory<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> provision provides that:</p>\n<p id=\"b545-11\">\u201cIt shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice:</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>\u201c(A) For any employer, because of the race, color, religion, sex, national origin, <em>handicap, </em>age, or ancestry of any person, to discharge without just cause, to refuse to hire, or otherwise to discriminate against that person with respect to hire, tenure, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, or any matter directly or indirectly related to employment.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">This court has held that in order to establish a prima facie case of handicap discrimination, the person seeking relief must demonstrate (1) that he or she was handicapped, (2) that an adverse employment action was taken by an employer, at least in part, because the individual was handicapped, and (3) that the person, though handicapped, can safely and substantially perform the essential functions of the job in question. <em>Hazlett v. Martin Chevrolet, Inc. </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 279, 281, 25 OBR 331, 333, 496 N.E.2d 478, 480. Once the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of handicap discrimination, the burden then shifts to the employer to set forth some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the action taken. <em>Plumbers &amp; Steamfitters Joint Apprenticeship Commt. v. Ohio Civ. Rights Comm. </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 192, 197, 20 O.O.3d 200, 203, 421 N.E.2d 128, 132. Legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for the action taken by the employer may include, but are not limited to, insubordination on the part of the employee claiming discrimination, or the inability of the employee or prospective employee to safely and substantially perform, with reasonable accommodations, the essential functions of the job in question. See, <em>e.g., </em>Ohio Adm.Code 4112-5-08(D)(4) and (E). Finally, if the employer establishes a nondiscriminatory reason for the action taken, then the employee or prospective employee must demonstrate that the employer\u2019s stated reason was a pretext for impermissible discrimination. <em>Plumbers &amp; Steamfitters Joint Apprenticeship Commt., supra, </em>66 Ohio St.2d at 198, 20 O.O.3d at 203, 421 N.E.2d at 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">The case we now have before us concerns only whether appellant was \u201chandicapped\u201d \u2014 the first element of a prima facie case of handicap discrimination. The version of R.C. 4112.01(A)(13), in effect at the time appellant\u2019s employment was terminated by her employer, provided that:</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">\u201c(13) \u2018Handicap\u2019 means a medically diagnosable, abnormal condition which is expected to continue for a considerable length of time, whether correctable or uncorrectable by good medical practice, which can reasonably be expected to limit the person\u2019s functional ability, including, but not limited to, seeing, hearing, thinking, ambulating, climbing, descending, lifting, grasping, sitting, rising, any related function, or any limitation due to weakness and significantly decreased endurance, so that he can not perform his everyday routine living and working without significantly increased hardship and vulnerability to what are considered the everyday obstacles and hazards encountered by the nonhandicapped.\u201d 143 Ohio Laws, Part III, 4156.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>In <em>Hazlett, supra, </em>this court reviewed former R.C. 4112.01(A)(13) and held that alcohol and drug addiction are, pursuant to the statute, handicaps. <em>Id. </em>at syllabus. See, also, <em>Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co. v. Ohio Civ. Rights Comm. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 222, 31 OBR 430, 510 N.E.2d 368.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>Hazlett, </em>this court recognized that drug addiction can create a debilitating chemical imbalance that is an abnormal physical condition, that such an addiction may limit the user\u2019s functional ability, and that the effects of the drug can remain in the body for a considerable period of time. <em>Id., </em>25 Ohio St.3d at 280, 25 OBR at 332, 496 N.E.2d at 479. Recognizing this, we also find that cancer <em>may </em>be a \u201chandicap\u201d as that term is defined in former R.C. 4112.01(A)(13). Obviously, however, given the requirements of the statute and the fact that many types and forms of the disease exist, the determination whether cancer is a handicap should be made on a case-by-case basis. In reaching this conclusion, we do not wish to imply that cancer is not a serious condition. Indeed, many individuals have been afflicted by and suffer from this dreadful disease. However, there may be instances where cancer is not so pernicious in its effect to warrant a finding that the person who is afflicted with the disease is \u201chandicapped\u201d as that term is defined in former R.C. 4112.01(A)(13).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In this regard, we reject appellant\u2019s contention that cancer should be classified, in all cases, as a <em>per se </em>handicap.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Having determined that cancer may be a handicap, we next consider whether the court of appeals in the case at bar erred in finding that appellant\u2019s testimony in support of her motion for summary judgment was insufficient to establish \u201cthat she suffered a covered condition and was within the class to be protected.\u201d In particular, the court determined that appellant\u2019s affidavit was \u201cself-serving\u201d testimony and hearsay, and that expert medical testimony was necessary to demonstrate that she suffered from her alleged handicap. We disagree. While the better practice in this type of situation would have been to submit expert medical testimony, we do not believe that under the circumstances of this particular case such testimony was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Civ.R. 56 sets forth the requirements that must be applied in determining whether appellees are entitled to summary judgment. Hence, to meet the requirements of Civ.R. 56(C), it must be demonstrated that: \u201c(1) No genuine issue as to any material fact remains to be litigated; (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and viewing such evidence most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made.\u201d <em>Davis v. Loopco Industries, Inc. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 64, 65-66, 609 N.E.2d 144, 145, citing <em>Temple v. Wean United, Inc. </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 317, 327, 4 O.O.3d 466, 472, 364 N.E.2d 267, 274. Furthermore, \u201c[bjecause summary judgment is a procedural device to terminate litigation, it must be awarded with caution. Doubts must be resolved in favor of the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Davis, supra, </em>66 Ohio St.3d at 66, 609 N.E.2d at 145, citing <em>Murphy v. Reynoldsburg </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 356, 358-359, 604 N.E.2d 138, 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The evidence in the record, construed in appellant\u2019s favor as required by Civ.R. 56, supports a finding that appellant\u2019s ailment was an abnormal, diagnosable, long-term condition, and that her condition caused functional limitations resulting in significantly increased hardship and vulnerability to everyday obstacles and hazards. Specifically, appellant testified that she had been diagnosed with bladder cancer (which is now not seriously contested by appellees) and that she had, by necessity, undergone numerous chemotherapy treatments over an extended period of time. The record also reveals that Diamond was aware that appellant had received chemotherapy treatments. Additionally, appellant also explained how her illness had required hospitalization and that the treatments she received in attempting to combat the disease adversely affected her everyday living and working environment. Such testimony was clearly within the personal knowledge of appellant. See Civ.R. 56(E)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and Evid.R. 602.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, applying the standards of Civ.R. 56, we find that questions whether appellant was \u201chandicapped\u201d pursuant to former R.C. 4112.01(A)(13), for purposes of summary judgment, must be resolved in appellant\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Accordingly, we hold that summary judgment was improperly granted in favor of appellees. We reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand this cause to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b548-8\">Resnick, F.E.

R.C. 4112.01 and 4112.02 have an interesting legislative history. The General Assembly amended both sections with an effective date of May 31,1990. 143 Ohio Laws, Part III, 4154. As part of the amendment to R.C. 4112.02, the General Assembly, at the conclusion of the text, said that \u201c[t]his is an interim section effective only until January 1,1994.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4162. At the same time as the 1990 amendments were adopted, the General Assembly <em>also </em>passed a second new version of R.C. 4112.02, to be effective January 1, 1994. <em>Id. </em>at 4162-4168.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-13\">But before the 1994 date was reached, the General Assembly then passed new versions of R.C. 4112.01 and 4112.02, with an effective date of June 30, 1992. 144 Ohio Laws, Part III, 4743. As part of this legislation, the General Assembly repealed the version of R.C. 4112.02 which was to have taken effect on January 1, 1994. <em>Id. </em>at 4782.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-14\">Thus, the law in effect today, as regards R.C. 4112.01 and 4112.02, is the version of the law enacted effective June 30,1992. However, the law we deal with in the case at bar is the version of both R.C. 4112.01 and 4112.02 effective May 31, 1990, since the discrimination alleged occurred on December 9, <em>1991 </em>\u2014 i.e., before the revised statute (effective June 30, 1992) which is now in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-15\">For any case of an alleged unlawful discriminatory practice involving handicaps, alcohol and/or drugs occurring after June 30,1992, interested persons are cautioned to review the current version of R.C. 4112.01 and 4112.02 and, specifically, R.C. 4112.01(A)(13) and 4112.02(Q).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b545-16\">.

I respectfully dissent. Although the syllabus law in this case is unassailable, given our summary judgment standard, I agree with the court of appeals and would affirm the summary judgment in favor of Diamond Products.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Diamond Products moved for summary judgment on the basis that Hood could not prove that her cancer was a handicap under former R.C. 4112.01(A)(13). Specifically, Diamond Products contended that Hood could not prove that her cancer clearly limited her \u201cfunctional abilities\u201d or that her cancer affected her ability to perform her \u201ceveryday routine living and working without significantly increased hardship.\u201d Diamond Products\u2019 motion for summary judgment forced Hood \u201cto produce evidence on any issue for which [Hood would bear] the burden of production at trial.\u201d <em>Wing v. Anchor Media, Ltd. of Texas </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 108, 570 N.E.2d 1095, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">The issue in this case is simply whether Hood\u2019s deposition and affidavit were competent evidence to raise an issue of material fact that Hood\u2019s cancer limited her \u201cfunctional ability * * * [to] perform [her] everyday routine living and working without significantly increased hardship and vulnerability to what are considered the everyday obstacles and hazards encountered by the nonhandicapped.\u201d Former R.C. 4112.01(A)(13). (143 Ohio Laws, Part III, 4156.) The statutory definition requires such evidence to relate to \u201ca medically diagnosable, abnormal condition which is expected to continue for a considerable length of time\u201d and \u201cwhich can reasonably be expected to limit the person\u2019s functional ability.\u201d Hood\u2019s testimony on those issues was dependent upon the medical diagnosis and opinion of medical experts.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">While Hood had personal knowledge of her adverse reactions to chemotherapy, her statements concerning the continuation of her cancer and the expectation of the limits of her functional abilities were not based on her firsthand knowledge. Thus, Hood\u2019s evidence as to those issues was not competent under Civ.R. 56(E). Hood, therefore, did not sustain her burden of demonstrating that a dispute on a genuine issue of material fact existed. In my view, the trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of Diamond Products.</p>\n<judges id=\"b549-8\">Moyer, C.J., and Wright, J., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
