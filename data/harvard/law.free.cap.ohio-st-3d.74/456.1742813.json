Appellant asserted that trial counsel was ineffective for allowing the results of ballistics tests to be introduced into evidence without calling the expert who performed the tests. The court of appeals held that appellant failed to show any prejudice because he had failed to demonstrate that, but for the alleged error, the outcome of his trial would have been different. We concur. See <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-14\">Appellant also argued that \u201ctrial counsel was ineffective for failing to offer the jury an explanation of the low levels of antimony and barium on the confessed shooter and failing to offer an alternative explanation of how appellant\u2019s hands could have been contaminated [with these chemicals].\u201d However, the court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>appeals held that the record showed that trial counsel did address that issue, and that, in any case, appellant failed to show prejudice. We concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b701-8\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Wright, Resnick, F.E.
