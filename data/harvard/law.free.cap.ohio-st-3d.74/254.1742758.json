Gay v. Mihm </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 315, 626 N.E.2d 666. The appellate court, however, held that relief consistent with <em>Noll </em>was more appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">We agree that the commission\u2019s order does not satisfy <em>Noll. </em>The commission acknowledged that the claimant\u2019s education and work history were \u201csignificant barriers to his ability to obtain gainful employment,\u201d but then concluded, without further explanation, that claimant had the \u201cvocational aptitude necessary to engage in and/or be trained for light employment.\u201d These two findings are inconsistent without further explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-11\"><em>Noll </em>noncompliance, however, does not compel relief consistent with <em>Gay. </em>The claimant\u2019s nonmedical profile, in this case, is not one that compels but one disability conclusion. Absent such a profile, <em>Gay </em>relief cannot issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-12\">Claimant lastly raises a due process argument, claiming that preparation of the permanent total disability compensation order by a subordinate hearing officer violates the Constitution. <em>State ex rel. Ormet Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1990), 54 Ohio St.3d 102, 561 N.E.2d 920, indicates otherwise. Claimant ignores that the commission is responsible for evaluating and ratifying that order, and is free to accept, reject, or modify it. Thus, by the time the order was ratified, it did indeed reflect the conclusions of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-13\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-14\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b499-15\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.

I would reverse the court of appeals, as I disagree with the proposition that the order of the commission fails to comply with <em>Noll.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">As I do not concur with the conclusion that the commission\u2019s findings are inconsistent without further explanation, I would reverse the court of appeals and deny the writ.</p>\n<judges id=\"b500-6\">Wright, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
