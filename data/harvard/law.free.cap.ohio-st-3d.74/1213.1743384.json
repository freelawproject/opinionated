White seeking the disqualification of Judge Peter J. Panagis in case No. 45133 in the Domestic Relations Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Trumbull County.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-11\">The substance of the affidavit is that affiant\u2019s husband, plaintiff Martin F. White in the captioned case, is a practicing attorney who has appeared \u201con occasion\u201d before Judge Panagis, and that the judge\u2019s relationship, as a judge, with the husband, the husband\u2019s counsel, and other attorneys in the husband\u2019s law office \u201cprevents her from obtaining a fair and impartial hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b949-12\">In his response to these allegations, Judge Panagis denies having more than a passing acquaintance with affiant\u2019s husband, his counsel, or any other attorney associated with the husband. Judge Panagis denies any bias, prejudice, or interest that would affect his ability to fairly and impartially preside in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-13\">Section 5(d) of the Guidelines for Assignment of Judges announced by me on May 24, 1988 states: \u201cThe fact that a local attorney is a litigant should not routinely cause the sitting judge to recuse himself or herself, unless the judge\u2019s relationship with that particular lawyer justifies recusal.\u201d There is no evidence in the record before me that any relationship exists between Judge Panagis and affiant\u2019s husband that would make recusal or disqualification necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-14\">For these reasons, the affidavit of disqualification is found not well taken and is hereby dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
