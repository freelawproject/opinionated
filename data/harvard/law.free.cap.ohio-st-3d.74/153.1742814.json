Each issue involved appellant\u2019s alleged mental incapacity. However, the court of appeals found that \u201c[t]he issue of Peeple\u2019s mental incapacity was previously and properly raised on direct appeal.\u201d Specifically, the court of appeals found that appellant\u2019s problem was not his appellate counsel\u2019s performance, but the fact that his motion to suppress his confession to the murder was denied at trial. We concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the court of appeals for the reasons stated in its opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b398-8\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Wright, Resnick, F.E.
