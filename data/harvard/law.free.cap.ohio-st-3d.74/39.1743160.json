Claimant seeks temporary total disability compensation and medical benefits for several other conditions that have not yet been additionally allowed. Claimant urges that her bleeding and pregnancy complications were symptoms of the allowed condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>tions. Thus, it would appear, no formal allowance for these conditions was required. For the reasons to follow, we find that the commission improperly ordered payment for these conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">R.C. 4123.84(A) reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">\u201c(A) In all cases of injury or death, claims for compensation or benefits for the \u2022 specific part or parts of the body injured shall be forever barred unless, within two years after the injury or death:</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">\u201c(1) Written notice of the specific part or parts of the body claimed to have been injured has been made to the industrial commission or the bureau of workers\u2019 eompensation[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">Discussing this provision, we have observed that:</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">\u201cThe essential requirement of * * * [R.C. 4123.84] is that the injured employee give written notice within two years of the specific part or parts of the body he or she claims to have been injured. These provisions do not require that the claimant give notice of any specific medical condition resulting from injury to those body parts.\u201d <em>Dent v. AT &amp; T Technologies, Inc. </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 187, 189, 527 N.E.2d 821, 824.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">In <em>Dent, </em>the claim was originally allowed for \u201ccontusion and abrasion of the left knee.\u201d Several years later, claimant sought additional recognition for additional conditions of left knee arthritis and chondromalacia. The employer asserted that claimant\u2019s application was barred by R.C. 4123.84\u2019s two-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-11\">We disagreed, writing:</p>\n<p id=\"b285-12\">\u201cWhen appellee filed her initial claim in 1972, it is undisputed that she gave notice of injury to specific body parts, including her left knee. Indeed, appellee\u2019s claim was recognized, in part, for \u2018contusion and abrasion of the left knee,\u2019 as it is apparent that notice was given of injury to the knee. Although notice from the original application did not mention chondromalacia or arthritic changes, neither of these need to be mentioned since they are medically recognized physical changes to parts of the body that were noted in the original claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-13\">\u201cR.C. 4123.84(B) appears to contemplate a residual injury<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as one developing in a body part not originally alleged per R.C. 4123.84(A)(1). Thus, claimant\u2019s application for \u2018chondromalacia of the patella and arthritic changes\u2019 would be unaffected by any statute of limitations for residual conditions, as it is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>additional condition and not a residual injury as contemplated by R.C. 4123.84(B). Therefore, the two-year statute of limitations set forth in R.C. 4123.84 is inapplicable to the facts in the instant case.\u201d (Footnote added.) <em>Id. </em>at 189, 527 N.E.2d at 824.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">In this case, appellees attempt to draw an arbitrary distinction in arguing then-case by classifying the disputed ailments as \u201csymptoms of the allowed conditions,\u201d as opposed to \u201cadditional conditions\u201d or \u201cresidual injuries.\u201d This distinction fails under these facts for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">First, <em>Dent </em>did not excuse those ailments classified as \u201cadditional conditions\u201d from the requirement that they be formally allowed. It found only that the allowance was not subject to R.C. 4123.84\u2019s statute of limitations. \u201cResidual injuries,\u201d of course, clearly contemplate formal allowance; otherwise no statute of limitations applicable thereto would be necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">In the same vein, regardless of whether described as \u201csymptoms\u201d or not, the fact remains that the disputed ailments arose in parts of the body not alleged to be injured in the original application. Formal allowance is, therefore, required.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">Formal allowance is also not excused by our recent decision in <em>State ex rel. Miller v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 229, 643 N.E.2d 113. In that case, the claimant industrially injured her back. Claimant later sought authorization for a supervised weight-loss program. The commission denied authorization because \u201cobesity\u201d had not been formally allowed in the claim. We disagreed, reasoning in part that:</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">\u201cThe reference to \u2018specific part of parts of the body\u2019 is prominent in R.C. 4123.84. The statute is concerned primarily with compensation for a specific body part hurt, not with compensing for the nature of injury \u2014 for example, sprain or fracture \u2014 related thereto. <em>Dent v. AT &amp; T Technologies, Inc. </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 187, 527 N.E.2d 821.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">\u201cThe mechanics of R.C. 4123.84 are irreconcilable with the concept of obesity as an allowed condition. First, obesity is usually a generalized condition. It cannot, therefore, be restricted to a specific body part or parts as R.C. 4123.84 envisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 233, 643 N.E.2d at 116.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\"><em>Miller </em>does not excuse formal allowance of the disputed conditions here because unlike \u201cobesity,\u201d the conditions here are specific and not general. <em>Dent </em>still controls in this case, and formal allowance is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-11\">The appellate judgment is hereby reversed, and the writ is allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-12\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and writ allowed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b287-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Wright, Pfeifer and Cook, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b287-5\">Resnick, J., dissents.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b287-6\">F.E.
