Martin from further proceedings in the above-captioned case.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-11\">Affiant alleges that Judge Martin\u2019s recusal from previous cases in which affiant was a party is grounds for the judge\u2019s disqualification from the pending case.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-12\">The voluntary recusal by a judge from an earlier case does not by itself support the judge\u2019s disqualification from another unrelated case involving the same party.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-13\">For this reason, the affidavit of disqualification is found not well taken and is hereby denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
