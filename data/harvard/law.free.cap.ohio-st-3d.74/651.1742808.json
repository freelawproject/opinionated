Mellon Bank contends that R.C. 5715.19(A)(2)(d) applies to this case because the lease amendment that it entered into with Nationwide created a new \u201coccupancy,\u201d and the lease rental received under the amended lease will result in a reduction in rental income of more than fifteen percent. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-10\">The sole occupant of the entire property, both before and after the amendment, was Nationwide. The only changes that occurred as a result of the amendment were an extension of the term of the lease and a reduction in the rental payments made to Mellon. Nevertheless, Mellon Bank contends that \u201cthe execution of a new lease must necessarily involve the creation of a new tenancy and, concomitantly, a new occupancy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b897-11\">A reading of R.C. 5715.19(A)(2)(d) shows that there are two elements which must be satisfied for it to be applicable. First, there must have been \u201can increase or decrease of at least fifteen percent in the <em>property\u2019s occupancy,\u201d </em>and second, that increase or decrease in the property\u2019s occupancy must have \u201chad a substantial economic impact on the <em>property.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Although the term \u201coccupancy\u201d is used numerous times throughout the Revised Code, it is only defined in R.C. 5722.01(F), which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b897-12\">\u201c \u2018Occupancy\u2019 means the actual, continuous, and exclusive use and possession of a parcel by a person having a lawful right to such use and possession.\u201d The statutory definition of \u201coccupancy\u201d set forth in R.C. 5722.01(F) comports with that found in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6 Ed.1990) 1078, which states that \u201coccupancy\u201d is:</p>\n<p id=\"b897-13\">\u201cTaking possession of property and use of the same; said <em>e.g. </em>of a tenant\u2019s use of leased premises. Period during which person owns, rents, or otherwise occupies real property or premises. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b897-14\">The relevant criteria used in the above definitions of \u201coccupancy\u201d are \u201cuse\u201d and \u201cpossession.\u201d For leased property, an increase or decrease in occupancy is measured by how much of the property is used and possessed by the tenants. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>For example, if one tenant possesses the entire property and later the entire property is occupied by five tenants, the occupancy of the property has not increased or decreased, only the number of occupants has changed. Furthermore, the rent received for a property does not measure the amount of use and possession of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">In this case the amendment of the lease did not increase or decrease the amount of square footage occupied by Nationwide. Therefore, there was no change in the property\u2019s occupancy and R.C. 5715.19(A)(2)(d) was not applicable to Mellon Bank\u2019s second complaint filed in the same interim period.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">We affirm the decision of the BTA, dismissing the complaint, as being reasonable and lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">\n<em>Decision affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b898-8\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Wright, Resnick, F.E.
