Respondent is, therefore, suspended from the practice of law in Ohio for one year; however, this suspension period is suspended and he is placed on a two-year probation period, provided that during this period no disciplinary complaints against respondent are certified to the board by a probable cause panel and that respondent meets regularly with an attorney appointed by relator to supervise his compliance with the Disciplinary Rules.
