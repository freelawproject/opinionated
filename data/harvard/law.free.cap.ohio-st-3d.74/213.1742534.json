Respondent also complains that he was permitted only an hour or so to show that his disqualification and sanction did not rise to the level of professional misconduct. We reject these arguments because respondent cites no authority to suggest that an unfettered opportunity to collaterally attack final court orders is constitutionally required in disciplinary proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">Respondent also takes issue with many of the board\u2019s findings of fact pertaining to the allegations of his misconduct in court; however, these infractions are hardly our main concern. We are most troubled, as was the panel and board, by respondent\u2019s propensity to scheme and deceive without any moral appreciation for the lies he tells or the fraud he perpetrates. Indeed, we find respondent\u2019s testimony and conduct as manifested in this record so duplicitous that we cannot credit even the representations he offers to support his objections. His objections are, therefore, overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">Upon review of the record, we concur in the board\u2019s findings that respondent violated DR 1-102(A)(3), (4), (5), and (6) as alleged in Counts I and II of the complaint. We also fully agree that the final orders issued by Judges Rogers and Walker, together with the testimony of both judges, provided ample credible evidence that respondent violated DR 5-101(B), 5-103(A), and 7-102(A)(l). Finally, we concur that respondent\u2019s misconduct warrants the sanction of perma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>nent disbarment. Respondent is, therefore, ordered permanently disbarred from the practice of law in Ohio.
