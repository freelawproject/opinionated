The court of appeals <em>sua sponte </em>denied the requested writs on the basis that appellants possessed an adequate legal remedy. This denial constituted a summary dismissal, which this court, reviews to determine if the court of appeals abused its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>discretion. <em>State ex rel. Hipp v. N. Canton </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 102, 103, 637 N.E.2d 317, 318. The term \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>State ex rel. Cassels v. Dayton City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 217, 223, 631 N.E.2d 150, 155.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">In general, a court may dismiss a complaint on its own motion pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6), failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, only after the parties are given notice of the court\u2019s intention to dismiss and an opportunity to respond. <em>State ex rel. Edwards v. Toledo City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 106, 108, 647 N.E.2d 799, 801. However, <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal without notice is appropriate where the complaint is frivolous or the claimant obviously cannot prevail on the facts alleged in the complaint. <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Baker v. Dir., U.S. Parole Comm. </em>(C.A.D.C.1990), 916 F.2d 725, and <em>English v. Cowell </em>(C.A.7, 1993), 10 F.3d 434. Here, the court of appeals did not give the parties prior notice of its intention to dismiss and an opportunity to respond. Consequently, we must determine if appellants\u2019 claims are frivolous or obviously without merit. <em>Edwards, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">In initially considering the claims for writs of mandamus and prohibition against the domestic relations division, absent a patent and unambiguous lack of jurisdiction, a court having general subject-matter jurisdiction can determine its own jurisdiction, and a party challenging the court\u2019s jurisdiction has an adequate remedy by appeal. <em>State ex rel. Enyart v. O\u2019Neill </em>(1995), 71 Ohio St.3d 655, 656, 646 N.E.2d 1110, 1112. However, where an inferior court patently and unambiguously lacks jurisdiction over the cause, mandamus and prohibition will lie to prevent any future unauthorized exercise of jurisdiction and to correct the results of prior jurisdictionally unauthorized actions. <em>State ex rel. Lewis v. Moser </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 25, 28, 647 N.E.2d 155, 157; <em>State ex rel. Adams v. Gusweiler </em>(1972), 30 Ohio St.2d 326, 330, 59 O.O.2d 387, 389, 285 N.E.2d 22, 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">R.C. 3105.21(B) vests a domestic relations court with jurisdiction to determine custody issues even though a divorce action is dismissed due to a failure to prosecute. <em>State ex rel. Easterday v. Zieba </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 251, 255, 569 N.E.2d 1028, 1032. However, the domestic relations court lacks jurisdiction under R.C. 3105.21(B) to exercise further jurisdiction in a divorce proceeding if the parties voluntarily dismiss their claims pursuant to Civ.R. 41(A)(1). See <em>Lilly v. Lilly </em>(1985), 26 Ohio App.3d 192, 193, 26 OBR 412, 413, 499 N.E.2d 21, 23. When a case has been properly dismissed pursuant to Civ.R. 41(A)(1), the court patently and unambiguously lacks jurisdiction to proceed and a writ of prohibition will issue to prevent the exercise of jurisdiction. <em>State ex rel. Hunt v. Thompson </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 182, 183, 586 N.E.2d 107, 108; see, also, <em>State ex rel. Rice v. McGrath </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 70, 577 N.E.2d 1100 (trial court lacks jurisdiction to proceed when a case has been unconditionally dismissed).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>Appellants claim that the parties to the divorce proceeding, Mary and Adam Fogle, dismissed the case on August 7, 1992 pursuant to Civ.R. 41(A)(1)(b) (\u201c[A]n action may be dismissed by the plaintiff without order of the court * * * by filing a stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties who have appeared in the action.\u201d). Appellees contend that the attempted voluntary dismissal by stipulation of the parties was ineffective because it did not contain the signature of Judith Prince, the paternal grandmother.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Appellees rely on the October 9, 1992 referee\u2019s report, the November 24, 1992 entry of Judge Steiner, and the February 22, 1994 <em>nunc pro tunc </em>entry of Judge Steiner. The referee\u2019s report specifies that the purported dismissal was invalid, where Prince did not sign or consent to it because of the court\u2019s prior entry granting custody <em>pendente lite </em>to Prince. However, the custody award under Civ.R. 75(M)(1) was only effective during the \u201c \u2018pendency of the action for divorce,\u2019 \u201d which ended upon the parties\u2019 dismissal of the action. See <em>Lilly, supra, </em>26 Ohio App.3d at 194, 26 OBR at 414, 499 N.E.2d at 24. The referee\u2019s report never indicated that Prince had ever been made a party to the action. In fact, the motion for custody <em>pendente lite </em>granted by the domestic relations court was filed by Adam Fogle, and a memorandum in support thereof merely stated that his mother was \u201cwilling to take temporary custody of the two minor children until such time as the court makes a determination as to the suitability of each parent for the custody of the minor children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">As to Judge Steiner\u2019s November 24, 1992 entry, he stated that the attempted dismissal by Mary and Adam Fogle was ineffective, since Prince had been \u201cjoined as a party and acquired the status of a third party to the suit pursuant to an entry filed August 4, 1992,\u201d <em>ie., </em>three days prior to the date the notice of dismissal was filed. Nevertheless, the only entry filed by Judge Steiner on August 4, 1992 granted Adam Fogle\u2019s motion for continuance of a previously scheduled temporary custody hearing because of the agreement of the parties and Prince\u2019s intent to subsequently request to be joined as a party. The entry did not join Prince as a party, and Prince did not file any motion to be joined as a party prior to the August 7, 1992 notice of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Appellees finally rely on Judge Steiner\u2019s February 22, 1994 <em>nunc pro tunc </em>entry ordering that Prince be named a third-party defendant in the divorce case \u201ceffective August 4, 1992.\u201d However, this entry was not journalized until well after the court of appeals\u2019 <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of appellants\u2019 extraordinary writ action. \u201cA reviewing court cannot add matter to the record before it, which was not part of the trial court\u2019s proceedings, and then decide the appeal on the basis of the new matter.\u201d <em>State v. Ishmail </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 402, 8 O.O.3d 405, 377 N.E.2d 500, paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>In re Contested Election of November 2, 1993 </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 411, 413, 650 N.E.2d 859, 861.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>Therefore, after construing the allegations of appellants\u2019 complaint concerning their claims for mandamus and prohibition pertaining to Judge Steiner, Referee Rickrich, and the domestic relations court most strongly in appellants\u2019 favor, the court of appeals abused its discretion in <em>sua sponte </em>dismissing these claims without notice, since they are neither frivolous nor obviously devoid of merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Generally, reversal of a court of appeals\u2019 erroneous dismissal of a complaint based upon failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted requires a remand to that court for further proceedings. <em>State ex rel. Natl. Emp. Benefit Serv., Inc. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Court of Common Pleas </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 49, 50, 550 N.E.2d 941, 943, fn. 1. However, the court\u2019s plenary authority in extraordinary actions vests it with discretion to consider an appeal as of right as if it had been originally filed in this court. <em>State ex rel. Natalina Food Co. v. Ohio Civ. Rights Comm. </em>(1990), 55 Ohio St.3d 98, 99, 562 N.E.2d 1383, 1384, citing <em>State ex rel. Pressley v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1967), 11 Ohio St.2d 141, 40 O.O.2d 141, 228 N.E.2d 631, paragraph ten of the syllabus. In that the parties appear to be in agreement about the pertinent facts, <em>i.e., </em>the filings in the domestic relations court, it is appropriate to exercise this authority and address the merits. <em>Natl. Emp. Benefit Serv., Inc., supra, </em>49 Ohio St.3d at 50, 550 N.E.2d at 943, fn. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">A court of record speaks only through its journal entries. <em>In re Adoption of Gibson </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St.3d 170, 173, 23 OBR 336, 338, 492 N.E.2d 146, 148, fn. 3. The filings in the divorce action indicate that Prince was not made a party to the action prior to the August 7, 1992 notice of dismissal signed by Mary and Adam Fogle. Prince did not file any motion to intervene prior to the notice of dismissal and there is no entry filed prior to that date joining her as a third-party defendant. As specified previously, the referee\u2019s October 9, 1992 reliance on a prior <em>pendente lite </em>custody award and Judge Steiner\u2019s November 24,1992 citation of his previous August 4, 1992 entry granting an agreed motion for continuance were patently erroneous. In fact, the referee\u2019s report of May 18, 1993 acknowledged that Prince had not been previously added as a third-party defendant. When the court added her as a party by entry on the same date, the notice of dismissal had already been filed. Moreover, this attempted addition of Prince as a party to the divorce action also followed appellants\u2019 action in the court of appeals for writs of mandamus and prohibition against Judge Steiner and Referee Rickrich.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Finally, over one year following the parties\u2019 notice of dismissal in the divorce action and while this appeal was pending, Judge Steiner issued his February 22, 1994 <em>nunc pro tunc </em>entry purporting to name Prince as a third-party defendant \u201ceffective August 4, 1992.\u201d In considering this entry pursuant to our plenary authority, see <em>Natalina Food Co. </em>and <em>Natl. Emp. Benefit Serv., Inc., supra, </em>courts and administrative tribunals possess inherent authority to correct errors in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>judgment entries so that the record speaks the truth. <em>In re Estate of Cook </em>(1969), 19 Ohio St.2d 121, 127, 48 O.O.2d 113, 116, 249 N.E.2d 799, 803; see <em>Garfield Hts. City School Dist. v. State Bd. of Edn. </em>(1992), 85 Ohio App.3d 117, 123, 619 N.E.2d 429, 433. However, <em>nunc pro tunc </em>entries are limited in proper use to reflecting what the court actually decided, not what the court might or should have decided or what the court intended to decide. <em>Webb v. W. Res. Bond &amp; Share Co. </em>(1926), 115 Ohio St. 247, 256, 153 N.E. 289, 291; see <em>State v. Greulich </em>(1988), 61 Ohio App.3d 22, 25, 572 N.E.2d 132, 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">When a court enters a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>entry backdated to the time the court intended to dismiss an action with prejudice after a Civ.R. 41(A) voluntary dismissal without prejudice had been filed, the <em>nunc pro tunc </em>entry is a nullity, having prospective effect only, and the voluntary dismissal terminates the court\u2019s jurisdiction. See <em>Torres v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>(1980), 68 Ohio App.2d 87, 22 O.O.3d 99, 427 N.E.2d 32; see, generally, McCormac, Ohio Civil Rules Practice (2 Ed.1992) 384, Section 13.32; see, also, <em>Sutton v. M.A.N. </em>(Sept. 8, 1993), Hamilton App. No. C-920533, unreported, at fn. 2, 1993 WL 342233 (\u201cThe trial court\u2019s characterization of its order as <em>nunc pro tunc </em>is without effect because the trial court was without authority to give its entry retroactive effect after the case had been voluntarily dismissed without prejudice.\u201d). In that it is manifest from a review of the pertinent filings and entries in the divorce action that Prince was not joined as a party prior to the dismissal, the belated <em>nunc pro tunc </em>entry was ineffective because it did not reflect an actual court decision preceding the August 7, 1992 stipulated dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Based on the foregoing, the domestic relations court patently and unambiguously lacked jurisdiction to proceed in the divorce action, and appellants are entitled to writs of mandamus and prohibition vacating all orders entered by the court following the August 7, 1992 notice of dismissal and preventing it from exercising further jurisdiction in the divorce proceeding. <em>Hunt </em>and <em>Rice, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Appellants also raised claims in the court of appeals for writs of mandamus and procedendo against Licking County Common Pleas Court, Juvenile Division Judge Mike Radabaugh. These claims were premised on the juvenile court\u2019s July 1, 1992 entry vacating its prior allowance of a writ of habeas corpus in favor of Mary Fogle. However, the juvenile court possessed jurisdiction to vacate its prior decision. Appellants do not specifically contend otherwise on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">The juvenile court vacated its previous order because of the domestic relations court\u2019s vacation of its temporary-custody award to Mary Fogle. Any error by the juvenile court in its vacation entry could have been raised on appeal. The availability of an appeal from the juvenile court\u2019s July 1, 1992 entry precludes extraordinary relief in mandamus and procedendo. See <em>State ex rel. Levin v. Sheffield Lake </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 104, 109-110, 637 N.E.2d 319, 324. There<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>fore, the court of appeals did not err in <em>sua sponte </em>dismissing appellants\u2019 claims as to Judge Radabaugh and the juvenile court, since the claims were obviously without merit. <em>Edwards, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals dismissing appellants\u2019 claims against Judge Steiner, Referee Rickrich, and the Licking County Common Pleas Court, Domestic Relations Division, is reversed, and the requested writs of mandamus and prohibition are granted. Judith Prince therefore has no present legal right to the possession or custody of the Fogle children. The judgment of the court of appeals dismissing the claims against Judge Radabaugh and the Licking County Common Pleas Court, Juvenile Division is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed in part, reversed in part and units granted.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b409-7\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Wright, Resnick, F.E.
