Sections 3 and 7, Article XVIII, Ohio Constitution. Included within the above grant of authority is the power of taxation. See <em>State ex rel. Zielonka, City Solr. v. Carrel, Aud. </em>[1919] 99 Ohio St. 220[, 124 N.E. 134].\u201d <em>Thompson v. Cincinnati </em>(1965), 2 Ohio St.2d 292, 294, 31 O.O.2d 563, 564, 208 N.E.2d 747, 749-750.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-11\">That power, however, is subject to \u201cpre-emption by the General Assembly of the field of income taxation and subject to the power of the General Assembly to limit the power of municipalities to levy taxes under Section 13 of Article XVIII or Section 6 of Article XIII of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d <em>Angell v. Toledo </em>(1950), 153 Ohio St. 179, 41 O.O. 217, 91 N.E.2d 250, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>In 1971, the General Assembly enacted R.C. Chapter 5747 to provide for an annual individual state income tax. Effective July 1, 1989, the General Assembly enacted Am.Sub.H.B. No. Ill, 143 Ohio Laws, Part II, 2330, 2615, which amended R.C. 5747.02 to provide for an annual income tax \u201con every individual and estate earning or receiving lottery winnings, prizes or awards pursuant to Chapter 3770. of the Revised Code.\u201d However, R.C. 5747.02 specifically disclaims any intent to preempt income taxation by municipalities.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">R.C. 5707.03 and 5707.04 imposed a state property tax on intangibles, measured by income yield. In <em>Ohio Fin. Co. v. Toledo </em>(1955), 163 Ohio St. 81, 83, 56 O.O. 74, 75, 125 N.E.2d 731, 732, the court held that \u201c[i]t is apparent therefore that the General Assembly has occupied a field which includes taxation of the income yield from intangibles.\u201d Subsequent legislation, however, in effect repealed these sections. As explained by the court of appeals in <em>Columbus Div. of Income Tax v. Boles </em>(1992), 78 Ohio App.3d 617, 624-625, 605 N.E.2d 981, 986:</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">\u201c * * * The state property taxes on intangibles in R.C. 5707.03 and 5707.04 were phased out by enactment of Am.Sub.H.B. No. 291 in 1983. The last year for such taxes was 1985. Thus, the door was then opened for this type of income taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">\u201cBecause of this, the Uniform Municipal Income Tax Act was amended in 1986 by Am.Sub.S.B. No. 238. By this enactment, division (C) [now division (F)(3) ] was added to R.C. 718.01 to prevent taxation [by municipal corporations] of \u2018intangible\u2019 income.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">Thus, although the power of municipalities to levy an income tax is not impliedly preempted, it is limited, as relevant here, to the extent that R.C. 718.01(F)(3) precludes municipalities from taxing intangible income.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">R.C. 718.01(A)(4) defines \u201cintangible income\u201d as \u201cincome of any of the following types: income yield, interest, dividends, or other income arising from the ownership, sale, exchange, or other disposition of intangible property including, but not limited to, investments, deposits, money, or credits as those terms are defined in Chapter 5701. of the Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-10\">R.C. 5701.06(C)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> defines \u201cinvestments\u201d as including, among other things, \u201cAnnuities, royalties, and other contractual obligations for the periodical payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>of money and all contractual and other incorporeal rights of a pecuniary nature from which income is or may be derived, however evidenced,\u201d excepting five categories not relevant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The lower courts found that lottery winnings constitute intangible income under R.C. 718.01(A)(4) and are precluded from taxation by any municipality pursuant to R.C. 718.01(F)(3). The courts\u2019 basis for this conclusion was twofold. First, the lower courts found that lottery winnings result from the disposition of intangible property, <em>i.e., </em>the lottery ticket. A lottery ticket is intangible property because it is an asset that represents valuable legal rights to the holder, but has no physical substance or intrinsic value; and since the language of R.C. 718.01(A)(4) is inclusive, and not limiting, it can be read to encompass income arising from a lottery ticket.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Second, \u201cthe nature of a state lottery ticket and the rights which accrue to the purchaser establish that it is a contractual relationship for value given with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>right to payment from the State of an indefinite sum upon the happening of a condition subsequent, <em>i.e.[,] </em>the correct identification of randomly selected numbers.\u201d By this characterization, the courts were able to pigeonhole lotteries into the investment classification of R.C. 5701.06(C), and bring lottery winnings within R.C. 718.01(A)(4)\u2019s definition of \u201cintangible income.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">A lottery is a game of chance and is gambling. \u201c[A] lottery is a species or form of gambling.\u201d <em>Westerhaus Co. v. Cincinnati </em>(1956), 165 Ohio St. 327, 339, 59 O.O. 428, 434, 135 N.E.2d 318, 327. It is \u201ca scheme for the distribution of prizes by lot or chance.\u201d <em>Troy Amusement Co. v. Attenweiler </em>(1940), 64 Ohio App. 105, 116, 17 O.O. 443, 448, 28 N.E.2d 207, 213; see <em>Stevens v. Cincinnati Times-Star Co. </em>(1905), 72 Ohio St. 112, 73 N.E. 1058. The essential elements of a lottery are prize, chance and consideration. <em>Finster v. Keller </em>(1971), 18 Cal.App.3d 836, 843, 96 Cal.Rptr. 241, 245. See, generally, 51 Ohio Jurisprudence 3d (1984) 429, Gambling, Section 5; 54 Corpus Juris Secundum, Lotteries (1987) 485-488, Sections 3 through 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">A lottery ticket is a chance. <em>United States v. Baker </em>(C.A.3, 1966), 364 F.2d 107, 111. It is \u201c \u2018merely the evidence or token of the holder\u2019s participation in the lottery and the number which determines his right to share in the distribution resolved by chance after the sale.\u2019 \u201d <em>Silbert v. State </em>(1971), 12 Md.App. 516, 533, 280 A.2d 55, 65, quoting <em>State v. Friedman </em>(1947), 135 N.J.L. 419, 420-421, 52 A.2d 416, 418, affirmed <em>State v. Friedman </em>(1948), 136 N.J.L. 634, 57 A.2d 390.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq_F\">The scope of the term \u201cinvestment\u201d is ultimately determined by how it is defined in R.C. 5701.06. However, since R.C. 5701.06 is inclusive in nature, and makes no specific reference to lottery winnings, of necessity, for legal construction, we are required to consult the common definitions to ascertain whether lottery winnings can fairly be classified as investments within the language of R.C. 5701.06(C). The term \u201cinvestment\u201d is defined in Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1986) 1190, as \u201cthe expenditure of money for income or profit.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6 Ed.1990) 825, defines \u201cinvestment\u201d as \u201c[a]n expenditure to acquire property or other assets in order to produce revenue; the asset so acquired. The placing of capital or laying out of money in a way intended to secure income or profit from its employment.\u201d Similarly, \u201cinvestment\u201d has, been judicially defined as \u201cthe laying out of money with the view of obtaining an income or profit from the thing bought, whether it be an interest in a business, a farm, stocks or bonds; to place money so that it will be safe and yield a profit.\u201d <em>State v. Gibbs </em>(1908), 18 Ohio Dec. 694, 696, 7 Ohio N.P. (N.S.) 371, 372-373.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">In <em>State ex rel Atty. Gen. v. Interstate Savings Invest. Co. </em>(1901), 64 Ohio St. 283, 60 N.E. 220, paragraph one of the syllabus, the court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>\u201cContracts of investment security, debentures or certificates, which by the device of a \u2018numeral-apart,\u2019 may be called in and redeemed at any period before they would regularly accumulate a credit in the reserve fund equal to the stipulated endowment value, and otherwise giving unequal advantages to the certificate holders, contain the elements of chance and prize constituting a lottery, and are unlawful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Other courts have similarly held with respect to bonds issued according to a scheme involving the elements of chance and prize. <em>Siver v. Guarantee Invest. Co. </em>(1904), 183 Mo. 41, 81 S.W. 1098; <em>Horner v. United States </em>(1893), 147 U.S. 449, 13 S.Ct. 409, 37 L.Ed. 237; <em>Ballock v. State </em>(1890), 73 Md. 1, 20 A. 184.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">In a colorful opinion issued by the court in <em>United States v. McDonald </em>(D.C.Ill.1893), 59 F. 563, it was held that a bond investment scheme dependent upon the probability of lapses (possessing characteristics similar to the investment scheme at issue in <em>Interstate Savings Invest. Co., </em>supra) is a scheme in which the prize is dependent upon chance and, therefore, constitutes a lottery. The court explained as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">\u201cNow, every enterprise in which we engage has a return or prize, or is supposed to have. That is the incentive which makes men industrious and active. Whether that return or prize be determinable by mere lot or chance makes it either a legitimate enterprise, or a lottery, and therefore an unlawful enterprise. We perhaps can illustrate that best by referring to some of the schemes of life in which men are engaged. Take, for instance, the life insurance companies, \u2014 those that proceed either on the stock plan or on the assessment plan. They require of the member that he pay in a certain amount of money. That is the pecuniary consideration. That money is invested, or supposed to be invested, in securities, and, when the member dies, a certain amount, stipulated in the policy, is paid to his heirs or the beneficiary named in the policy. That is the return. The man may have been insured but a month, and have paid in but a few dollars, and have received back $5,000 or $10,000. In such instances as that, a much larger sum has been returned than the consideration, but the fact that there was such a return does not make it an unlawful enterprise. Why? Because the prize is not determinable by, or dependent upon, chance or lot. It is dependent upon the life of a man, and the life of a man is determined by the laws of nature, and not by the chances of lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">\u201cA man who makes an investment in real estate may put in a few thousand dollars, and take out a million. What he puts in is the consideration; what he takes out is the prize. It may be a hundredfold larger than what he puts in, but on what is it dependent? Upon the growth of the town in which he lives; upon the growth of public sentiment respecting the value of property in that particular locality; upon the law of growth, which is itself a natural one, \u2014 an industrial law. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>But suppose a man puts a ticket in a hat with a hundred other tickets, and then it is drawn by a blindfolded man, his chance of the prize offered is dependent upon that drawing. The ticket may cost but 50 cents. The prize may be worth $10,\u2014 much larger than the price of the ticket, though not larger in proportion than the life insurance policy or the real estate investment. But the getting of the prize is dependent upon the chance or lot of his ticket being drawn, not upon any natural law, as a man\u2019s life, nor upon any industrial growth, as the growth of the value of real estate. This illustrates to you the difference between legitimate investments, which may yield, according to the good fortune of the investor, a hundredfold more than the amount invested, and a gambling investment, according to a lottery, which can only yield in case the allotment or chance, which is purely artificial, turns in his favor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 565-566.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">With this in mind, we cannot find R.C. 718.01(A)(4)\u2019s definition of \u201cintangible income\u201d to include games or schemes of chance. Semantics aside, lotteries or lottery tickets are not investments, deposits, money or credits, nor are they of the same class, kind or nature of such items of intangible property. They are a species or form of gambling, distinguished from other enterprises by virtue of the element of chance. Absent a clear intention by the General Assembly, we cannot place what is essentially gambling income into the same fortress of protection from municipal taxation erected for income from such sources as stocks, bonds, certificates, debentures, notes, deposits, annuities, royalties, money and credits.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Accordingly, we hold that lottery winnings are not \u201cintangible income\u201d as that term is defined in R.C. 718.01(A)(4), and, therefore, municipal corporations are not precluded from levying an income tax thereon by virtue of R.C. 718.01(F)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">In light of our disposition of this issue, it is unnecessary to address appellants\u2019 second proposition of law, relative to whether injunctive relief is available to a taxpayer who has filed an appeal from an administrative proceeding under R.C. 2506.01. Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b756-9\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Wright, F.E.
