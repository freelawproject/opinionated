Gay v. Mihm </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 315, 626 N.E.2d 666. For the reasons to follow, we deny the claimant\u2019s request and affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-10\">Preliminary to any consideration of <em>Gay </em>relief is a finding that <em>Noll </em>has not been met. <em>State ex rel. Sebestyen v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 36, 641 N.E.2d 197. In this case, the commission clearly articulated its reason for the denial of permanent total disability compensation \u2014 claimant\u2019s age, not injury, was deemed to be the overwhelming impediment to a return to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-11\">In <em>State ex rel. Speelman v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1992), 73 Ohio App.3d 757, 763, 598 N.E.2d 192, 196, the court of appeals observed:</p>\n<p id=\"b707-12\">\u201cThe non-medical factors include those that may, in certain instances, be held to constitute causation for the person being unable to engage in substantially remunerative employment despite the medical disability from the allowed condition(s). For example, claimant may be disabled at age fifty-five from returning to the former position of employment but, at that time, be capable of obtaining sustained remunerative employment within the medically limiting capabilities that the claimant has, after considering all non-medical factors, including age. Ten or fifteen years may elapse with the physical condition remaining approximately the same. At that time, the age factor may be combined with the disability to disqualify claimant from any sustained remunerative employment. <em>In that event, the Industrial Commission should have the discretion to find that the sole causal factor is the increase in age rather than the allowed disability.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b707-13\"><em>Speelman </em>makes an outstanding point. Permanent total disability compensation was never intended to compensate a claimant for simply growing old. Therefore, the commission must indeed have the discretion to attribute a claim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>ant\u2019s inability to work to age alone and deny compensation where the evidence supports such a conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">In this case, Dr. Woolfs report is \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting such a finding. Dr. Woolf specifically attributed claimant\u2019s inability to work to \u201ctime and the natural progression of aging.\u201d The commission\u2019s denial of permanent total disability compensation was not, therefore, an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b708-8\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Wright, Resnick, F.E.
