We agree with the BTA that these devices are not braces under this exemption, but find that the BTA neglected to decide whether these devices aid human perambulation. Consequently, we reverse the BTA and remand this matter to it for such determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-13\">In <em>Akron Home Med. Serv., Inc. v. Lindley </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 107, 25 OBR 155, 495 N.E.2d 417, we addressed the predecessor statute (R.C. 5739.02[B][18]) to this exemption. This statute exempted \u201cbraces and other similar medical or surgical devices for supporting weakened or useless parts of the human body * * *.\u201d We ruled that \u201cbraces are of that group which <em>physically </em>supports parts of the body, as opposed to a broader type of \u2018support\u2019 which could include chemically induced support of particular organs.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) Id. </em>at 109, 25 OBR at 157, 495 N.E.2d at 420. We ruled that oxygen and oxygen equipment, then under review, were not similar to braces. We judged the oxygen equipment to be delivery systems that do not actually support a part of the body in any direct fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-14\">We find the same here. The instant devices provide electrical charges to contract muscles that stabilize or support a part of the body. However, the muscles provide the support, not the electrical devices. Thus, these devices are not braces or other devices that support weakened or non-functioning parts of the human body under R.C. 5739.02(B)(19).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>Furthermore, the General Assembly amended the statute after the audit period (1977-1979) involved in our decision in <em>Akron Home Medical Services </em>to enact R.C. 5739.02(B)(19) and to exempt \u201ccrutches or other devices to aid human perambulation.\u201d (138 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3384.) We note that the General Assembly did not, in amending this exemption, include the term \u201csimilar\u201d to modify the clause \u201cother devices to aid human perambulation\u201d as it had for \u201cbraces and other <em>similar </em>medical or surgical devices\u201d for our review in <em>Akron Home Medical Services.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">On reviewing the testimony, there appears to be a question as to whether these devices can be used \u201cto aid human perambulation.\u201d But, the BTA did not review these devices in light of this latter clause of R.C. 5739.02(B)(19). Accordingly, we reverse the BTA\u2019s decision and remand this matter to it for it to rule on whether these devices are exempt as aiding in human perambulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">\n<em>Decision affirmed in part, reversed in part and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b763-8\">Moyer, C.J., Wright, Resnick, F.E.
