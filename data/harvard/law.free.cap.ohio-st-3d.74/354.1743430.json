Gay v. Mihm </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 315, 626 N.E.2d 666. The commission wants its order upheld. For the reasons to follow, we find in favor of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\"><em>Gay </em>relief cannot be considered without a preliminary finding that <em>Noll, supra, </em>has not been satisfied. <em>State ex rel. Sebestyen v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 36, 38, 641 N.E.2d 197, 199. Asserting such noncompliance, claimant objects to the reasoning underlying the commission\u2019s denial \u2014 that claimant\u2019s limited academic skills do not preclude retraining for work within his physical restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Claimant\u2019s argument hinges largely on Parsons\u2019 assessment of functional illiteracy \u2014 a conclusion with which the commission disagreed. So long as that conclusion is supported by \u201csome evidence,\u201d the presence of contrary evidence is immaterial. <em>State ex rel. Burley v. Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E.2d 936. In this case, claimant was asked whether he could read, write and do basic math. Three alternative responses were listed \u2014 \u201cYes,\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d and \u201cNot well.\u201d Claimant chose the third response in each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Claimant argues that \u201cNot well\u201d must be interpreted as evidence that claimant possesses no transferable skills in these areas. This is incorrect. The commission is exclusively responsible for evaluating and interpreting evidence. <em>Burley. </em>It was the commission\u2019s prerogative to conclude that because claimant could have denied any ability in these areas and did not, claimant possessed some minimal competency in these subjects. Claimant\u2019s self-assessment, therefore, constitutes \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting the commission\u2019s determination that claimant possessed basic abilities in these areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">In denying permanent total disability compensation, the commission found that claimant\u2019s physical abilities permitted retraining for work that did not require extensive academic skills. It further found that claimant\u2019s- minimal skills were not an impediment to retraining, and explained how it reached that conclusion. The order, therefore, minimally satisfies <em>Noll </em>and will not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b600-11\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Wright, Resnick, F.E.
