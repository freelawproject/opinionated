Many of these legal issues have been decided in prior cases and will be handled summarily. <em>State v. Poindexter </em>(1986), 36 Ohio St.3d 1, 3, 520 N.E.2d 568, 570. We must also make an independent review of the record to determine whether the aggravating circumstance outweighs the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. Finally, we must decide whether the sentence of death is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-12\">For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the convictions and sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b629-14\">Voir Dire/Jury Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b629-15\">In his first proposition of law, Wilson argues that the trial court denied him due process by not allowing him to individually voir dire prospective jurors about specific mitigating factors. Wilson argues he should have been allowed to ask <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>what each prospective juror thought about each of several statutory mitigating factors (R.C. 2929.04[B][l]-[4]) as well as fourteen individually tailored \u201cother factors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">Wilson relies strongly on <em>Morgan v. Illinois </em>(1992), 504 U.S. 719, 112 S.Ct. 2222, 119 L.Ed.2d 492. In <em>Morgan, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that the trial court, at an accused\u2019s request, must ask prospective jurors about their views on capital punishment in an attempt to ascertain whether any of them would automatically vote for the death penalty regardless of the circumstances. The court held that the voir dire was inadequate to detect such jurors and reversed the death sentence. An earlier United States Supreme Court decision had held that asking jurors whether they were opposed to the death penalty did not violate an accused\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>Lockhart v. McCree </em>(1986), 476 U.S. 162, 106 S.Ct. 1758, 90 L.Ed.2d 137.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">In a recent case the United States Supreme Court held that a trial judge\u2019s refusal to voir dire individual jurors about the contents of news reports each juror had read did not violate the Constitution. <em>Mu\u2019Min v. Virginia </em>(1991), 500 U.S. 415, 111 S.Ct. 1899, 114 L.Ed.2d 493. The court stated that a trial court has \u201cgreat latitude in deciding what questions should be asked on voir dire.\u201d <em>Mu'Min, </em>500 U.S. at 424, 111 S.Ct. at 1904, 114 L.Ed.2d at 505. See Annotation (1994), 114 L.Ed.2d 763. Deciding \u201cissues raised in voir dire in criminal cases has long been held to be within the discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>State v. Beuke </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 29, 39, 526 N.E.2d 274, 285. See <em>Rosales-Lopez v. United States </em>(1981), 451 U.S. 182, 101 S.Ct. 1629, 68 L.Ed.2d 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">We find no abuse of discretion in this case. Here, the trial court allowed individual voir dire in the death-qualification process. The trial judge asked the prospective jurors approximately twenty questions about their views on capital punishment, the basis of those views, their willingness to consider mitigating evidence, the death penalty, and their commitment to follow instructions as given. The trial court also allowed counsel to inquire into these matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\"><em>Morgan </em>does not require judges to allow individual voir dire on separate mitigating factors. The detailed questioning that occurred in this case was adequate to expose faults that would render a juror ineligible. See <em>State v. Rogers </em>(1985), 17 Ohio St.3d 174, 17 OBR 414, 478 N.E.2d 984, paragraph three of the syllabus. <em>Morgan </em>imposes no further requirements on voir dire.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">Moreover, we have rejected past efforts to find an abuse of discretion in similar circumstances. See <em>State v. Bedford </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 122, 129, 529 N.E.2d 913, 920. \u201cJurors weigh mitigating factors together, not singly, and do so collectively as a jury in the context of a penalty hearing. Realistically, jurors cannot be asked to weigh specific factors until they have heard all the evidence and been fully instructed on the applicable law.\u201d <em>State v. Lundgren </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 474, 481, 653 N.E.2d 304, 315. Further, a juror need not give any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>weight to any particular mitigating factor although instructed to consider such factors. \u201c[E]vidence of an offender\u2019s history, background and character\u201d not found mitigating \u201cneed be given little or no weight against the aggravating circumstances.\u201d <em>State v. Stumpf </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 95, 512 N.E.2d 598, paragraph two of the syllabus. See <em>State v. Steffen </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 111, 31 OBR 273, 509 N.E.2d 383, paragraph two of the syllabus. We find that Wilson\u2019s first proposition of law lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">In his fourth proposition of law, Wilson argues that the trial court erred in allowing the prosecutor to ask questions about \u201cvictim\u2019s rights\u201d during general voir dire. At various times, the prosecutor asked jurors about their \u201cperceptions\u201d of the criminal justice system. He followed up by asking whether any jurors had heard or thought about \u201cvictim\u2019s rights\u201d and what their thoughts were on that subject. The prosecutor\u2019s questions were deliberately brief, open-ended, and nonjudgmental. He did not attempt to explain \u201cvictim\u2019s rights,\u201d indoctrinate the jurors, inflame the jurors, or improperly appeal to community sentiment.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">We do not find these limited voir dire questions to be improper. Newspapers and other media frequently discuss the criminal justice system and \u201cvictim\u2019s rights.\u201d Such limited, open-ended questions could uncover biased or unsuitable jurors. Trial judges have discretion over voir dire and are not required to exclude all possibly controversial topics. <em>State v. Bedford, </em>39 Ohio St.3d at 129, 529 N.E.2d at 920; <em>Rosales-Lopez v. United States, supra. </em>The trial court did not abuse its discretion by allowing the prosecutor\u2019s limited questioning about the criminal justice system or \u201cvictim\u2019s rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">In his tenth proposition of law, Wilson argues that the prosecutor \u201cdestroyed the presumption of innocence\u201d and \u201casked the jurors during voir dire to commit themselves to the * * * death penalty.\u201d Viewed in the context of the entire voir dire, the prosecutor\u2019s questions were not an attempt to destroy Wilson\u2019s presumption of innocence. Instead, the prosecutor tried to determine whether jurors could recommend the death penalty <em>if </em>the accused were convicted as charged, <em>and if </em>the aggravating circumstance were found to outweigh the mitigating factors. Although the prosecutor inartfully used the terms \u201cpresume\u201d and \u201cpresuming\u201d in connection with guilt, Wilson did not object and therefore waived that issue. Moreover, the context shows that the prosecutor meant \u201cassume\u201d and \u201cassuming,\u201d not \u201cpresume\u201d and \u201cpresuming.\u201d The trial court fully instructed the jury on the accused\u2019s presumption of innocence. The state\u2019s imprecise language did not affect that presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">The prosecutor did not wrongfully attempt to commit jurors to imposing the death penalty. Instead, the prosecutor attempted to discover whether a juror could, in an actual case and not on an abstract level, sign a death penalty verdict if that juror found that the aggravating circumstance outweighed the mitigating factors. As the trial court noted, \u201cthe point * * * is can jurors distinguish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>between that which is philosophical and abstract and that which is real.\u201d Such questions are proper; thus, we reject Wilson\u2019s tenth proposition of law. <em>State v. Lorraine </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 414, 424-425, 613 N.E.2d 212, 221; <em>State v. Evans </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 231, 249-250, 586 N.E.2d 1042, 1057-1058.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">In his ninth proposition of law, Wilson argues that the trial court erred in not granting a change of venue or allowing sufficient voir dire to identify biased jurors. Yet, Wilson failed to show any basis for a change in venue. Moreover, the trial court adequately and individually questioned jurors on pretrial publicity, and Wilson\u2019s counsel had ample opportunity to inquire further. Of the jurors that sat, only three had read or heard anything beyond headlines or TV reports, and none had an opinion about the accused\u2019s guilt. Finally, \u201c[a]ny decision on changing venue rests largely in the discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>State v. Landrum </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 107, 116, 559 N.E.2d 710, 722. Thus, we find Wilson\u2019s ninth proposition of law lacks merit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">In his eleventh proposition of law, Wilson contends that the trial court improperly used the <em>Wainwright </em>constitutional standard to death-qualify the jury. <em>Wainwright v. Witt </em>(1985), 469 U.S. 412, 105 S.Ct. 844, 83 L.Ed.2d 841. However, the trial court correctly used the <em>Wainwright </em>standard. See <em>State v. Tyler </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 24, 30, 553 N.E.2d 576, 586; <em>State v. Scott </em>(1986), 26 Ohio St.3d 92, 96-97, 26 OBR 79, 83, 497 N.E.2d 55, 59-60; <em>State v. Rogers </em>(1985), 17 Ohio St.3d 174, 17 OBR 414, 478 N.E.2d 984, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">In his twelfth proposition of law, Wilson argues that the trial court erred in rejecting challenges to prospective jurors Sibley and Clutter and juror Edwards. The standard of review in this respect is that \u201c \u2018[djeference must be paid to the trial judge who sees and hears the juror.\u2019 * * * We will not overrule his decision absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>State v. Tyler, </em>50 Ohio St.3d at 30, 553 N.E.2d at 586. We have reviewed the transcript and find no abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">In his thirteenth proposition of law, Wilson argues that the prosecutor peremptorily excused prospective juror Bruce on racial grounds. Obviously, jurors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>cannot be excused based on racial considerations. <em>Batson v. Kentucky </em>(1986), 476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69. However, the prosecutor explained in race-neutral terms that he challenged Bruce based on Bruce\u2019s equivocation about the death penalty. The record supports the state\u2019s claim. When asked if he would fairly consider that penalty, Bruce said, \u201cYes, I guess. I\u2019m not sure about that.\u201d When asked whether he could sign a death verdict, Bruce replied, \u201cI really don\u2019t know.\u201d In response to the same line of questioning he said, \u201cI think so\u201d and \u201cI can\u2019t say I can. I guess if I have the evidence and listen to the evidence, I could.\u201d In the face of such responses, the prosecutor\u2019s peremptory challenge was appropriate. Wilson\u2019s thirteenth proposition of law lacks merit. See <em>State v. Hernandez </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 577, 589 N.E.2d 1310.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">In proposition of law fourteen, Wilson argues that the trial court erred when the court passed out notebooks and told jurors they could take notes during the trial. Wilson did not object to the notetaking or the jury instructions on notetaking thereby waiving all but plain error. A trial court can exercise its discretion and allow jurors to take notes. See <em>State v. Loza </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 61, 74, 641 N.E.2d 1082, 1099; <em>State v. Williams </em>(1992), 80 Ohio App.3d 648, 610 N.E.2d 545. The court adequately instructed the jury and emphasized that notes were to assist the jury, not a primary objective; that taking notes should not distract the juror from paying close attention to the ongoing testimony; and that \u201c[y]our primary objective is to hear evidence and testimony as it comes to you from the witness stand.\u201d Thus, we find no plain error with respect to the notetaking by the jurors and reject Wilson\u2019s proposition of law fourteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Evidence Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">In his eighth proposition of law, Wilson argues that the trial court erred by not suppressing his confession. He claims that he asked for an attorney and didn\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>receive one, that his confession was involuntary, and that his mental faculties were impaired at the time of his confession. The recorded interviews indicate that Detective Riley advised Wilson of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and that Wilson waived those rights and agreed to talk with the police. Wilson claims that he asked for a lawyer when the recorder was turned off, that Riley promised to help him if he confessed, and that Riley threatened Wilson with the \u201celectric chair\u201d if he did not confess. Riley denied all of these claims. Wilson said he had had a beer and smoked two marijuana cigarettes earlier that afternoon, but Riley found Wilson alert and in control of his mental faculties.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">\u201c[T]he weight of the evidence and credibility of witnesses are primarily for the trier of the facts. * * * This principle is applicable to suppression hearings as well as trials.\u201d <em>State v. Fanning </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St.3d 19, 20, 1 OBR 57, 58, 437 N.E.2d 583, 584. The trial court specifically found in its entry denying Wilson\u2019s motion to suppress that Wilson \u201cknowingly and intelligently waived his right against self-incrimination\u201d and that his statements \u201cwere voluntarily made.\u201d Further, the accused\u2019s asserted intake of one beer and \u201ctwo joints\u201d did not prevent him from being able to make \u201ca knowing, voluntary and intelligent waiver of his rights.\u201d Further, the trial court found that Wilson never invoked his right to counsel \u201c[d]ue to the inconsistencies\u201d in his testimony. The taped interviews and testimony support those findings. <em>State v. Mills </em>(1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 357, 366, 582 N.E.2d 972, 982; <em>State v. Smith </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 284, 288, 574 N.E.2d 510, 515. Accordingly, we reject Wilson\u2019s eighth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">In proposition of law fifteen, Wilson argues that the trial court erred in admitting prejudicial \u201cother acts\u201d testimony from Angie Shelton and Darlene DeBolt. On the evening of May 3, Wilson had argued with Shelton, his girlfriend, and threatened to hit her. On May 4, around 6:00 a.m., Wilson dropped by the gas station where DeBolt worked and tried to get her to go out with him. We find no prejudicial error in the trial court\u2019s decision to allow the testimony of these witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">The state contended that Wilson\u2019s motive in kidnapping Lutz was, at least in part, his inability to deal with female rejection. The fact that, just before meeting Lutz, Wilson had argued with Shelton and threatened to hit her after she rejected him arguably supports that claimed motive. Under Evid.R. 404(B), evidence of other acts, though criminal, may be admissible as \u201cproof of motive.\u201d See <em>State v. Woodard </em>(1993), 68 Ohio St.3d 70, 73, 623 N.E.2d 75, 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">DeBolt\u2019s testimony was clearly admissible. DeBolt placed Wilson in Lutz\u2019s Oldsmobile between 6:00 a.m. and 7:00 a.m. on May 4, corroborating that part of Wilson\u2019s confession. DeBolt describes Wilson as \u201cpersistent\u201d and \u201cpushy\u201d and thus never raises an \u201cother acts\u201d issue. In view of the overwhelming evidence of Wilson\u2019s guilt, especially his voluntary confession, the testimony of neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>witness materially prejudiced Wilson. Thus, we reject his fifteenth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">In proposition of law sixteen, Wilson argues that the trial court erred by admitting \u201ccumulative, gruesome and inflammatory\u201d photographs of the victim and crime scene. These photos were also reproduced and shown as slides. Under Evid.R. 403 and 611(A), the admission of photographs is left to the trial court\u2019s sound discretion. <em>State v. Slagle </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 597, 601, 605 N.E.2d 916, 923. Nonrepetitive photographs in capital cases, even if gruesome, are admissible as long as the probative value of each photograph outweighs the danger of material prejudice to an accused. See <em>State v. Maurer </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 239, 15 OBR 379, 473 N.E.2d 768, paragraph seven of the syllabus; <em>State v. Morales </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 252, 257, 513 N.E.2d 267, 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The trial court properly admitted these photographs and slides. The two photographs of Lutz\u2019s body illustrate the coroner\u2019s testimony, are nonrepetitive, and each has probative value greater than any prejudicial effect. Two other photographs, also admissible, show Lutz\u2019s body at the scene after the fire was extinguished. Both photographs illustrate testimony and help to demonstrate Wilson\u2019s intent and the extent of Lutz\u2019s injuries. The remaining photographs under objection are relevant, nonobjectionable, and not even gruesome, since they do not contain a body. See <em>State v. DePew </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 275, 281, 528 N.E.2d 542, 550-551. Thus, we find that proposition of law sixteen lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">In proposition of law seventeen, Wilson argues plain error, contesting the admission of testimony from the coroner and three witnesses who were at the scene of the burning car. The coroner testified about Lutz\u2019s injuries and confirmed that carbon monoxide and third degree burns had caused her death. Patton described the fire and the pictures she had taken of the burning car, helping to confirm the fire\u2019s origin and intensity. The paramedic described the fire and his confirmation at the scene that no one was in the passenger compartment of the car. A fire department captain described the fire fighting efforts, the car\u2019s damage, and the body in the trunk.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">Wilson did not object to these witnesses at trial, thereby waiving this issue absent plain error. The testimony from these witnesses was relatively brief, relevant, and not unfairly prejudicial to the accused under Evid.R. 403(A), which states that even relevant evidence must be excluded \u201cif its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice * * The overwhelming evidence of Wilson\u2019s guilt, including his confession, precluded any material prejudice from this factual testimony. Wilson did object to the photos and a few questions that were asked of the coroner, but those objections lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>Wilson offered, at the last moment, to stipulate to the victim\u2019s identity; the state did not agree to the stipulation. Testimony from two dentists establishing Lutz\u2019s identity was proper, nonprejudicial, and not inflammatory. Thus, we find Wilson\u2019s claim of error, with respect to these witnesses, lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Guilt Phase Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">In propositions of law eighteen, nineteen, twenty, twenty-one, and twenty-five, Wilson argues that the trial court erred in giving guilt phase instructions. Wilson failed to object at trial to the instructions he now contests in propositions of law eighteen and nineteen. He also failed to object with specificity to the instruction contested in proposition of law twenty-five. Thus, he waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Underwood </em>(1983), 3 Ohio St.3d 12, 3 OBR 360, 444 N.E.2d 1332, syllabus. We find no plain error as to those issues. As to proposition twenty, Wilson argues correctly that the trial court erred in shifting the burden of proof as to \u201cknowledge.\u201d Except on that point, Wilson\u2019s propositions twenty and twenty-one also lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">In proposition of law eighteen, Wilson argues plain error because the trial court instructed, \u201c[t]he purpose with which a person does an act or brings about a result is determined from the manner in which it is done, the means used and all of the other facts and circumstances in evidence.\u201d We reject Wilson\u2019s claim that these words relieved the prosecutor of his burden of proof or created a mandatory presumption. <em>State v. Montgomery </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 410, 414-415, 575 N.E.2d 167, 171-172; <em>State v. Price </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St.2d 136, 141, 14 O.O.3d 379, 382, 398 N.E.2d 772, 775.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">The court further instructed that no one \u201cmay be convicted of Aggravated Murder unless he\u2019s specifically found to have intended to cause the death of another.\u201d The instructions on prior calculation and design also amplified the court\u2019s instructions on \u201cpurpose.\u201d When the instructions are viewed in context, Wilson\u2019s claim of error, plain or otherwise, lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">In proposition of law nineteen, Wilson argues plain error because of the trial court\u2019s following definitions of \u201cpurpose\u201d which Wilson contends are \u201cincongruous\u201d: \u201cA person acts purposely when it is his specific intention to cause a certain result. It must be established in this case that at the time in question there was present in the mind of the Defendant a specific intention to cause the death of another. * * * A person acts purposely, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to accomplish thereby, if it is his specific intention to engage in conduct of that nature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Admittedly, the \u201cgist of the offense\u201d language is confusing in a murder prosecution which requires \u201cpurpose.\u201d See <em>State v. Carter </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 545, 552-553, 651 N.E.2d 965, 973-974; R.C. 2901.22(A); 4 Ohio Jury Instructions (1995) 52, 409.01(3)(Comment). In the context of all the instructions given the jury, the court provided adequate instructions on the element of specific intent to kill. <em>State v. Price, </em>60 Ohio St.2d at 140-141, 14 O.O.3d at 381-382, 398 N.E.2d at 775; <em>State v. Martens </em>(1993), 90 Ohio App.3d 338, 349-350, 629 N.E.2d 462, 469-470. Given the evidence, including Wilson\u2019s confession, the jury could not have based its decision on the \u201cgist of the offense\u201d language. No \u201coutcome-determinative\u201d plain error occurred. We, therefore, reject proposition of law nineteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">In proposition of law twenty, Wilson first argues that the trial court erred in refusing his request to instruct the jury on intoxication as it relates to aggravated murder and arson. Whether to instruct on intoxication as a defense rests within a trial court\u2019s sound discretion. <em>State v. Wolons </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 64, 541 N.E.2d 443, paragraph two of the syllabus; <em>State v. Fox </em>(1981), 68 Ohio St.2d 53, 22 O.O.3d 259, 428 N.E.2d 410; <em>Nichols v. State </em>(1858), 8 Ohio St. 435, paragraph two of the syllabus. Such an instruction is not required, since \u201c[ijntoxication is easily simulated\u201d and is \u201coften voluntarily induced for the sole purpose of nerving a wicked heart[.]\u201d <em>Nichols, 8 </em>Ohio St. at 439. As discussed <em>infra, </em>the court did instruct on intoxication as to the kidnapping offense and specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">Moreover, the evidence does not reasonably raise the intoxication issue as to the aggravated murder or arson. Wilson cites much evidence from the trial to show how much alcohol he drank up to 2:30 a.m. on May 4. However, aside from one or two beers at his trailer around 3:00 a.m., there was no evidence at trial that indicated Wilson drank anything after that time. The murder occurred around 1:30 p.m., eleven hours after the Empire Tavern closed and at least eight hours after Wilson\u2019s last beer. During this time, Wilson walked, slept, drove to various places, and talked with DeBolt at 6:00 a.m. in Stow for sixty to ninety minutes. His own confession reflects that he knew exactly what he was doing after 7:30 a.m. Lacking evidence of intoxication, the court did not err in declining to instruct on intoxication as to the events that directly preceded Lutz\u2019s death. See <em>State v. Hicks </em>(1989), 43 Ohio St.3d 72, 538 N.E.2d 1030, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">In proposition of law twenty, Wilson further argues that the trial court erred in instructing the jury, over objection, that he had the burden of proof to establish that his intoxication negated the \u201cknowledge\u201d element in the kidnapping. This contention relates solely to the kidnapping conviction. Wilson makes no claim that any error affects the remaining charges or the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">The court instructed: \u201cIntoxication is not an excuse * * *, [but] such evidence is admissible for the purpose of showing that the Defendant was so intoxicated that he was incapable of having the knowledge to commit the offense of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>Kidnapping. Knowledge is the element of this offense; and intoxication * * * can co-exist with knowledge. * * * On this issue, <em>the burden of proof is upon the Defendant </em>to establish by a preponderance or greater weight of the evidence that at the time in question he was so influenced by alcohol that he was incapable of having the knowledge to commit the offense. If you <em>find by a preponderance or greater weight </em>of the evidence that the Defendant was <em>incapable of having the knowledge </em>to commit the offense, then you must find the Defendant was not guilty of the offense of Kidnapping because Knowledge is an essential element of the offense[,] as I have previously instructed you.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">As the court instructed, \u201cknowledge\u201d is an element of kidnapping. Due process requires the prosecution to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, every element of the crime charged. <em>In re Winship </em>(1970), 397 U.S. 358, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368. Due process prohibits requiring an accused to disprove an element of the crime charged. <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>(1975), 421 U.S. 684, 95 S.Ct. 1881, 44 L.Ed.2d 508. This instruction is unconstitutional under <em>Winship </em>because it required Wilson to disprove \u201cknowledge,\u201d which is an element of the offense of kidnapping. R.C. 2905.01(B). The burden of proof cannot be placed on a defendant to disprove an element of an offense. <em>Mullaney, supra. </em>Nevertheless, we find the error to be harmless under the facts of this case, since the kidnapping of Lutz continued into the late morning and early afternoon. At that point, he clearly knew what he was doing and intoxication would not reasonably be available as a defense to negate \u201cknowledge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">No other offenses are affected by this instructional deficiency, since this instruction on intoxication involved only the kidnapping. The felony-murder counts and kidnapping penalty specifications played no role at all in the penalty phase. The death penalty was imposed solely on Count I and specification one.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">In proposition of law twenty-one, Wilson argues that the trial court erred in refusing his request to instruct on murder as a lesser included offense. However, a charge on a \u201clesser included offense is required only where the evidence presented at trial would reasonably support both an acquittal on the crime charged and a conviction upon the lesser included offense.\u201d <em>State v. Thomas </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 213, 533 N.E.2d 286, paragraph two of the syllabus. Here the evidence did not reasonably raise murder as a lesser included offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">No evidence exists that indicates that Wilson had anything to drink after approximately 2:30 a.m. Wilson knew Lutz was locked in the trunk at 7:30 a.m. In the hours after that, he drove and walked around, kept Lutz locked in the trunk, and thought about what he was going to do. It appears that by 1:00 p.m., he had decided to kill her and to that end set fire to a rag stuffed into the gas tank. That time, the fire went out. He next let Lutz out of the trunk and talked with her for fifteen to twenty minutes before forcing her back in the car trunk. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>This time he punctured the gas tank before lighting the rag. The fire caught and Lutz was burned to death. Evidence of prior calculation and design is overwhelming, and a jury could not reasonably find him guilty of murder but not guilty of aggravated murder. Thus, the trial judge did not err in refusing to instruct on murder as a lesser included offense. See <em>State v. Evans, </em>63 Ohio St.3d at 245, 586 N.E.2d at 1054-1055; <em>State v. Tyler, </em>50 Ohio St.3d at 36, 553 N.E.2d at 591.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">We summarily reject Wilson\u2019s proposition of law twenty-five, which challenges Ohio\u2019s statutory reasonable doubt instruction used at the guilt and penalty phases. <em>State v. Van Gundy </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 230, 594 N.E.2d 604; <em>State v. Nabozny </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 195, 8 O.O.3d 181, 375 N.E.2d 784, paragraph two of the syllabus. Moreover, it should be noted that Wilson failed to object and waived the issue. <em>State v. Underwood </em>(1983), 3 Ohio St.3d 12, 3 OBR 360, 444 N.E.2d 1332, syllabus; Crim.R. 30(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">Effective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">In proposition of law twenty-four, Wilson argues that he was denied his right to the effective assistance of counsel at trial. Wilson did not raise this claim before the court of appeals and thus waived this issue. <em>State v. Williams </em>(1977), 51 Ohio St.2d 112, 5 O.O.3d 98, 364 N.E.2d 1364. Moreover, reversal of convictions on ineffective assistance requires that the defendant show, first, \u201cthat counsel\u2019s performance was deficient\u201d and, second, \u201cthat the deficient performance prejudiced the defense * * * so * * * as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, 693; <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">Wilson challenges his counsel\u2019s decisions on numerous issues. We find that each of those decisions was the product of reasonable professional judgment. Additionally, as to all of these issues, Wilson has not established prejudice, <em>ie., </em>\u201ca reasonable probability that, were it not for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the trial would have been different.\u201d <em>Bradley, </em>paragraph three of the syllabus. Thus, we find that proposition of law twenty-four lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b639-11\">Constitutional Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b639-12\">Proposition of law twenty-two challenges the death-penalty felony-murder provisions, but it lacks both merit and relevance. <em>State v. Henderson </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 24, 528 N.E.2d 1237, paragraph one of the syllabus. Wilson\u2019s arguments in proposition of law twenty-seven challenging Ohio\u2019s proportionality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>review lack merit. <em>State v. Green </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 141, 151, 609 N.E.2d 1253, 1261; <em>State v. Steffen </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 111, 31 OBR 273, 509 N.E.2d 383, paragraph one of the syllabus. We summarily reject Wilson\u2019s constitutional arguments in propositions of law twenty-two, twenty-seven and twenty-eight. <em>State v. Poindexter </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 1, 520 N.E.2d 568, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Sentence Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">In his second proposition of law, Wilson challenges the constitutionality of appellate sentence reweighing in death penalty cases and seeks to sharply restrict the use of appellate reweighing to determine sentence appropriateness. Wilson further argues that appellate reweighing is speculative and improper when an error is based upon inadmissible evidence. However, we find Wilson\u2019s second proposition of law lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">At the sentencing proceedings, the jury and judge became aware that Wilson had been earlier adjudged a delinquent child for an involuntary manslaughter. Wilson starts his arguments against reweighing with the erroneous assumption that the court improperly admitted evidence of his juvenile criminal history. The trial transcript demonstrates that Wilson mentioned his juvenile record and introduced evidence of that record at sentencing. Having invited any error, he cannot now complain. <em>Center Ridge Ganley, Inc. v. Stinn </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 310, 31 OBR 587, 511 N.E.2d 106. The trial jury properly considered the defense evidence. See discussion of Wilson\u2019s fifth proposition of law, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">However, we agree that the trial court in its sentencing opinion improperly injected Wilson\u2019s juvenile record into the weighing process as a nonstatutory aggravating circumstance. In justifying the death penalty, and explaining why the aggravating circumstance outweighed mitigating factors, the trial court stated: \u201cDefendant\u2019s total disregard for the suffering of his victim(s) in the present case and in his juvenile adjudication finding him delinquent by reason of involuntary manslaughter. * * * Defendant\u2019s actions in both cases support the aggravating circumstance in that defendant acted in order to prevent the victim from seeking assistance in order to avoid detection, apprehension, trial or punishment.\u201d The court of appeals recognized the trial court\u2019s error and took appropriate corrective action by independently reassessing the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">Wilson now challenges the authority of the court of appeals to reassess the sentence under the circumstances. Wilson argues that appellate reweighing is limited to situations where an aggravating circumstance has been subsequently ruled invalid under the Eighth Amendment. His argument lacks logic and is not based on precedent. \u201cThe independent weighing process at each appellate level * * * provides a procedural safeguard against the arbitrary imposition of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>death penalty.\u201d <em>State v. Holloway </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 239, 527 N.E.2d 831, paragraph two of the syllabus. We have upheld appellate reweighing in varied situations. See <em>State v. Combs </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 278, 286, 581 N.E.2d 1071, 1079; <em>State v. Landrum, </em>53 Ohio St.3d at 124, 559 N.E.2d at 729. This court has specifically used appellate reweighing to correct errors in a trial court\u2019s sentencing opinion. See <em>State v. Fox </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 183, at 190-192, 631 N.E.2d 124, at 130-131; <em>State v. Lewis </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 200, 204, 616 N.E.2d 921, 925; <em>State v. Lott </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 169-170, 555 N.E.2d 293, 303-304; <em>State v. Maurer, </em>15 Ohio St.3d at 246-247, 15 OBR at 385-386, 473 N.E.2d at 777-778. Thus, we reject Wilson\u2019s second proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">In his third proposition of law, Wilson argues that the trial court erred in instructing the jury, over objection, that \u201c[mjitigating factors are factors that, while they do not justify or excuse the crime * * *, may be considered by you as extenuating, lessening, weakening, excusing to some extent, <em>or </em>reducing the degree of the Defendant\u2019s <em>blame or culpability.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">We agree that the trial court erred in referring to only \u201cblame or culpability\u201d when explaining mitigating factors. As <em>State v. Holloway </em>held at paragraph one of the syllabus, \u201cMitigating factors * * * are not necessarily related to a defendant\u2019s culpability but, rather, are those factors that are relevant to the issue of whether an offender convicted under R.C. 2903.01 should be sentenced to death.\u201d However, instructions must be considered as a whole, not in isolation. <em>State v. Price </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St.2d 136, 14 O.O.3d 379, 398 N.E.2d 772. When considered in context, the trial court\u2019s instructions adequately informed the jury as to the relevant mitigating factors it must consider. The court told the jury that the \u201cmitigating factors which you are to weigh include but are not limited to the youth of the offender; any other factor raised by the Defendant which may include, but is not limited to, that the Defendant is the product of a dysfunctional family; alcoholism; ability to adjust to a structural environment in an institutional setting; the Defendant\u2019s confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">\u201cLikewise, the existence of any of the mitigating factors does not preclude or prevent the imposition of a sentence of death if you find that the aggravating circumstance still outweighs the mitigating factors by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">\u201cIf, after a full and impartial consideration of all the relevant evidence * * * you are firmly convinced that the aggravating circumstance * * * outweighs the factors in mitigation, beyond a reasonable doubt, then the state has met its burden of proof * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">\u201cIf, on the other hand, you are not firmly convinced that the aggravating circumstance * * * outweighs the factors in mitigation, beyond a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>doubt, then the State has not met its burden of proof and the sentence of death shall not be imposed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Under the circumstances, we find no material prejudice resulted from use of the words \u201cblame\u201d or \u201cculpability.\u201d Taken as a whole, the jury instructions indicate that the penalty phase was to determine Wilson\u2019s punishment, not just to assess his blame or culpability. See <em>State v. Woodard, </em>68 Ohio St.3d at 77, 623 N.E.2d at 80. The arguments of counsel reflected that view. Additionally, our independent sentence reassessment eliminates the effect of this error. See <em>State v. Landrum, </em>53 Ohio St.3d at 124, 559 N.E.2d at 729; <em>State v. Holloway, </em>38 Ohio St.3d at 242, 527 N.E.2d at 835.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Contrary to Wilson\u2019s arguments in proposition of law twenty-three, the trial court did not err in refusing to instruct on mercy. <em>State v. Lorraine, </em>66 Ohio St.3d at 417, 613 N.E.2d at 216; <em>State v. Landrum, </em>53 Ohio St.3d at 123, 559 N.E.2d at 728.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">In his fifth proposition of law, Wilson argues that prosecutorial misconduct denied him a fair penalty determination. First, Wilson argues that the prosecutor improperly introduced Wilson\u2019s juvenile record into evidence and improperly cross-examined defense witnesses about that record. Wilson\u2019s argument obscures what occurred at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">Before trial, the prosecutor stated that he might use Wilson\u2019s prior juvenile record \u201cto cross-examine them [defense witnesses] regarding their knowledge of his record.\u201d Such a comment in a pretrial conference does not constitute use of the evidence before the jury. In fact, the record is clear that Wilson, as part of a reasoned defense strategy, disclosed his juvenile record in his opening statement at the sentencing proceedings and questioned his own witnesses about that juvenile record.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">Wilson\u2019s mitigation strategy involved numerous witnesses\u2019 testifying about his childhood. His juvenile record featured prominently in his mitigation case. Wilson was incarcerated at age fourteen, spent two years in institutions, and then lived in a foster home. Wilson\u2019s \u201cpersonality disorder\u201d diagnosis depended upon a juvenile record. According to Wilson, his father\u2019s alcoholism and neglect directly caused his juvenile record.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-10\">Having introduced the evidence himself, Wilson cannot now complain because the prosecutor cross-examined witnesses about his juvenile record or mentioned it in argument. See <em>State v. Montgomery, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 418, 575 N.E.2d at 173. \u201cA party cannot take advantage of an error he invited or induced.\u201d <em>State v. Seiber </em>(1990), 56 Ohio St.3d 4, 17, 564 N.E.2d 408, 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-11\">Wilson\u2019s remaining prosecutorial misconduct arguments also lack merit. \u201c[T]he touchstone of due process analysis in cases of alleged prosecutorial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>misconduct is the fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor.\u201d <em>Smith v. Phillips </em>(1982), 455 U.S. 209, 219, 102 S.Ct. 940, 947, 71 L.Ed.2d 78, 87. \u201c[T]here can be no such thing as an error-free, perfect trial, and * * * the Constitution does not guarantee such a trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Hasting </em>(1983), 461 U.S. 499, 508-509, 103 S.Ct. 1974, 1980, 76 L.Ed.2d 96, 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">The prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination about people who kill strangers and Wilson\u2019s possible future conduct was not improper given Wilson\u2019s attempt to present himself as not dangerous when he was off alcohol. Wilson also did not always object so as to preserve any error. The prosecutor could discredit favorable defense childhood testimony by cross-examining witnesses about Wilson\u2019s childhood vandalism.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Since Wilson first presented evidence that he adjusted well to imprisonment, the prosecution could properly cross-examine a defense witness about Wilson\u2019s attempt to escape from custody. The limited victim-impact testimony of Lutz\u2019s mother did not violate constitutional guarantees. Mrs. Lutz expressed no opinion about the penalty. <em>Payne v. Tennessee </em>(1991), 501 U.S. 808, 830, 111 S.Ct. 2597, 2611, 115 L.Ed.2d 720, 739, at fn. 2; <em>State v. Fautenberry </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 435, 438, 650 N.E.2d 878, 881-882; see <em>State v. Lorraine, </em>66 Ohio St.3d at 420-421, 613 N.E.2d at 218-219.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">Prosecutorial characterization of Wilson as a \u201cwalking time bomb\u201d was not unreasonable under the testimony given. Prosecutors can be \u201ccolorful or creative.\u201d <em>State v. Brown </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 305, 317, 528 N.E.2d 523, 538. Prosecutors can urge the merits of their cause and legitimately argue that defense mitigation evidence is worthy of little or no weight. The prosecutor did not err by arguing that others with deprived childhoods do not necessarily commit such crimes. See <em>State v. Murphy </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 554, 570-571, 605 N.E.2d 884, 899; <em>State v. Richey </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 353, 370, 595 N.E.2d 915, 929. The trial court\u2019s sentencing instructions cured any asserted prosecutorial misstatements of law. <em>State v. Greer </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 236, 251, 530 N.E.2d 382, 400.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">With respect to Wilson\u2019s allegations about prosecutorial misconduct, we find that such misconduct did not permeate the trial, and that Wilson received a fair trial, if not a perfect one. Compare <em>State v. Landrum, </em>53 Ohio St.3d at 110-112, 559 N.E.2d at 716-718; <em>State v. Johnson </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 96, 101-103, 545 N.E.2d 636, 642-643. We therefore reject Wilson\u2019s fifth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">In his seventh proposition of law, Wilson argues that the trial court erred in failing \u201cto consider and give effect to his relevant mitigating evidence.\u201d Wilson argues that the trial court\u2019s sentencing opinion did not give appropriate mitigating weight to his alcoholism, confession, adaptation to incarceration, and youth. However, the sentencing opinion shows that the court did consider all asserted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>mitigating factors. \u201c[T]he assessment and weight to be given mitigating evidence are matters for the trial court\u2019s determination.\u201d <em>State v. Lott, </em>51 Ohio St.3d at 171, 555 N.E.2d at 305. \u201c[E]vidence of an offender\u2019s history, background and character which the * * * trial court * * * considered, but did not find to be mitigating, need be given little or no weight against the aggravating circumstances.\u201d <em>State v. Stumpf </em>32 Ohio St.3d 95, 512 N.E.2d 598, paragraph two of the syllabus. See, also, <em>State v. Steffen, </em>31 Ohio St.3d 111, 31 OBR 273, 509 N.E.2d 383, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The trial court\u2019s sentencing opinion indicates that the court correctly understood the weighing process and the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof. The court of appeals had earlier recognized and corrected the only notable error. Any imprecision in the trial court\u2019s opinion, as well as the minor mistake regarding the accused\u2019s age, was inconsequential.\u00bb Also, our independent reassessment of the sentence cures any arguable error. <em>State v. Lott, supra. </em>Thus, we reject Wilson\u2019s proposition of law seven.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Wilson, in proposition of law twenty-six, argues that the trial court erred in imposing prison sentences along with the death penalty. That claim lacks merit. <em>State v. Campbell </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 38, 52, 630 N.E.2d 339, 352. In addition, Wilson cannot now complain since he failed to object at trial. <em>State v. Williams </em>(1977), 51 Ohio St.2d 112, 5 O.O.3d 98, 364 N.E.2d 1364.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">INDEPENDENT SENTENCE ASSESSMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">In proposition of law six, Wilson argues that the death sentence is inappropriate for him. After independent assessment, we find that the evidence proves, beyond a reasonable doubt, the aggravating circumstance charged against Wilson, <em>ie., </em>that he killed Lutz \u201cfor the purpose of escaping detection, apprehension, trial, or punishment\u201d for kidnapping Lutz. R.C. 2929.04(A)(3). We find nothing in the nature and circumstances of the crimes themselves to be mitigating.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-10\">Wilson\u2019s history and background do provide some mitigating features. Until he was fourteen, Wilson suffered at the hands of a tyrannical, alcoholic father, who alternatively teased, beat, and neglected his sons. His mother could do little and ultimately abandoned him to his father. At fourteen, Wilson was adjudged delinquent, spent two years in an institutional setting, and then lived successfully in a foster home for four years. Undoubtedly, Wilson\u2019s \u201cpersonality disorders\u201d resulted in part from that deprived childhood. We find all of this entitled to some weight. However, its significance is undercut by the fact that, at about age seventeen, Wilson had an opportunity for a fresh start in life, in a loving home, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>and he failed to follow through successfully. We find nothing in Wilson\u2019s character to be mitigating.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">We accord appropriate weight to the statutory mitigating factor of age. See R.C. 2929.04(B)(4). Wilson was twenty-one at the time of the offense. No other statutory mitigating factor in R.C. 2929.04(B)(l)-(3), (B)(5), or (B)(6) is raised by the evidence or applicable. As to R.C. 2929.04(B)(7), \u201cother factors,\u201d Wilson\u2019s anti-social and borderline personality disorders, his alcoholism, his confession, and his adaptation to confinement collectively deserve some weight. However, Wilson confessed only after he was identified and taken into custody, and thus his confession is entitled to little weight. Personality disorders are often accorded little weight because they are so common in murder cases. Alcoholism is of little mitigating value here because, as we have previously discussed, Wilson\u2019s claim that he was drunk when he killed Lutz does not hold up under examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">In this case, the aggravating circumstance outweighs the combined mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. Wilson acted in the full light of the afternoon, hours after waking up and thinking about his options. When weighed against this aggravating circumstance, the mitigating factors \u2014 his history, background, youth, alcoholism, and the \u201cother factors\u201d cited \u2014 are of minor consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">The death penalty is both appropriate and proportionate when compared with similar capital cases. <em>State v. Lawson </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 336, 595 N.E.2d 902; <em>State v. Brewer </em>(1990), 48 Ohio St.3d 50, 549 N.E.2d 491; <em>State v. Stumpf </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 95, 512 N.E.2d 598.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b645-9\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E.

All jurors denied knowledge of the events at issue in the trial, except as indicated. Beere, \u201cheadlines\u201d only; Edwards, heard and saw \u201csomething about it\u201d; Schlegelmilch, \u201cread a little bit,\u201d but had no opinion; Schuller, \u201cread some articles,\u201d but had no opinion; Perez, \u201chaven\u2019t followed it much\u201d; Barnes, recalled hearing about it \u201c[a] long time ago.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b632-9\">. Wilson\u2019s counsel asked Sibley what factors he would like to know about an accused before deciding on the sentence. Sibley replied he would \u201clike to know about the crime\u201d and that \u201cwould be the deciding factor\u201d or \u201cmain thing.\u201d It isn\u2019t possible for a prospective juror to know what, if any, mitigating factors are to be considered before being accepted as a juror. Sibley stated he would follow the court\u2019s instructions and not his personal views, would fairly consider mitigating factors, and would consider penalties other than death if the evidence warranted. We find that no basis for challenge existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>Wilson\u2019s counsel objects to Clutter because Clutter had read about the case, and at some point became \u201ctoo disgusted\u201d to read further. Clutter stated she could not understand \u201cwhy in the world anybody would bum anybody.\u201d Clutter also stated that she had \u201cno idea what happened\u201d and thus had no opinion as to the guilt or innocence of Wilson. She stated that she would not \u201cjudge anybody until\u201d she \u201chearts] everything.\u201d She agreed to set aside any feelings of disgust, to follow the court\u2019s instructions, and to consider mitigating evidence and penalties other than the death penalty. The court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting Wilson\u2019s challenge to Clutter.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">Edwards expressed concern over her absence from a family business in the event she was sequestered for \u201ca week or something.\u201d She said, \u201c[I]f it\u2019s more than a couple of days, it\u2019s going to be a problem.\u201d She also stated, \u201cAs long as I go home at night that\u2019s okay.\u201d She promised not to think about her business \u201cin this courtroom\u201d and to \u201cgive this ease\u201d her \u201cfull attention.\u201d She promised to \u201cbe here and listening\u201d during all court sessions. Again, the court did not abuse its discretion by rejecting this challenge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
