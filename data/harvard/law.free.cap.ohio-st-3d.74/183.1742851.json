We therefore also reject the arguments raised in respondent\u2019s objections \u2014 (1) that his unauthorized communication with Mrs. Cooper was ethical because her signature was not required to execute the transfer of the liquor license, and (2) that his unauthorized request for information from a represented party was permissible because the opposing counsel had not identified his address in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">Apparently, respondent contends that Mrs. Cooper was not represented in the liquor license transfer by the Coopers\u2019 general counsel and, therefore, respondent could not have communicated with her about \u201cthe subject of [her] representation\u201d in that matter. DR 7 \u2014 104(A)(1). The subject of the representation at issue, however, was the sale of the gas station, including the agreement to transfer the liquor license, and the Coopers\u2019 general counsel plainly represented Mrs. Cooper\u2019s interests, as well as those of her husband, in the entire transaction. Moreover, another \u201csubject of the representation\u201d about which respondent had no authority to communicate with Mrs. Cooper was the Coopers\u2019 credit with the bank respondent represented. Respondent nevertheless surprised Mrs. Cooper at her home, which generated their discussion about the possibility of the bank\u2019s foreclosure. Either way, respondent\u2019s communications with Mrs. Cooper violated DR 7-104(A)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">Furthermore, an attorney is not relieved of the duty to communicate only with the attorney of a represented party by the opposing counsel\u2019s failure to confirm the representation in writing. DR 7 \u2014 104(A)(1) forbids such communication upon the attorney\u2019s knowledge of the party\u2019s representative, and respondent admits having had that knowledge here.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">We, therefore, publicly reprimand respondent for having committed these two violations of DR 7-104(A)(l). Costs taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b429-11\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Wright, Resnick, F.E.
