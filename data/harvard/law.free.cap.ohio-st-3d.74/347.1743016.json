Upon review, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and find Tonia to be wholly dependent upon decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">R.C. 4123.59(D)(2) reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">\u201cThe following persons shall be presumed to be wholly dependent for their support upon a deceased employee:</p>\n<p id=\"b593-11\"><em>a </em>* # *</p>\n<p id=\"b593-12\">\u201c(2) A child under the age of eighteen years * * * upon only the one parent who is contributing more than one-half of the support for such child and with whom he is living at the time of the death of such parent, or for whose maintenance such parent was legally liable at the time of his death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-13\">Children bom out of wedlock have the same status as legitimate children in terms of dependency. See <em>Boston v. Daugherty </em>(1984), 12 Ohio App.3d 8, 12 OBR 92, 465 N.E.2d 1321. Contrary to appellant\u2019s representation, there is absolutely no evidence that the commission\u2019s decision was based on Tonia\u2019s illegitimacy. The order is based solely on the commission\u2019s conclusion that decedent did not contribute over one-half of Tonia\u2019s support.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-14\">Appellant objects, asserting that the commission improperly excluded other income earned by Franklin. Appellant argues that adding this extra money to decedent\u2019s substantiated wages demonstrates that decedent contributed more than one-half of Toma\u2019s support, when compared with total monthly household income. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-15\">The commission is the sole evaluator of evidentiary weight and credibility. <em>State ex rel. Burley v. Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E.2d 936. It was the commission\u2019s prerogative to reject Boston\u2019s unsubstantiated allegation of odd-job income. The commission did not abuse its discretion in choosing to rely on only those sources of income that could be verified by payroll or tax records.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>Appellant also argues that the commission erred in expanding the time frame over which Franklin\u2019s support was evaluated. Claimant proposes that R.C. 4123.59 \u201crequires the determination as to which parent is contributing more than one-half the support for such child and with whom he is living <em>at the time of the death of such parent. </em>It does not permit, nor does it authorize a provision for making that determination as of one year prior to the death of such parent or six months prior to the death of such parent, six weeks prior to the death of such parent or six hours prior to the death of such parent.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Appellate\u2019s assertion is untenable. To make such a restricted evaluation would be impossible, and, if attempted nonetheless, would lead to false determinations. Under appellant\u2019s theory, years of diligent support or disgraceful nonsupport could be nullified by a single act that coincidentally preceded death. Such a scheme operates to no one\u2019s benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">The commission did not, therefore, err in finding that decedent did not contribute over half of Tonia\u2019s support. It is at this point, however, that the commission\u2019s analysis ends. Appellant again objects, arguing that even if decedent did not contribute over one-half of Toma\u2019s support, a finding of whole dependency is warranted if the deceased employee had a legal obligation of support. Appellant relies on the following language:</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">\u201cA child under the age of eighteen years * * * [is presumed wholly dependent] upon only the one parent who is contributing more than one-half of the support for such child and with whom he is living at the time of the death of such parent, <em>or </em>for whose maintenance such parent was legally liable at the time of his death.\u201d (Emphasis added.) R.C. 4123.59(D)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">The commission reads the statute differently:</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">\u201cA child under the age of eighteen years * * * [is presumed wholly dependent] upon only the one parent who is contributing more than one half of the support for such child <em>and </em>with whom he is living at the time of the death of such parent, or for whose maintenance such parent was legally liable at the time of his death.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">Under the commission\u2019s interpretation, a finding of a contribution of half support is a necessary prerequisite for death benefits. Once such a finding is made, a claimant must also establish either cohabitation or a legal obligation. Appellant, on the other hand, asserts that a claimant need only establish the fact of half support or a legal obligation to provide support. We favor appellant\u2019s reading.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-11\"><em>State ex rel. Wright v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1943), 141 Ohio St. 187, 25 O.O. 277, 47 N.E.2d 209, at paragraph three of the syllabus, held that \u201c[u]nder the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, dependency is based on the right to support rather than upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>the actual fact of support.\u201d In that case, decedent and his wife divorced prior to his death. His minor daughter, under the divorce decree, went to live with her mother and decedent remarried. Decedent was ordered to pay a weekly amount and evidently was given visitation rights. Decedent, however, never visited his daughter and never made the required payments. After decedent\u2019s industrial death, both his widow and his daughter filed for death benefits. The commission awarded the maximum amount of compensation, allocated between widow and daughter. The widow objected to any award to the daughter, arguing that the daughter \u201c(1) * * * had no \u2018right to support\u2019 from her father, such obligation being the legal responsibility of her mother under the circumstances, and (2) since Jean\u2019s father never contributed anything to her support after the divorce, she lost nothing by his death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 189, 25 O.O. at 278, 47 N.E.2d at 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">We disagreed, reasoning that parents had both a statutory (see former R.C. 2151.42 and former 3113.01) and common-law obligation to support their minor children \u2014 an obligation that was \u201cnot extinguished by a decree granting [the father] a divorce and giving to the mother custody of the child.\u201d <em>Id., </em>paragraphs one and two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Professor Young in his treatise Ohio Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law (2 Ed.1971) 154, Section 7.35, echoes <em>Wright:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">\u201cThe statutes do not specifically define dependency, but the purpose of providing death benefits is to compensate for loss of support. The actual fact of support does not control; the critical issue is the legal right to support.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\"><em>Wright </em>best exemplifies the undesirability of the commission\u2019s interpretation. The commission\u2019s theory twice penalizes the child of a neglectful parent. If the child does not get the actual financial support due during the course of the deceased parent\u2019s life, he or she will be precluded from death benefits as well. Given this result and R.C. 4123.95\u2019s directive to construe the workers\u2019 compensation statutes in favor of employees and their dependents, appellant\u2019s interpretation is more persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">We recently commented on the legal ramifications of the parent/child relationship in <em>Bercaw v. Bercaw </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 160, 161, 543 N.E.2d 1197, 1199:</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">\u201c * * * [P]arents have continuing support obligations to their children. These obligations are defined by statutes in the common law * * *. Society expects that those who bring children into this world will care for and attend to those children * * *. This obligation continues until the duty of support expires, whether due to the child reaching the age of majority, adoption, or some other legal termination of that duty. Until such termination of parental support obligations occurs, a parent may not unilaterally cease supporting his minor children. * * * \u201d (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>We, therefore, find that decedent\u2019s legal obligation towards Tonia entitles her to whole dependency status.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">The judgment of the court of appeals is hereby reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b596-7\">Douglas, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b596-8\">Moyer, C.J., Wright and Cook, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b596-9\">Cook, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ai7\">dissenting. I respectfully dissent as I find the construction of R.C. 4123.59(D)(2) adopted by the majority unsound. It ignores phrasing in the statute which, if acknowledged, admits of only one meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">While R.C. 4123.59(D)(2) is a challenging statute to understand from a cursory reading, the aim of the statute is made clear in the following diagram:</p>\n<p id=\"b596-11\">\u201cA child under the age of eighteen years * * * [is presumed wholly dependent] upon:</p>\n<p id=\"b596-12\">only the one parent[:]</p>\n<p id=\"b596-13\">[1] who is contributing more than one-half of the support for such child[;]</p>\n<p id=\"b596-14\">and</p>\n<p id=\"b596-15\">[2] with whom [the child] is living at the time of the death of such parent,</p>\n<p id=\"b596-16\">or</p>\n<p id=\"b596-17\">[3] [the child] for whose maintenance such parent was legally liable at the time of his death.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b596-18\">In contrast, the majority\u2019s reading of the statute looks like this:</p>\n<p id=\"b596-19\">\u201cA child under the age of eighteen years * * * [is presumed wholly dependent] upon [EITHER]:</p>\n<p id=\"b596-20\">[1] only the one parent who is contributing more than one-half of the support for such child and with whom [the child] is hving at the time of death of such parent, OR</p>\n<p id=\"b596-21\">[2] [either parent (because all parents have a legal duty to support their children) ].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-22\">The reading adopted by the majority seems illogical. It is unlikely that the legislature would , have fashioned such a strict category as set forth as the majority\u2019s alternative [1] above, followed by a catch-all that swallows the first category completely. It allows a presumption of wholly dependent status for any child because every parent has a common-law and statutory obligation to support. Why then did the General Assembly set forth criteria for the wholly dependent presumption status as between the parents of a child? What possible sense does it make that one category considers the amount of support actually provided and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>the other negates it completely? How, under this reading, could the commission ever get to the partial dependency, case-by-case considerations as set forth in the statute?</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">Under the majority view, a child can be presumed wholly dependent upon <em>both </em>parents because, as the analysis goes, every parent has a continuing obligation to support a child. The General Assembly, however, obviated such a construction of the statute by employing the phrase \u201cupon only the one parent.\u201d When determining the presumption, the line is drawn as between the parents by using the \u201cmore than one-half of the support\u201d language because, as between two persons, only one of them can logically contribute <em>more </em>than one-half support. The majority reading of R.C. 4123.59(D)(2) ignores the emphasis upon \u201conly the one parent\u201d and attributes no meaning to the corollary language regarding more than one-half support.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The commission correctly determined that contributing more than one-half support is a necessary condition to a presumption of whole dependency status, together with either cohabitation or a legal obligation of support.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">The majority concludes that the commission\u2019s interpretation is \u201cundesirable\u201d because a child of \u201cneglectful parents\u201d is \u201ctwice penalized,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>denied death benefits because she did not actually receive financial support during the parent\u2019s lifetime. However, R.C. 4123.59(D)(2) does not preclude a dependent child from receiving death benefits. Rather, the statute precludes a child from being presumed wholly dependent. In fact, R.C. 4123.59(D) provides, \u201cIn all other cases, the question of dependency, in whole or in part, shall be determined in accordance with the facts in each particular case existing at the time of the injury resulting in death of such employee * * Nothing in the statute precludes a child who is not presumed wholly dependent from presenting additional evidence to establish whole or partial dependency status. Thus, the majority\u2019s concern that a child is twice penalized is unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">Finding no error in the logical construction applied to the statute by the commission and \u201csome' evidence\u201d supporting the factual conclusions, I would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals denying the writ.</p>\n<judges id=\"b597-8\">Moyer, C.J., and Wright, J., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
