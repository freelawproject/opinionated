Sweeney, Sr., J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGl\">The main issue before this court is whether the comparative negligence defense is applicable to a professional negligence claim of a client against its accountant. For the following reasons, we find that the comparative negligence defense is applicable in accounting negligence cases. Accordingly, the trial court erred in granting the motion <em>in limine </em>and in not giving an instruction on the comparative negligence defense. Nevertheless, we affirm the court of appeals\u2019 upholding of the jury\u2019s verdict because the error was not prejudicial in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-10\">The \u201caudit interference\u201d rule was set forth in <em>Natl. Sur. Corp. v. Lybrand </em>(1939), 256 A.D. 226, 9 N.Y.S.2d 554. At that time, New York recognized contributory negligence as a complete bar to recovery. In <em>National Surety, </em>the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, held that contributory negligence constituted an affirmative defense for accountants only if the client\u2019s negligence contributed to the accountant\u2019s failure to perform his contract and to report the truth. While this rule was adopted by a number of jurisdictions, a review of these cases shows that none discusses its applicability in a state recognizing comparative negligence, with the exception of <em>Fullmer v. Wohlfeiler &amp; Beck </em>(C.A.10, 1990), 905 F.2d 1394 (applying Utah law). See <em>Lincoln Grain v. Coopers &amp; Lybrand </em>(1984), 216 Neb. 433, 345 N.W.2d 300; <em>Jewelcor Jewelers &amp; Distrib., Inc. v. Corr </em>(1988), 373 Pa.Super. 536, 542 A.2d 72; <em>Cereal Byproducts Co. v. Hall </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>(1956), 8 Ill.App.2d 331, 132 N.E.2d 27; <em>Greenstein, Logan &amp; Co. v. Burgess Marketing, Inc. </em>(Tex.App.1987), 744 S.W.2d 170. The audit interference rule was made to soften what was then the \u201charsh rule\u201d of negligence law which barred recovery of damages if there was any contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff. Note, The Peculiar Treatment of Contributory Negligence in Accountants\u2019 Liability Cases (1990), 65 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 329, 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">However, in light of Ohio\u2019s comparative negligence statute enacted in 1980, R.C. 2315.19(A), there is no need for a special rule and, thus, we reject the application of the audit interference rule in Ohio. Hence, any negligence by a client, whether or not it directly interferes with the accountant\u2019s performance of its duties, can reduce the client\u2019s recovery. In so holding, we note that virtually all courts that have expressly considered the applicability of the audit interference rule to their comparative negligence states have agreed and rejected the rule. See <em>Halla Nursery, Inc. v. Baumann-Furrie &amp; Co. </em>(Minn.1990), 454 N.W.2d 905, 909 (\u201cBecause we have broadly construed the comparative fault act and applied it to other professional malpractice actions, we * * * hold that the trial court did not err in applying the principles of comparative fault in this action by a client against an accountant for negligent failure to discover embezzlements in the client\u2019s business.\u201d); <em>Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Deloitte &amp; Touche </em>(E.D.Ark. 1992), 834 F.Supp. 1129, 1144-1147 (applying Arkansas law); <em>Devco Premium Fin. Co. v. N. River Ins. Co. </em>(Fla.App.1984), 450 So.2d 1216 (declined to adopt the audit interference rule because it was based on principles of contributory negligence, which had been repudiated in Florida); <em>Capital Mtge. Corp. v. Coopers &amp; Lybrand </em>(1985), 142 Mich.App. 531, 537, 369 N.W.2d 922, 925; <em>Natl. Credit Union Adm. Bd. v. Aho, Henshue &amp; Hall </em>(Aug. 30, 1991), E.D.La. No. 90-4443, unreported, 1991 WL 174671 (applying Louisiana law).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Ohio has adopted comparative negligence for all negligence actions not covered by statute. R.C. 2315.19; <em>Wilfong v. Batdorf </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 100, 6 OBR 162, 451 N.E.2d 1185, overruled in <em>part </em>and modified in part on other grounds, <em>Van Fossen v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co. </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 100, 522 N.E.2d 489. Thus, comparative negligence is the law of Ohio in negligence cases, including professional negligence cases, where appropriate. See <em>Cincinnati Riverfront Coliseum, Inc. v. McNulty (1986), 28 Ohio </em>St.3d 333, 28 OBR 400, 504 N.E.2d 415. As to the application of the comparative negligence defense in the present case, we note that while accountants should exercise ordinary care in conducting their accounting activities, the persons who hire accountants, usually businesspersons, should also be required to conduct their business activities in a reasonable and prudent manner. <em>Halla Nursery, Inc. v. Baumann-Furrie, supra, </em>454 N.W.2d at 909.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>Based on the foregoing, we conclude that Ohio\u2019s comparative negligence law is applicable to a client\u2019s claim against its accountant for professional negligence. Accordingly, the trial court erred in granting the motion <em>in limine </em>as to PW\u2019s comparative negligence defense and in failing to give an instruction on comparative negligence to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">However, despite the trial court\u2019s initial ruling granting the motion <em>in limine, </em>the record demonstrates that PW was not precluded from presenting extensive evidence tending to show that Scioto\u2019s own conduct was a cause of its losses, in addition to the negligence of PW. As the trial court noted in its decision denying PWs motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, \u201cDefendant properly developed an appreciable body of evidence on the alleged acts of Plaintiff which would comprise all such affirmative defenses. These were before the jury * * * to use in establishing proximate cause as defined for the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">PW primarily argues about the trial court\u2019s exclusion of evidence regarding Scioto\u2019s failure to obtain business-interruption insurance. However, as the trial court noted, \u201cthe $4,000,000.00 hole in PlantifPs [sic ] protective coverage was clearly and repeatedly presented to the jury.\u201d Moreover, failure to obtain such insurance constitutes comparative negligence only with regard to the damages attributable to the delays caused by the fire and not the other damages which the jury found Scioto to have sustained as a result of PW\u2019s negligence and breach of contract. The court of appeals recognized that the jury award improperly included damages that resulted from the fire, and ordered a remittitur to cure the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">Accordingly, we find that while the trial court should have allowed the comparative negligence defense, in this case the error was cured by the court of appeals\u2019 remittitur and, therefore, did not constitute prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">Likewise, the trial court\u2019s failure to give an instruction on comparative negligence was not prejudicial error in this case as Scioto\u2019s alleged negligence pertained mainly to the damages caused by the fire which, as we stated above, does not constitute comparative negligence. The court of appeals\u2019 remittitur properly reduced the jury award by the amount of damages attributable to the fire. Furthermore, evidence pertaining to the negligent acts of Scioto was presented to the jury during the trial. The jury was instructed that it should not award any damages to Scioto which were not caused by PW. The jury was instructed that if Scioto failed to act reasonably to avoid or reduce its losses, it could not recover any such damages. Despite these instructions, the jury still awarded Scioto all of its damages, indicating that the jury found PW the sole cause of the failure of Richmond Place. Thus, we find that even if the jury had been required to apportion the fault between the parties in this case, the outcome would have been the same. The jury found that PW was solely liable for Scioto\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>loss. Accordingly, since there was no prejudicial error, a new trial is not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">As to Scioto\u2019s Cross-Proposition of Law I, in which Scioto attacks the trial court\u2019s denial of prejudgment interest, we find that the trial court\u2019s order was within its discretion and will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Kalain v. Smith </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 157, 159, 25 OBR 201, 203, 495 N.E.2d 572, 574. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying prejudgment interest in the present case as the court found that PW had an objectively reasonable belief that it had no liability. In Cross-Proposition of Law II, Scioto urges that the remittitur ordered by the appellate court be modified. However, where a party voluntarily chooses to accept a remittitur, rather than a new trial, it cannot challenge that remittitur on appeal. <em>Iron RR. Co. v. Mowery </em>(1881), 36 Ohio St. 418, paragraph three of the syllabus. This rule is fundamentally fair, as it simply binds a party to its election. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Finally, we do find merit in Scioto\u2019s third Cross-Proposition of Law, which contends that the court of appeals erred when it ordered post-judgment interest on Scioto\u2019s verdict to run from September 1, 1988. This was the date the <em>nunc pro tunc </em>entry was filed, which corrected a typographical error in the case number of the original judgment entry filed on August 4, 1988. Since post-judgment interest should run from the date of the original August 4, 1988 judgment entry, we reverse the court of appeals\u2019 finding on this issue and order post-judgment interest to run beginning August 4, 1988. See R.C. 1343.03(B); <em>In re Petition for Inquiry into Certain Practices </em>(1948), 150 Ohio St. 393, 38 O.O. 258, 83 N.E.2d 58, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b723-7\">Resnick and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b723-8\">Cook, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b723-9\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas and Wright, JJ., concur in part and dissent in part.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b723-10\">Cook, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A0Q\">concurring. I concur with the judgment of the majority but dissent from the syllabus. Primarily, my disagreement is with the concept that any negligence of a client, whether or not it directly interferes with the accountant\u2019s performance, can reduce the client\u2019s recovery. I would hold, instead, that comparative negligence may be applied only to negligent acts of a client that contribute to the accountant\u2019s failure to perform according to the standards of the accounting profession. Other negligence by the client, such as the claimed negligence of Scioto here, is to be considered in the context of whether Scioto\u2019s damages proximately resulted from its own conduct as opposed to the profession<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>al negligence of Price Waterhouse. I would adopt the reasoning of the court of appeals affirming the trial court\u2019s decision not to instruct on comparative negligence in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">I also note that although the majority finds that the trial' court erred in granting the motion <em>in limine, </em>error may not be predicated on a preliminary ruling. The resulting exclusion of evidence offered at trial may be raised as error on appeal and Price Waterhouse claims such error.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Douglas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part. I concur with the syllabus of the majority and the discussion in the opinion supporting the syllabus. I respectfully dissent from the judgment of the majority and the remainder of the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">This case involves a plethora of issues including (1) comparative negligence, (2) intervening or superseding cause, (3) judicial estoppel, (4) measure of damages, (5) prejudgment interest, (6) post-judgment interest, (7) the \u201ctwo issue\u201d rule, and (8) remittitur. Herein, I deal only with comparative negligence and judicial estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">Comparative Negligence</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">The majority properly says that \u201cany negligence by a client, whether or not it directly interferes with the accountant\u2019s performance of its duties, can reduce the client\u2019s recovery. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">\u201c * * * Thus, comparative negligence is the law of Ohio in negligence cases, including professional negligence cases, where appropriate. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b724-11\">\u201c * * * Accordingly, <em>the trial court erred </em>in granting the motion <em>in limine </em>as to PW\u2019s comparative negligence <em>defense and in failing to give an instruction </em>on comparative negligence to the jury.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b724-12\">Notwithstanding all the foregoing, the majority then finds that because PW was permitted to present <em>\u201cextensive </em>evidence tending to show that Scioto\u2019s own conduct was a cause of its losses,\u201d the error of the trial court in granting the motion <em>in limine </em>was \u201ccured by the court of appeals\u2019 remittitur and, therefore, did not constitute prejudicial error.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b724-13\">This is the first place that I respectfully part company from the majority. In <em>Marshall v. Gibson </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St.3d 10, 12, 19 OBR 8, 10, 482 N.E.2d 583, 585, we said that the judge in that case \u201cmust be reversed on the grounds that the trial judge committed prejudicial error in refusing to instruct the jury on comparative negligence * * I recognize that it can be argued that the rule emanating from <em>Marshall </em>(that it is error not to instruct the jury on comparative negligence when the evidence dictates such a charge) was based on the particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>facts of <em>Marshall. </em>However, given the unequivocal statement of the majority herein that it was error for the trial court not to give an instruction on comparative negligence, it is difficult to ignore the teachings of <em>Marshall </em>in this regard. My reason for so concluding is simple \u2014 we will never know what the jury might have decided had the jury had all the evidence before it that the granting of the motion <em>in limine </em>precluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Judicial Estoppel</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">The doctrine of judicial estoppel prevents a party from staking out a position in a subsequent action that is inconsistent with a position taken in a prior action. In the case at bar, I believe that Scioto took a position that was inconsistent with a prior position taken by it in a Kentucky court.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">As set forth by the majority, the Richmond Place project was largely destroyed by fire on June 1, 1983. The fire, caused by a welder\u2019s torch, placed the project in serious jeopardy as to sales, revenues and competition for the existing market. At the time of the commencement of the Richmond Place project, Lexington, Kentucky, had no comparable facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">On August 13, 1984, Scioto sued its general contractor, Foster &amp; Creighton Company (\u201cF &amp; C\u201d), in a Kentucky court. In that suit, Scioto presented evidence that the negligence of F &amp; C had caused Scioto $11.8 million in damages. The depositions of at least two of Scioto\u2019s corporate officers were taken. Each swore that the Richmond Place project was on sound financial footing prior to the fire and that the subsequent failure of the venture was attributable to the fire. Because of a liquidated damages clause in the contract between Scioto and F &amp; C, the maximum Scioto could obtain from F &amp; C was $1.2 million. Before trial, the parties settled for something less than the full amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">In the case at bar (the \u201cOhio\u201d case), Scioto claims that the failure of the project was due to the negligence of PW and that the fire caused Scioto no more real harm in the long run. One of the same corporate officers whose deposition was taken in the Kentucky suit now says, in the Ohio case, that the value of the project was not destroyed by the fire but the project was, instead, a failure before the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-10\">On this point, Scioto\u2019s position in the Ohio case cannot be reconciled with its position in the Kentucky case. However, the court of appeals decided that Ohio does not recognize the doctrine of \u201cjudicial estoppel\u201d in cases like the one now before us. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-11\">In <em>Fish v. Lake Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1968), 13 Ohio St.2d 99, 102, 42 O.O.2d 290, 292, 234 N.E.2d 590, 592, this court took the position that a party who had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>previously, in a judicial proceeding, successfully asserted one of two inconsistent substantive rights may not, in a later judicial proceeding, assert the other inconsistent right. While the term \u201cjudicial estoppel\u201d is not used in the case, it is fair to say, I believe, that the term is descriptive of the case holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">If the position taken by Scioto in the Kentucky suit is to be given credence (as it was), then Scioto should not now be heard, in the Ohio case, to say something entirely different from and contradictory to the position it took in the Kentucky case. This is not just the old \u201ctwo bites of the apple\u201d theory. This is total consumption of the same apple twice \u2014 a seemingly impossible feat.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">For the foregoing as well as some additional reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b726-9\">Moyer, C.J., and Wright, J., concur in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
