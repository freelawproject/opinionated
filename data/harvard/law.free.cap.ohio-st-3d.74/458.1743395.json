Gay v. Mihm </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 315, 626 N.E.2d 666. Upon review, we find such relief to be inappropriate, and return the cause to the commission for further consideration and amended order pursuant to <em>State ex rel. Noll v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 203, 567 N.E.2d 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">Preliminary to any consideration of relief pursuant to <em>Gay </em>is a finding that <em>Noll </em>has not been met. <em>State ex rel. Sebestyen v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 36, 38, 641 N.E.2d 197, 199. <em>Noll </em>noncompliance in this case stems from a deficiency which we are encountering with increasing frequency \u2014 the inconsistency between the commission\u2019s actions and words.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-10\">The commission cites claimant\u2019s occupational longevity as evidence that retraining is unimpeded by age. Several months earlier, however, the commission refused to refer claimant to its own rehabilitation division because it felt that claimant was too old. Claimant either is or is not too old for effective retraining \u2014 he cannot be both.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-11\">Left to decide between <em>Noll </em>or <em>Gay </em>relief, we elect the former. As we reaffirmed in <em>State ex rel. Pass v. C.S.T. Extraction Co. </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 373, 658 N.E.2d 1055, we will not review the commission\u2019s findings <em>de novo. </em>To proceed further in this instance would force us to speculate as to which age assessment more accurately reflects the commission\u2019s views \u2014 an action we decline to take. Guidance from the commission is imperative on this important issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed and a limited writ is issued that returns the cause to the commission for further consideration and amended order.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and limited unit granted.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b705-6\">Douglas, Wright, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b705-7\">Moyer, C.J., and Cook, J., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b705-8\">Cook, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AQO\">dissenting. I respectfully dissent. Because I consider the commission\u2019s order to have sufficiently explained its bases for the decision to deny permanent total disability compensation to this claimant, I would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals to deny the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">In explaining its order, the commission cited that the claimant is not medically prevented from performing light to sedentary work, that factors such as his work history as a vocational instructor and his prior participation in a vocational program support his ability to retrain vocationally, and that the file reflects that the claimant planned to work for a number of years past retirement. <em>Noll </em>requirements are satisfied by the commission\u2019s order, in my view, and there is \u201csome evidence\u201d in the order which supports the decision. Thus, the decision of the commission that claimant is able to sustain remunerative employment should not be overridden by the age and education factors seized by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-10\">The rationale of the majority decision can legitimately be construed to mean that if a claimant is over eighty years old with a seventh grade education, that claimant is permanently and totally disabled as a matter of law.</p>\n<judges id=\"b705-11\">Moyer, C.J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
