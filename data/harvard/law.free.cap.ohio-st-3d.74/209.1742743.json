X. We also agree, in the main, with the board\u2019s recommendation; however, we consider a two-year probation period more appropriate for the public\u2019s protection. Moreover, consistent with relator\u2019s suggested sanction, we are inclined to credit respondent for the purpose of his actual suspension period from December 16, 1994, the date on which he conscientiously entered the Prospect House and had already ceased practicing law on his own accord. Therefore, we order that respondent be suspended from the practice of law in Ohio for two years; however, one year of this sanction is suspended, respondent is placed on probation for two years under the conditions established by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>board, and the period of his actual suspension is deemed to have commenced on December 16, 1994.
