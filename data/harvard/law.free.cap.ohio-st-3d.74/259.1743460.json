Gay v. Mihm </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 315, 626 N.E.2d 666. Because we agree with claimant\u2019s initial contention, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">The commission did not include claimant\u2019s psychiatric condition in its deliberations. The court of appeals, however, held that <em>State ex. rel. Cordray v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1990), 54 Ohio St.3d 99, 561 N.E.2d 917, supported the commission\u2019s action. In so doing, the court of appeals erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The relevant chronology is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\"><em>June 27, 1990 </em>\u2014 Claimant\u2019s permanent total disability compensation application heard;</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\"><em>August 7, 1990 </em>\u2014 Claimant moves for additional allowance of psychiatric condition; \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\"><em>September 6, 1991 </em>\u2014 Permanent total disability compensation denied;</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\"><em>September 30, 1991 </em>\u2014 Claimant moves for reconsideration;</p>\n<p id=\"b507-11\"><em>June 12, 1992 </em>\u2014 Psychiatric condition allowed; and</p>\n<p id=\"b507-12\"><em>April 13, 1993 </em>\u2014 Reconsideration denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-13\">In examining the confusing order of events, we hold neither claimant nor the commission to be blameless. Claimant did not seek psychiatric allowance until after the permanent total disability compensation hearing. The commission, for its part, took an inordinately long time to adjudicate the three motions before it\u2014 fourteen months for permanent total disability compensation, two years for the psychiatric allowance, and eighteen months for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-14\">Irrespective of fault, one fact controls \u2014 by the time reconsideration was denied, \u201cmajor depressive disorder\u201d was an allowed condition. This distinguishes this case from <em>Cordray.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b507-15\">In <em>Cordray, </em>the commission held claimant\u2019s permanent total disability compensation motion in abeyance in order to secure a commission specialist\u2019s exam. During the abeyance period, claimant submitted a vocational report. Permanent total disability compensation was later denied, without consideration being given to the vocational report. Claimant challenged the omission to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-16\">We found no abuse of discretion. We reasoned that, under Ohio Adm.Code 4121-3-09(0(5), the commission, \u201chaving the discretion to grant or deny additional time for hearing preparation, * * * must also have the discretion to accept or reject evidence submitted thereafter.\u201d <em>Cordray, </em>54 Ohio St.3d at 101, 561 N.E.2d at 919.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-17\">Under <em>Cordray, </em>the commission, in this case, was indeed free to disregard the psychiatric evidence. The critical difference is that, unlike <em>Cordray, </em>the commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>sion <em>did </em>consider the belated evidence and, once it did, moved beyond Cordray\u2019s protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Once the commission allowed the psychiatric condition prior to the commission\u2019s conclusive denial of permanent total disability compensation, the issue became one of additional <em>conditions, </em>rather than one of additional evidence. Unlike additional evidence, there is no precedent supporting the denial of permanent total disability compensation absent consideration of all allowed conditions. The commission, therefore, erred in not granting reconsideration and incorporating the condition into its deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals, direct the commission to vacate an order, and return the cause for consideration of all allowed conditions and amended order. Until the commission does so, any further discussion of claimant\u2019s potential eligibility for permanent total disability compensation is premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">The judgment of the court of appeals is hereby reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and limited writ allowed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b508-9\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Wright, Resnick, F.E.
