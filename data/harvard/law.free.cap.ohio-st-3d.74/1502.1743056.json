This cause is pending before the court as a discretionary appeal and cross-appeal. It appears from the records of this court that appellee/eross-appellant, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, has not filed a memorandum in response/memorandum in support of cross-appeal, due January 10, 1996, in compliance with the Rules of Practice of the Supreme Court and therefore has failed to prosecute this cause with the requisite diligence. Upon consideration thereof,</p>\n<p id=\"AoWn\">IT IS ORDERED by the court that the cross-appeal of State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1503\">*1503</page-number>Company be, and hereby is, dismissed <em>sua sponte, </em>effective January 17, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"AqrR\">The appeal of Barbara A. Thompson, Admr., etc., et al. remains pending.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
