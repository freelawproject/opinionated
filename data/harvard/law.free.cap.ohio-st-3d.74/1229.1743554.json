Barrett, counsel for defendant Marvin L. Warner, seeking the disqualification of Judge Robert P. Ruehlman from further proceedings in the above-captioned case. Pending before Judge Ruehlman is defendant\u2019s Motion to Suspend Further Execution of Sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-13\">The affidavit alleges that comments made by Judge Ruehlman at the execution of sentence on April 23, 1991 evidence bias and prejudice against the defendant and a prejudgment of the merits of the pending motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-14\">A transcript of the April 23, 1991 proceedings indicates that Judge Ruehlman made this unsolicited remark: \u201c[I]f the parole board calls me I am going to tell them that you should serve the full three and one-half years.\u201d (Sentencing transcript at 30, lines 1-3.) This remark suggests \u201cthe formation of a fixed anticipatory judgment on the part of the judge, as contradistinguished from an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1230\">*1230</page-number>open state of mind\u201d such that a reasonable person could question whether the decision on the pending motion \u201cwill be governed by the law and the facts.\u201d <em>State ex rel.
