Sweeney, Sr., J.</author>\n<p id=\"AU8\">At issue in this case is whether forty percent of the award to claimant was part of the total award for permanent partial disability, as determined by the Industrial Commission, or was an award for facial and head disfigurement, as appellant contends. Since the Industrial Commission\u2019s decision is supported by some evidence in the record, we reject appellant\u2019s argument that claimant was compensated for facial and head disfigurement and affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>The computation of claimant\u2019s award of fifty percent permanent partial disability is supported by three of the four medical reports contained in the record. Nevertheless, appellant challenges that portion of the award (forty percent) which was characterized in some of the medical reports as a \u201cdisfigurement impairment.\u201d Appellant presumes that since the term \u201cdisfigurement impairment\u201d was used, the claimant was, in essence, being compensated pursuant to R.C. 4123.57(B) for serious facial or head disfigurement.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">The evidence in the record fails to support appellant\u2019s position. In fact, the disfigurement sustained by the claimant extends beyond his face and head region and is estimated to cover forty percent of his body. Thus, the medical reports that refer to \u201cdisfigurement\u201d do not simply focus on disfigurement to claimant\u2019s face and head but instead recognize more extensive scarring to his whole body as well as the physical limitations which result from the scarring and skin contractures. For instance, Dr. Conte notes that claimant has scarring on the right side of his body with contraction and limitation of movement in his right arm and that claimant will need ongoing therapy to prevent joint contractures and possible future release surgeries. Likewise, Dr. Clarence J. Louis, a commission specialist, notes that claimant has generalized scarring of his body and recommends ongoing therapy to prevent contractures.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">We do not believe that the Industrial Commission abused its discretion in granting claimant a fifty percent permanent disability award. The claimant was not merely compensated for facial or head disfigurement. As the court of appeals referee notes, \u201cthe permanent partial disability award was not made for head disfigurement and scarring <em>per se </em>but rather was awarded to compensate for the physical dysfunctions noted in the medical evidence which resulted from scarring and disfigurement due to claimant\u2019s injuries.\u201d Therefore, since the commission\u2019s decision is supported by some evidence in the record, this court will not disturb those findings. <em>State ex rel. Milburn v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1986), 26 Ohio St.3d 119, 26 OBR 102, 498 N.E.2d 440. Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b590-8\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b590-9\">Wright and Cook, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b590-10\">Wright, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AHT\">dissenting. This court today upholds a determination by the Industrial Commission of a fifty percent permanent partial disability that is in large part attributable to a disfigurement. Such a determination is contrary to statutory law (see R.C. 4123.57[B]) and longstanding case law. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>Not all disfigurements caused by industrial accidents are compensable. <em>State ex rel. Butram v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1932), 124 Ohio St. 589, 180 N.E. 61, paragraph one of the syllabus. The court held that <em>only </em>those disfigurements that affect the face or head, which are serious, and which impair the disfigured person\u2019s ability to secure or retain employment are compensable. <em>Id. </em>That holding is now codified as part of R.C. 4123.57(B). Betzner has not applied for an award under R.C. 4123.57(B), which is the exclusive section of R.C. Chapter 4123 that allows compensation for disfigurement. The disfigurement suffered by Betzner, grievous as it is, is not compensable as a percentage of permanent partial disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The issue here is whether the PPD award to Betzner included a percentage for disfigurement. Given that the doctors\u2019 reports relied on by the commission allocate forty percent of the whole person (of a fifty percent award) to \u201cdisfigurement impairment,\u201d I would limit the determination of permanent partial disability to ten percent: the maximum disability in the record that is wholly attributable to medical impairment and therefore the maximum disability for which there is some evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Thus, for the reasons stated, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b591-7\">Cook, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
