Mead and David S. Dunscomb, as trustees for the persons who might be holders of certain mortgage bonds, issued by the company and secured by the mortgage, to the amount of $2,000,000.

At common law he would not be. By the statute of Anne the common law was changed. In <em>Moss </em>v. Gallimore, 1 Douglass, 279, it was holden that a mortgagee after notice to a tenant under a prior lease was entitled to the rent. This decision was expressly based upon the statute. The statute never having been enacted in this state has as such no force here. Our ancestors expressly rejected the common law. 1 Colonial Records, 509; <em>Fitch </em>v. Brainard, 2 Day, 189; <em>Fish </em>v. <em>Fish, </em>1 Conn., 559; <em>Card v. Grinman, </em>5 id., 168; <em>Baldwin </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>21 id., 181. In all the decided cases and in all the text-books where the doctrine claimed by the mortgagees here is laid down or recognized as law, the authority traced back leads to the case of <em>Moss </em>v. <em>Gallimore </em>and to no other. At common law livery of seizin or possession being essential, and a mortgagee being in possession by his tenant \u2014 in order to perfect the conveyance the tenant was required to attorn to the mortgagee. The possession of the tenant being the possession of the landlord, attornment being a change of landlords was a change of possession. But the statute provided \u201c that all grants of reversions should be as good and effectual to <em>dll intents and purposes </em>\u201d without attornment as with. By mere force of the statute delivery of a deed became a delivery of possession, and the mortgagee of the reversion being in contemplation of law in possession was therefore entitled to the rent. The notice required by the statute was solely for the protection of the tenant, but conferred no rights on the mortgagee beyond the rights he had from his mortgage. In this state there is no distinction between a grant of a reversion and a grant of any other interest in real estate. A mortgagee in this state and in New York, where this mortgage was made, takes the interest in lands conveyed by the mortgage (be it a reversion or whatever it may be) merely as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>security, leaving the ownership for all other purposes in the mortgagor. <em>Leonard </em>v. Bosworth, 4 Conn., 421; <em>Huntington </em>v. Smith, id., 235; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Beach, </em>6 id., 150; <em>Toby </em>v. <em>Heed, </em>9 id., 224; <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>15 id., 556; <em>Packer </em>v. <em>Rochester &amp; Syracuse R.

A mortgagor in possession is as regards the rents and profits the real owner. <em>Lacon </em>v. <em>Davenport, </em>16 Conn., 341; <em>Bank of Ogdensburgh </em>v. <em>Arnold, </em>5 Paige, 38; <em>Astor v. Turner, </em>11 id., 436; <em>Clason v. Corley, </em>5 Sandf., 447, 454; <em>Cheney </em>v. <em>Woodruff, </em>45 N. York, 98; <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>51 id., 447; <em>Galveston R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Cowdrey, </em>11 Wall., 459; <em>Gilman </em>v. <em>Illinois &amp; Miss. Telegraph Co., </em>91 U. S. Reps., 603. In <em>Am. Bridge Co. </em>v. <em>Heidelbach, </em>94 U. S. Reps., 798, it was holden that mortgagees are not entitled to rent until possession is taken under the mortgage and then only from the time possession is taken. But the defendants claim that mortgagees of reversions are an exception to the rule. No z\u2019eason however can be given why one mortgagee should be preferred to another. No case can be found where it has been holden that a mortgagee of a reversion could recover rent without an attornment or something by statute expressly made equivalent thereto. \u201cA mortgagee of a reversion is entitled to rent after notice, but cannot recover it by suit unless the lessee has attorned.\u201d 2 Swift Dig., 292; 1 Smith Leading Cases, 697; 4 Kent Com., 166; <em>Baldwin </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>21 Conn., 181. In the last case, which was an action by a mortgagee of a reversion, the tenant Walker, before any rent became due upon notice promised to pay it to the plaintiff; not doing so the plaintiff brought his suit and alleged an attornment, which the defendant denied. This question of fact was tried by the parties and committed to the jury in the charge of the court. The plaintiff recovered because the jury found an attornment. No question was made about the effect of the notice. Here the defendants claim the rent by virtue of their notice, without any attornment. \u201c Rent is incident to reversion;\u201d true \u2014 so are rents and profits incident to title, but neither are incident to mortgages. The mortgage itself provides that the trustees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>may take possession and then \u201creceive the rents, &lt;fec.\u201d Possession is indispensable. If these mortgagees claim possession how did they obtain it ? By deed ?. Surely not; titles are conveyed in this state by deed; but not possession. By their notice ? Hardly; possession is not taken with paper.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b232-5\"><em>II B. Harrison </em>and <em>W.

The lease reserving the rents was executed on the 26th day of February, 1872, and was for the term of five years from the 1st day of March then next, when the defendants entered into possession under the lease. Subsequently, on or about the first day of October, 1872, the lessors, being the owners of the leased premises, mortgaged the same, with other p'roperty situate in the state of New York, to secure the payment of certain bonds of the mortgagors, amounting to the sum of two million dollars, to David S. Dunscomb and Erastus F. Mead, as trustees for those who might become holders of the bonds. .The principal of the bonds was made payable on the first day of October, 1892, and the interest semi-annually on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>the first day of April and the first day of October in each year, upon the presentation and surrender of the interest warrants or coupons which were annexed to the bonds. And the mortgage expressly authorized the mortgagees, after six months\u2019 default in the payment of interest, to enter into and take possession of the property mortgaged and receive the rents, income and profits thereof. Soon after the execution of the mortgage the bonds passed into the hands of <em>bond fide </em>holders for value, and still remain outstanding and unpaid. The mortgagors having made default in the payment of interest more than six months prior to the 15th day of March, 1875, and interest to a large amount being then due and unpaid, the mortgagees on that day gave notice thereof to the defendants and demanded of them the rents then due and thereafter to become due under their lease. Five days after-wards the plaintiff commenced a suit by foreign attachment against the mortgagors, the New York, Housatonic and Northern Railroad Company, and attached the rents then due, amounting to the sum of $2,215.60. In that suit the plaintiff recovered judgment, took out execution, placed the execution in the hands of a proper officer, and the officer, by virtue of the execution, on the 23d day of December, 1875, made demand of the present defendants of the sums contained in the execution and of any estate of the New York, Housatonic and Northern Railroad Company in their hands, but the defendants refused to comply with the demand. And on the 21st day of February, 1876, the suit upon which the proceedings below were had was brought. The court below rendered judgment in favor of the defendants; and the question is whether in so doing the court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">It is a well settled principle of the common law that the grant of the reversion of an estate expectant on the determination of a lease for years, passes to the grantee the rents reserved in the lease as incident to the reversion. Co. Litt., 151, 152; 2 Bl. Comm., 176; 4 Kent, 354. The consent of the tenant, expressed by what was called his attornment, was, however, necessary to the perfection of the grant in England, until the fourth year of the reign of Queen Anne; but in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>year a statute was passed which made the grant effectual without attornment. And since that time notice of the grant to the tenant has been sufficient to entitle the grantee to demand and recover the rents. <em>Birch </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>1 T. R., 384; <em>Lumley </em>v. <em>Hodgson, </em>16 East, 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Where the grant is by way of mortgage, the mortgagee, though entitled to the rents as incident to the reversion, may take them or not at his election. If he elects not to take them, as he generally does so long as his interest is paid, he may forbear to give notice to the tenant, and in that case the mortgagor is authorized to collect the rents and appropriate them to his own use. But if the mortgagee elects to take the rents and gives notice of his election to the tenant, he then becomes entitled to all the rents accruing after the execution of the mortgage and in arrear and unpaid at the time of the notice, as well as to those which accrue afterwards. But the rents in arrear at the time the mortgage was executed belong to the mortgagor. The leading authority for this doctrine is the case of <em>Moss </em>v. <em>Gallimore, </em>Doug., 279. The decision in that case seems to have settled the law in England. 2 Cruise Dig., 84; <em>Birch </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>supra; <em>Trent </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>9 Exch., 14. And its soundness, in view of the relations of a mortgagor and mortgagee of a reversion to each other and to a tenant in possession under a lease prior to the mortgage, cannot well be questioned. In commenting upon the decision, the learned English editor of Smith\u2019s Leading Cases observes that it \u201cis upon a point which seems so clear in principle that, were it not for its general importance, it would, perhaps, be matter of surprise that any case should have been deemed requisite to establish it.\u201d 1 Smith\u2019s Lead. Cas., 698. It is true, as suggested by counsel for the plaintiff, that the court, in making that decision, was governed by the provisions of the statute of Anne. But the principle embodied in that statute, and enforced in the case of <em>Moss </em>v. <em>Gallimore, </em>has been adopted by the courts of last resort in many of our sister states (4 Kent, 165); and was expressly sanctioned and approved by this court in the case of <em>Baldwin </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>21 Conn., 168. In that case one Stoddard, being the owner of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>an undivided half of certain real estate, leased it to the defendant for a term of years and afterwards mortgaged it to the plaintiff. The defendant had notice of the mortgage, but refused to pay to the plaintiff the rent due under the lease; and the plaintiff sued in an action of covenant to recover it, and judgment was rendered in his favor. The case then came to this court upon a motion for a new trial, and also upon a motion in error. Both motions were unsuccessful, and the judgment below was affirmed. Church, C. J., in giving the opinion of the court, after referring to the lease, and declaring that as between Stoddard the lessor and the defendant the lease must be treated as an effective one and as leaving when made a x'eversion in Stoddard, says: \u2014 \u201cBy his mortgage to the plaintiff this reversion, as a subsisting legal interest, was coxxveyed or assigned to the plaintiff, unless he elected to treat it as void. This he has not done, but claims, as he may, his right as mortgagee or assignee to the rent incident to such reversionciting 2 Cruise\u2019s Dig., 111; <em>Moss </em>v. Gallimore, Doug., 279; 2 Swift Dig., 179; <em>Fitchburg Manuf\u2019g Co. </em>v. Melvin, 15 Mass., 268. The leaxmed judge then obsexwes that, \u201cif the lease had beeix executed <em>after </em>the mortgage to the plaintiff, he could not as mox\u2019tgagee, perhaps, have any remedy for the recovery of this rent, without attornment, for want of legal priority.\u201d That case is decisive of the one at bar and fully sustains the coui\u2019t below in the judgment which it rendered in favor of the defendants. The judgment must, tlxerefox\u2019e, be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b235-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
