'</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-12\">Scire Facias upon a process of foreign attachment; brought to the City Court of the city of Hartford, and appealed by the defendants \u2018from the judgment of that court to the Superior Court for Hartford County. In the latter court the plaintiff moved that the case be erased from the docket on the ground that it was not appealable from the City Court, but the court (Sanford, J\".,) denied the motion, and at a later term judgment having been rendered for the defendants, the plaintiff brought the case before this court by a motion in error, assigning as error the denial of the motion that the case be erased from the docket.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b59-13\"><em>Gr.

It is proceeded with in all respects as a suit at law. The writ is issued by the clerk of the court which rendered the original judgment, it contains a summons to the defendant to appear and answer, and upon it property may be attached; and although it is not an original writ, but a judicial writ, still \u201cit is an action, it may be pleaded to as an action, and may be released by a release of all actions.\u201d Williams, J., in <em>Ensworth </em>v. <em>Davenport, </em>9 Conn., 392; and see cases there cited. Judge .Swift, (1 Swift\u2019s Digest, 731,) says: \u201cIf the garnishee makes default <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>of appearance, or refuses to disclose what goods, &amp;c., he had in his hands at the time of the service of the original writ, judgment may be rendered against him as of his own proper debt. The defendant may appear and plead any proper plea in his defense, and under the general issue the case may be tried to the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">The case of <em>Smyth </em>v. <em>Ripley, </em>33 Conn., 311, fully sustains the claim of the defendants that a scire facias is an action at law. Actions at law and suits at law are synonymous terms; they are one and the same thing. In the General Statutes writs of scire facias are classified under the head of civil actions, and it is provided (page 396, sec. 1,) that \u201cmesne process shall lie in actions at law, including writs of scire facias, a writ of summons or attachment, &amp;c.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">We find no error in the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b61-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
