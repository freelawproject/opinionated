It proceeded to use the invention for a purpose which might or might not be within its license, according to the true construction. It notified the patentee, who approved, and accepted royalty thereon. While this course of business was continuing, the' plaintiff took an exclusive license under the same patent, but expressly subject to the defendant\u2019s existing rights. Plaintiff did not know the extent of these rights, except as shown by the written license, and at that time made no inquiry. Some' months later it did inquire from the patentee and from the defendant whether defendant had any other rights under the patent, and both replied in the negative. Claiming that defendant company\u2019s continued use in the broader sense was not within its written license, properly construed, the plaintiff brought this infringement suit, and joined the patentee as defendant. Defendant company\u2019s rights, as against the patentee, to continue the use in question, cannot be doubted. It is not important whether their mutual conduct was a construction of their ambiguous contract, or whether it was the granting of a further and oral license. Plaintiff\u2019s license was expressly subject to the defendant company\u2019s rights, whatever they were. The answers which both defendants made to the plaintiff\u2019s inquiries could not change the actual situation, unless on the theory of an estoppel; and plainly there could be no estoppel by answer to plaintiff\u2019s question, when plaintiff\u2019s only action in the matter had been finished before it made the inquiry. The decree of the court below, dismissing the bill, is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
