St. \u00a7 1259), quoted in the footnote,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> emphasizes, and in our judgment makes mandatory, that the additional jurors be taken from the body of the district and not from bystanders; but the further provision that they be \u201csummoned,\u201d if it should he deemed to require them to be summoned specifically as grand jurors, seems to us to be merely directory. See Steers v. U. S., 192 F. 1, 112 C. C. A. 423; Merchants\u2019 Co. v. U. S., 199 F. 902, 118 C. C. A. 232; Williams v. U. S. (C. C. A.), 275 F. 129. If the names of qualified persons have been drawn from the box as prescribed by statute, and duly summoned by the marshal for jury service at the term of court, and if the court order the marshal to select six of those thus summoned and place them on the grand jury list, every substantial provision of the statute would seem to be complied with.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-21\">The supplemental record filed herein recites that \u201cthe grand jurors summoned and returned by the marshal, according to the order of the court, having been called, the following answered and appeared: [Then follow the names of the 16.]\u201d Nothing further appearing in the record, we hold the grand jury thus selected to have been legally constituted.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-23\">It suffices to say of the other alleged errors, that we do not deem the district attorney\u2019s argument or any statement by the trial judge to the jury to have been in any manner improper or subject to objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-24\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b623-25\"> \u201cEvery grand jury impaneled before any District Court shall consist of not less than sixteen nor more than twenty-three persons. If of the persons summoned less than sixteen attend, they shall be placed on the grand jury, and the court shall order the marshal to summon, either immediately or for a day fixed, from the body of the district, and not from the bystanders a sufficient number of persons to complete the grand jury. And whenever a challenge to a grand juror is allowed, and there are not in attendance other jurors sufficient to complete the grand jury, the court shall make a like order to the marshal to summon a sufficient number of persons for that purpose.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
