In discussing these assignments the defendants apparently overlook the rule that this appellate court is not authorized to weigh the evidence which was submitted to the jury, but is required .only to ascertain from the record whether substantial evidence was submitted to the jury sufficient to sustain their verdict. In this case there was testimony of disinterested witnesses, as well as the testimony of the plaintiff, that the fishing gear was placed on board the vessel, and that its value was at least $7,000, and that five-sevenths of it was shipped under deck as required by the terms of the policy. As' to the proof of loss of underdeek cargo and proof of actual total loss there was testimony that about 2 o\u2019clock in the morning, while the vessel was anchored in Smallpox Bay, San Juan Island, fire broke out on the vessel, and, being unable to extinguish it, the master and crew took to a boat; that they stood watching and tried to save some nets from the vessel, but failed; that after burning 20 minutes the gasoline tank exploded, the vessel filled with water, and sank in about one hour; that nothing was saved from the fire except the fire extinguishers, a handsaw, and the skiff; that everything else was lost. One witness testified that all the fishing gear put on board the boat \u201cwas destroyed by fire,\u201d and that, if any of the nets were still there when the vessel sank, they would be good for nothing. Clearly in view of this testimony the trial court would not have been justified in instructing the jury to find for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
