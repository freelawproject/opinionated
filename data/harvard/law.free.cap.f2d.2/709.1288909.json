St. \u00a7 10296) for subornation of perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-21\">1. The indictment undertook to allege in the same count, first, the commission of perjury by one Almashy, and then the subornation thereof by Link. The false oath was made before a United States Commissioner, to procure, under the National Prohibition Act (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923, \u00a7 10138\u00bc et seq.), a search warrant for a house, and declared a purchase there by Almashy. The indictment-allegation of Almashy\u2019s perjury was in all respects completely formal, save that it omitted the word \u201cwillfully.\u201d The allegation of subornation is\u2014\u201cone Nick Link, well knowing that the * * * affidavit so given * * * as aforesaid was knowingly, willfully and corruptly made, as aforesaid, did feloniously willfully and corruptly suborn, incite and procure, etc.\u201d We are not prepared to say that in view of the scope which the courts in late years have given to the curative effects of R. S. \u00a7 1025 (C. S. 1916, \u00a7 1691), and section 269 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St. \u00a7 3246), we would now be as strict in requiring the presence of \u201cwillfully\u201d in a perjury indictment, as were some of the older decisions, like U. S. v. Edwards (C. C.) 43 F. 67, and U. S. v. Howard (D. C.) 332 F. 325 (though see U. S. v. Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542, 23 L. Ed. 588). The strictness would be particularly unnecessary in a ease where tho full circumstances stated strongly suggested willfulness. However that might he, when we find that tho false oath was taken, knowing it to be false, and then that its making was corruptly suborned and procured by another, every suggested element of perjury carried by the word \u201cwillfully\u201d is to bo found in the complete <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>indictment\u2014save for the possibility that the falsehood might have been inadvertent or under compulsion. How these possibilities can be reconciled with the allegation that the oath was \u201ccorruptly suborned and procured\u201d is not clear; but this indictment goes further. In the subornation clause, it expressly recites that the false oath had been \u201cwillful.\u201d We think this recital is sufficient, as against the suborner, to supply any otherwise possibly existing defect in the allegation of willfulness. We do not find that the exact point has been decided, but the tendency of the late decisions under R. S. \u00a7 1025, is to this effect. See Nickell v. U. S. (C. C. A. 9) 161 F. 702, 88 C. C. A. 562.</p>\n<p id=\"AGb\">2. The motion to direct a verdict for defendant is now said to have been based upon the lack of any sufficient proof that the false oath was in fact taken or of the official character of the person who administered the oath as United States Commissioner. The record contains, as Exhibit No. 1, attached to the bill of exceptions, what purports to be a copy of the affidavit in question, signed by Almashy (under a false name) and sworn to before J. Stanley Hurd, United States Commissioner. This exhibit was shown to Almashy and he admitted signing it. It was then stated by counsel, in the presence of the witness and without objection by any one, that the affidavit was \u201csworn to before J. Stanley Hurd, U. S. Commissioner.\u201d This statement being unchallenged, and Mr. Hurd being an officer of the court whose official position was judicially known to the court, and his signature not having been questioned when the exhibit was . received in evidence, there was no necessity for further proof of official character, signature, or administration of oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">3. The other objections presented have been considered, but we find nothing else meriting discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
