Appellee company filed its opposition to the registration of the mark on the ground that the word \u201cAl-Kol\u201d is merely a misspelling of the word \u201calcohol,\u201d and that the mark \u201cAl-Kol,\u201d if granted, would conflict with the right of the opposer to the use of the word \u201calcohol,\u201d associated with and upon various products placed upon the market by it, particularly compositions containing alcohol which are used for bathing and massaging, and other external uses, which it is alleged it has manufactured and sold in large quantities since February, 1921.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-24\">The contention that the opposer has no standing in an opposition proceeding to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>contest the registration of applicant\u2019s mark is without merit. It is not essential that the opposer shall have a similar trade-mark to justify opposition. It is sufficient, as in this ease, that a similar word has been used as a trade-name prior to the adoption of the mark by applicant. Johnson v. Brandau, 32 App. D. C. 348; Nairn Linoleum Co. v. Ringwalt Linoleum Works, 46 App. D. C. 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-4\">We agree with the Commissioner that the word \u201cAl-Kol\u201d is merely a phonetic or misspelling of the word \u201calcohol,\u201d and is descriptive of the goods oil which it is used, since they possess a large percentage of alcohol. It is equally descriptive of the goods of the opposer, on which the descriptive term \u201calcohol\u201d is used. As the court said in Standard Paint Co. v. Trinidad Asphalt Mfg. Co., 220 U. S. 446, 31 S. Ct. 456, 55 L. Ed. 536: \u201cThe word, therefore, is descriptive, not indicative of the origin or the ownership of the goods; and, being of that quality, we cannot admit that it loses such quality and becomes arbitrary by being misspelled. Bad orthography has not yet become so rare or so easily detected as to make a word the arbitrary sign of something else than its conventional meaning, as different, to bring the example to the present case, as the character of an ai\u2019ticle is from its origin or ownership.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">Appellant is here seeking to register merely a phonetic spelling of a descriptive word used by opposer upon its various goods possessing similar descriptive qualities. The word sought to he registered is confusingly similar to the descriptive word \u201calcohol.\u201d Opposer\u2019s use of the descriptive word, therefore, is sufficient to support the opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
