The record contains no bill of exceptions. Without a bill of exceptions, the motion for a continuance and the court\u2019s ruling thereon are not properly presented for consideration by an appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">Furthermore, the record before us does not in any way indicate that the facts alleged in the motion as grounds for a continuance were admitted or proved. For aught that in any way is disclosed, the ruling complained of may have resulted from a finding of the nonexistence of the facts alleged on the motion. The record shows no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
