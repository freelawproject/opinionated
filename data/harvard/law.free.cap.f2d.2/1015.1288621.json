While the record before us contains what purports to be a narrative of the trial, including the testimony and subsequent affidavits on the motion for a new trial, there is nothing in the nature of a bill of exceptions purporting to be signed by the trial - judge. As the only error assigned is the denial of the motion for a new trial on several grounds, we cannot properly pass thereon, in the absence of a bill of exceptions, even if we treated the assignment of errors as directed, not to a mere denial of the motion for a new trial, but to an abuse of discretion in, so doing. A reading, however, of the document, doubtless intended to be a bill of exceptions, satisfies us that the evidence cannot be deemed insufficient to sustain the verdict, and on grounds of substantial justice the other alleged errors would-not justify a reversal of the judgment.
