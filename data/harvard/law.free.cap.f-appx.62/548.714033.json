Parrish, Jr., appeals his conviction for possession with intent to distribute cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (2000). Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">Parrish contends that the district court should have granted his motion to suppress the evidence and the statements obtained as a result of a search warrant because the search warrant affidavit was not supported by probable cause, and the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule under <em>United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984), did not apply. We review a district court\u2019s factual findings underlying a motion to suppress for clear error, and the district court\u2019s legal determinations de novo. <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996); <em>United States v. Rusher, </em>966 F.2d 868, 873 (4th Cir.1992). When a suppression motion has been denied, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the government. <em>See United States v. Seidman, </em>156 F.3d 542, 547 (4th Cir.1998). We have reviewed the record and conclude that the search warrant application established probable cause to search Parrish\u2019s residence. We therefore decline to review Parrish\u2019s claim regarding the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">Accordingly, we affirm Parrish\u2019s conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
