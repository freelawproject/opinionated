Accordingly, we affirm No. 00-1959 on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Columbia Gas v. Burdette Realty, </em>102 F.Supp.2d 673 (S.D.W.Va. July 5, 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-12\">Because the district court dismissed the case and ordered it stricken from the docket, we find Columbia could not amend the complaint as of right under Rule 15(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. We further find the court did not abuse its discretion denying the motion to vacate the judgment under Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for the purpose of permitting it to amend the complaint with leave of court. <em>See NOW v. Operation Rescue, </em>47 F.3d 667, 669 (4th Cir.1995) (stating standard of review). Thus, we affirm the order in No. 02-2370.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-14\">We affirm the orders and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
