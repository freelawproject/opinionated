The district court entered orders noting deficiencies in Watkins\u2019 pleadings. Watkins filed a notice of appeal, creating appeal No. 03-6128. On November 14, 2002, Watkins filed a second 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition, which the district court, by orders dated November 14, 2002, and December 3, 2002, dismissed as redundant of his September 5, 2002, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition. Watkins filed a second notice of appeal, creating appeal No. 03-6129.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-28\">As to appeal No. 03-6128, this court may exercise jurisdiction only over final orders and certain interlocutory and collateral orders. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291, 1292 (2000). Watkins\u2019 appeal in this case is timely only as to the district court\u2019s deficiency orders, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>which are neither final orders, nor appeal-able interlocutory or collateral orders. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">As to appeal No. 03-6129, Watkins appeals the district court\u2019s orders, dated November 14, 2002, and December 3, 2002, dismissing his November 14, 2002, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition as redundant of his September 5, 2002, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition. Watkins cannot appeal these orders unless a circuit judge or justice issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A habeas petitioner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 1040, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.), <em>cert denied, </em>534 U.S. 941, 122 S.Ct. 318, 151 L.Ed.2d 237 (2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Watkins has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss this appeal as meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">We deny Watkins\u2019 motion to deconsolidate these appeals. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
