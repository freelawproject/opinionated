We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>have reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs and the record on appeal and are satisfied that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Gullett failed to make the requisite showing to warrant a new trial based on newly discovered evidence. <em>See United States v. Chavis, </em>880 F.2d 788, 793 (4th Cir.1989); <em>United States v. Wallace, </em>528 F.2d 863, 866 (4th Cir.1976) (applying test set forth in <em>Larrison v. United States, </em>24 F.2d 82, 87-88 (7th Cir.1928)). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Gullett\u2019s motion for a new trial. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
