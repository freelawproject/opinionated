California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which she raises the issue of whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>the district court\u2019s sentencing departure was reasonable. Moultrie was notified of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so. We conclude the district court sentenced Moultrie within the applicable guideline range. Mpultrie may not challenge his sentence as the district court did not depart from the applicable guideline range and the sentence was within that authorized by statute. <em>See United States v. Porter, </em>909 F.2d 789, 794 (4th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Moultrie\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform her client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
