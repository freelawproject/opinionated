We conclude that the record supports the immigration judge\u2019s conclusion that Gao and Zhang failed to establish their eligibility for asylum. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a) (2002); <em>Gonahasa v. INS, </em>181 F.3d 538, 541 (4th Cir.1999). As the decision in this case is not manifestly contrary to law, we cannot grant the relief that Gao and Zhang seek.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-20\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-21\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
