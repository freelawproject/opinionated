Faggart\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing her guilty plea was not entered into knowingly and voluntarily and the district court sentenced her incorrectly. Additionally counsel alleges claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and prosecutorial misconduct. However, counsel states that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues. Advised of her right to file a pro se supplemental brief, Faggart has not done so. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">Faggart\u2019s plea agreement contained a waiver of her right to appeal her conviction and sentence. Whether a defendant validly waived her right to appeal is a question of law, which this court reviews de novo. <em>United States v. Marin, </em>961 F.2d 493, 496 (4th Cir.1992). A waiver of a defendant\u2019s right to appeal contained in a valid plea agreement is enforceable if it is \u201cthe result of a knowing and intelligent decision to forego the right to appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Wessells, </em>936 F.2d 165, 167 (4th Cir.1991). We have reviewed Faggart\u2019s plea agreement and the Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 hearing and conclude she knowingly and intelligently waived her right to appeal. Further, we have reviewed Faggart\u2019s claims challenging the validity of her guilty plea and find them to be without merit. Consequently, the valid appeal waiver precludes review of her sentencing issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-11\">Faggart argues her counsel was ineffective. Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are generally not cognizable on direct appeal unless the trial record conclusively establishes ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997). To allow for adequate development of the record, ineffective assistance of counsel claims generally should be pursued in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) proceeding. <em>See United States v. Hoyle, </em>33 F.3d 415, 418 (4th Cir.1994). Because review of the record in this appeal does not conclusively establish ineffective assistance of counsel, we conclude Faggart\u2019s claim should be brought, if at all, in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding, not on direct appeal. Faggart makes no specific allegation of prosecutorial misconduct, and none is apparent in the record on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-12\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Faggart\u2019s conviction and sentence. We deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of her right to petition the Supreme Court <em>of </em>the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-13\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
