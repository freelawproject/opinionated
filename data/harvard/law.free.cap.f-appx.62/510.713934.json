On appeal, he contends his due process rights were violated because of alleged alterations to the order of removal and collateral documents. He further contends the taking of his fingerprints when he unlawfully re-entered the country violated the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protection against unreasonable search and seizure. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>In the context of a prosecution for illegal reentry after deportation, a defendant may collaterally attack a deportation order constituting an element of the offense if he can show that: (1) he was effectively deprived of his right to judicial review of the deportation order; (2) the deportation proceedings were fundamentally unfair; and (3) he has exhausted any administrative remedies that may have been available to seek relief against the deportation order. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d) (2000); <em>United States v. Mendoza-Lopez, </em>481 U.S. 828, 107 S.Ct. 2148, 95 L.Ed.2d 772 (1987). All three conditions must be satisfied. <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>316 F.3d 506, 509 (4th Cir.2003). We find that Kaczmarak cannot challenge the Order of Removal because the proceedings giving rise to the order were not fundamentally unfair. Kaczmarak failed to show he suffered prejudice as a result of the alleged defects. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">We further find the district court did not err by denying Kaczmarak\u2019s motion to suppress the fingerprint evidence. \u201cRoutine border searches may be conducted without a warrant or a showing of reasonable suspicion or probable cause.\u201d <em>United States v. Montoya de Hernandez, </em>473 U.S. 531, 538, 105 S.Ct. 3304, 87 L.Ed.2d 381 (1985). \u201cA \u2018routine\u2019 [border] search is one that does not seriously invade a traveler\u2019s privacy. In evaluating whether a search is \u2018routine,\u2019 the key variable is the invasion of the privacy and dignity of the individual.\u201d <em>United States v. Kelly, </em>302 F.3d 291, 294 (5th Cir.2002) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). We find Kaczmarak\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights were not violated when authorities took his fingerprints after he was lawfully detained after entering the country illegally.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">We affirm the conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
