Rodney Jones seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying his motion to alter or amend the judgment. We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-22\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-23\">The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on August 21, 2002. The notice of appeal was filed no earlier than October 31, 2002.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Because Jones failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal. We also deny Jones\u2019 motions for appointment of counsel and for protection from inmates and staff at the South Carolina Department of Corrections. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-24\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b574-19\"> Jones\u2019 notice of appeal was received by the district court on November 5, 2002. However, we must consider it filed as of the date it was delivered to prison officials for mailing. <em>See Houston </em>v. <em>Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988). Giving Jones every benefit of the doubt, his notice is deemed filed on October 31, 2002.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
