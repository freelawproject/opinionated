Page was sentenced to 292 months incarceration and 5 years of supervised release. Page timely appealed his conviction, and his attorney has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">On appeal, Page asserts that the magistrate judge erred in conducting his Fed. R.Civ.P. 11 plea colloquy, and consequently, that the district court erred in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. We review this claim for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Ubakanma, </em>215 F.3d 421, 424 (4th Cir.2000). Page\u2019s claims are meritless. Page cannot establish his plea colloquy was flawed, or that the district court erred in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Fed. R.Civ.P. 11; <em>United States v. Lambey, </em>974 F.2d 1389, 1394 (4th Cir.1992); <em>United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 116-17 (4th Cir.1991). <em>United States v. Moore, </em>931 F.2d 245, 248 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">Accordingly, we affirm Page\u2019s conviction and sentence. In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and find no other meritorious issues for appeal. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
