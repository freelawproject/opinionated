We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-21\">The petition for review is untimely as to the March 19, 2002, order that dismissed the appeal from the immigration judge\u2019s denial of Gatshetshiladze\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of deportation. <em>See Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405-06, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995) (holding time for filing petition for review is jurisdictional, and is not affected by filing motion to reconsider). Therefore, we lack jurisdiction to review that order. The petition for review is timely as to the Board\u2019s denial of the motion to reopen or reconsider. In his brief, Gatshetshiladze has made no arguments relevant to the denial of that motion, focusing instead on the March 19 order. Therefore, he has abandoned any such claims. <em>Yousefi v. INS, </em>260 F.3d 318, 326 (4th Cir.2001). However, we have reviewed the record and the Board\u2019s order and find that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2(b)(2) (2002); <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-22\">We deny as untimely the petition for review as to the Board\u2019s order of March 19, 2002. We deny the petition for review of the motion to reopen or reconsider, concluding that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying it. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-23\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
