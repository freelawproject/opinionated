Both pled guilty without plea agreements to armed bank robbery, aiding and abetting, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2, 2113(d) (2000), and brandishing a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, aiding and abetting, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2, 924(c) (2000). Drummond also pled guilty to bank robbery, aiding and abetting, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2, 2113(a) (2000). Butler challenges the magistrate judge\u2019s inquiry regarding the influence of medication at his Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 hearing. Both Appellants challenge the district court\u2019s imposition of a two-point enhancement under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3C1.2 (2000). In No. 01-4567, Drummond has filed a motion to file a pro se supplemental brief challenging the seven-year sentence under his \u00a7 924(c) count. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">Butler contends the magistrate judge conducted an inadequate inquiry into the potential effects of medications he was taking. Butler did not challenge the magistrate judge\u2019s inquiry below, therefore we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Vonn, </em>535 U.S. 55, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002). When a defendant raises a question about his state of mind, the court must conduct further inquiry into the defendant\u2019s competence to enter a guilty plea to ensure the guilty plea is knowing and voluntary. <em>United States v. Damon, </em>191 F.3d 561, 564-65 (4th Cir.1999). Upon Butler\u2019s statement he was under the influence of several medications, the magistrate judge engaged in a detailed inquiry regarding Butler\u2019s state of mind and requested a list of the medications he was taking. We find the magistrate judge\u2019s inquiry was adequate under <em>Damon </em>to ensure Butler\u2019s guilty plea was knowing and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-12\">Both Drummond and Butler contend the district court erred by enhancing their guidelines ranges under USSG \u00a7 3C1.2. We review the district court\u2019s enhancement under \u00a7 3C1.2 for clear error. <em>United States v. Harrison, </em>272 F.3d 220, 223 (4th Cir.2001), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 123 S.Ct. 162, 154 L.Ed.2d 61 (2002). The enhancement applies if the defendant recklessly created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another while fleeing from a law enforcement officer. USSG \u00a7 3C1.2. We find the defendants\u2019 conduct in fleeing the scene of the armed robbery sufficient to merit an enhancement under an aiding and abetting standard. <em>See United States v. Chong, </em>285 F.3d 343, 346 (4th Cir.2002); <em>Harrison, </em>272 F.3d at 223.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-15\">Drummond has filed a pro se motion we have construed as a motion to file a pro se supplemental brief. We grant this motion. Drummond argues he did not aid or abet his co-defendants\u2019 brandishing their weapons during the robbery. Drummond\u2019s guilty plea precludes his challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. <em>See United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number><em>States v. Willis, </em>992 F.2d 489, 490-91 (4th Cir.1993). We also reject Drummond\u2019s argument that his \u00a7 924(c) sentence violates <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). <em>See Harris v. United States, </em>536 U.S. 545, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 2414, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">We therefore grant Drummond\u2019s motion to file a pro se supplemental brief and affirm Drummond\u2019s and Butler\u2019s convictions and sentences. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal issues are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
