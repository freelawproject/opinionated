Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">Bartley contends he was denied his rights under the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161 (2000), and his constitutional right to a speedy trial. We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo. <em>United States v. Stoudemnire, </em>74 F.3d 60, 62 (4th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Reavis, </em>48 F.3d 763, 770 (4th Cir.1995). We find no error in the district court\u2019s decision to deny Bartley\u2019s motion to dismiss for denial of his statutory speedy trial rights. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h)(7), (8)(A); <em>United States v. Samo, </em>24 F.3d 618, 622 (4th Cir.1994); <em>see also United States v. Tedder, </em>801 F.2d 1437, 1450 (4th Cir.1986). Bartley also asserts that the delay in proceedings violated his constitutional right to a speedy trial. This claim is likewise meritless. <em>See Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 530, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972); <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>55 F.3d 144, 149 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-12\">Accordingly, Bartley\u2019s conviction is affirmed. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
