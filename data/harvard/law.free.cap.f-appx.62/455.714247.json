Mitchell, Jr., appeals the district court\u2019s order denying review of the Commissioner of Social Security\u2019s denial of Supplemental Security Income benefits. Mitchell contends only that the district court overlooked the Commissioner\u2019s fail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>ure to consider the report of a consultative physician as required by Social Security Ruling 96-6p (\u201cSSR 96-6p\u201d). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">This court reviews the Commissioner\u2019s final decision to determine whether it is supported by substantial evidence and whether the correct law was applied. <em>Pass v. Chater, </em>65 F.3d 1200, 1203 (4th Cir.1995). Because the Commissioner\u2019s decision indicates that the opinion of the consultative physician was considered and provides reasons for the weight accorded to that physician\u2019s report, we find no violation of SSR 96-6p. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.927(f) (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying judicial review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
