Azeez petitions for a writ of mandamus, alleging the district court has unduly delayed acting on his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000) petition. He seeks an order from this court directing the district court to act. The district court has recently entered an order ruling on Azeez\u2019s pending motions, appointing counsel, and scheduling an evidentiary hearing on the issues raised in his \u00a7 2254 petition. Accordingly, because the district court has recently tak<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>en significant action in Azeez\u2019s case, we deny the mandamus petition as moot. We grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis. We deny Azeez\u2019s motions for summary judgment by default and to submit evidence in support of the district court\u2019s alleged neglect. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
