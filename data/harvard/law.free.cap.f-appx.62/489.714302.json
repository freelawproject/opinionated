A loaded handgun was under the driver\u2019s seat of his car. He was charged with three counts of drug trafficking and two federal firearms offenses. He pled guilty to possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (2000) (Count 5), and using and carrying a firearm in a drug trafficking crime, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (2000) (Count 4). Palmer received a 70-month term of imprisonment for the \u00a7 922(g)(1) conviction and a consecutive 60-month term for the \u00a7 924(c) offense. He appeals his sentence, arguing, first, that the district court erred in applying the cross reference in <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(e)(l)(A) (2001) when it calculated the offense level for the \u00a7 922(g)(1) count and, second, that even if application of the cross reference was permissible, it should not have been applied in his case. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">The guideline sentence for a \u00a7 924(c) offense is the minimum sentence prescribed by the statute, <em>see </em>USSG \u00a7 2K2.4(a)(2), in this case 60 months, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(l)(A)(i). With regard to the \u00a7 922(g)(1) count, the base offense level was 20 because Palmer had a prior drug conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A). No enhancement was made for use or possession of the firearm in connection with another felony under USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) because the weapon that Palmer possessed in the course of the drug trafficking charge, the offense underlying the \u00a7 924(c) charge, was the basis for the possession of a firearm by a felon charge. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2K2.4, comment, (n.2) (\u201cIf the ... weapon that was possessed ... in the course of the underlying offense also results in a conviction that would subject the defendant to an enhancement under ... \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) (pertaining to the possession of any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense), do not apply that enhancement.\u201d). Application Note 2 directs that the \u00a7 924(c) sentence \u201caccounts for the conduct covered by [the enhancement under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5)] because of the relatedness of that conduct to the conduct that forms the basis for the conviction under the [\u00a7 924(c)] conviction.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b528-14\">While the court did not make any firearm enhancements, it applied, over Palmer\u2019s objection, the cross reference in \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(l)(A), which directs that \u201c[i]f the defendant used or possessed any firearm in connection with the commission or attempted commission of another felony offense,\u201d \u00a7 2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation or Conspiracy) should be applied with respect to the other offense if the resulting offense level is greater than the offense level otherwise determined under \u00a7 2K2.1. Section 2X1.1 provides that the base offense level and any adjustments are taken from the guideline for the substantive offense. Palmer\u2019s substantive \u201cother offense\u201d was drug trafficking. The court determined that he was responsible for at least 4.18 grams of crack. Palmer\u2019s base offense level was thus increased to 24. USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(8) [4-5 grams of crack]. With a three-level adjustment for acceptance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>responsibility, USSG \u00a7 3E1.1, Palmer\u2019s final offense level was 21. Palmer was in criminal history category V, which gave him a guideline range of 70-87 months for the \u00a7 922(g)(1) offense. He received the minimum sentence of seventy months, to be followed by the mandatory consecutive sixty-month term for the \u00a7 924(c) count.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">On appeal, Palmer renews his challenge to the application of the cross reference, arguing that Amendment 599, which in 2000 amended Application Note 2 to \u00a7 2K2.4, prohibits the sentencing court from enhancing a \u00a7 922(g)(1) sentence for use of the firearm in connection with another offense. We review the district court\u2019s legal interpretation of a guideline de novo. <em>United States v. Souther, </em>221 F.3d 626, 628 (4th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Palmer argues that Application Note 2 to \u00a7 2K2.4, in its current form, prohibits application of the cross reference in \u00a7 2K2.1(e)(l)(A) for use or possession of a firearm in connection with another offense when the defendant is also convicted of violating \u00a7 924(c) because the cross reference covers the same conduct as that covered by \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), an enhancement which is specifically prohibited in \u00a7 2K2.4. In his view, the same reasons the Sentencing Commission put forward for excluding the enhancement under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) \u201ccompel the conclusion\u201d that the Sentencing Commission did not intend to allow use of the cross reference to compromise its purpose for the amendment. We disagree. Application Note 2 specifically prohibits a weapon enhancement under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), but does not prohibit application of the cross reference in \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(l)(A). The Sentencing Commission could have, but did not, prohibit application of the cross reference in cases such as Palmer\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b528-11\">. The underlying offenses for the \u00a7 922(g)(1) felon in possession offense were: a 1991 New York assault conviction and a 1999 New York drug conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
