This Court may only grant a certificate of appealability if the appellant makes a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). The relevant inquiry is whether \u201c\u2018reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u2019\u201d <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 1040, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003) (quoting <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000)). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Beckford has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
