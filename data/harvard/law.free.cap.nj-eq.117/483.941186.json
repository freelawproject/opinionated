To this the respondent filed an answer, denying any acts of cruelty, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>also filed a counter-claim alleging adultery on the part of the wife, which he abandoned at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The cause came on for final hearing, resulting in a decree dismissing the petition of the wife, on the ground that the charge of extreme cruelty was not brought by the petitioner in good faith, and that she had failed to establish her cause of action. Prom this decree the wife appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">We conclude that the evidence justified the finding of the advisory master who heard the cause and advised the decree, and we do not think it should be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">The decree below is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\"><em>For affirmance </em>\u2014 The Chief-Justice, Parker, Lloyd, Case, Bodine, Donges, Heiier, Pbrskie, Van Buskirk, Kays, Hetfield, Dear, Wells, JJ. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\"><em>For reversal </em>\u2014 None.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
