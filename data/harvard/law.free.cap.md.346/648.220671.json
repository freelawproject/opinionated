Shapiro (Ms. Shapiro) and David L. Shapiro (Mr. Shapiro). Mr. Shapiro is a clinical psychologist. Ms. Shapiro is a computer programmer and teacher of computer science. Four children were born of the marriage: Sara (9/4/73), Laura (11/11/75), Ann (6/7/79), and Jonathan (1/7/82). Mr. Shapiro remarried in December 1988. Ms. Shapiro has not remarried.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">The Agreement was incorporated into, but not merged with, the divorce judgment granted the parties on August 29, 1988, by the Circuit Court for Howard County. Under the Agreement and the decree, the parties have joint custody of their children, whose primary residence is with their mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">The Agreement recites the parties\u2019 intent \u201cto settle all questions of maintenance and support, alimony, counsel fees, their respective rights in ... property ... and all other matters of every kind and character arising from their marital relationship.\u201d Payments by Mr. Shapiro \u201cas alimony\u201d are as required by parts 5(a) and (b) of the Agreement. Part 5(a) payments of $2,500 per month terminate on the first to occur of the death of either spouse or the arrival of January 1, 2009. There is no provision for the part 5(a) \u201calimony\u201d to end on Ms. Shapiro\u2019s remarriage. Part 5(b) payments of $1,250 per month commence January 1, 2009, and terminate on the first to occur of the death of either spouse or Ms. Shapiro\u2019s remarriage. For income tax purposes payments made pursuant to both parts are to be deducted by Mr. Shapiro and included in income by Ms. Shapiro.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">The January 1, 2009 termination date for part 5(a) \u201calimony\u201d bears no significant relation to the age of any of the children or to the termination of child support. Under the Agreement support for a child ends on the child\u2019s twenty-fifth birthday. The youngest child reaches age twenty-seven seven days after the part 5(a) payments end.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>Possible modification of the alimony is addressed in part 5(e), reading:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-5\"><em>\u201cSaid alimony payments shall not be modified by the Court except in the event that </em>Husband shall become temporarily or permanently disabled as defined in Husband\u2019s current disability insurance policy. In the event of such disability, Husband shall have the right to submit the issue of alimony to arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association or some similarly recognized arbitration association. The provisions of this paragraph will not apply if Husband and Wife agree to support modifications as a result of any disability. The level of support preceding Husband\u2019s disability shall remain in effect until said arbitration has resulted in the binding recommendation of a new support figure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">(Emphasis added). Part 5(f) requires Mr. Shapiro to maintain a disability policy at least as comprehensive as his policy then in effect so long as he is required to make \u201calimony\u201d payments. Mr. Shapiro is not and has not been disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">Mr. Shapiro also agreed to pay child support for his four children in installments of $250 per month for each child. Termination events are Mr. Shapiro\u2019s death, the death of an individual child, or the child\u2019s reaching age twenty-five. The Agreement contains a cost-of-living formula for annual adjustments of child support. Mr. Shapiro further agreed to be responsible \u201cfor such other Child-related expenses as medical, dental, and orthodonture expenses, the expenses of Bar and Bat Mitzvah, and camp,\u201d and \u201cto pay the reasonable costs of college tuition, room, and board for each child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">Approximately sixteen months after the divorce was granted Mr. Shapiro petitioned the court to rescind the Agreement or to modify it. His effort to rescind the Agreement was unsuccessful, and those issues are not before us. Subsequently, the court (Kane, J.) held that the provisions of the Agreement for the payment of alimony were subject to court modification, despite the express provision that the alimony payments were not to be modified, except in the event of Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>Shapiro\u2019s disability\u2014a condition that had not occurred. The court based its conclusion on <em>Langley v. Langley, </em>88 Md.App. 535, 596 A.2d 89 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\"><em>Langley </em>involved a separation agreement that provided for a court determination of spousal support in the event the husband were to become unemployed. But for that provision, the agreement was silent on modifiability <em>vel non </em>of support. When the husband sought a modification of the amount of support, although he was still employed, the trial court dismissed the petition because the sole condition for modification had not occurred. <em>Id. </em>at 537, 596 A.2d at 90. The Court of Special Appeals reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">It noted that FL \u00a7 8-103(c)(2) required \u201ca <em>specific </em>statement that support is not subject to <em>any </em>court modification,\u201d both of which were lacking in the Langleys\u2019 agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 540-41, 596 A.2d at 92. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-7\">\u201cWhile their agreement provides that the parties may petition the court to modify the support obligation if Mr. Langley should become unemployed, the agreement is devoid of a specific statement, as required by statute, in order to preclude the eourt from modifying the support obligation <em>under other circumstances. </em>Without the requisite definitive statement, their agreement is subject to modification by the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 541, 596 A.2d at 92 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">Ms. Langley then argued that the separation agreement, by limiting modification to one circumstance, was properly to be construed to prohibit modification under any other circumstances. The Court of Special Appeals rejected this contention. It repeated that FL \u00a7 8\u2014103(c)(2) \u201cunequivocally requires a <em>specific </em>statement that the agreement is not subject to <em>any </em>court modification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court further held that \u201c[wjithout the requisite \u00a7 8-103(c)(2) statement, the Langleys\u2019 spousal support provision is subject to modification despite\u201d the paragraph addressing the husband\u2019s possible unemployment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>Insofar as it bears on the issues before us, <em>Langley </em>may be read in two different ways. One passage, quoted above, strongly suggests that the Langleys\u2019 agreement would have complied with \u00a7 8-103(c)(2) if the provision concerning all circumstances other than unemployment specifically stated that it was not subject to any modification. On the other hand, the twice repeated statement of the effect of \u00a7 8-103(c)(2) refers the specific statement of non-modifiability to the entire agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">In the instant matter the Shapiros\u2019 Agreement expressly precludes court modification, except in the event of Mr. Shapiro\u2019s disability, when modification by an arbitrator is permitted. The circuit court concluded that <em>Langley </em>was not thereby distinguished. Failure to use the \u201crequisite\u201d language to block all modification made the Agreement potentially modifiable at any time and under any circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">At a later hearing, the court (Sweeney, J.) considered whether the spousal support provisions of the Agreement <em>should </em>be modified. There was evidence presented by Mr. Shapiro that the tax deductibility of alimony weighed heavily in setting forth in the Agreement the amount of spousal support as compared to child support. The court was persuaded by this evidence. Insofar as relevant to the issues now before us, the circuit court entered the following judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-7\">\u201c13. The alimony provisions of the parties\u2019 Agreement ... shall be considered child support for purposes of any further construction of the Agreement by this Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-8\">\u201c14. ... [Mr. Shapiro\u2019s] alimony and child support obligations are hereby modified to the effect that [Mr. Shapiro] shall be allowed an offset against his monthly child support obligation for each child who is attending college and for whom [Mr. Shapiro] is paying college education expenses in accordance with the ... Agreement. [Mr. Shapiro] shall further be allowed an offset in the amount of that child\u2019s proportionate share of his monthly alimony payments for each child who is attending college and for whom [Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>Shapiro] is paying college education expenses in accordance with the ... Agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Ms. Shapiro appealed to the Court of Special Appeals which, in an unreported opinion, affirmed those aspects of the circuit court judgment discussed above. The intermediate appellate court held that the circuit court properly had applied <em>Langley </em>(\u201cParagraph 5(e) of the Shapiros\u2019 agreement does not contain a provision, as required by statute ... to preclude the court from modifying the spousal support agreement obligation under <em>any </em>circumstances.\u201d). The intermediate appellate court also held that the circuit court had not erred in revising the divorce decree to recharacterize alimony as child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">We granted Ms. Shapiro\u2019s petition for certiorari which raises two questions. The first is whether FL \u00a7 8-103(c)(2) requires the alimony or spousal support provisions of a separation agreement to be entirely modifiable or entirely non-modifiable. We answer that question in the negative in Part I, <em>infra. </em>The second question presented is: \u201cIn the absence of fraud, mistake, or irregularity, may a court rewrite a marital settlement agreement which is part of an enrolled judgment?\u201d We reject the revision of the separation agreement in Part II, <em>infra.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">In \u00a7 8-103(e)(2) the word, \u201cprovision,\u201d appears four times in singular or plural number. The first appearance is in the statement of the general rule that \u201cthe court may modify any provision of a[n] ... agreement ... with respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>alimony or spousal support----\u201d Use of the pronominal indefinite adjective, \u201cany,\u201d is the recommended drafting technique in the Code Revision Project for \u201cdefining the class.\u201d Governor\u2019s Commission to Revise the Annotated Code of Maryland, <em>Revisor\u2019s Manual </em>at 51 (2d ed. Nov.1973). The second appearance is in the clause, \u201cregardless of how the provision is stated.\u201d Under this clause the distinction previously made between technical alimony and contractual support becomes irrelevant for purposes of applying \u00a7 8-103(e). Under prior law technical alimony was modifiable and contractual support was not modifiable, despite what a separation agreement said. <em>See Horsey v. Horsey, </em>329 Md. 392, 410-11, 620 A.2d 305, 315 (1993); <em>McAlear v. McAlear, </em>298 Md. 320, 329-30, 469 A.2d 1256, 1260-61 (1984); <em>Emerson v. Emerson, </em>120 Md. 584, 597-98, 87 A. 1033, 1038-39 (1913). The third appearance introduces an exception to the general rule, \u201cunless there is ... a provision that specifically states----\u201d The fourth appearance is the language, \u201cthat the provisions with respect to alimony or spousal support are not subject to any court modification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">The courts below read the fourth appearance, \u201cprovisions,\u201d to mean all of the provisions. That reading is influenced by the singular in the third appearance, suggesting that the exception to the general rule can only be achieved by one provision that specifically states that \u201cthe provisions,\u201d read as \u201call of the provisions,\u201d are not subject to any court modification. Of course, if that were the legislative intent, the draftsperson could more precisely have said, \u201cunless there is ... a provision that specifically states that no provision ... is subject to any court modification.\u201d That is, in effect, the construction for which Mr. Shapiro contends. He submits that a bright-line test is intended that carries forward the all or nothing approach to modifiability previously encountered in the technical alimony-contractual support distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">Ms. Shapiro contends for a construction that would permit specifying, provision by provision within the class, whether a provision is modifiable or not. A hypothetical may be used to illustrate Ms. Shapiro\u2019s contention. The parties might agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>in provision one to an initial amount of spousal support and in that provision specifically state that the amount is not subject to court modification, unless otherwise provided. In provision two they might agree to a modification of the initial amount to a different, specific amount upon the payor\u2019s retirement, and in that provision specifically state that the revised amount is not subject to court modification. In provision three the parties might address loss of employment, prior to retirement, by the payor, and agree to court modification under that described circumstance. Provision four might address disability of the payor and provide for court modification under that described circumstance. Ms. Shapiro submits that the courts below erred in adopting a construction requiring that all four circumstances addressed in our hypothetical agreement must be unmodifiable for any to be unmodifiable, and in holding that, if any provision is modifiable, all provisions become modifiable, even if the agreement expressly says that some provisions are not modifiable.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Rules of interpretation are set forth in Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.), Article 1. Section 8 provides that \u201c[t]he singular always includes the plural, and vice versa, except where such construction would be unreasonable.\u201d Under this statutory directive, the third and fourth appearances in \u00a7 8-103(c) of \u201cprovision(s)\u201d can be read either uniformly in the singular or uniformly in the plural\u2014\u201cunless there are provisions that specifically state that the provisions\u201d within the class are hot subject to any court modification, or, \u201cunless there is a provision that specifically states that a provision\u201d within the class is not subject to any court modification. Either form, permissible under Art. 1, \u00a7 8, raises at least an ambiguity as to whether the parties may contract concerning court modifiability, <em>vel non, </em>provision by provision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">When we turn to the legislative history of FL \u00a7 8\u2014103(e) for assistance in resolving the ambiguity, we find that the language to be construed first appeared in the Code with the enactment of what is now FL \u00a7 8-103(b),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that the purpose of subsections (b) and (c) was to remove a technical, legal obstacle to effectuating the parties\u2019 intent as expressed in their contract, and that there is nothing indicating that the General Assembly intended to prevent parties, by contract, from excepting themselves under specified conditions, as opposed to universally, from modifiability.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">FL \u00a7 8\u2014103(b) was enacted by Chapter 849 of the Acts of 1975 to overturn the rule, exemplified by <em>Simpson v. Simpson, </em>18 Md.App. 626, 308 A.2d 410 (1973), under which technical alimony was modifiable but contractual spousal support was not. <em>LaChance v. LaChance, </em>28 Md.App. 571, 576 n. 7, 346 A.2d 676, 680 n. 7 (1975). The separation agreement in <em>Simpson </em>stated specifically that its \u201calimony\u201d provisions would be subject to \u201c \u2018continuing jurisdiction and further orders of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County.\u2019 \u201d <em>Simpson, </em>18 Md. App. at 630, 308 A.2d at 413. Because the agreement failed to terminate the payments on the death of the payor, the payments were not technical alimony, and the court was powerless to consider modification after the payor had retired from active employment. <em>Id. </em>at 631, 308 A.2d at 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">Chapter 849 of the Acts of 1975 addressed the problem by amending Md.Code (1957, 1973 Repl.Vol.), Art. 16, \u00a7 28. The then existing statute recognized the validity of separation agreements and provided that child custody agreements were subject to court modification under the best interests of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>child standard. Chapter 849 wove its provisions into that existing statutory framework in the fashion set forth below, where the italicized matter reflects new language added to the existing statute.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-4\">\u201c[Pjrovided, that whenever any such deed or agreement shall make provision for or in any manner affect the care, custody, education or maintenance of any infant child or children of the parties, <em>or shall make provision for or in any manner affect support, maintenance, property rights, or personal rights between the husband and wife, </em>the court shall have the right to modify such deed or agreement in respect to such infants as to the court may seem proper, looking always to the best interests of such infants, <em>or </em>in respect to support, <em>maintenance, property rights, or personal rights between the husband and wife regardless of the manner in which the provisions are expressed or stated unless the provisions of the deed, agreement, or settlement specifically state that they are not subject to any court modification.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">The 1975 enactment had a postponed effective date of January 1, 1976. Under cover of a letter of October 13, 1975, the Family Law Committee of the Bar Association of Baltimore City, Inc. transmitted to the House Judiciary Committee a proposed emergency bill that would amend the 1975 legislation. That proposal became House Bill 467 which was enacted as Chapter 170 of the Acts of 1976, effective April 13, 1976.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See Bill File on H.B. 467 of the 1976 Session of the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">The covering letter from the bar association committee stated that the objective of the 1975 enactment, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cwiping out\u201d the distinction between technical alimony and contractual support, \u201cwas certainly meritorious as in too many instances, the wording utilized by the draftsman to set forth the true <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>intent of the settling parties produced a result contrary to what was actually intended.\u201d The letter, however, pointed out at least two areas in which the 1975 legislation was said to have gone too far. The first was by including property rights and personal rights within the scope of a court\u2019s power to modify an agreement. The second was that the 1975 legislation could be read to permit the parties by contract to prevent a court from modifying child custody and child support awards.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">Chapter 170 of the Acts of 1976 addressed these concerns by separating the provisions relating to the modification of child custody and support from those relating to spousal support, by eliminating from the latter the reference to property and personal rights, and by recognizing contractually based waivers of spousal support. In relevant part the language enacted by Chapter 170 read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-6\">\u201cFurthermore, any provision in the deed or agreement in respect to alimony, support and maintenance of the husband or wife is subject to modification by the court to the extent the court deems just and proper regardless of the manner in which the provisions with respect to the alimony, support and maintenance are expressed or stated unless there is an express waiver of alimony, support and maintenance by the husband or wife or unless the provisions of the deed, agreement, or settlement specifically state that the provisions with respect to the alimony, support and maintenance of the husband or wife are not subject to any court modification.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">Thus, in terms of our dissection of the use of \u201cprovision(s)\u201d in FL \u00a7 8\u2014103(c), the 1976 legislation used the plural in both the third and fourth appearances of the term. By utilizing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>plural in both the subject and the predicate of the exception, the draftsperson created a semantic ambiguity as to the number intended. R. Dickerson, <em>The Fundamentals of Legal Drafting </em>\u00a7 6.5, at 124 (2d ed.1986), advises as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-4\">\u201cSo far as substantive meaning permits, it is desirable to use the singular rather than the plural. This will avoid the question whether the predicate applies separately to each member of the subject class or jointly to the subject class taken as a whole.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">The rule of interpretation set forth in Art. 1, \u00a7 8 was in effect in 1976. Consequently, unless it would be unreasonable to do so, the 1976 enactment could be read to say, \u201cunless a provision of the ... agreement ... specifically states a provision with respect to ... support ... is not subject to any court modification.\u201d Thus, the parties could specifically state exclusion from modifiability provision by provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Former Art. 16, \u00a7 28 remained unchanged from the emergency legislation of 1976 until the enactment, by Chapter 296 of the Acts of 1984, of the Family Law Article as part of the Code Revision Project. Because of the differences in the subject matter of the contract provisions dealt with in the 1975 and 1976 enactments, and because of the difference in effective dates, the two enactments were separately presented in FL \u00a7 8-103 as subsections (b) and (c). In restyling former \u00a7 28 to create present subsection (c), the revisor had to express two ways in which the parties could, by agreement, prevent court modification of spousal support provisions, namely, (1) an express waiver of alimony or spousal support and (2) \u201cprovisions\u201d in the agreement specifically stating that \u201cthe provisions with respect to ... support ... are not subject to any court modification.\u201d The revisor introduced both exceptions by saying, \u201cunless there is:\u201d. That introduction accommodated the singular, \u201can express waiver,\u201d in then existing Art. 16, \u00a7 28, but the singular of the verb, \u201cis,\u201d conflicted with the plural used in then existing Art. 16, \u00a7 28 for the second exception, \u201cprovisions.\u201d Thus, \u201cprovisions\u201d in the prior statute became \u201ca provision\u201d dealing with \u201cthe provisions,\u201d the latter of which the courts below read to mean \u201call provisions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>A legislative intent supporting the interpretation of the courts below cannot be derived from the change between the 1976 language and the Code Revision language. The Re-visor\u2019s Note to \u00a7 8-103 does not specifically address the change. See Md.Code (1984), Revisor\u2019s Note following FL \u00a7 8-103. That Note, however, does advise that \u201c[t]his section is new language derived without substantive change from the second and third sentences of former Art. 16, \u00a7 28.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">FL \u00a7 8-103(c) is incorporated into FL \u00a7 8-105(b), enacted by Chapter 443 of the Acts of 1990.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The purpose of \u00a7 8-105(b) was to change the rule enunciated in <em>Mendelson v. Mendelson, </em>75 Md.App. 486, 541 A.2d 1331 (1988). <em>See </em>J.F. Fader, II <em>&amp; </em>R.J.

To the extent that the parties could agree under FL \u00a7 8-103(c) that there would be no modification, the parties could so agree after the 1990 enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">Thus, it appears that FL \u00a7 8-103(c)(2), and the predecessor statute that was restyled into FL \u00a7 8-103(c)(2), do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>unambiguously support the construction applied by the courts below and that the language can also accommodate Ms. Shapiro\u2019s contention. On the other hand, we have uncovered nothing in the legislative history that indicates that the General Assembly ever focused on the issue with which we are here concerned. Thus, in order to construe the statute on the issue here, we examine the General Assembly\u2019s purpose in enacting it. <em>See Kaczorowski v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 525 A.2d 628 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">As we have seen in Part I.A, <em>supra, </em>the statute\u2019s immediate purpose was to permit court modification of contractual support, unless the parties otherwise agreed, by eliminating, in the modification context, the distinction between technical alimony and contractual support. The ultimate purpose was to prevent the unintended results under separation agreements that were produced by the technical alimony-contractual support dichotomy.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">If the statutory exception to the general rule of modifiability is read to require a blanket provision, making non-modifiable each and every provision in a package of provisions relating to spousal support, then the evil that the General Assembly sought to cure by \u00a7 8-103(c)(2) is recreated. The only difference is the nature of the contractual intent that is frustrated. Under the technical alimony-contractual spousal support distinction, intended modifiability was frustrated. Under the construction applied by the courts below, intended non-modifiability of one or more provisions out of the whole number of contractual spousal support provisions in an agreement can be frustrated. We can discern no legislative purpose to substitute one form of frustration of contractual intent for another in a statute intended to fulfill expectations based on the parties\u2019 agreement. Nor do we discern in this statute, that was intended to abolish the technical alimony-contractual support distinction, an intent to perpetuate the all or nothing approach to modifiability that characterized that prior law.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">The foregoing conclusion is reinforced by the public policy of the past sixty-five years, that is now expressed in FL \u00a7 8-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>101(a). It provides that \u201c[a] husband and wife may make a valid and enforceable deed or agreement that relates to alimony, support, property rights, or personal rights.\u201d FL \u00a7 8-101(a) was first enacted by Chapter 220 of the Acts of 1931. In its original form the statute read, in part, that separation agreements \u201cshall be valid, binding and enforceable to every intent and purpose.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>The broad, validating approach of FL \u00a7 8-101(a) is inconsistent with restrictively reading FL \u00a7 8-103(c)(2) to require that the contractual spousal support provisions in a sophisticated separation agreement must either be modifiable as a class or non-modifiable as a class. It is similarly inconsistent with \u00a7 8-101(a)\u2019s invitation to contract to declare modifiable that which is specifically nonmodifiable based on the lack of uniformity as to modifiability among all provisions relating to spousal support.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">In addition to relying on <em>Langley, </em>Mr. Shapiro argues that the General Assembly intended an all or nothing approach in FL \u00a7 8-103(c)(2) in order to permit a court to apply the factors for setting the level of spousal support that are required to be considered under FL \u00a7 ll-106(b).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> First, FL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>\u00a7 11\u2014106(b) was enacted by Chapter 575 of the Acts of 1980, some four years after enactment of the statute that is now FL \u00a7 8-103(c)(2). Second, \u00a7 11-106 addresses the initial determination of \u201cthe amount of and the period for an award of alimony,\u201d FL \u00a7 11-106(a), not a modification. Third, where the parties have agreed on non-modifiable support payments under some circumstances and have agreed that they will look to the court for modification under some other circumstance, if and when that other circumstance occurs and the parties come to the court for modification, the court at that time would not be restricted from considering as many of the types of factors enumerated in FL \u00a7 ll-106(b) as are relevant to the circumstances at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Inasmuch as Mr. Shapiro is not and has not been disabled, the sole circumstance under which modification of spousal support is permitted by the Agreement has not occurred. For all the foregoing reasons we hold that the presently operative spousal support provision is not modifiable, as the parties agreed. To the extent that <em>Langley </em>is inconsistent with our holding in this case, it is overruled.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">In its decree the circuit court also ordered that the \u201calimony provisions\u201d of the Agreement \u201cshall be considered child support....\u201d The Court of Special Appeals affirmed that aspect of the circuit court\u2019s order, concluding that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>circuit court had the power so to alter the Agreement by a combination of FL \u00a7\u00a7 8-105(b), 8\u2014103(c)(2), and its decision in <em>Lieberman v. Lieberman, </em>81 Md.App. 575, 568 A.2d 1157 (1990). The argument fails because the Agreement had been incorporated into the judgment for divorce of August 29,1988. When Mr. Shapiro filed his petition for modification in December 1989, approval of the alimony provisions, \u201cas alimony,\u201d had been effected by incorporation of the Agreement into the decree. Unless a statute otherwise provided, that aspect of the decree was subject to modification only for fraud, mistake, or irregularity. Maryland Rule 2-535(b); <em>Platt v. Platt, </em>302 Md. 9, 485 A.2d 250 (1984). No ground under Rule 2-535(b) for revising the judgment is asserted here.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">FL \u00a7 8-105(b) states that a court may modify any provision of an agreement that is incorporated into a divorce decree, and that statute is expressly retroactive. Acts of 1990, Chapter 443, SEC. 2. But the power is expressly limited to any provision that is \u201csubject to modification under \u00a7 8-103____\u201d FL \u00a7 8-105(b)(2). The power is not exercisable here because we have held in Part I, <em>supra, </em>that the alimony provision of the Agreement is not modifiable, except as provided in the Agreement.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\"><em>Lieberman </em>is not authority for modifying an enrolled judgment, absent a statutory authorization to do so. That opinion construed a payment provision in order to determine the amount originally allocated to child support and the amount originally allocated to spousal support. The judgment under direct review in <em>Lieberman </em>was an appealable interlocutory judgment for the payment of money. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1974, 1995 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 12-303(3)(v) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-9\">Here, the circuit court denied Mr. Shapiro\u2019s claim to decrease child support, except for the set-off of college expenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>against alimony and child support. Because the denial of any downward modification of child support was in part predicated on the validity of the set-off against the alimony payments, which we have reversed, the remand to the circuit court for further proceedings, previously ordered by the Court of Special Appeals, will include consideration of possible downward revisions of child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.

On other issues that are not before us on certiorari the Court of Special Appeals also affirmed, with one exception. The exception relates to Ms. Shapiro\u2019s appeal from the denial of an increase in child support. On that issue the intermediate appellate court vacated and remanded for calculation of child support in accordance with the child support guidelines, or for an explanation of any departure from the guidelines. Under the Court of Special Appeals opinion it was unclear whether the recharacterized alimony payments were to be added to the child support payments in the guideline calculations. Our reversal of the recharacterization moots the question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b701-6\">. It should be noted that this case does not present the question of whether the parties can allow for court modification of a provision but then contractually limit the extent of the exercise of a court\u2019s power, e.g., by establishing contractual ceilings or floors on court ordered support. Here we deal only with circumstances\u2014in this case, two circumstances, namely, disability of the payor when modification of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>amount of spousal support is permitted, and all other circumstances, when the amount of support is agreed to be unmodifiable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b702-8\">.

Furthermore, the majority\u2019s interpretation is inconsistent with the history and legislative policy concerning judicial modification of alimony and spousal support agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">Section 8-103 of the Family Law Article states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMt\">\u201c \u00a7 8-103.

The opening words of both subsection (b) and subsection (c) broadly authorize a court to modify \u201cany provision\u201d with respect to alimony or spousal support. The language goes on to emphasize the breadth of this authority by saying \u201cregardless of how the provision is stated.\u201d Finally, the only exception to a court\u2019s modification authority regarding an agreement providing for alimony or spousal support, is narrowly drawn. The exception requires that there be a provision <em>specifically </em>stating that \u201cthe provisions\u201d concerning alimony or spousal support are not subject to \u201cany\u201d court modification. The word \u201cprovisions\u201d is not limited and obviously applies to all of the provisions concerning alimony or spousal support. The Legislature\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>rejection of selected or partial modifiability is reinforced by the word \u201cany\u201d preceding the words \u201ccourt modification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">The majority\u2019s decision rests upon the finding of an ambiguity in the phrase \u201cprovisions with respect to alimony or spousal support,\u201d and specifically the finding that the word \u201cprovisions\u201d is ambiguous. The majority discerns an ambiguity in the word \u201cprovisions\u201d because the draftperson could \u201chave said, \u2018unless there is ... a provision that specifically states that no provision ... is subject to any court modification.\u2019 \u201d (Opinion at 656, 697 A.2d at 1346). Merely because there is an alternative way of saying something, which the author of the majority opinion prefers, does not render the statutory language ambiguous. Very often there are alternative ways of saying something, and neither way is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">The majority also relies upon the rule of interpretation, Code (1957, 1994 Repl.Vol.), Art. 1, \u00a7 8, that the \u201csingular always includes the plural, and vice versa, except where such construction would be unreasonable.\u201d In \u00a7 8-103 of the Family Law Article, however, the Legislature carefully used the singular word \u201cprovision\u201d to refer to one provision, and the plural word \u201cprovisions\u201d to refer to all of the provisions relating to alimony and spousal support. Moreover, the rule of interpretation that the plural includes the singular does not mean that the plural is limited to the singular.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">As a matter of plain English, the phrase \u201cprovisions of an agreement,\u201d without any limitation, includes <em>all </em>of the provisions of the agreement. The phrase \u201cprovisions with respect to alimony or spousal support,\u201d without limitation, means <em>all </em>of the provisions with respect to alimony or spousal support. Under normal usage, in speaking of the component parts of any document, whether it is a contract, statute, will, etc., by referring to its \u201cprovisions,\u201d \u201cwords,\u201d \u201cclauses,\u201d \u201csections,\u201d \u201clanguage\u201d or similar terms, the use of the plural term without limitation is all inclusive. The phrases \u201cprovisions of a contract\u201d or \u201cwords of a contract\u201d or \u201cprovisions of a statute\u201d or \u201cwords of a statute,\u201d without any limitation, are normally used to refer to all of the provisions, or all of the words of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>document. One can select at random numerous opinions by this Court which illustrate this usage of language. <em>See, e.g., Scott v. Ford Motor Credit, </em>345 Md. 251, 253-255, 691 A.2d 1320, 1321-1322 (1997) (per Rodowsky, J.) (referring to \u201cthe provisions of the loan agreement\u201d to mean all of the provisions; when the author is not referring to all of the provisions of a document or statute, limiting language is used); <em>Bailer v. Erie Insurance, </em>344 Md. 515, 536, 687 A.2d 1375, 1385-1386 (1997) (Chasanow, J., dissenting) (refers to \u201cprovisions of an insurance contract\u201d to mean \u201c[a]ll of the provisions of this contract\u201d); <em>Polomski v. Baltimore, </em>344 Md. 70, 75, 684 A.2d 1338, 1340 (1996) (per Karwacki, J.) (refers to \u201cthe language of the statute\u201d to mean all of the language); <em>Fraternal Order of Police v. Mehrling, </em>343 Md. 155, 174, 680 A.2d 1052, 1062 (1996) (to the same effect); <em>Ward v. Property &amp; Casualty, </em>325 Md. 1, 8, 599 A.2d 81, 84 (1991) (per Rodowsky, J.) (uses the phrase \u201cwords of the statute\u201d to refer to all of the words).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">The majority\u2019s holding that court modifiability of alimony or spousal support depends on the wording of each \u201cprovision by provision\u201d relating to alimony or spousal support (opinion at 658, 697 A.2d at 1347), also overlooks the language in \u00a7 8-103 stating that <em>any </em>provision relating to alimony or spousal support is judicially modifiable \u201cregardless of how the provision is stated____\u201d The General Assembly thus made it clear that the wording of a particular provision concerning alimony or spousal support was immaterial. Rather, judicial modifiability of any provision could be precluded only if there was a specific statement that the provisions, without limitation, could not be judicially modified.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>The normal meaning of the words in \u00a7 8-103 clearly refutes the majority\u2019s holding that parties may make an alimony or spousal support agreement \u201cpartially\u201d modifiable by a court on a \u201cprovision by provision\u201d basis. Instead, as held by the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Langley v. Langley, </em>88 Md.App. 535, 540, 596 A.2d 89 (1991),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-4\">\u201c[s]ection 8-103(c) is unambiguous.

The Legislature unambiguously stated that <em>any </em>provision with respect to alimony or spousal support is subject to court modification unless the parties specifically stated that the <em>provisions </em>regarding alimony or spousal support are not subject to <em>any </em>court modification. Only the most tortured reading could find an ambiguity in this language.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">The ambiguity and difficulty in this case, instead of being in the statutory language, lies in the majority\u2019s interpretation. The majority, in the earlier portion of its opinion dealing with the statutory language, focuses upon the words \u201cprovision\u201d and \u201cprovisions,\u201d states that judicial modifiability need not be an \u201call or nothing approach,\u201d and indicates that \u201cthe parties may contract concerning court modifiability ... provision by provision.\u201d (Opinion at 655-658, 697 A.2d at 1345-1347). The majority illustrates its interpretation by an hypothetical agreement whereby provision one relates to the initial amount of spousal support and states that it is non-modifiable, provision two concerns a revised amount of spousal support upon the payor\u2019s retirement and states that it is non-modifiable, provision three concerns spousal support upon loss of employment and states that it is judicially modifiable under certain circumstances, and provision four deals with spousal support upon disability and states that it can be modified by the court. (Opinion at 656-657, 697 A.2d at 1346-1347). The majority seems to conclude that this \u201cprovision by provision\u201d scheme of partial modifiability is \u201cpermissible\u201d under the statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">One problem with the majority\u2019s interpretation is what constitutes these separate and distinct \u201cprovisions\u201d? In the present context, the phrase \u201cprovisions of an agreement\u201d has no more specific meaning than the phrases \u201cparts of the agreement\u201d or \u201cclauses of the agreement\u201d or \u201cwords of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>agreement.\u201d If, as in the majority\u2019s hypothetical, there are four separate subjects, set forth in four numbered \u201cprovisions,\u201d making up the spousal support portion of the agreement, the majority\u2019s interpretation might be workable. But not all agreements are so neatly structured. If there are numbered paragraphs, does each one constitute a separate \u201cprovision\u201d regardless of subject matter, requiring a statement in each as to judicial modifiability? If there are no numbered or labeled divisions, does a court analyze the agreement for different subjects? What does a court do if there is no correlation between numbered paragraphs and different subjects? The difficulties with the term \u201cprovision\u201d and with the majority\u2019s interpretation are illustrated by the majority opinion itself. While the earlier portions of the opinion seem to authorize judicial modification on a separate \u201cprovision by provision\u201d basis (opinion at 655-658, 697 A.2d at 1345-1347), the majority concludes Part I of its opinion by addressing the agreement in this case and referring to the \u201cspousal support <em>provision\u201d </em>in the singular.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Furthermore, the majority\u2019s conclusion that the word \u201cprovisions\u201d in the statute is ambiguous, and the majority\u2019s resulting notion of \u201cpartial judicial modifiability\u201d on a \u201cprovision by provision\u201d basis, would not appear to support the majority\u2019s decision in this case. The case at bar does not present any issue of partial court modification on a provision by provision basis. Instead, we are here dealing with contingent modifiability. Under the appellant Debra Shapiro\u2019s position, the entire agreement relating to alimony or spousal support is modifiable if the disability contingency occurs and the entire agreement relating to alimony or spousal support is non-modifiable if the disability contingency does not occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">The present case does not involve the situation posed by the majority\u2019s hypothetical, under which certain provisions concerning certain subjects are made modifiable and other provisions concerning other subjects are made non-modifiable. The alimony portion of the agreement in this case contains separate paragraphs, identified by the letters (a), (b), etc., dealing with several subjects. Some of the paragraphs seem to deal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>with more than one matter. Paragraph (a), for example, sets forth the.amount of monthly \u201calimony\u201d from May 1, 1988, to January 1, 2009. Paragraph (a) also provides for termination of alimony upon either the death of the wife or the death of the husband. Paragraph (b) provides for the amount of monthly alimony from and after January 1, 2009, again provides for termination upon the deaths of either, and provides for termination upon the remarriage of the wife. Paragraph (d) relates to deductibility and declarations of income on the husband\u2019s and wife\u2019s income tax returns. None of these paragraphs contains a provision relating to modifiability. Then, the final paragraph of the spousal support agreement seems to authorize complete modifiability in the event of the husband\u2019s disability. Thus, the issue in this case seems to have no relation to the alleged ambiguity in the word \u201cprovisions\u201d discovered by the majority, and has no relation to partial modifiability on a provision by provision basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Since the agreement in this case provided that it was totally modifiable if a certain contingency occurred, and since, under the statutory language, total judicial modification is authorized if any part of the alimony or spousal support agreement is subject to judicial modification, the alimony or spousal agreement in the case before us is clearly subject to judicial modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">Not only is the majority\u2019s \u201cpartial modification\u201d theory flatly inconsistent with the unambiguous language of \u00a7 8-103, but the majority\u2019s theory cannot be squared with the history and legislative background of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">Until the filing of the majority\u2019s opinion today, the concept of \u201cpartial judicial modifiability\u201d of alimony or a spousal support agreement was entirely unknown to Maryland law. Prior to January 1,1976, as well as after that date with regard to any agreements entered into before 1976, the right of a court to modify the spousal support portion of a separation agreement depended upon whether the spousal support agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>ment was incorporated in a judicial decree and constituted \u201calimony\u201d in a technical sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">\u201cAlimony\u201d has been defined in numerous Maryland cases, and most recently in <em>Horsey v. Horsey, </em>329 Md. 392, 410, 620 A.2d 305, 314-315 (1993), as follows (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-6\">\u201c \u2018Alimony\u2019 in a legal sense (often referred to as \u2018technical alimony\u2019) is a periodic allowance for spousal support, <em>payable under a judicial decree, </em>which terminates upon the death of either spouse or upon the remarriage of the spouse receiving the payments or upon the reconciliation and cohabitation of the parties. <em>See, e.g., Thomas v. Thomas, </em>294 Md. 605, 614-621, 451 A.2d 1215, 1221-1223 (1982); <em>Goldberg v. Goldberg, </em>290 Md. 204, 207-210, 428 A.2d 469, 472-473 (1981).... A court exercising equitable jurisdiction has authority to modify its prior award of technical alimony. <em>Goldberg v. Goldberg, </em>290 Md. at 209, 428 A.2d at 473....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">Where the spousal support agreed upon by the parties possessed all of the characteristics of \u201calimony,\u201d and where it was incorporated in a judicial decree, it became \u201calimony\u201d awarded by the judicial decree. It could later be modified by a court because of the settled principle that a court award of alimony was always subject to judicial modification. The basis for the spousal support award under these circumstances, and the basis for later judicial modification, was not that the parties had entered an agreement. Instead, the validity of the award, and the ability to modify it, rested upon the judicial decree providing alimony. <em>See Horsey v. Horsey, supra, </em>329 Md. at 412, 620 A.2d at 315-316; <em>Emerson v. Emerson, </em>120 Md. 584, 591-597, 87 A. 1033, 1036-1038 (1913) (\u201cthe validity of the award depends not upon the agreement, but upon the judgment or decree\u201d and the court \u201chas the same power of modification of the decree as it had in the absence of an agreement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">Where, however, a spousal support agreement entered prior to 1976 did not have all of the characteristics of alimony, it was not subject to any judicial modification. Such contractual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>spousal support could not be judicially modified <em>even if it </em>was incorporated into a judicial decree or even if the parties stated that it should be \u201cmerged\u201d into the decree. <em>Horsey v. Horsey, supra, </em>329 Md. at 411-417, 620 A.2d at 315-318. The reason for this rule was the traditional doctrine, emphasized in the majority opinion, that parties ordinarily should be free to contract as they wish, and that such \u201cspousal support payments, ... being contractual in nature, are not subject to change absent assent of the parties, notwithstanding the fact that they have been incorporated into a divorce decree.\u201d <em>Goldberg v. Goldberg, supra, </em>290 Md. at 209, 428 A.2d at 473. Nevertheless, this traditional contract doctrine was not applicable to alimony, as \u201c[technical alimony can only be provided by decree of court.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">In sum, prior to 1976 no spousal support agreement incorporated into a judicial decree was subject to partial judicial modification. If the agreement incorporated into a decree constituted alimony, it was fully subject to subsequent judicial modification because judicial decrees of alimony had always been subject to modification. If the incorporated agreement did not have all of the characteristics of alimony, it was not subject to any subsequent judicial modification on the ground that courts generally do not modify contractual obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">In 1975 and 1976, the General Assembly changed the law to give courts much greater authority to modify spousal support agreements. Departing from the traditional contract principles on which the former law was based, the Legislature in \u00a7 8-103 of the Family Law Article provided that both alimony and non-alimony contractual spousal support were subject to judicial modification. The statutory language itself demonstrates a policy favoring judicial modification of agreements and restricting traditional contract principles. Under \u00a7 8-103(c), a court is broadly authorized to modify \u201cany provision\u201d concerning alimony or contractual spousal support, \u201cregardless\u201d of the parties\u2019 intent reflected in the wording of that provision. In addition, as discussed in the beginning of this opinion, the only exception to the court\u2019s modification authority is very narrowly drawn. The majority opinion, with its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>reliance on traditional contract principles, wholly fails to give effect to the Legislature\u2019s clear purpose of greatly increasing judicial modification authority. The General Assembly obviously believed that, in the context of spousal support, courts should have broader power to modify agreements because of changed circumstances, fairness, unequal bargaining power, etc.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Regardless of the majority\u2019s view of this policy, this Court should give effect to the legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Although the General Assembly, in enacting \u00a7 8-103, intended to enlarge the authority of courts to modify spousal support agreements, there is utterly no indication from the statutory language or the legislative history that the Legislature intended to change the traditional principle that a spousal support agreement was either wholly modifiable or not modifiable at all. The majority opinion states that it discerns no legislative \u201cintent to perpetuate the all or nothing approach to modifiability that characterized that prior law.\u201d (Opinion at 664, 697 A.2d at 1350). If the statutory language and legislative history were silent on this issue, as the majority apparently believes, the normal presumption would be that the Legislature did not intend to change the law. Moreover, as shown in Part (1) of this dissent, the statutory language is clearly inconsistent with any notion of partial modifiability of a spousal support agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Another strong indication that the Legislature did not intend to adopt the majority\u2019s novel \u201cpartial modification\u201d theory is the legislative acquiescence in the holding of <em>Langley v. Langley, supra, </em>88 Md.App. 535, 596 A.2d 89. We have often pointed out that, where the General Assembly has acquiesced in the judicial construction of a statute, there is a strong presumption that the legislative intent has been correctly interpreted. Although the principle is ordinarily applicable only when the construction of the statute was by this Court, <em>United States v. Streidel, </em>329 Md. 533, 551 n. 12, 620 A.2d 905, 914 n. 12 (1993), there are exceptions where the principle has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>been applied to constructions of a statute by other entities. <em>See, e.g., Prince George\u2019s County v. Brown, </em>334 Md. 650, 660, 640 A.2d 1142, 1147 (1994); <em>State v. Crescent Cities Jaycees, </em>330 Md. 460, 470, 624 A.2d 955, 960 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">In the particular area of family law involved in this case, the General Assembly has changed the law to overrule statutory interpretations by the Court of Special Appeals with which the General Assembly disagreed. <em>See </em>\u00a7 8-105 of the Family Law Article, overruling <em>Mendelson v. Mendelson, </em>75 Md.App. 486, 541 A.2d 1331 (1988), and the Floor Report of the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee on Senate Bill 541 of the 1989 General Assembly (\u201cThis bill is expressly intended to overrule the holding of the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Mendelson v. Mendelson, </em>75 Md.App. 486, 541 A.2d 1331 (1988)\u201d). Nevertheless, the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 construction of \u00a7 8-103 in <em>Langley v. Langley, supra, </em>has not been modified by the General Assembly. In light of this legislative acquiescence, this Court should not now overrule <em>Langley </em>and adopt, for the first time in Maryland history, the doctrine that a spousal support agreement incorporated in a court decree may be partially modifiable by a court.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">The majority\u2019s novel and confusing interpretation of \u00a7 8-103 of the Family Law Article finds no support in either the language or history of the statute. I would reaffirm the interpretation of \u00a7 8-103 set forth six years ago in the <em>Langley </em>case and accepted by the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">RAKER, J., concurs with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b714-7\">. The majority's only discussion of the clause \"regardless of how the provision is stated,\u201d is to say that \u201c[u]nder this clause the distinction previously made between technical alimony and contractual support becomes irrelevant for purposes of applying \u00a7 8-103(c).\u201d (Opinion at 656, 697 A.2d at 1346). The earlier language, at the beginning of the sentence, however, that \"[t]he court may modify any provision ... with respect to alimony <em>or spousal support </em>\u201d (emphasis added), effectively does away with the former technical difference between alimony and contractual spousal support. Although the subsequent clause \"regardless of how the provision is stated\u201d would also accomplish this, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>clause is much broader. It indicates that the wording of each provision by provision does not determine judicial modifiability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b721-7\">. <em>See </em>S.
