He dissents, however, from the summary affirmance with regard to the other issues. As to them, he would set the case for briefing and argument before the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Judges Eldridge, Rodowsky and Chasanow would deny the application for leave to appeal, but, since the majority has granted the application, they would summarily affirm with regard to all issues.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
