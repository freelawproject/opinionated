The primary question we must decide in this case is whether a shoulder injury, which causes permanent partial disability, is an injury to the arm under Maryland Code (1991 RephVol., 1996 Cum.Supp.) \u00a7 9\u2014627(d)(l)(iii) of the Labor and Employment Article<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or whether permanent partial disability resulting from a shoulder injury is properly classified under \u00a7 9-627(k), \u201cOther cases.\u201d We must also decide whether the Court of Special Appeals erred in concluding that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) committed an error of law when it awarded permanent partial disability benefits based on thirty percent loss of industrial use of the body. We shall hold that the Commission correctly categorized claimant\u2019s injury as an \u201cOther cases\u201d impairment and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>that the finding of permanent partial disability based on thirty percent loss of use of the body was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">The claimant, Patricia M. Getson, sustained an accidental injury to her right shoulder arising out of and in the course of her employment with WM Bancorp. Getson fell on ice in her employer\u2019s parking lot on February 4, 1993, fracturing the right humeral head of her right shoulder.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She underwent surgery to repair her rotator cuff and to have inserted a prosthesis in her right shoulder. After the surgery, Getson received six months of physical therapy to regain mobility and strength in her right shoulder. Eventually, in late summer 1993, Getson returned to her position as a bank teller with Respondent WM Bancorp. She was able to perform most of her duties as a teller, but she could not lift heavy trays of coins, and she had difficulty reaching over a high counter to give customers their money.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The claimant completed her course of treatment and was evaluated by two physicians, Dr. Renato Lapidario at the request of the employer and insurer, and Dr. Neil Novin at the request of the claimant. Dr. Lapidario concluded that the claimant sustained an injury to her right shoulder resulting in a twenty percent permanent impairment of her right upper extremity; Dr. Novin concluded that the claimant sustained an injury to her right shoulder resulting in a forty-one percent permanent impairment of her right upper extremity.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Getson filed a Workers\u2019 Compensation claim for an accidental injury. The Commission held a hearing on her claim on October 25, 1994. The issue before the Commission was permanent disability. Concluding that an impairment of the shoulder is considered an impairment of the \u201cwhole person,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>the Commission found that Getson had suffered a permanent partial disability resulting in a thirty percent loss of industrial use of her body as a result of the accidental injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">The employer and insurer petitioned the Circuit Court for Alleghany County for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s order and presented two arguments: first, that the Commission should have decided the case as a loss of use of the arm or upper extremity, not of the whole body, because the <em>Guides for Evaluation of Permanent </em>Impairment<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>, American Medical Association, Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment (3d ed.1988) (hereinafter AMA Guides), adopted by the Commission as the method of evaluation of permanent impairment, define the arm or upper extremity to include the shoulder; and second, that if the Commission properly classified the shoulder injury as one to the whole body, it should have followed its regulations and converted impairment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>upper extremity to impairment of the body as a whole, in accordance with the conversion tables in the <em>AMA Guides. </em>The circuit court affirmed the Commission, finding that the Commission properly classified Getson\u2019s injury as an \u201cOther cases\u201d injury under \u00a7 9-627(k) and properly apportioned the injury to the body as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The employer and insurer appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. The Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, affirmed the circuit court in part and reversed in part. The intermediate appellate court held that a shoulder injury is an unscheduled injury, falling within the classification of \u201cOther cases\u201d under \u00a7 9-627(k). The court further held that the Commission improperly used whole body impairment to assess claimant\u2019s permanent partial disability. Reasoning that it is illogical to require evaluating physicians to use the numerical ratings in the <em>AMA Guides </em>but not to require the Commission to do so, the intermediate appellate court held that the Commission failed to abide by its own regulations and, hence, reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">We granted Getson\u2019s petition for -writ of certiorari to resolve the following question: \u201cDid the Court of Special Appeals err in finding that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission had committed an error of law in finding that the Claimant had sustained a 30% disability to her body as a whole?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">We must determine whether the Commission properly classified Getson\u2019s injury under the \u201cOther cases\u201d provision of \u00a7 9-627(k). In other words, should Getson\u2019s shoulder injury be considered an unscheduled, \u201cOther cases\u201d injury or a scheduled injury to the arm? Only if the Commission properly classified the injury do we address whether the Commission expressed the degree of impairment in proper form.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">Section 9-627 governs the classification of injuries for purposes of permanent partial disability compensation. Section 9-627 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-9\">(a) If a covered employee is entitled to compensation for a permanent partial disability under this Part IV of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>subtitle, the employer or its insurer shall pay the covered employee compensation for the period stated in this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-5\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-6\">(d) (1) Compensation shall be paid for the period listed for the loss of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-7\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-8\">(iii) an arm, 300 weeks;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-9\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-10\">(k) <em>Other </em>eases.\u2014(1) In all cases of permanent partial disability not listed in subsections (a) through (j) of this section, the Commission shall determine the percentage by which the industrial use of the covered employee\u2019s body was impaired as a result of the accidental personal injury or occupational disease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-11\">(2) In making a determination under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Commission shall consider factors including:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-12\">(i) the nature of the physical disability; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-13\">(ii) the age, experience, occupation, and training of the disabled covered employee when the accidental personal injury or occupational disease occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-14\">(3) The Commission shall award compensation to the covered employee in the proportion that the determined loss bears to 500 weeks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-15\">(4) Compensation shall be paid to the covered employee at the rates listed for the period in \u00a7\u00a7 9-628 through 9-630 of this Part IV of this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-16\">The shoulder is not listed among the scheduled body parts in \u00a7 9-627. Accordingly, permanent partial disability resulting from a shoulder injury is governed by the catch-all \u201cOther cases\u201d provision of \u00a7 9-627(k).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-17\">Although this Court has not had occasion to consider the classification of a shoulder injury, the Court of Special Appeals has previously held that an injury to the shoulder is properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>classified as an \u201cOther cases\u201d impairment. <em>First National Bank v. Sohn, </em>35 Md.App. 44, 368 A.2d 1122 (1977); <em>see also </em>R. Gilbert &amp; R. Humphreys, Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Handbook \u00a7 7.4, at 140 (2d ed. 1988) (\u2018\u201cWhole body\u2019 injuries to such parts of the body as the back, neck, chest, or shoulder fall within the scope of \u2018Other cases.\u2019 \u201d). Courts in other states with statutes containing distinctions between scheduled and unscheduled injuries similar to the Maryland statute have likewise concluded that shoulder injuries are unscheduled. <em>See, e.g., Dye v. Industrial Comm\u2019n of Ariz., </em>153 Ariz. 292, 736 P.2d 376, 378 (1987); <em>Taylor v. Pfeiffer Plumbing &amp; Heating Co., </em>8 Ark.App. 144, 648 S.W.2d 526, 527 (1983); <em>Mobley v. Jack &amp; Son Plumbing, </em>170 So.2d 41, 45 (Fla.1964); <em>Shebester-Bechtel v. Higginbottom, </em>905 P.2d 1137, 1139 (Okla.Ct.App.1995); <em>Continental Ins. Co. v. Pruitt, </em>541 S.W.2d 594, 597 (Tenn.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">Relying on \u00a7 9-721<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and COMAR 14.09.04, the employer and insurer contend that the General Assembly and the Commission intended to incorporate the <em>AMA Guides </em>\u2019 terminology and division of body parts into the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. The <em>AMA Guides </em>do not use the \u201carm\u201d as a unit of evaluation; instead, the <em>AMA Guides </em>speak in terms of the \u201cupper extremity,\u201d which consists of the hand, wrist, elbow, and shoulder. AMA Guides, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 3.1, at 13. The employer and insurer maintain that it is improper for the Commission to classify an injury to the shoulder as an \u201cOther cases\u201d injury when the <em>AMA Guides </em>treat the shoulder as part of the upper extremity. Since the evaluating physicians expressed their opinion in terms of \u201cupper extremity,\u201d the employer and insurer argue that an injury to the shoulder should be treated as a scheduled injury to the arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">We disagree. The Commission\u2019s adoption of the <em>AMA Guides </em>as the standard for the evaluation of permanent impairment does not affect \u00a7 9-627\u2019s classifications of permanent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>partial disabilities. The legislative history of the <em>AMA Guides \u2019 </em>incorporation into Maryland law reveals that neither the General Assembly nor the Commission intended to incorporate the <em>AMA Guides\u2019 </em>definitions of body parts into the workers\u2019 compensation law of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">In the Acts of 1987, chapter 591, \u00a7 1, the General Assembly adopted the following provision, then codified as Art. 101, \u00a7 36C:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-6\">(a) <em>In </em>general.\u2014On or before July 1, 1988, the Commission shall adopt guides to be used by physicians to measure and report to the Commission all medical evaluations of permanent impairments, including loss of function, endurance, and range of motion, and pain, weakness, and atrophy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-7\">(b) <em>Nature of </em>guides.\u2014The guides to be adopted by the Commission under subsection (a) of this section are regulations under Subtitle 1, Title 10 of the State Government Article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-8\">(c) <em>Guides prior to adoption of official </em>guide.\u2014On or after July 1, 1987, and until the Commission adopts guides under subsection (a) of this section, physicians shall use the most recent edition of the American Medical Association\u2019s \u201cGuides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment,\u201d as amended, to measure all medical evaluations of permanent impairments. Physicians shall report their findings in accordance with those guides.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-9\">(d) <em>Additional information prior to official </em>guide.\u2014Until the Commission adopts guides under subsection (a) of this section, a physician, in evaluating a permanent impairment, shall submit to the Commission additional information, including:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-10\">(1) Pain;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-11\">(2) Weakness;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-12\">(3) Atrophy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-13\">(4) Loss of endurance; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-14\">(5) Loss of function.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>The Commission adopted guides as directed in \u00a7 36C(a); COMAR 14.09.04 went into effect December 15, 1988. Like the interim measure enacted by the General Assembly in Article 101, \u00a7 36C(e), the Commission also selected the <em>AMA Guides </em>as the method of evaluation that physicians shall use in assessing permanent impairment for workers\u2019 compensation purposes. COMAR 14.09.04 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-4\">.01 Incorporated Document.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-5\">Those provisions of \u201cGuides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment\u201d (American Medical Association, 3rd ed.1988) specified in Regulation .02 are incorporated by reference.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-6\">.02 General Guidelines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-7\">A.

A physician preparing an evaluation of permanent impairment may include numerical ratings not set forth in the American Medical Association\u2019s \u201cGuides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment\u201d for the items listed in \u00a7 B(4) of this regulation. If the physician does so, the physician shall include in the evaluation the detailed findings that support those numerical ratings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-7\">D. When reviewing an evaluation for permanent impairment, the Commission shall consider all the items listed in \u00a7 B of this regulation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-8\">E. The Commission may not approve payment of a physician\u2019s fee for an evaluation that does not comply with this regulation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-9\">F. This regulation shall apply to all evaluations prepared on or after July 1,1990.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">When the former Article 101 was revised and enacted as Title 9 of the Labor and Employment Article, the provision of \u00a7 36C that directed the Commission to adopt guides for medical evaluation of permanent disability and the provision that established an interim guide were deleted as obsolete because the Commission had adopted guides. 1991 Maryland Laws, ch. 8, at 946 (Revisor\u2019s Notes). Section 9-721, the successor to \u00a7 36C, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-11\">(a) <em>In accordance with </em>regulations.\u2014A physician shall evaluate a permanent impairment and report the evaluation to the Commission in accordance with the regulations of the Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-12\">(b) <em>Contents of </em>evaluation.\u2014A medical evaluation of a permanent impairment shall include information about:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-13\">(1) atrophy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-14\">(2) pain;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-15\">(3) weakness; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-16\">(4) loss of endurance, function, and range of motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>As the legislative history illustrates, the General Assembly initially adopted the <em>AMA Guides </em>as an interim method of evaluation for use until the Commission adopted guides for permanent evaluation. The Commission then promulgated COMAR 14.09.04 which incorporates by reference certain provisions of the <em>AMA Guides. </em>Section 9-721, the current version of the statute governing evaluation of permanent impairment, mandates that physicians evaluate permanent impairment in accordance with the Commission\u2019s regulations and sets out certain types of information that must be included in the evaluation. <em>See Sears Roebuck v. Ralph, </em>340 Md. 304, 313, 666 A.2d 1239, 1243 (1995) (discussing legislative history of \u00a7 9-721).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">This legislative history does not reveal an intent on the part of the General Assembly to incorporate the terminology of the <em>AMA Guides. </em>In fact, the General Assembly adopted the <em>AMA Guides </em>solely as interim guides to be used until the Commission promulgated guides of its own. The provision of \u00a7 36C that referred to the <em>AMA Guides </em>was deleted as obsolete when \u00a7 36C was placed in Title 9 of the Labor and Employment Article. Maryland Laws 1991, ch. 8, at 946 (Revisor\u2019s Notes). The current version of \u00a7 9-721 does not mention the <em>AMA Guides, </em>but refers only generally to the Commission\u2019s regulations. We agree with the circuit court and Court of Special Appeals that \u201c \u2018the plain meaning of the statute is devoid of any such intent\u2019 to \u2018enact the AMA\u2019s division of body parts.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Furthermore, COMAR 14.09.04.01 incorporates by reference only those provisions of the <em>AMA Guides </em>that are specified in COMAR 14.09.04.02; the Commission did not incorporate the entire <em>AMA Guides. </em>COMAR 14.09.04.02 does not refer to the <em>AMA Guides </em>\u2019 terminology, but rather requires that evaluating physicians employ the numerical ratings and the reporting format from the <em>AMA Guides. </em>Nowhere does the regulation mandate or suggest that the particular terminology used in the <em>AMA Guides </em>substantively changes workers\u2019 compensation law.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>In summary, nothing in the statutes, regulation, nor in the <em>AMA Guides </em>disturbs \u00a7 9-627\u2019s division of injuries into those specifically listed and those \u201cOther cases\u201d addressed by \u00a7 9-627(k). Section 9-627 specifically lists loss of an arm, but it fails to mention loss of a shoulder. Incorporating portions of the <em>AMA Guides </em>in an administrative regulation cannot rewrite \u00a7 9-627. The circuit court did not err in affirming the Commission\u2019s award of permanent partial disability benefits based on \u00a7 9-627(k), \u201cOther cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The employer and insurer also dispute the Commission\u2019s finding of permanent partial disability based on thirty percent industrial loss of use of the body. Although the employer and insurer maintain that the Commission may not classify claimant\u2019s injury as \u201cOther cases\u201d impairment under \u00a7 9-627(k), they contend that if the Commission may do so, it must at least convert upper extremity impairment ratings to the equivalent impairment of the body as a whole and award permanent partial disability based on that converted impairment rating. We agree, but conclude that the Commission\u2019s finding of thirty percent loss of use of the body was not error under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">As we discussed above, the unscheduled \u201cOther cases\u201d category, to which Petitioner\u2019s injury belongs, requires the Commission to evaluate industrial loss of use of the whole body, not just loss of an isolated body part. The evaluating physicians in this case presented their evaluations in terms of impairment of the right upper extremity, not in terms of the body as a whole. The <em>AMA Guides </em>contain tables that convert impairment expressed in one form to impairment expressed in another form. Table 3 of Chapter 3 converts impairment of the upper extremity to impairment of the body as a whole. In this case, Dr. Novin\u2019s assessment of forty-one percent impairment of the right upper extremity translates to twenty-five percent impairment of the whole person; Dr. Lapidario\u2019s assessment of twenty-five percent impairment of the right upper extremity translates to twelve percent impairment of the whole person.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>The employer and insurer contend that the Commission improperly took the average of the two upper extremity impairment ratings (forty-one percent and twenty percent) and then applied that average to the whole person rather than to the upper extremity, when instead the Commission should have taken the average of the whole body impairment ratings.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">We reject their contention because no statute or regulation requires that the Commission take the average of the medical assessments, nor is the Commission bound by the highest or lowest medical assessments. <em>See Gly Construction Co. v. Davis, </em>60 Md.App. 602, 607, 483 A.2d 1330, 1333 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>302 Md. 288, 487 A.2d 292 (1985). In <em>Gly Construction, </em>Chief Judge Richard Gilbert, then Chief Judge of the Court of Special Appeals, writing for the court, considered whether the Commission may award a percentage of disability greater than the highest medical evidence in the record. <em>Id. </em>at 605, 483 A.2d at 1332. The intermediate appellate court held that nothing within the workers\u2019 compensation statute or accompanying regulations limits the Commission, or the circuit court on petition for judicial review, to the medical evaluations. <em>Id. </em>at 606, 483 A.2d at 1332.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Moreover, the Commission\u2019s determination of disability was never intended to be the one-to-one equivalent of the medical evaluations of the claimant\u2019s impairment. The Court of Special Appeals in <em>Gly </em>reiterated that injury and disability are not synonymous and that compensation is paid not for the injury but for the resulting disability. <em>Id. </em>at 607, 483 A.2d at 1333. Chief Judge Gilbert wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-7\">To hold that in all cases the Commission or the court is compelled to find an amount of disability that is no greater than the highest medical evaluation and no less than the lowest medical evaluation would impermissibly shift the legal determination of \u201cdisability\u201d to physicians. That result would be in clear contravention of the legislative intent and traditional role of the Commission or court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-8\"><em>Id., </em>483 A.2d at 1333. The <em>AMA Guides </em>themselves warn that the impairment ratings derived from the <em>AMA Guides </em>are not substitutes for the legal determination of disability.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>[A]s used in the <em>Guides, </em>\u201cimpairment\u201d means an alteration of an individual\u2019s health status that is <em>assessed by medical means, </em>\u201cdisability,\u201d which is <em>assessed by nonmedical means, </em>means an alteration of an individual\u2019s capacity to meet personal, social, or occupational demands, or to meet statutory or regulatory requirements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-5\">H* sfc H\u00ab H* H&lt;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-6\">Each administrative or legal system that uses permanent impairment as a basis for disability rating needs to define its own process for translating knowledge of a medical condition into an estimate of the degree to which the individual\u2019s capacity to meet personal, social, or occupational demands, or to meet statutory or regulatory requirements, is limited by the impairment. We encourage each system not to make a \u201cone-to-one\u201d translation of impairment to disability, in essence creating a use of the <em>Guides </em>which is not intended.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">AMA Guides, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1.1, 1.3, at 2, 6 (emphasis in original). Were the Commission routinely to determine industrial loss of use by averaging the medical assessments, the Commission would fall short of its obligation to consider all of the factors set out in COMAE 14.09.04.02(B) to determine a claimant\u2019s disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">The Commission must do more than merely adopt medical evaluations of anatomical impairment; the Commission must assess the extent of the loss of use by considering how the injury has affected the employee\u2019s ability to do his or her job. An evaluating physician provides the Commission with an assessment of medical impairment; the finder of fact, however, must determine the degree of disability. Gilbert &amp; Humphreys, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 7.2, at 135. Medical impairment and compensable disability are not synonymous. In the treatise authored by Gilbert and Humphreys, we find a hypothetical that illustrates the difference between injury and compensable disability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>Consider, for example, claimants A and B, who have both sustained amputations on both hands of the thumbs. Claimant A is a freight checker, who is required to operate the push buttons on an electronic truck scale and tabulate weight sheets for his employer. After recovering from the injury he returns to this pre-accident duties and works the same number of hours per week. Claimant B is a concert pianist who, as a result of the injury, has been informed that he shall never play the piano professionally, if at all. Notwithstanding the similarity of the injuries, it is easy to fathom that Claimant B conceivably could be found permanently totally disabled, while Claimant A would receive an award for a much smaller industrial loss of use of the body.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ay4\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7.5, at 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">The Court of Special Appeals acknowledged that the Commission is not bound by the medical evaluations, but nevertheless held that the Commission committed an error of law when it concluded that Getson had sustained a thirty percent impairment of her body as a whole because \u201cthe Commission failed to abide by its own regulations.\u201d We are unable to discern how the Commission disregarded its own regulation. COMAR 14.09.04 sets out general guidelines for physician evaluations. The COMAR regulation only requires that the Commission consider the factors specified in COMAR 14.09.04.02(B) and that the Commission authorize payments only to physicians who comply with the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">In this case, the Commission found a thirty percent loss of use of the body as a whole, seventeen percent greater than the highest medical assessment. COMAR 14.09.04.02 directs that the Commission, in assessing permanent impairment, shall consider all of the information provided in the medical evaluations, as well as the information required by \u00a7 9\u2014721(b)\u2014 namely, atrophy, pain, weakness, and loss of endurance, function, and range of motion. \u00a7 9-721(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Dr. Novin concluded that Getson \u201chas significant pain, weakness, loss of endurance, atrophy, and loss of function.\u201d Dr. Novin also found impaired range of motion. Dr. Lapidar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>io, who assessed a lower level of impairment, nonetheless concluded that Petitioner\u2019s injury resulted in \u201crecurrent discomfort in the right shoulder, weakness of the muscles, stiffness of the shoulder joint and loss of endurance.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s testimony demonstrated that the injury has limited her day-today activities. She testified that her arm gets very tired and hurts when outstretched for a long period of time at work. She also reported that she has difficulty giving customers their money at work because the counter is too high for her to reach with her right arm and that she can no longer lift the change trays used at the bank. Outside of the work context, Petitioner experienced a great deal of pain in cold weather and suffered from such limited range of motion that getting items out of her cupboards at home and reaching her arm behind her back in order to dress herself have become nearly impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Upon judicial review in the circuit court, the Commission\u2019s decision is presumed to be <em>prima facie </em>correct and the burden of proving that the Commission\u2019s decision was not correct rests with the party seeking judicial review. \u00a7 9-745(b). We agree with the circuit court that the employer and insurer did not overcome the presumption of correctness that the Commission\u2019s decision enjoys. We conclude that the circuit court did not err in affirming the Commission\u2019s finding of 30% loss of industrial use of the body as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

There are two categories of injuries for purposes of permanent partial disability under \u00a7 9-627\u2014-those that are \u201cscheduled,\u201d or specifically listed and those that are \u201cunscheduled\u201d and fall within the \"Other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>cases\u201d category of \u00a7 9-627(k). In \u00a7 9-627(b) through \u00a7 9-627(j), the General Assembly has ascribed the duration of compensation, measured in weeks, for the loss of each scheduled body part. Among the scheduled injuries are loss of use of the thumb, finger, toe, hand, arm, foot, leg, eye, hearing, and septum. Section 9-627 assigns to each scheduled injury the number of weeks for which compensation is available for that injury. Not all injuries are scheduled. Section 9-627 contains a \u201ccatch-all\u201d provision, entitled \"Other cases,\u201d \u00a7 9-627(k), for permanent partial disability not listed elsewhere in the section. Section 9-627(k), \"Other cases,\u201d provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-7\">In all cases of permanent partial disability not listed in subsections (a) through (j) of this section, the Commission shall determine the percentage by which the <em>industrial use of the covered employee\u2019s body </em>was impaired as a result of the accidental personal injury or occupational disease.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">Section 9-627(k) differs from the scheduled provisions in that \u00a7 9-627(k) speaks in terms of loss of \"industrial use of the covered employee\u2019s body\u201d rather than loss of use of the specific body part.
