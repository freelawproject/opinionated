For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">The petitioner, Jessie Wayne Stanford, is a former member of the Easton Police Department. On February 8, 1992, Stanford, a fifteen-year police veteran, pleaded guilty to a charge of misdemeanor theft of federal government property in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641. The charge arose from misrepresentations made by Stanford on an application for rural housing assistance from the United States Farmers Home Administration (FHA). Stanford indicated to the FHA that he was the sole income earner in his household; based on these representations, he received approximately $7,752.00 in mortgage interest credits. In fact, Stanford shared his home with a woman whose contributions to the household finances, if properly disclosed, would have affected Stanford\u2019s eligibility for housing assistance. The plea agreement, pursuant to which Stanford was convicted, incorporated a promise to make restitution. In addition, Stanford was sentenced to one year of unsupervised probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">As a result of Stanford\u2019s conviction, the Easton Police Department, terminated his employment on April 29, 1994. Approximately one week later, Stanford was offered a position with the St. Michael\u2019s Police Department. The effective date of Stanford\u2019s employment with the St. Michael\u2019s Police Department was May 10, 1994. Hence, there was a ten-day period during which Stanford was not a member of any law enforcement unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">On May 16, 1994, Chief Wade A. Roche of the St. Michael\u2019s Police Department notified the agency- that oversees police officer certification, the Police Training Commission (also \u201cthe Commission\u201d), that his department had hired Stanford. Chief Roche urged the members of the Police Training Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>to give Stanford \u201ca second chance\u201d in the event they \u201cdecide to take [him] to a decertification hearing.\u201d In response, the Police Training Commission invited Chief Roche to attend an upcoming meeting, at which the issue of Stanford\u2019s recertification was scheduled to be discussed. The Police Training Commission\u2019s characterization of the issue as one of recertification, as opposed to decertification, goes to the heart of the dispute in this case and will be resolved below.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">Stanford did not receive notice of, and did not attend, the meeting at which his certification was slated for discussion. Following a review of Stanford\u2019s misdemeanor conviction and a reading of several letters of support, a motion to certify Stanford was made and seconded. The motion did not carry, however, and this litigation ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">On June 28, 1994, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, Stanford filed a petition seeking judicial review of the Commission\u2019s action. He subsequently filed an amended petition and petition for writ of mandamus, alleging, among other things, that because he satisfied the requirements for certification under Maryland law, the Police Training Commission acted illegally in refusing to certify him. Stanford also asserted that the Police Training Commission should have provided him with notice and an opportunity to be heard prior to \u201cdecertifying\u201d him. The trial judge granted summary judgment in favor of the Police Training Commission, and Stanford appealed to the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">On appeal, Stanford maintained that the action taken by the Commission at the June 7 meeting was a revocation of his certification. The significance of this contention is that Maryland law requires compliance \"with certain procedures prior to the Commission\u2019s revocation or suspension of an officer\u2019s certificate. Specifically, the Commission must \u201chold a hearing, in compliance with the Administrative Procedure Act....\u201d Md.Code (1957, 1997 Repl..Vol.), Art. 41, \u00a7 4-201(g)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>addition, the officer must receive notice of the hearing, including a statement of the grounds for the contemplated revocation or suspension. \u00a7 4-201(g)(3). It is undisputed that the June 7 meeting did not conform to the statutorily-prescribed procedures for revocation hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">The Court of Special Appeals disagreed with Stanford\u2019s claim that the Commission revoked his certification on June 7. Rather, after examining the relevant statutory language, the court concluded that Stanford\u2019s certification was <em>automatically </em>revoked upon his termination from the Easton Police Department:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-5\">\u201cAlthough [the statute] is not as clear as it could be as to what happens to a police officer\u2019s certification when the officer\u2019s employment is terminated by a law enforcement agency, ... the statutory scheme behind the statute reveals that the legislat[ure] did not intend that an individual who ceases to be a police officer continue[ ] to hold his or her certification.\u201d (Footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">The intermediate appellate court concluded that the meeting of June 7 did not constitute a decertification hearing, the characterization urged by Stanford, but rather amounted to a recertification hearing. Because there is no requirement that an officer be provided with notice and opportunity to be heard with regard to his or her recertification, the Commission\u2019s action of June 7 was held to be proper.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">This Court granted certiorari to consider the pivotal issue of whether a police officer\u2019s certificate is automatically \u201crevoked\u201d upon the termination of the officer\u2019s employment with a police department. Stanford presents essentially the same arguments to this Court as he did below; namely, that the Commission improperly revoked his certification at the meeting of June 7, and that the Commission violated Maryland law and principles of due process by depriving him of certification without notice and an opportunity to be heard. For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>reasons that we shall explain, we agree with the Court of Special Appeals that termination of employment effects an automatic \u201crevocation\u201d of certification. Stanford thus lost his certification upon his separation from the Easton Police Department on April 29, not as a result of the Commission meeting of June 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">The statutes pertinent to police officer certification do not explicitly provide that termination of employment invalidates an officer\u2019s certificate. Stanford seizes upon the absence of an express statement to this effect as the basis for his argument. Invoking the rule of statutory construction that the express authorization of one action implies exclusion of another, <em>see, e.g., Mossburg v. Montgomery County, Md., </em>329 Md. 494, 505, 620 A.2d 886, 892 (1993), Stanford notes that \u00a7 4-201 explicitly sets forth a number of circumstances under which an officer may lose his or her certification, but does not include termination of employment among them. The implication, Stanford contends, is that the legislature did not intend termination to result in automatic decertification; otherwise, this potentiality would have been included among the various provisions of \u00a7 4-201.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">The mere failure to provide expressly <em>for </em>decertification upon termination, however, does not mean that the legislature intended certification to continue. \u201cThat which necessarily is <em>implied </em>in the statute is as much a part of it as that which is expressed.\u201d <em>Soper v. Montgomery County, </em>294 Md. 331, 335, 449 A.2d 1158, 1160 (1982)(emphasis added)(superseded in part by statute)(citing <em>Guardian Life Ins. v. Ins. Comm\u2019r, </em>293 Md. 629, 643, 446 A.2d 1140, 1148 (1982); <em>Chillum-Adelphi v. Board, </em>247 Md. 373, 377, 231 A.2d 60, 62 (1967); <em>Restivo v. Princeton Constr. Co., </em>223 Md. 516, 525, 165 A.2d 766, 771 (I960)). Accordingly, the Commission argues that the statutory provisions pertinent to police officer certification \u201ccollectively ... demonstrate ... the General Assem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>bly\u2019s intent in linking a police officer\u2019s certification with his or her continuing employment as a person authorized to enforce the general criminal laws____\u201d More specifically, the Commission contends that because \u201cpolice officer\u201d is statutorily defined as \u201ca person who has the authority to enforce the general criminal laws of this State <em>and </em>is a member of\u2019 one of twelve enumerated \u201claw enforcement units,\u201d Stanford could not have remained certified as a \u201cpolice officer\u201d when he was no longer a member of a law enforcement unit. In further support of its position, the Commission singles out several regulations that indicate that termination brings about an automatic revocation of certification. These regulations have survived several amendments to \u00a7 4-201, which, the Commission asserts, evidences implicit legislative approval of the Commission\u2019s interpretation of the effect of termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">As the preceding summary of the parties\u2019 arguments indicates, this case involves an issue of statutory construction. \u201cAs we have so often said, the cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intention.\u201d <em>State v. Crescent Cities Jaycees, </em>330 Md. 460, 468, 624 A.2d 955, 959 (1993). In determining legislative intent, \u201cthe court\u2019s inquiry begins with the words of the statute____\u201d <em>Tidewater v. Mayor of Havre de Grace, </em>337 Md. 338, 344, 653 A.2d 468, 472 (1995). The statutory language is not read in isolation, but \u201cin light of the full context in which [it] appeals], and in light of external manifestations of intent or general purpose available through other evidence.\u201d <em>Cunningham v. State, </em>318 Md. 182, 185, 567 A.2d 126, 127 (1989); <em>see also Warsame v. State, </em>338 Md. 513, 519, 659 A.2d 1271, 1273 (1995); <em>Kaczorowski v. City of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 514-15, 525 A.2d 628, 632 (1987). Applying these principles to the instant case, we conclude that the General Assembly intends a police officer\u2019s certification to be invalidated upon termination of employment with a law enforcement agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>1.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">Our analysis begins with a review of the statutory provisions under which the Commission acts and pursuant to which certificates are issued. The Police Training Commission was created in an effort by the legislature to improve the educational and clinical training of police officers. Chapter 286 of the Acts of 1966. Hoping to redress what it perceived as \u201ca serious need for improvement in the administration of law enforcement,\u201d the General Assembly established the Commission for the purpose of developing \u201ca minimal standards educational and training program.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The specific powers, responsibilities, and duties of the Commission presently are codified at \u00a7 4-201 and include such tasks as adopting standards for the approval of police training schools; certifying and periodically inspecting training schools; developing curriculum and minimal educational requirements for training schools; prescribing minimum qualifications for police school instructors; and verifying the satisfactory completion of training programs by police officers. \u00a7 4-201(d)(1)\u2014(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Most importantly for purposes of the case <em>sub judice, </em>the Commission is responsible for the certification of police officers. Maryland law prohibits, with limited exceptions, the employment of any individual as a police officer who is not certified by the Commission. \u00a7 4-201(j). Those individuals who have \u201c[satisfactorily met the Commission\u2019s standards; or ... [provided the Commission with sufficient evidence [of satisfactory completion of] a training program in another state of equal quality and content as required by the Commission\u201d are eligible for certification. \u00a7 4-201(d)(6). The precise standards for certification are established by regulation<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> pursuant to the Commission\u2019s express rule making authority. <em>See </em>\u00a7 4-201(d)(ll).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>In conjunction with the power to issue certificates, the Commission possesses the authority to revoke, suspend, or recall certificates under certain conditions. Pursuant to \u00a7 4-201(d)(7), for example, the Commission is empowered to revoke or suspend a certificate \u201cif the police officer has violated or has failed to meet the Commission\u2019s standards, including having knowingly failed to report suspected child abuse in violation of \u00a7 5-704 of the Family Law Article.\u201d Furthermore, if the suspension or revocation is prompted by the occurrence of certain enumerated events, the Commission may recall the certificate. The specific grounds for recall are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUC\">\u201c(1) The certificate was issued by administrative error;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-4\">(2) The certificate was obtained through misrepresentation or fraud;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-5\">(3) The holder has been convicted of a felony; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-6\">(4) The holder has been convicted of a misdemeanor for which a sentence of imprisonment for more than 1 year may be imposed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">\u00a7 4-201(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">Even if the Commission does not initiate an action for revocation, suspension, or recall, an officer may lose his or her certification through \u201cautomatic lapse.\u201d Section 4-201(h) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-9\"><em>\u201cAutomatic lapse of officer\u2019s certificate; </em>recertification.\u2014 (1) A police officer\u2019s certificate ... shall automatically lapse 3 years from the date of the previous certification.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8Z\">A police officer\u2019s certificate thus automatically expires 3 years after issuance. Section 4-201(i) suggests that the failure to meet the Commission\u2019s standards may also cause a certificate to lapse. That section states that \u201c[i]f the certificate is in danger of lapsing or has lapsed <em>because of the police officer\u2019s failure to meet the Commission\u2019s standards, </em>the police officer may request a hearing____\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">Section 4-201 thus sets forth a number of ways in which an officer could lose his or her certification. Stanford urges us to find significance in the failure to include termination of employment among these express provisions. In a number of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>cases, we have indeed recognized that \u201cwhere the Legislature in a statute expressly authorizes a particular action under certain circumstances, the statute ordinarily should be construed as not allowing the action under other circumstances.\u201d <em>Mossburg, </em>329 Md. at 505, 620 A.2d at 892; <em>see also Office &amp; Prof. Employees Int\u2019l v. MTA, </em>295 Md. 88, 96, 453 A.2d 1191, 1195 (1982)(observing that \u201cthe Legislature\u2019s enumeration of one item, purpose, etc. ordinarily implies the exclusion of all others\u201d); <em>American Security v. New Amsterdam, </em>246 Md. 36, 41, 227 A.2d 214, 217 (1967)(referring to principle that \u201cthe express imposition of one qualification shows a deliberate rejection of any other\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">In <em>American Security, </em>for example, this Court held that a mortgagee was not a \u201cpurchaser\u201d for purposes of a statute that protected property sold to bona fide purchasers from attachment by the seller\u2019s creditors. 246 Md. at 41, 227 A.2d at 216-17. In reaching this decision, the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACU\">\u201cHad the legislature intended to include a mortgagee within the terms of the statute, it would undoubtedly have done so, and since it did not, the implication is that mortgagees were purposely excluded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-5\"><em>Id. </em>In contrast to those cases in which this maxim, sometimes expressed as \u201cexpressio unius est exclusio alterius,\u201d has been applied, however, the statutory language in the instant case does not support the inference that the General Assembly purposely excluded termination of employment such that an officer\u2019s certification would survive his or her separation from a law enforcement unit. Stated otherwise, we are unable to conclude that if the legislature had intended termination of employment to invalidate automatically an officer\u2019s certification, it necessarily would have included such a provision in \u00a7 4-201.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">Preliminarily, we note that the provisions dealing with the Commission\u2019s specific power to revoke, suspend, or recall certificates do little, if anything, to resolve the question presented in this case. The mere fact that the Commission is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>expressly authorized to revoke certification upon termination of employment as a law enforcement officer does not mean that termination of employment does not <em>automatically </em>\u201crevoke\u201d certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">The more relevant inquiry is the significance of the failure to include termination of employment in the \u201cautomatic lapse\u201d provisions, an omission that Stanford cites in support of his position. The primary goal of the provisions dealing with automatic lapse seems to be to ensure that active police officers receive adequate training on a regular basis. The automatic lapse provisions do not appear to be an attempt by the General Assembly to define the entire universe of events that may cause an officer to lose his or her certification. The focus, rather, is on fashioning a mechanism by which to enforce the training requirements established by the Commission. Inclusion of a provision that termination of employment invalidates officer certification does not further this goal. Hence, we do not consider the absence of termination of employment among the express provisions of \u00a7 4-201 necessarily indicative of a legislative intent that certification remain intact following termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Furthermore, certain other subsections of \u00a7 4-201 support the conclusion that the General Assembly does not intend that an officer\u2019s certificate remain valid after termination of employment. In its judgment below, the Court of Special Appeals noted that the statutory definition of \u201cpolice officer\u201d is a significant indicator that a certificate is invalidated if an officer is terminated. A \u201cpolice officer\u201d is defined as \u201ca person who has the authority to enforce the general criminal laws of this State <em>and </em>is a member of any of [twelve enumerated] law enforcement units.\u201d \u00a7 4-201(a)(8)(i)(emphasis added). An individual who is no longer \u201ca member of ... a law. enforcement unit\u201d clearly does not fall within this definition. We agree with the intermediate appellate court, therefore, that an individual cannot be certified as fulfilling the Commission\u2019s standards \u201cas a police officer\u201d if he or she fails to meet the very definition of police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>The conclusion that employment with a law enforcement unit is a prerequisite to certification is also consistent with \u00a7 4-201 (j), which provides: \u201cA person may not be employed as a police officer by any law enforcement unit <em>for a period to exceed 12 months </em>unless that person is certified by the Commission____\u201d (Emphasis added). This 12-month-grace period affords officers sufficient time, after they are hired by a particular law enforcement unit, to comply with the Commission\u2019s standards for certification. The inclusion of the grace period suggests that the legislature presumed that an individual is not eligible for certification unless and until he or she is employed as a police officer, and that a period during which to obtain that certification should be provided.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section 4-201 (e) supports this conclusion; it restricts a probationary appointment as a police officer to \u201ca total period not exceeding one (1) year for the purpose of enabling such a person ... to take a training course as prescribed in this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Stanford attempts to draw a distinction, however, between the requirements for <em>becoming </em>certified and the requirements for <em>remaining </em>certified. To become certified, Stanford concedes that one must be employed by a law enforcement agency. Once certified, however, Stanford argues that continued employment is not necessary to remain certified. There is no indication in the relevant statutory provisions that the General Assembly intended such a distinction. Furthermore, \u201cin seeking to ascertain legislative intent, [we] may consider the consequences resulting from one meaning rather than another, and adopt that construction which avoids an illogical or unreasonable result, or one which is inconsistent with common sense.\u201d <em>Tucker v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>308 Md. 69, 75, 517 A.2d 730, 732 (1986). The adoption of Stanford\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>interpretation would have an undesirable result: an individual who possesses the rights and privileges attendant to certification as a police officer, but who is not operating under the auspices of any particular law enforcement unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">Counsel for Stanford opined at oral argument that, assuming that an individual remains certified after termination of employment with a law enforcement agency, that individual would retain the privilege, by virtue of his or her certification as a police officer, to carry a handgun. It is unclear whether this position is supported by the applicable law,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and we express no opinion on the matter today. This question exemplifies, however, precisely the type of confusion that would arise if we were to adopt an interpretation that would permit certification to continue even after termination of employment as a law enforcement officer. While it seems contrary to sound public policy to permit an unemployed police officer to enforce the law in a vigilante-like manner, an individual who is \u201ccertified as a police officer\u201d certainly appears, at least superficially, to possess the authority to act as a police officer. By construing the statute to mean that certification is automatically revoked upon termination of employment with a law enforcement unit, we avoid the uncertainties that would result from an interpretation to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Finally, the regulations that have been promulgated by the Commission in accordance with its rule making authority leave little doubt that an officer does not remain certified after termination of employment. Commission regulations require officers to carry their certificates \u201cat all times while ... in a duty status.\u201d Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR) 12.04.01.11G(3). If an officer is terminated, however, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>certificate must \u201cbe returned to the Commission within 10 working days by the agency head----\u201d COMAR 12.04.01.11E. The meaning of this regulation seems beyond dispute: an officer who is terminated must forfeit his or her certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Stanford contends, however, that this regulation is merely a \u201chousekeeping\u201d provision, and that the return of a certificate to the Commission upon termination of employment does not mean that the officer is no longer certified. If we were to accept this argument, several other regulatory provisions would be rendered meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">COMAR 12.04.01.11F, for example, seems specifically aimed at remedying the <em>ipso facto </em>decertification of police officers who have terminated their employment with one law enforcement agency, and who are subsequently hired by another law enforcement agency. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-8\">\u201cA person will be recertified as a police officer and a certificate shall be issued to the officer when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-9\">(1) A person is hired by a second or successive law-enforcement unit, the \u201cNotice of Probationary Appointment\u201d form has been received by the Commission, and the person has met all standards of the Commission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">With regard to officers \u201cwho ha[ve] been separated from a law enforcement unit in good standing for not more than 3 years,\u201d COMAR 12.04.01.11D(1) provides that \u201c[i]f all training requirements for the previous calendar year have been met, an individual may be certified without additional training.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Commission has thus established a minimally burdensome process of recertification for previously-certified officers, who are re-hired by a subsequent law enforcement agency within 3 years and who have completed the requisite training. If it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>were true that officers remained certified following termination of employment, there would be no need for this expedited process of recertification.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Stanford also claims that officers who transfer, without a gap in service, from one agency to another presently are \u201cnot required to undergo an entire recertification procedure, or any particular [Commission] procedure, for that matter.\u201d Because the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals makes no distinction between officers who transfer without a gap in service and officers who are re-hired after a period of non-employment, Stanford interprets the decision as meaning that both categories of officers lose their certification upon separation from the initial law enforcement agency. Accordingly, Stanford contends that the Commission must now mandate new procedures for transferring officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Stanford cites no statutory or regulatory authority, however, in support of his contention that officers who transfer, without a gap in service, are not required to be recertified. In fact, the regulations make no express distinction between such officers and officers who, like Stanford, are re-hired after a period of non-employment. While we need not decide the matter in order to resolve the issue in this case, we note that the aforementioned recertification regulations seem to apply regardless of the circumstances under which the officer is reappointed.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">With regard to other \u201cprocedures\u201d required by the Commission, the pertinent regulations are similarly devoid of any indication that they do not apply to transferring officers. As the Commission notes in its Brief, the \u201cregulations set forth a number of steps that a law enforcement unit must follow whenever it seeks to hire an individual as a police officer, regardless of whether that person is currently employed elsewhere as a police officer or is not employed at all____\u201d For example, COMAR 12.04.01.02B requires the filing of a Notice of Probationary Appointment \u201cwithin 30 days of the officer\u2019s date of employment <em>each and every time </em>the officer is hired by a law enforcement unit in the State.\u201d COMAR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>12.04.01.02B (emphasis added); <em>see also </em>COMAR 12.04.01.02A. Another regulation specifically requires a background investigation \u201c[i]n each subsequent appointment\u201d as a police officer. <em>See </em>COMAR 12.04.01.01B. There are no exceptions in these regulations for officers who transfer without a gap in service. Contrary to Stanford\u2019s assertion, therefore, there appear to be procedures in place that are triggered by the appointment or reappointment of an individual as a police officer, regardless of the officer\u2019s previous employment status.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">The various aforementioned regulations indicate that the Commission considers an officer who is terminated from employment to be automatically decertified. We have repeatedly stated that \u201cthe contemporaneous interpretation of a statute by the agency charged with its administration is entitled to great deference.\u201d <em>Balto. Gas &amp; Elec. v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>305 Md. 145, 161, 501 A.2d 1307, 1315 (1986); <em>see also McCullough v. Wittner, </em>314 Md. 602, 612, 552 A.2d 881, 886 (1989); <em>Board v. Harker, </em>316 Md. 683, 698-99, 561 A.2d 219, 227 (1989); <em>Consumer Protection v. Consumer Pub., </em>304 Md. 731, 759, 501 A.2d 48, 63 (1985). This is particularly true where the \u201cinterpretation has been applied consistently and for a long period of time,\u201d <em>Balto. Gas, </em>305 Md. at 161, 501 A.2d at 1315, or \u201cwhere there are subsequent re-enactments without change of the language thus construed.\u201d <em>Kimball-Tyler v. City of Balto., </em>214 Md. 86, 99, 133 A.2d 433, 440 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">In the years since the promulgation of these regulations, the General Assembly has enacted several amendments to \u00a7 4-201.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> None of the subsequent enactments contradicts the regulatory provisions or otherwise indicates legislative disapproval of the view that termination of employment invalidates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>a previously-issued certif\u00edcate. Legislative acquiescence in the Commission\u2019s treatment of the effect of termination of employment is yet further confirmation that the General Assembly intends the same result.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">In sum, an examination of the language of the statute, the purposes behind its enactment, and the applicable regulations leads us to conclude that termination of employment invalidates an individual\u2019s certification as a police officer. Upon Stanford\u2019s termination from the Easton Police Department, therefore, his certification was automatically \u201crevoked,\u201d and the action taken at the Commission meeting of June 7 is properly characterized as a determination that Stanford should not be recertified.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">Stanford stated in his Brief: \u201cIt is not disputed, if indeed Stanford\u2019s certificate had been [automatically] revoked, that the [Commission] could refuse to certify him.\u201d The propriety of the Commission\u2019s refusal to recertify Stanford, therefore, is not before this Court. We note, however, the refusal to recertify Stanford apparently did not result from his failure to complete the requisite training programs but, rather, from his conviction for misdemeanor theft, a minor offense punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000 or imprisonment for not more than 1 year. The record indicates that Stanford has now made full restitution to the FHA. Nothing in this opinion should be construed as making him ineligible for recertification.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">Finally, because the June 7 meeting did not amount to a revocation hearing, it is unnecessary for us to address Stanford\u2019s argument that he was not provided the process that he was due. The judgment of the Court of Special Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED. COSTS IN THIS COURT AND IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b421-7\">.

Commission regulations, in fact, clarify that an individual who receives a probationary appointment as a police officer as defined in \u00a7 4-201 begins a one-year probationary period, during which time \u201c[t]he officer shall successfully complete the entrance-level police training program, approved by the Commission.\u201d COMAR 12.04.01.01A(1)(b). If the individual is terminated from employment, the probationary certificate issued during the probationary period is invalidated.

Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 36B, which establishes a general prohibition against the carrying, wearing or transporting of an open or concealed handgun, provides in pertinent part: \"Nothing in this section shall prevent the wearing, carrying, or transporting of a handgun by: (i) law-enforcement personnel of the United States, or of this State, or of any county or city of this State____\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b431-11\">. For those officers \u2018\u2018who ha[ve] been separated from a law enforcement position in good standing for more than 3 years but not more than 5 years,\u201d the requirements for recertification are more stringent: these officers must complete certain portions of the entrance level training program. <em>See </em>COMAR 12.04.01.110(2). And if the period of separation is in excess of 5 years, the individual must satisfy \u201call entrance-level standards of the Commission.\u201d COMAR 12.04.01.11D(3)(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b433-6\">. For example, the regulation that requires agencies to turn over the certificates of terminated officers has been in effect since December 31, 1985. See 12:16 Md. Reg. 1608; COMAR 12.04.01.11(E). The effective date of the regulation pertaining to recertification upon re-employment was January 1, 1982. <em>See </em>8:25 Md. Reg.1996; COMAR 12.04.01.11(F). With one exception, the General Assembly has amended \u00a7 4-201 every year from 1986\u20141996; there were no amendments in 1989.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
