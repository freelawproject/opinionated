Warren, </em>336 Md. 618, 650 A.2d 252 (1994), and <em>Frye v. Frye, </em>305 Md. 542, 505 A.2d 826 (1986), this Court declined to create an exception to the parent-child immunity doctrine in motor tort cases based upon the existence of compulsory automobile liability insurance coverage. We are asked in this case to reexamine those decisions. Having done so, we shall reaffirm the vitality of the parent child-immunity doctrine in this State and affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">The facts of this case are brief and undisputed. On December 8,1992, Natasha Renko suffered serious injuries when her biological mother, Teresa Kaylor McLean, negligently drove the car both women were occupying into the rear of another vehicle. At the time, Natasha Renko was seventeen years old.</p>\n<p id=\"ADV\">On January 18, 1994, and following her eighteenth birthday, Renko filed a Complaint and Election of Jury Trial in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County seeking damages in the amount of $100,000 for injuries she allegedly sustained in the December 8, 1992 automobile accident. The Complaint named Teresa McLean and her husband, Robert McLean,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as defendants,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> here appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"Apb\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>Both Teresa and Robert McLean filed Motionfs] to Dismiss. Robert McLean subsequently filed an independent Motion for Summary Judgment. In a hearing on the motions, Renko beseeched the court to recognize an exception to the parent-child immunity doctrine and allow emancipated children to file actions against their parents for injuries sustained in motor vehicle accidents occurring in minority between fifteen and eighteen years of age. The court declined to do so and entered judgment in favor of the appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Renko appealed the judgment entered in favor of her mother to the Court of Special Appeals.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We issued a writ of certiorari before consideration by the intermediate appellate court of the issues presented in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">For nearly seventy years, the parent-child tort immunity doctrine has been, with few exceptions,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a salient feature of Maryland law. <em>See Schneider v. Schneider, </em>160 Md. 18, 152 A. 498 (1930).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It remains so today.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">Once an absolute bar to tort actions between parents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>and their minor children,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the parent-child immunity doctrine grew out of an abiding belief that it served the compelling public interest in preserving, under normal circumstances, the internal harmony and integrity of the family unit and parental authority in the parent-child relationship. <em>Warren v. Warren, </em>336 Md. 618, 622, 650 A.2d 252, 254; <em>Smith v. Gross, </em>319 Md. 138, 145-46, 571 A.2d 1219, 1222 (1990); <em>Frye, </em>305 Md. at 548, 505 A.2d at 829-30; <em>Yost v. Yost, </em>172 Md. 128, 134, 190 A. 753, 756 (1937); <em>Schneider, </em>160 Md. at 21-22, 152 A. at 499-500. In fact, the special relationship, with its reciprocal duties and obligations, that the minor child shares with his or her parents forms a major component of the foundation upon which the parent-child immunity doctrine is built\u2014a relationship recognized both at common law<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and by the General Assembly.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Other justifications offered for the rule include the prevention of fraud and collusion among family members to the detriment of thirdparties, and the threat that intrafamilial litigation will deplete family resources. <em>See Warren, </em>336 Md. at 625, 650 A.2d at 255.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>Nevertheless, the parent-child immunity doctrine has never stood static where historical experience and common sense dictated that it must yield. Indeed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-5\">\u201c[t]he parent[-]child immunity rule ... was a creature of the common law. It was judicially conceived, judicially adopted in Maryland, judicially changed in certain significant aspects, and otherwise judicially nurtured and applied in this jurisdiction[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-6\"><em>Frye, </em>305 Md. at 566, 505 A.2d at 839; <em>see also </em>n.4, <em>supra. </em>But our acknowledgment that circumstance sometimes severs the doctrine from its rationale and reason in no way detracts from our fundamental belief that \u201cthe parent-child immunity rule [is still] essential to the maintenance of discipline and to the stability of family harmony.\u201d <em>Frye, </em>305 Md. at 561, 505 A.2d at 836; <em>see also Warren, </em>336 Md. at 622-24, 650 A.2d at 254-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">In <em>Frye, supra, </em>we exhaustively surveyed the creation and refinement of the parent-child immunity doctrine both in this State and across our Country. Despite the growing chorus of criticism surrounding the doctrine,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we determined that the parent-child relationship had changed little, if at all, in the ensuing years since our predecessors first recognized parent-child immunity. We thus concluded that \u201ctoday\u2019s parent-child relationship, as recognized by this Court and the Legislature, furnishes no compelling reason to abrogate the rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 561, 505 A.2d at 836; <em>see also Warren, </em>336 Md. at 627-28, 650 A.2d at 256-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">Renko nonetheless mounts a three-pronged attack upon the parent-child immunity doctrine. She asserts that (1) adult children should be allowed to maintain actions against their parents for injuries occurring in their minority; (2) no contemporary justification exists to apply the doctrine to the facts of the case <em>sub judice </em>in light of compulsory motor vehicle liability insurance; and (3) any such application is violative of Articles 19 and 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights and of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. We shall address each of these contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">a.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Renko correctly points out that we have permitted suits between parents and their minor children in limited circumstances. For instance, we have held that a minor child may maintain an action against a father\u2019s business partner for alleged negligence arising out of the operation of the partnership. <em>Hatzinicolas v. Protopapas, </em>314 Md. 340, 550 A.2d 947 (1988). That decision was predicated upon our belief that the parent-child relationship, so important to the parent-child immunity rule, would remain inviolate in a suit against the father\u2019s business partner. <em>Id. </em>at 357, 550 A.2d at 947.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">We further observed that (1) assuming the existence of a business liability insurance policy, the father had already paid his share of liability through his contribution to policy premium payments; or (2) it would otherwise be unrealistic to assume that the father did not take his partnership contribution obligation<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> into account when the familial decision was made to initiate a suit against his partner; and (3) although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>the ultimate decision to sue may impair or even destroy the relationship between the partners, that relationship is not the focus or concern of the parent-child immunity rule. <em>Id. </em>at 358, 550 A.2d at 956. Thus, despite the possible financial impact upon the father (and therefore, the family) by the successful prosecution of a suit against his business partner by a minor child, we concluded that \u201cpreservation of the family interests [justifying the parent-child immunity doctrine] does not require [the extension of the doctrine] to bar any recovery from a parent\u2019s partner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 357, 550 A.2d at 955.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Recognizing that reality sometimes belies the ideal of family life, our predecessors also deemed permissible a suit by a minor child against her father\u2019s estate for alleged injuries she sustained when, within the span of one week, the father both murdered the child\u2019s mother and committed suicide in the child\u2019s presence. <em>Mahnke v. Moore, </em>197 Md. 61, 77 A.2d 923 (1951). The Court reasoned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Akj\">\u201c[i]n these circumstances, there can be no basis for the contention that the daughter\u2019s suit against her father\u2019s estate would be contrary to public policy, for the simple reason that there is no home at all in which discipline and tranquility are to be preserved____ [W]hen ... the parent is guilty of acts which show complete abandonment of the parental relation, the rule giving him immunity from suit by the child, on the ground that discipline should be maintained in the home, cannot logically be applied, for when he is guilty of such acts he forfeits his parental authority and privileges, including his immunity from suit.... Justice demands that a minor child shall have a right of action against a parent for injuries resulting from cruel and inhuman treatment or for malicious and wanton wrongs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 67-68, 77 A.2d at 926.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">Renko contends that since this Court has already permitted children to maintain actions against their parents for acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>occurring after the child reaches the age of majority, <em>see Waltzinger v. Birsner, </em>212 Md. 107, 128 A.2d 617 (1957), we should take the logical step of allowing otherwise adult children to sue their parents for wrongful acts that occur during minority. We see no such logic. In fact, Renko\u2019s proffered solution to her particular dilemma would result in a <em>de facto </em>abrogation of the parent-child immunity doctrine in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Maryland Code (1995 Repl.Vol, 1996 Supp.), \u00a7 5-201<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> of the Courts <em>&amp; </em>Judicial Proceedings Article permits minors to bring tort actions for injuries sustained in minority at the hands of another within three years after reaching the age of majority. Thus, an injured minor child could simply wait until reaching the age of majority before initiating a suit that is otherwise barred in his or her infancy. In that circumstance, the parent-child immunity doctrine would serve not as a bar to actions between parent and child, but rather as an obstacle easily overcome with the passage of time. The looming specter of a lawsuit is as surely detrimental to family peace and harmony and parental authority as is the actual suit itself. Given this Court\u2019s long commitment to the parent-child immunity doctrine, we refuse to create an exception that would effectively negate the rule and open courthouse doors to every conceivable dispute between parent and child. <em>See Warren, </em>336 Md. at 626, 650 A.2d at 256. Indeed, the rule was fashioned to prevent just that. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">b.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Renko alternatively contends that \u201cwith mandatory automobile insurance creating universal coverage for auto torts, there can be no rational objection to recovery by an emancipated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>child in\u201d the case <em>sub judice. </em>Maryland Code (1992, 1996 Supp.), \u00a7 17-103 of the Transportation Article and Md.Code (1957, 1994 Repl.Vol., 1995 Supp.), Art. 48A, \u00a7\u00a7 539, 540, 541 respectively require Maryland drivers to procure, and Maryland insurers to provide, certain minimum liability insurance coverage for personal injury and property damage caused by automobile accidents resulting from the primary negligence of the insured. <em>See National Grange Mut. Ins. Co. v. Pinkney, </em>284 Md. 694, 704, 399 A.2d 877, 882 (1979). Included within these statutes are uninsured motorist provisions that enable innocent victims of automobile accidents to recover from their own insurers in the event that the negligent driver is without insurance. Art. 48, \u00a7 541; <em>see also Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Webb, </em>291 Md. 721, 737, 436 A.2d 465, 474-75 (1981). It is these statutes upon which Renko relies.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">We recognized in <em>Warren and Frye, supra, </em>that an overwhelming majority of jurisdictions have abrogated the parent-child immunity doctrine in whole or in part. <em>See Warren, </em>336 Md. at 627 n. 2, 650 A.2d at 257 n. 2; <em>Frye, </em>305 Md. at 562-54, 505 A.2d at 836-37. For a discussion of those cases, see Romualdo P. Eclavea, Annotation, <em>Liability of Parent for Injury to Unemancipated Child Caused by Parent\u2019s Negligence\u2014Modern Cases, </em>6 A.L.R.4th 1066 (1981, 1996 Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">At the time we issued the <em>Warren </em>opinion, \u201c[o]nly eight states, including Maryland, continue[d] to adhere to the doctrine of parent-child immunity without exception for motor torts.\u201d 336 Md. at 621 n. 1, 650 A.2d at 254 n. 1. Those same jurisdictions continue to stand their ground.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">Other jurisdictions, however, have found persuasive arguments calling for the abolition of the parent-child immunity doctrine in motor tort cases. The seminal decision in this area <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>is <em>Sorensen v. Sorensen, </em>369 Mass. 350, 339 N.E.2d 907 (1975). There, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-5\">\u201cIn dealing with an automobile accident in which two passengers, one an unemancipated minor child of the defendant driver and the other a minor who had no familial relationship to the defendant driver, are injured, it would be incongruous to permit recovery against a parent and the parent\u2019s insurance company by the unrelated child but to deny recovery to the parent\u2019s child when culpability is admitted or established.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 360, 339 N.E.2d at 913. Noting the basis of the parent-child immunity doctrine, the court commented that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-7\">\u201c[t]he primary disruption to harmonious filial relations is not the lawsuit brought for damages after the injury but the injury itself, resulting from the misconduct of a parent. <em>Falco v. Pados, </em>444 Pa. 372, 380, 282 A.2d 351[, 355] (1971). When the wrong has been committed, the harm to the basic fabric of the family has already been done and the source of rancor and discord already introduced into family relations. <em>Tamashiro v. De Gama, </em>51 Haw. 74, 78, 450 P.2d 998[, 1001] (1969). <em>Balts v. Balts, </em>273 Minn. 419, 429, 142 N.W.2d 66[, 73] (1966). It can hardly aid family reconciliation to deny the injured child access to the courts and, through them, to any liability insurance which the family might maintain.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 360, 339 N.E.2d at 913.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">Considering the same issue, the Supreme Court of Delaware concluded, that with the almost universal existence of motor vehicle liability insurance,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-10\">\u201cthe domestic tranquility argument is, at best, hollow. Liability insurance impersonalizes the suit and negates the possible disruption of family harmony by easing the financial repercussions of the accident. In short \u2018when insurance is involved, the action between parent and child is not truly adversary; both parties seek recovery from the insurance carrier to create a fund for the child\u2019s medical care and support without depleting the family\u2019s other assets.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number><em>Williams v. Williams, </em>369 A.2d 669, 672 (Del.l976)(citing <em>Sorensen, </em>369 Mass, at 362-63, 339 N.E.2d at 914); <em>see also Schneider v. Coe, </em>405 A.2d 682 (Del.l979)(afBrming abrogation of parent-child immunity in auto tort cases where insurance coverage exists). Stated otherwise, \u201cdomestic peace and harmony may be more threatened by denying the cause of action than by permitting one, especially where there is insurance.\u201d <em>Glaskox v. Glaskox, </em>614 So.2d 906, 911 (Miss.1992). Thus, the argument goes, abrogating parent-child immunity where automobile liability insurance exists furthers the objectives of the rule by relieving the family of the financial burden of an adverse judgment while at the same time providing a means of recovery for the injured child. Numerous other jurisdictions concur in this view.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">The Delaware court added that the \u201cdomestic-tranquility justification\u201d also lacked merit in light of the fact that other courts have permitted various types of intrafamilial litigation, including, <em>inter alia, </em>suits between siblings. <em>Williams, </em>369 A.2d at 672 (citing <em>Midkiff v. Midkiff, </em>201 Va. 829, 113 S.E.2d 875 (1960))(suit brought by a minor against his unemancipated brother for injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident); <em>see also Smith v. Kauffman, </em>212 Va. 181, 185, 183 S.E.2d 190, 194 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>(1971)(parent-child immunity anachronistic when applied to automobile accident litigation).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">The fraud-collusion justification for the parent-child immunity doctrine too has suffered its critics, among them, the Mississippi Supreme Court\u2014the birthplace of the parent-child immunity doctrine. <em>See Hewlett v. George, </em>68 Miss. 703, 9 So. 885 (1891). In <em>Glaskox, supra, </em>the court majority observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-6\">\u201c \u2018[t]he possibility of collusion exists to a certain extent in any case. Every day we depend on juries and trial judges to sift evidence in order to determine the facts and arrive at proper verdicts. Experience has shown that the courts are quite adequate for this task. In litigation between parent and child, judges and juries would naturally be mindful of the relationship and would be even more on the alert for improper conduct.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">614 So.2d at 912 (quoting <em>Nocktonick v. Nocktonick, </em>227 Kan. 758, 768-69, 611 P.2d 135, 142 (1980)). In a similar vein, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-8\">\u201cIn the last analysis it is much to be preferred that we depend upon the efficacy of the judicial process to ferret out the meritorious from the fraudulent rather than using a broad broom to sweep away a class of claims, a number of which are admittedly meritorious.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-9\"><em>Falco v. Pados, supra, </em>444 Pa. at 381, 282 A.2d at 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">Recognizing the continuing need to protect parental authority and family harmony, some jurisdictions have attempted to limit immunity to negligent conduct arising out of an \u201cexercise of parental authority ... [or] an exercise of ordinary parental discretion with respect to the provision of food, clothing, housing, medical and dental services, and other care.\u201d <em>Goller v. White, </em>20 Wis.2d 402, 413, 122 N.W.2d 193, 198 (1963); see <em>also Jilani v. Jilani, </em>767 S.W.2d 671, 672 (Tex.1988); <em>Plumley v. Klein, </em>388 Mich. 1, 9, 199 N.W.2d 169, 172-73 (1972); <em>Rigdon v. Rigdon, </em>465 S.W.2d 921, 923 (Ky.1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-11\">California and New York have adopted their own unique brands of parent-child immunity. California courts apply a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>\u201creasonable parent\u201d standard to determine the viability of tort actions between parent and child. <em>Gibson v. Gibson, </em>3 Cal.3d 914, 921, 92 Cal.Rptr. 288, 293, 479 P.2d 648, 653 (1971). New York, on the other hand, seems to permit all such actions, except those arising out of a parent\u2019s failure to properly supervise the child. Under New York law, parents owe no legal duty to their children to supervise them properly. <em>Holodook v. Spencer, </em>36 N.Y.2d 35, 51, 364 N.Y.S.2d 859, 870-72, 324 N.E.2d 338, 346 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Despite the majority trend, even those most critical of the rule must acknowledge that its abrogation is not a panacea. At least with respect to motor tort cases, the argument for abrogation suffers from several infirmities.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">In a normal case, liability insurance becomes relevant only <em>after </em>an insured\u2019s liability is fixed in an appropriate legal proceeding. Yet as between parent and child, it becomes the <em>raison d\u2019etre </em>of the suit. Thus, unlike a true adversarial proceeding, an insurer is forced into the unenviable position of attempting to defend a suit that its insured has every incentive to lose.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">This, of course, inevitably leads the trier of fact to realize that the suit targets not the parent or child (to whom immunity would otherwise attach) but rather the insurance company. Maryland follows the majority rule that evidence of liability insurance on the part of a defendant is generally inadmissible. <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Atwood, </em>319 Md. 247, 258, 572 A.2d 154 (1990); <em>see also Allstate Ins. Co. v. Miller, </em>315 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>Md. 182, 191, 553 A.2d 1268, 1272 (1989); <em>Jones v. Federal Paper Bd. Co., </em>252 Md. 475, 494-95, 250 A.2d 653, 664 (1969); <em>Snowhite v. State, </em>243 Md. 291, 301, 221 A.2d 342 (1966); <em>Takoma Park Bank v. Abbott, </em>179 Md. 249, <em>263, 19 </em>A.2d 169, <em>cert. denied, </em>314 U.S. 672, 62 S.Ct. 134, 86 L.Ed. 538 (1941). This policy stems from the fact that the matter of insurance is irrelevant to the issue of a defendant\u2019s liability and evidence of that irrelevant fact is highly prejudicial to the defendant\u2019s case. <em>Morris v. Weddington, </em>320 Md. 674, 680, 579 A.2d 762, 765 (1990)(quoting <em>Atwood, supra, </em>319 Md. at 258, 572 A.2d at 159). Yet the insurance justification for abrogation of the parent-child immunity doctrine in motor tort cases ignores the practical considerations associated with this policy. Indeed, at least one commentator has acknowledged that \u201c[a]n insurance underwriter may experience ... problems in defending an intra-family tort claim.\u201d <em>See </em>Comment, <em>Parent Child Immunity: Time for Maryland to Abrogate an Anachronism, </em>11 U.Balt.L.Rev. 435, 464-65 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">It is a common experience in many courts that a jury\u2019s generosity is proportional to the amount of available insurance. Although it has been suggested that informing juries prior to deliberations that unjustly high awards affect insurance rates universally, <em>see id. </em>at 466, that warning instructs jurors to consider cautiously an issue they ought not to consider at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Also, the insurance-based argument in favor of abrogation fails to assess the consequences of an award that exceeds available coverage.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Is the child then to proceed against the assets of the family? If that is so, it is hard to believe that the rancor and discord the insurance is said to obviate would not find its way back into the mix. While denying an \u201cinjured child access to the courts, and through them any liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>insurance the family ... maintains] [might not] aid family reconciliation,\u201d <em>see Sorensen, supra, </em>369 Mass, at 360, 339 N.E.2d at 913, the same can be said of handing an injured child a large damage award and allowing him or her to ravage a family through further collection proceedings. Either way, the family suffers. And even assuming that a child\u2019s recovery is limited to the amount of available insurance, the argument that his or her recovery should be no different than that of any person negligently injured once again takes center stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Further, many families carry medical insurance that would necessarily compensate the injured child, and therefore, his or her family, for injury-related expenses. Allowing children then to proceed to court and recover for pain and suffering and other noneconomic damages, which often far exceed medical costs, might potentially saddle a family with a judgment that they can ill-afford to pay because, as previously indicated, it exceeds available insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Finally, Justice Lee of the Supreme Court of Mississippi cogently observed that many of the arguments against parent-child immunity</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-7\">\u201cimpl[y] that a child injured by the negligence of a parent is adrift in our current system with no rights of all____ [T]ort law cannot erase physical injuries or soothe human suffering. It can only insure that injured parties are compensated. [P]arents already have the legal responsibility of providing care for their children.... A policy of immunity in no way detracts from the seriousness of the issue of parental neglect or other forms of abuse. The proper remedy for these injuries, however, is eternal vigilance on the part of individuals and government agencies and vigorous enforcement of criminal statutes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-10\"><em>Glaskox, supra, </em>614 So.2d at 916 (Lee J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-11\">In light of the foregoing observations and on balance, we remain convinced that the parent-child immunity rule \u201cis still in the best interests of both children and parents to retain ... [and that] [abrogating immunity would result only in further discord within the family and would interfere -with the exercise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>of parental discretion in raising and disciplining children.\u201d <em>Warren, </em>336 Md. at 626, 650 A.2d at 255.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">c.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Renko lastly contends that the parent-child immunity doctrine as applied in motor vehicle torts is \u201cirrational and arbitrary and violates Articles 19[ <footnotemark>16</footnotemark>] and 24[ <footnotemark>17</footnotemark>] of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, and the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the [Fourteenth Amendment to the] United States Constitution.[<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>]\u201d We find these assertions to be meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">With respect to her contention that denying a minor child access to the courts for injuries sustained at the hands of a negligent parent violates the injured child\u2019s due process rights, <em>Johnson v. Maryland State Police, </em>331 Md. 285, 628 A.2d 162 (1993) is dispositive. In <em>Johnson, </em>we considered the constitutional validity of an administrative claim requirement under the Maryland Tort Claims Act. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1995 Repl.Vol., 1996 Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 12-101, <em>et seq. </em>of the State Government Article. In so doing, we could not \u201cagree [with the Petitioner\u2019s assertion] that there is a constitutionally protected vested property right in a particular cause of action.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>331 Md. at 298-99, 628 A.2d at 168; <em>see also Murphy v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number><em>Edmonds, </em>325 Md. 342, 362-63, 601 A.2d 102, 112 (1992). Renko therefore states no cognizable claim under either Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights or the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>See Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 569-70, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 2705, 33 L.Ed.2d 548, 556-57 (1972)(in order to assert a due process claim, individual must have property or liberty interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment); <em>see also Livingston v. State, </em>317 Md. 408, 410, 564 A.2d 414, 415-16 (1989); <em>Pitsenberger v. Pitsenberger, </em>287 Md. 20, 27, 410 A.2d 1052, 1056 (1980)(Art. 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights construed <em>in pari materia </em>with Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution); <em>accord Oursler v. Tawes, </em>178 Md. 471, 483, 13 A.2d 763, 768 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Renko\u2019s equal protection claim suffers a similar analysis. Although Article 24 does not contain an express equal protection clause, the concept of equal protection nevertheless is embodied in the Article. <em>See State Admin. Bd. of Election Laws v. Board of Supervisors, </em>342 Md. 586, 595 n. 6, 679 A.2d 96, 100 n. 6 (1996); <em>Gilchrist v. State, </em>340 Md. 606, 623 n. 3, 667 A.2d 876, 884 n. 3 (1995); <em>Ashton v. Brown, </em>339 Md. 70, 101 n. 17, 660 A.2d 447, 462 n. 17 (1995); <em>Verzi v. Baltimore County, </em>333 Md. 411, 417, 635 A.2d 967, 969-970 (1994). In that regard, federal equal protection decisions are illustrative. <em>Tyler v. State, </em>330 Md. 261, 264-65, 623 A.2d 648, 650 (1993). Even so, we have found neither State nor federal authority supportive of Renko\u2019s position, and she cites none.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Renko maintains that the common law parent-child immunity doctrine impermissibly discriminates against her and others similarly situated based upon age and familial status. Neither, however, is a \u201csuspect class\u201d under traditional equal protection jurisprudence.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>Massachusetts Bd. of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number><em>Retirement v. Murgia, </em>427 U.S. 307, 312, 96 S.Ct. 2562, 2566, 49 L.Ed.2d 520, 524-25 (1976); <em>accord In re Trader, </em>272 Md. 364, 397, 325 A.2d 398, 415-16 (1974)(age). <em>See also Lyng v.

Thus, even assuming, without deciding, that the common law doctrine of parent-child immunity is subject to constitutional attack, we must determine if the classifications of which Renko complains bear any reasonable or rational relation to the objectives of the rule. <em>See Kirsch v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>331 Md. 89, 104, 626 A.2d 372, 379 (1993). Under this analysis, the parent-child immunity doctrine</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-5\">\u201ccan be invalidated only if the classification is without any reasonable basis and is purely arbitrary. Further, a classification having some reasonable basis need not be made with mathematical nicety and may result in some inequality. If any state of facts reasonably can be conceived that would sustain the clarification, the existence of that state of facts at the time the law was [adopted] must be assumed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AzR\"><em>Whiting-Turner Contract. Co. v. Coupard, </em>304 Md. 340, 352, 499 A.2d 178, 185 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">For the reasons articulated in Part II of this opinion and exhaustively explained in <em>Warren </em>and <em>Frye, supra, </em>we conclude that the parent-child immunity doctrine survives the rational basis standard of review. We continue to believe that the doctrine well serves the citizens of this State by insulating families from the vagaries and rancorous effects of tort litigation. That it may occasion undesirable consequences is quite irrelevant. \u201c \u2018To be able to find fault with a law is not to demonstrate its invalidity. It may seem unjust and oppressive, yet be free from judicial interference. The problems of government are practical ones and may justify, if they do not require, rougk accommodations, illogical, it may be, and unscientific.\u2019 \u201d <em>in re Trader, supra, </em>272 Md. at 399, 325 A.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>416-17 (quoting <em>Metropolis Theatre Co. v.

[,] that access is subject to reasonable regulation.\u201d <em>Edmonds, supra, </em>325 Md. at 365, 601 A.2d at 113. In light of the fact that parents are charged with the \u201csupport, care, nurture, and welfare\u201d of their children, <em>see </em>n.8, <em>supra, </em>Maryland law has long recognized, save for extraordinary circumstances, that the parent-child immunity doctrine is a reasonable and well-founded limitation upon a child\u2019s access to our courts, serving to protect one of the most fundamental and sacred units in our society.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT AFFIRMED, WITH COSTS.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b511-13\">.
