On June 27, 1997, the State filed a response in opposition to the appellant\u2019s motion, and counsel for the appellant filed a letter and an affidavit signed by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">The Court has carefully considered the motion, the response, the letter of appellant\u2019s counsel, and the affidavit dated June 25,1997, in which the appellant stated, <em>inter alia, </em>that he \u201c... waive[s] any right that I may have to challenge the State\u2019s authority to carry out an execution by lethal injection rather than lethal gas during the five day period beginning Monday, June 30, 1997. I also waive any other right I have to challenge the method of execution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">Now therefore, pursuant to the provisions of Maryland Rule 8~604(e) that \u201cthe Court may enter an appropriate judgment directly,\u201d it is this 27th day of June, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-12\">ORDERED, by the Court of Appeals of Maryland, that the warrant of execution signed on May 15, 1997, by the Hon. Joseph H.H. Kaplan, Administrative Judge of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, is hereby modified to substitute for the words \u201clethal gas,\u201d in the last paragraph of page 2, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>words \u201clethal injection,\u201d and, as so modified, the warrant of execution dated May 15,1997, shall be fully effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Mandate to issue forthwith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
