The dismissed complaint had been filed 26 months after plaintiffs\u2019 accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">Plaintiff Ryszard Rutkowski was injured when his right hand was caught in an unguarded rolling mill, resulting in severe permanent injuries. Plaintiffs initially had filed a timely complaint naming both specific and \u201cJohn Doe\u201d defendants as being \u201cthe designers of, manufacturer of, seller of, distributor of, repairer of, modifier and/or renovator of, or ... otherwise responsible for\u201d the machine that injured plaintiff Ryszard Rutkowski. Defendants Liberty Mutual Insurance Company and American Motorists Insurance Company are successive workers\u2019 compensation insurers of plaintiff\u2019s employer. Plaintiff contended in the dismissed complaint that defendants\u2019 negligence in the performance of safety and engineering inspections and in the furnishing of loss control services to plaintiff\u2019s employer was a partial cause of his injury. Shortly after the filing of the new complaint, plaintiffs moved for its consolidation with the previously-filed action, but this motion was denied. Defendants thereafter were granted summary judgment as noted above, and this appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">In their appellate briefs the parties focus solely on the application of the discovery rule as authorization for the late filing of this complaint. Between the time of the filing of the briefs and oral argument, however, the Supreme Court decided <em>Viviano v. CBS, Inc., </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>538 (1986). At oral argument we discussed with counsel the issue of whether under the principles of <em>Viviano </em>the original \u201cJohn Doe\u201d designation in the parallel suit was sufficient to have covered the defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>in this action. We established a supplemental briefing schedule so that counsel could meet this issue. It appeared to us that if defendants could have been added to the timely-filed initial action, with plaintiffs\u2019 claims relating back under <em>R. </em>4:26-4 to the initial filing of that matter, the policies underlying the statute of limitations might not have justified dismissal of this parallel <em>action</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em>.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">We will approach this matter as if plaintiffs had made an application to add the insurance companies as defendants in the earlier-filed action<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>. As noted earlier, both the named and fictitious defendants were alleged to be those who had designed, manufactured, sold, distributed, repaired, modified, renovated, or were \u201cotherwise responsible\u201d for the allegedly defective machine. We cannot imagine that this quoted phrase would have indicated to even the most thorough reader that plaintiffs intended to make a claim for negligent safety inspections. In fact, plaintiffs had dealt with defendant Liberty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>Mutual Insurance Company, which allegedly performed the inspections, since before the inception of the initial action without thought on the part of either party that they were potential adversaries. Only after plaintiffs\u2019 belated discovery of the insurers\u2019 role as safety consultants did this theory of liability emerge.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\"><em>R. </em>4:26-4 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-6\">In any action, irrespective of the amount in controversy, other than an action governed by <em>R. </em>4:4-5 (affecting specific property or a res), if the defendant\u2019s true name is unknown to the plaintiff, process may issue against the defendant under a fictitious name, stating it to be fictitious and adding an appropriate description sufficient to identify him. Plaintiff shall on motion, prior to judgment, amend his complaint to state defendant\u2019s true name, such motion to be accompanied by his affidavit stating the manner in which he obtained that information. If, however, defendant acknowledges his true name by written appearance or orally in open court, the complaint may be amended without notice and affidavit. No final judgment shall be entered against a person designated by a fictitious name.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">As the Supreme Court noted in Viviano, in an industrial accident</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-8\">the injured worker generally knows that he or she has been injured and that the injury is attributable to the act of another. Consequently, it behooves the worker to consult counsel promptly. It then becomes incumbent on counsel to investigate the matter, retain experts if required, and institute suit when the facts suggest a claim is well-founded. If counsel is uncertain about the identity of the culpable party, he or she may resort to the fictitious-name procedure in <em>R. </em>4:26-4 ... [101 <em>N.J. </em>at 547-48].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">In <em>Viviano </em>the \u201cJohn Doe\u201d defendant designations were noted as the \u201cmanufacturer ... installer ... and distributor\u201d of the record press machine in which plaintiff\u2019s hand was injured. There was no express allegation \u201cagainst any component manufacturer, either by specific identification or through the fictitious-name procedure authorized by Rule 4:26-4.\u201d <em>Viviano </em>at 548. Thereafter, the <em>Viviano </em>complaint was amended six times, the intermediate amended complaints not even including the \u201cJohn Doe\u201d designations. In the sixth amended complaint, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>the \u201cJohn Doe\u201d designation was reinstated and in that complaint defendant Sybron, a component manufacturer, originally disclosed by the primary defendant two years and one month prior to the filing of the amended complaint, was first named by plaintiff. C.B.S., the primary defendant, was found, however, to have detached the timer prior to plaintiffs inspection of the machine and to have suppressed an internal memorandum inculpating the timer as a prime cause of the accident. The trial judge permitted the amendment and denied dismissal on statute of limitations grounds on the basis of the discovery rule. The Appellate Division reversed, also on discovery rule grounds, but noted that had the fictitious defendant designation been carried through in the various intermediate amended complaints, the broad designation of a \u201cJohn Doe\u201d defendant as the \u201cmanufacturer\u201d of the record press machine would have been sufficient to include Sybron. The dissenting judge in the Appellate Division would have found either the discovery rule or the \u201cJohn Doe\u201d practice sufficient to have preserved plaintiffs claim against Sybron.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">The Supreme Court distinguished the policy considerations separating on one hand the discovery rule deferring the accrual of the cause of action and on the other the fictitious defendant practice, which satisfies the statute by permitting the relation back of an amendment identifying the responsible party. Prior to <em>Viviano, </em>in <em>Farrell v. Votator Div. of Chemetron Corp., </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>111, 120-123 (1973), the Supreme Court had permitted the later identification of a fictitious defendant alleged to have been the assembler, supplier, or seller of the machine causing plaintiffs injuries. There the missing defendant was correctly identified as to the capacity in which it had been sued. In <em>Viviano, </em>however, the court permitted specific language of the complaint to be broadly construed to allege a cause of action against the manufacturer of a defective component notwithstanding the lack of any direct allegation against a component manufacturer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6f\">In more general language, the complaint alleged further: \u2018Defendant, JOHN DOE COMPANY, negligently, carelessly and recklessly designed, constructed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>manufactured and tested the Record Press Machine purchased and used by the Columbia Broadcasting System, Columbia Records Division.\u2019 Construing the complaint liberally in the interest of justice, as Rule 4:5-7 mandates, we find that it alleges a cause of action against the manufacturer of a defective component, such as the timer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-4\">We recognize that the designation of the fictitious defendant in the complaint could have been more precisely drawn to set forth that it also applied to the manufacturer of any components of the press____ <em>[Viviano, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>at 553-54.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">Similarly, in the case before us there had been no specific designation of the basis of the missing defendant\u2019s responsibility. There was only general language indicating that the basis might go beyond the specific capacities alleged. Such language would have put no insurer or other safety inspector on notice of the claim alleged. But notice is, in any event, a fiction in a case such as <em>Viviano </em>or the one before us.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Except in the most unusual case, the potential defendant has no occasion to be aware of the pendency of the action. Especially in industrial accident cases, the constraints of discovery are such that the two year statute of limitations is often insufficient. So that there will be some reasonable repose to this litigation, the Supreme Court has determined that the complaint must be filed within the statutory period, but, with a fictitious defendant designation in the complaint, discovery may yield not just the true name of the unknown defendant, but also some related bases of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">We are faced, however, with the provision in <em>R. </em>4:26-4 requiring the fictitious name designation to have appended to it \u201can appropriate description sufficient to identify\u201d the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>ant. Even applying the liberal construction of <em>Viviano, </em>we are constrained to say that the designation here applied, one \u201cotherwise responsible,\u201d was insufficient to satisfy this provision. <em>Viviano </em>makes it clear that <em>R. </em>4:26-4 may be relaxed where there is an imprecise but similar allegation against the excluded defendant as to the capacity in which it was later alleged to be responsible. In <em>Viviano, </em>the court relaxed the designation requirement because a manufacturer of a component was sufficiently akin to the manufacturer of the machine itself. 101 <em>N.J. </em>at 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">The court\u2019s direction as to future designation of \u201cJohn Doe\u201d defendants supports the view that there must be at least a general designation of the fictitious defendant.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-7\">For the future, however, a plaintiff who is injured in an industrial accident should at least name as fictitious parties, if their true identities are unknown, those entities that designed, manufactured, and maintained the subject machine and its component parts. Furthermore, the plaintiff should allege in the body of the complaint, in general terms if necessary, his or her causes of action against those entities. <em>(Id. </em>at 555).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s allegations here cannot be so construed. To permit such a general description of the fictitious defendant as the one before us (one \u201cotherwise responsible\u201d), would emasculate even our liberal pleading rules. <em>See R. </em>4:5-2. A plaintiff could file a complaint on the last day before the statute of limitations would run alleging merely that he was injured in a particular situation and that \u201cJohn Doe(s) were negligent and responsible for plaintiff\u2019s loss.\u201d He later could amend to include both the defendants\u2019 names and the bases of responsibility. We realize that with a long enough list of bases for liability, the \u201cJohn Doe\u201d practice can now approximate this result, but we cannot permit the complete frustration of the principle that a complaint must generally state the facts showing that the pleader is entitled to relief. <em>Spring Motors Distributor, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., </em>191 <em>N.J.Super. </em>22, 29-30 (App.Div.1983), aff\u2019d in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>part and rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, 98 <em>N.J. </em>555 (1985).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> .</p>\n<p id=\"Am_\">The summary judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b175-7\">Although plaintiffs\u2019 counsel at oral argument explained that his practice was to file independent actions against new defendants and then move to consolidate, we suggest that the better practice is to file amended complaints, with leave of court where necessary, thus avoiding precisely the procedural tangle before this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b175-8\">We dismiss out of hand the discovery rule argument raised by plaintiffs. From the date of the accident plaintiffs knew the extent of the injuries and the instrumentality causing the loss and could have analyzed the various legal theories upon which responsible entities could have been joined. The legal theory upon which defendants might have been held liable was discussed in detail in <em>Jackson v. N.J. Manufacturers Co., </em>166 <em>N.J.Super. </em>448, 456-460 (App. Div.), certif. den. 82 <em>N.J. </em>330 (1979). Even if this theory were more arcane, \"[tjhere is no suggestion in any of the leading cases in this area that accrual of the cause of action is postponed until plaintiff learns or should learn the state of the law positing a right of recovery upon the facts already known to or reasonably knowable by the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Burd v. N.J. Telephone Co., </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>284, 291-92 (1978). <em>See also Viviano v. CBS, Inc., supra, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>at 546-47. There was nothing withheld or hidden from plaintiffs; they merely did not inquire into the existence of safety reports until after the statute of limitations had run. Therefore by the exercise of reasonable diligence plaintiffs could have discovered the alleged negligence of the insurers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b176-10\">Federal practice in New Jersey is to the contrary. <em>See Britt v. Arvanitis, </em>590 F.2d 57 (3rd Cir.1978), in which our \"John Doe\u201d practice and relation back of amendments was criticized and found not binding upon the federal courts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b178-9\">Plaintiffs have asserted that no hardship would be imposed upon the insurers if this claim is allowed. Liberty Mutual has been in the case since its inception as the workers\u2019 compensation carrier paying for plaintiff\u2019s medical expenses, and was, we assume, fully familiar with its own safety reports to the employer. But, as noted in <em>Viviano, </em>lack of prejudice is not a factor in the application of <em>R. </em>4:26-4, as it is in <em>R. </em>4:9-3 governing the relation back of amendments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b180-9\">Without a designation of a defendant by name or a description of a fictitious defendant at least showing the capacity in which the missing party is sued, <em>R. </em>4:5-2 cannot be satisfied. <em>See abo </em>discussion in Schnitzer and Wildstein, <em>N.J. Rules Service, </em>(1954), annotation to <em>R.R. </em>4:8-1, \u00a7 7 at AIV-140-141, and 4-27-61 supplement at 74-76. Where a party is properly designated a subsequent motion for a more definite statement or answer to interrogatories can supplement information and apprise a defendant of the full particulars of a claim. But without even a designation of the manner in which a \"John Doe\u201d may be responsible, no adequate claim can be said to have been made. This analysis is consistent with the requirement in <em>R. </em>4:26-4 that in a \"John Doe\u201d pleading, there must be \"an appropriate description sufficient to identify\u201d the fictitious defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
