Plaintiff appeals from the Law Division judge\u2019s order granting summary judgment and dismissing the complaint. We reaffirm the principle expressed by us in <em>Biasi v. Allstate Ins. Co. </em>104 <em>N.J.Super. </em>155 (App.Div.1969), certif. den. 53 <em>N.J. </em>511 (1969), that the personal injury claimant may not sue the carrier to recover the excess verdict beyond the coverage without an assignment of the claim from the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-12\">On January 1, 1982 plaintiff, Peggy Anne Murray, was involved in a motor vehicle accident when her car collided with a motor vehicle owned by William B. Olsen and operated by Thomas W. Olsen. As a result, plaintiff instituted a suit for personal injuries. At the time of the accident defendant Allstate had in effect a policy of insurance issued to William B. Olsen which covered the operation of the vehicle by Thomas W. Olsen. In accordance with the terms of the policy, Allstate tendered a defense to both Olsens.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>On June 14, 1984 a jury trial resulted in a verdict in favor of plaintiff and against Thomas W. Olsen only in the amount of $75,000. Allstate undertook to prosecute an appeal of that result on behalf of its insured. This court heard numerous motions addressed to that appeal of the tort action and ultimately entered an order which provided that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-5\">A stay of the judgment pending appeal is granted conditioned upon appellant\u2019s posting a supersedeas bond in the sum of $103,880. Plaintiff shall not be entitled to levy, execute or otherwise pursue the bond for any sums over and above the contractual obligation of the Allstate Insurance Company under appellant\u2019s automobile liability insurance policy unless and until Allstate\u2019s liability for an excess judgment is established in a \u201cbad faith\u201d suit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Eventually defendant did file the bond required and the appeal proceeded. Ultimately this court affirmed the jury\u2019s verdict for $75,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">During the pendency of the appeal of the tort action, plaintiff filed the instant suit against Allstate, its adjuster, Naughton, and several unidentified employees of Allstate identified as John Does. In that complaint, plaintiff essentially asserted that Allstate and its employees had \u201cfailed to negotiate [a settlement] in good faith on behalf of Thomas W. Olsen\u201d thus entitling plaintiff to a judgment for the entire amount of the jury\u2019s verdict in the tort action plus \u201ccosts of suit and attorneys fees.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">Defendants brought a motion for summary judgment contending that they were entitled to a dismissal because plaintiff had not secured from Allstate\u2019s insured, Thomas W. Olsen, a written assignment to prosecute the claim. Plaintiff opposed the motion asserting a right to bring the action independent of any assignment and also submitted an affidavit by Thomas W. Olsen\u2019s personal attorney in which he said that his client had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>indicated a willingness to provide such an assignment. However, Olsen has since left the State and cannot be located. No assignment has been obtained. Following oral argument, the Law Division judge granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, relying upon this court\u2019s decision in <em>Biasi v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>104 <em>N.J.Super. </em>155 (App.Div.1969), certif. den. 53 <em>N.J. </em>511 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Plaintiff here asserts that the trial court erred because,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-6\">Point I .. .[T]he court erred when it refused to abide the appellate division\u2019s prior ruling on this matter in holding that the bad faith suit could be instituted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-7\">Point II The lower court erred when it held that plaintiff could not proceed in this matter unless it had a written assignment from the insured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-8\">Point III.[T]he court erred when it dismissed the plaintiffs complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">Plaintiff contends that the entry of the interlocutory order of this court entered in the appeal of the tort action conclusively established her right to \u201cfile a bad faith suit against the defendant, Allstate, even though an assignment of rights had not been made.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-11\">Aside from the fact that the language of the order simply does not support her conclusion, the law is not supportive of her position. There was no final order or judgment entered upon which this court acted in ruling on the procedural requirements of that appeal. <em>Credit Bureau Collection Agency v. Lind, </em>71 <em>N.J.Super. </em>326, 328 (App.Div.1961). The merits of plaintiff\u2019s right to prosecute the bad faith suit simply was not part of that record and was not properly before this court for decision at that time. <em>Matter of Kovalsky, </em>195 <em>N.J.Super. </em>91, 99 (App.Div.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b199-13\">Plaintiff further asserts that her suit against defendants was dismissed improperly because she has a right to bring such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>suit as a third-party beneficiary, that the facts in <em>Biasi </em>are distinguishable and thus not apposite or controlling and further, that insofar as <em>Biasi </em>may be read to require a written assignment as a condition precedent, it does not correctly state the law in this area. (We note that plaintiff\u2019s complaint herein does not contain any allegation of a right as a third-party beneficiary).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">In <em>Biasi v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>104 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 156-157, plaintiff won a judgment in an automobile accident case against Allstate\u2019s insured which exceeded the policy limits. Since the insured was unable to satisfy the amount of the judgment, plaintiff\u2019s attorneys suggested that the insured sue Allstate and also sent the insured an assignment of rights which would permit plaintiff to do so. The insured refused and plaintiff instituted suit against the insurance company. Allstate moved for summary judgment and offered an affidavit by its insured specifically indicating her complete satisfaction with Allstate\u2019s handling of her case and asserting, further, that she did not desire to sue Allstate nor did she want plaintiff to do so. In affirming the trial court\u2019s grant of that summary judgment the court observed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-5\">Plaintiff contends that a party injured in an automobile accident who recovers a judgment against another motorist, who caused the injury, for a sum in excess of the liability policy limits of defendant motorist\u2019s insurance coverage can, without holding an assignment from the insured, bring an action against the insurance company for breach of the latter\u2019s obligation to act in good faith in reference to negotiation of settlement of the claim prior to judgment. Plaintiff bottoms its contention upon the argument that plaintiff has a common law right to succeed to any claim arising out of the policy which the assured could prosecute against the insurance company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-6\">********</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-7\">The right of the assured to recover against the insurer for its failure to exercise good faith in settling a claim within the limits of a liability policy, as was adjudicated in <em>Bowers v. Camden Fire Ins. Ass\u2019n, </em>51 <em>N.J. </em>62 (1968), is predicated upon the potential damage to the <em>assured </em>in being subjected to a judgment in excess of her policy limits and the consequent subjection of her assets to the satisfaction of such judgment. The damage is peculiarly to the assured by reason of breach of an implied condition of the policy contract. The injured third party is a stranger in that sense. Moreover, public policy does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>mandate that the injured party in the accident should be deemed the intended beneficiary of the company\u2019s contractual duty to its policyholder to act in good faith regarding settlement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-6\">Nor does <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-2 give the injured party such a right. It merely provides that the bankruptcy <em>or </em>insolvency of the assured against whom an injured party has recovered a judgment shall not release the insurance carrier and, in such an event, the injured party may file an action directly against the carrier under the terms of the policy for the amount of the judgment but \u201cnot exceeding the amount of the policy.\u201d This statute is not applicable to the present situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-7\">Under the circumstances here present we conclude that plaintiff does not have a legal cause of action against Allstate or the status to maintain the present suit. Therefore we find that the trial court properly entered summary judgment against her. See <em>Duncan v. Lumbermen's Mutual Casualty Co., </em>91 <em>N.H. </em>349, 23 A.2d 325 (Sup.Ct.1941); <em>Wessing v. American Indemnity Co. of Galveston, </em>127 <em>F. Supp. </em>775 (D.C.W.D.Mo.1955); <em>Chittick v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co., </em>170 <em>F.Supp. </em>276 (D.C.Del.1958); <em>Murray v. Mossman, </em>56 <em>Wash.2d </em>909, 355 P.2d 985 (Sup.Ct.1960); <em>Ammerman v. Farmers Insurance Exchange, </em>19 <em>Utah </em>2d 261, 430 P.2d 576 (Sup.Ct.1967). See also, Keeton, \u201cLiability Insurance and Responsibility For Settlement,\u201d 67 <em>Harv.L. Rev. </em>1136, 1176 (1954).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-8\"><em>Atlantic City v. American Casualty Insurance Co., </em>254 <em>F.Supp. </em>396 (D.C.N.J.1966), relied upon by plaintiff is inapposite. In that case plaintiff did possess a partial assignment from the assured (Atlantic City) of its claim against the insurance carrier for the carrier\u2019s unreasonable refusal to settle. Thus, any discussion therein by the court as to the rights of the injured party to sue the insurance company without an assignment was dictum.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">Unlike <em>Biasi, </em>here Olsen has not affirmatively indicated his approval of the manner in which Allstate had handled plaintiff\u2019s claim against him. (Indeed, plaintiff argues that there is evidence to indicate his express desire to do otherwise. But the attorney\u2019s affidavit is not competent evidence to support this conclusion. 12.1:6-6). However, the <em>Biasi </em>court clearly held that absent the insured\u2019s express consent, an injured judgment creditor may not maintain an excess suit against an insurance carrier under any of the theories advanced by plaintiff here. Whether the rationale be that of third-party beneficiary, a right accorded by statute, some judicially-fashioned common-law remedy or otherwise, a <em>sine qua non </em>is that the insured be dissatisfied and expressly and affirmatively take steps to prosecute such a claim or, by assignment, authorize another person to do so. <em>Bourget v. Government Employees </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number><em>Ins. Co., </em>456 <em>F.</em>2d 282 (2nd Cir.1972); Annotation, \u201cRight of Injured Person Recovering Excess Judgment Against Insured to Maintain Action Against Liability Insurer For Wrongful Failure to Settle Claim,\u201d 63 <em>A.L.R.3d </em>677 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Plaintiff directs our attention to the case of <em>Thompson v. Commercial Union Ins. Co. of New York, </em>250 <em>So.2d </em>259 (Fla.1971), in which the Supreme Court of Florida stands alone in upholding plaintiffs position here. We simply do not agree that its rationale is more persuasive than that elucidated by this court in <em>Biasi. </em>The extent of contractual duties are contained within the terms of the insurance policy including the monetary limits. Any right of action for recovery in excess of those limits, caused by a breach of that contract, inures only to the benefit of the primary parties to the contract and not to any stranger to that contract. <em>Bourget, supra; see Turgeon v. Shelby Mut. Plate Glass &amp; Cas. Co., </em>112 <em>F.Supp. </em>355 (D.Conn. 1953). To hold otherwise would be to expose an insurer to suit in every instance where the judgment ultimately exceeds the policy limits notwithstanding the satisfaction of the insured that the insurer has fully performed its contractual duties. <em>Cf. Rova Farms Resort v. Investors Ins. Co., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474 (1974). Such a rule would further unfairly restrict a carrier\u2019s ability to negotiate a settlement with a potential plaintiff without fear of reprisal through such an excess suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">While it may be argued that financially irresponsible insureds will frustrate the ability of an injured party to be fully compensated when the judgment exceeds policy limits by failing to furnish the necessary authority for institution of suit, we think that such an argument is speculative at best. For example, in <em>Biasi, </em>the execution on the judgment was returned unsatisfied, indicating that the insured was not possessed of sufficient assets to pay the excess judgment. Yet, there the insured, when faced with an offer to have the injured party pursue her carrier (presumably without expense to her) expressly indicated her satisfaction with the carrier\u2019s handling of the complaint and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>refused to sign the assignment. In this case, we should expect no less than a like informed and express determination by Olsen.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Thus we reaffirm the rationale expressed in <em>Biasi </em>by this court and affirm the dismissal of plaintiffs complaint.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b198-9\">The counts against defendant Naughton were couched in terms of his individual failure to negotiate a settlement in good faith as the company adjuster assigned and, in terms of his failure to do so, because he \"had a personal vendetta\u201d against plaintiffs law firm. However, the dismissal of these counts has not been separately treated or argued, and we assume that such a cause of action has been abandoned. R.2:6-2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b203-7\">SIMPSON, J.A.D.,</author>\n<p id=\"A65\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">I respectfully dissent from Part II of the majority\u2019s opinion in this case, relying principally as it does upon <em>Biasi v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>104 <em>N.J.Super. </em>155 (App.Div.1969), certif. den. 53 <em>N.J. </em>511 (1969), since that case is distinguishable and in my view the circumstances here present require reversal of the summary judgment dismissing plaintiff\u2019s complaint. A $75,000 judgment (plus prejudgment interest) upon a jury verdict has already been affirmed on appeal, with the unreported opinion noting that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-9\">Olsen admitted that the accident was his fault, and said in the course of direct examination by his own attorney that he received a summons for and pled guilty to careless driving.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">As to the contention that the verdict was excessive, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-11\">Nor do we consider the quantum of the verdict as shocking the judicial conscience and warranting appellate interference. <em>Baxter v. Fairmont Food Co., </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>588, 598-599 (1977).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-12\">Olsen\u2019s applicable policy limit was only $25,000. On the motion below, Allstate\u2019s counsel told the judge that $12,500 would have settled the case, although at oral argument before us he said the amount was $10,000. Since the verdict was not excessive, Allstate could have settled for 40 to 50% of the policy <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the verdict was six to seven and one half times such settlement figures.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The verdict was three times the $25,000 policy limit and it is clear that the extent of plaintiff\u2019s injuries and their causal relationship to this accident were the principal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>issues in the \u201chotly contested trial.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Whether there was a good faith effort by Allstate to settle on behalf of its insured, Olsen, is a fact question that should be decided at a plenary trial, <em>Rova Farms Resort v. Investors Ins. Co., </em>65 <em>N.J </em>474 (1974)\u2014provided that plaintiff has standing to bring this action against Allstate.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">In <em>Biasi, </em>the defendant insured refused to assign to the plaintiff her rights to recover from Allstate \u201cdamages for the judgment against [her]\u201d in excess of her policy limits and said \u201cI am completely satisfied with the way Allstate handled my case and I do not wish to sue Allstate nor do I want the Biasis to do so,\u201d 104 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 157-158. The situation in the present case is quite different. As the majority has pointed out, Olsen\u2019s personal attorney said his client had indicated a willingness to provide such an assignment, but he has absconded and cannot be located. While it is true that <em>R. </em>1:6-6 and <em>Evid.R. </em>63 would preclude such a statement as hearsay evidence, it is also true that Olsen\u2019s previous statement would be admissible at trial if he is a witness\u2014pursuant to <em>Evid.R. </em>63(1). In any event, if Olsen\u2019s consent or assignment is crucial, the determination should not be made on a motion for summary judgment without at least an affidavit by the insured. In my view, however, the majority is incorrect in concluding that an assignment is a <em>sine qua non </em>to permit an injured party, such as plaintiff, to maintain an excess suit against the carrier. On the contrary, the action should be permitted <em>unless </em>the insured affirmatively objects as in <em>Biasi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The annotation cited by the majority, 63 A.L.R.3d 677 (1975) indicates that the cases around the country are split as to whether an injured party can recover in excess of the policy limits in the absence of an assignment from the insured. The rationale precluding such an action is usually lack of privity or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>rejection of the injured party\u2019s standing as a third party beneficiary of the insurance contract. In the light of present day automobile transportation conditions, and current insurance regulation, coverage, practice and procedures, application of such traditional common-law bars to an injured party\u2019s bad faith claim against an insured\u2019s carrier is no longer warranted. <em>Cf. Rosenblum v. Adler, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>324 (1983); <em>Henningsen v. Bloomfield Motors, Inc., </em>32 <em>N.J. </em>358 (1960). The cited portion of the opinion in <em>Biasi </em>also includes the assertion that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-6\">Moreover, public policy does not mandate that the injured party in the accident should be the intended beneficiary of the company\u2019s contractual duty to its policyholder to act in good faith regarding settlement. [104 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 159-160],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">More persuasive to me is the reasoning in <em>Thompson v. Commercial Union Ins. Co. of New York, </em>250 <em>So.</em>2d 259 (Fla.1971), that mandatory automobile liability insurance is primarily for the protection of and benefit to third parties, and the right of an injured party to sue on a judgment in excess of the insured\u2019s policy limit on a bad faith claim (without an assignment by the insured) accords with public policy favoring compromise and settlement of controversies. New Jersey also views insurance as an instrument of a social policy that the victims of negligence be fully compensated. <em>Cooper v. Government Employees Ins. Co., </em>51 <em>N.J. </em>86, 94 (1968); <em>cf. Breen v. Peck, </em>28 <em>N.J. </em>351, 357 (1958); <em>Deblon v. Beaton, </em>103 <em>N.J.Super. </em>345, 351 (Law Div.1968). Such a result further accords with an economic view of law deeming it essential that a defendant be made to pay damages and that they be equal to a plaintiff\u2019s loss. Posner, <em>Economic Analysis of Law, </em>(2d Ed.1977) \u00a7 6.12 at 143.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">Furthermore, my colleagues\u2019 concern about restricting a carrier\u2019s ability to negotiate \u201cwithout fear of reprisal through such an excess suit\u201d is unrealistic. Liability insurance policies invariably contain clauses requiring an insured\u2019s cooperation in defense of a case and giving the carrier full control of the settlement of claims against the insured. The only fear a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>carrier need have is that of an excess suit where it has not negotiated in good faith. In that respect, it should be irrelevant as to whether the injured party has an excess judgment assignment or not; and in any event, an excess claim should be actionable in the absence of an affirmative objection by the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">I would reverse the summary judgment and reinstate plaintiff's complaint.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b203-13\"> 40% X $25,000 = $10,000 and 50% X $25,000 = $12,500.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b203-14\"> 6 X $12,500 = $75,000 and 7\u00a14 X $10,000 = $75,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Description of the trial in the unreported Appellate Division opinion affirming the judgment in <em>Murray v.
