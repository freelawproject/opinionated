The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>transcript was received under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-7b(2) which provides that the guilty knowledge requisite to the proof of receiving may be found where the person on trial \u201c[h]as received stolen property in another transaction within the year preceding the transaction charged____\u201d Defendant argues it should not have been admitted because the Municipal Court judge failed to establish that the defendant knew of the stolen character of the property there involved. From our examination of the transcript it clearly appears that in accepting the plea the Municipal Court judge ascertained from the defendant that the property had been stolen and that defendant had accepted it. Although <em>NJ.S.A. </em>2C:20-7a specifically requires proof of knowledge or belief that the property was stolen as a condition to guilt of theft, it defines \u201creceiving\u201d merely as \u201cacquiring possession, control or title, or lending on the security of the property.\u201d We disagree that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-7b(2) either contemplates the proof of \u201ctheft\u201d within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-7a or requires that proof of the earlier act of receiving take the form of a conviction for that offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">Defendant also asserts the following contentions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-8\">The Court committed reversible error by admitting hearsay evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-9\">The Court\u2019s instruction in its charge to the jury in respect to defendant\u2019s prior disorderly person\u2019s conviction was reversible error.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-10\">The Court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal or new trial because the verdict was against the weight of the evidence. The Court erred in evidencing bias in favor of the State in commenting on the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">After carefully examining the record on appeal, including the briefs and appendices and relevant parts of the transcript, we are entirely satisfied that the foregoing contentions are clearly without merit. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
