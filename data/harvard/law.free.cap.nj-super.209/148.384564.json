It was defendant\u2019s second violation of this statute and he received the same sentence as he did upon conviction in the Montvale Municipal Court. We affirm the conviction substantially for the reasons set forth in Judge Cariddi\u2019s comprehensive oral opinion of June 12, 1985, following the trial <em>de novo </em>on the record, wherein he concluded that there was overwhelming evidence of drunken driving as well as two breathalyzer test results of 0.13%.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Patrolman Kevin Downs testified as to defendant\u2019s erratic driving, inability to produce his driver\u2019s license, alcoholic beverage odor on his breath, slurred speech, slow hand movements, and failure to pass a field test for balance. At headquarters, defendant failed some more balance tests and Patrolman Downs\u2019 opinion was that he was under the influence of alcohol. Patrolman William Stachnick administered the breathalyzer tests with the indicated results, and he also was of the opinion that defendant was under the influence of alcohol based upon defendant\u2019s walking, mannerisms, slow and slurred \u201ctalk\u201d and the smell of alcohol. Defendant did not testify, but one of his drinking companions testified for the defense that defendant had two or three glasses of beer with dinner and \u201ca few beers\u201d at another bar. He denied any erratic driving by defendant and counsel stipulated that another companion\u2019s testimony would be similar and cumulative.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The municipal court judge found defendant guilty \u201csolely on the breathalyzer readings\u201d and added that \u201cThere is no need for the Court to make further findings.\u201d On this appeal, defendant contends that a judgment of acquittal should be entered because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-7\">POINT I: THE INSPECTION CERTIFICATES PURPORTING TO PROVE THAT THE BREATHALYZER DEVICE USED WAS IN GOOD WORKING ORDER WERE NOT PROPERLY COMPLETED OR AUTHENTICATED, AND SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ADMITTED INTO EVIDENCE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-8\">POINT II: THE BREATHALYZER TEST WAS IMPROPERLY ADMINISTERED, AND THE READINGS OBTAINED WERE THEREFORE UNRELIABLE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>POINT III: THE ADDITIONAL FINDINGS OF FACT ON APPEAL <em>DE NOVO </em>IN THE LAW DIVISION WERE UNWARRANTED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">POINT IV: THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO SUSTAIN A FINDING OF INTOXICATION BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">The scope of our review is limited, as set forth in <em>State v. Johnson, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>146, 162 (1964), and we are satisfied that the Law Division judge\u2019s findings \u201ccould reasonably have been reached on sufficient credible evidence present in the record.\u201d Our careful review of the record has also led to our determination that all of the issues raised in defendant\u2019s contentions are clearly without merit. <em>R. </em>2:11\u20143(e)(2). We add as to Point III that defendant is mistaken in asserting that at the \u201cmunicipal court hearing ... no argument was advanced on ... whether or not the testimony would support conviction ... absent the breathalyzer reading.\u201d The record is clear that the case was tried on both bases, and although the prosecutor was willing to submit without closing argument, he responded to defense counsel\u2019s summation that there was evidence \u201cfar beyond that of just the breath test.\u201d The Law Division, therefore, properly determined guilt on the alternative bases provided by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50 in the trial <em>de novo </em>on the record, <em>State v. Johnson, supra, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>at 158, although it did not have the benefit of the municipal court judge\u2019s findings as to the credibility of the witnesses. Furthermore, defendant did not request additional fact findings by the municipal court judge as he was entitled to under <em>R. </em>1:7-4. For guidance in the future of municipal court judges, however, we note that in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50 cases where there are proofs of guilt, with and without breathalyzer readings, the judge should make findings and conclusions on both bases. Failure to do so is unfair to defendants, the State, the attorneys and the Appellate Courts. <em>Curtis v. Finneran, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>563, 569-570 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
