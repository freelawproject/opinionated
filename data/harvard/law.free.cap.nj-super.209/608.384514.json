The trial judge concluded in ruling on the cross-motions for summary judgment that Hartford Insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>Company (Hartford), which provided insurance for the involved premises, was responsible for coverage rather than New Jersey Manufacturers Insurance Co. (Manufacturers), which insured the truck and its driver who was injured while attempting to use what was apparently a defective loading dock plate. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">The present state of the legal precedent in this area is somewhat conflicting. More recent cases have distinguished <em>Streeter v. Henry Heide, Inc., 171 N.J.Super. </em>58 (App.Div. 1979). We thus consider the facts involved in the underlying case in light of <em>Streeter </em>and the other case authorities in this State to determine the present viability of <em>Streeter </em>as precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">The underlying law suit brought by plaintiff, Edward F. Forsythe, the truck driver, and his spouse, Linda Forsythe (who asserted a <em>per quod </em>claim), was settled without prejudice to the resolution of the dispute between the two insurance carriers, Hartford and Manufacturers. The sole issue on this appeal is whether Hartford as comprehensive general liability carrier for defendant-third party plaintiff Teledyne Turner Tube (Teledyne) or Manufacturers, as insurer for the vehicle making or attempting to make the delivery on Teledyne\u2019s property when the accident occurred, is responsible for coverage for the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Forsythe had backed his truck into a loading bay of Tele-dyne\u2019s building. According to plaintiff\u2019s deposition, it was his practice when making deliveries at Teledyne to obtain assistance from an employee of Teledyne in unloading boxes from his truck. The loading dock was equipped with a movable loading dock plate that adjusted to the height of the floor of the truck. After Forsythe dropped off delivery papers at the desk in the warehouse, he went to Teledyne\u2019s loading dock in order to unload boxes from his truck. To do this Forsythe had to raise the rear door and manually adjust the loading dock plate so that it became even with the floor bed of the truck. Forsythe raised the docking plate with the help of James Runyon, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>Teledyne employee, who was to hold the plate as a safety precaution. The process of adjusting the docking plate and opening the rear truck door was standard procedure. Forsythe indicated that the docking plate was supposed to stay level with the floor of the truck, but that \u201cit never did as long as I can remember. It went down below the floor level. It had to have a stick under it to hold it up to the floor level.\u201d Forsythe also indicated that nothing unusual occurred in the unloading process until the docking plate collapsed on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">The accident happened immediately after Forsythe and Runyon had raised the docking plate. Forsythe released his hand from the plate and took one step with the intention of raising his rear door in order to place the docking plate upon the rear floor bed of the truck. In its cross-motion for summary judgment, Teledyne (by its insurer, Hartford) had attached and relied on extracts of Forsythe\u2019s depositions. According to Forsythe, the weight balance mechanism of the loading docking plate broke at that point causing the docking plate to fall upon him. Forsythe testified that he was aware that the docking plate was to facilitate the loading and unloading of the truck and that in the normal course of the loading operation he first had to raise the docking plate in order to raise the truck\u2019s door, and lower the docking plate onto the truck bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleged<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that his injuries were proximately caused by Teledyne\u2019s negligence in failing to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-8\">[Ijnspect and remedy hazardous and potentially dangerous conditions at its plant facility which it was obligated to do in the exercise of ordinary care for business invitees and licensees entering upon the premises, to inspect and remedy a dangerous condition on its property of which it had prior knowledge, improperly maintaining or failing to maintain the loading, unloading dock and the scale area, by failing to warn business invitees or licensees by appropriate notice of the hazardous and dangerous condition, and in otherwise neglecting repair, maintenance and allowing improper use and abuse of the loading, unloading dock and the scale area on which plaintiff was injured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>In deciding the cross-motions for summary judgment in favor of Manufacturers, the trial judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-4\">[T]he facts do not develop that the plaintiff did anything wrong in the course of utilizing the property of Teledyne; that the truck was in any way involved in doing anything other than just being there; and that the negligence which may have given rise to the injury which was ultimately sustained by the plaintiff was caused by anything that occurred during the unloading process, other than the condition of the property. The condition of the building, the condition of the loading dock.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Hartford, as insurer of Teledyne, relies heavily upon <em>Streeter v. Henry Heide, supra, </em>in arguing that the use of the docking plate was an integral part of the loading and unloading process and, therefore, Manufacturers\u2019 policy insuring the vehicle also extended coverage to Teledyne as an additional insured under the loading and unloading provisions of that policy. Hartford takes the position that because Forsythe was injured while attempting to use Teledyne\u2019s loading dock plate in order to unload his cargo, a loading and unloading function of the truck was involved within the meaning of Manufacturer\u2019s policy. By invoking the loading and unloading provisions of the insurance policy covering the truck, the owner of the premises attempts to shift responsibility for defense of the injured truck driver\u2019s claim and any liability to the insurance company for the trucking firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">In <em>Streeter v. Henry Heide, Inc., supra, </em>the plaintiff truck driver was injured \u201cas he was preparing a loading platform to load a shipment at Henry Heide Incorporated\u2019s premises.\u201d 171 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 59. The spring-loaded docking plate, which was supposed to fall into place when the truck was backed into the loading platform, stuck, and when plaintiff attempted to trip it, he was injured. Streeter sued Heide for negligence and breach of warranty that the instrument was fit for the use intended. <em>Streeter </em>held that the truck owner\u2019s liability insurance carrier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>afforded coverage to the owners of the premises\u2019 for plaintiff\u2019s claims:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-6\">In construing the loading and unloading provision New Jersey applies the \u2018complete operation\u2019 doctrine. The proper approach is to consider \u2018whether the accident was, within reason, causally connected with the <em>complete operation of unloading * * * </em>the truck.\u2019 <em>Drew Chem. Corp. v. Amer. Fore Loyalty Group, etc., </em>90 <em>N.J.Super. </em>582, 591 (App.Div.1966). Without the lowering of the docking plate to connect the truck with the loading platform, there could be no loading of the truck. It is perfectly obvious that the placement of the docking plate was an integral part of the loading operation. <em>[Id. </em>at 60-61]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">In rejecting the argument that because no employee of Heide was involved, it could not have been \u201cusing\u201d the truck, <em>Streeter </em>also said that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-8\">Since the installation of the docking plate was essential to the loading of the truck and the installation was provided for by Heide, Heide was in fact using the truck for loading. The acts alleged to have caused the accident were, therefore, causally connected with the complete operation of loading. <em>Cenno v. W. Virginia Paper &amp; Pulp Co., </em>109 <em>N.J.Super. </em>41, 47 (App.Div.1970), certif. den. 56 <em>N.J. </em>99 (1970). [Id. at 61]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">However, as we have more recently stated in <em>Neuman v. Wakefern Foods, </em>205 <em>N.J.Super. </em>263, 266 (App.Div.1985):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-10\">[T]he current state of our law regarding the responsibility of the owner of the premises is as more recently stated in <em>Wakefern Food Corp. v. Gen\u2019l Acc. Group, supra </em>[188 <em>N.J.Super. </em>77 (App.Div.1983)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-11\">Our reexamination of the law satisfies us that <em>Streeter </em>applied certain legal principles too broadly. We decline to follow <em>Streeter </em>in cases such as the one involved here. <em>Street-er </em>relied on <em>Cenno v. W. Virginia Paper &amp; Pulp Co., </em>109 <em>N.J.Super. </em>41, 47 (App.Div.1970), certif. den. 56 <em>N.J. </em>99 (1970), in which the driver of the truck involved was delivering bales of cardboard boxes which he had picked up elsewhere. The bales were about to be unloaded by an Allied employee using a fork lift. While moving the bales a metal band used to bale the cardboard boxes broke, causing plaintiff to lose his balance and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>fall off the truck. Plaintiff in that case had sued the manufacturer of the bands and clips and also West Virginia Paper &amp; Pulp Company which had baled the cartons, alleging that the bales had been negligently banded. Defendants sought coverage for plaintiffs claim under the truck owner\u2019s liability policy. We held in <em>Cenno </em>that there was no coverage, and pointed out that the alleged negligent acts \u201cantedated delivery of the goods\u201d to plaintiff\u2019s employer and \u201cwere unrelated to the loading or unloading of the truck.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 45. We also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVV\">In summary, we conclude that unless the alleged negligent act which is alleged to have caused the accident was an integral part of the overall loading or unloading operation, so that the mishap is causally connected with such loading and unloading and did not merely occur during it, the person charged with the negligent act is not considered to have been using the vehicle so as to be covered by the vehicle\u2019s liability policy for such act as an additional assured, [citation omitted; <em>id. </em>at 47.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">Likewise, in <em>Atlantic Mutual Ins. Co. v. Richards, </em>100 <em>N.J.Super. </em>180 (Chan.Div.1968), aff\u2019d o.b. 105 <em>N.J.Super. </em>48 (App.Div.1969) the loading and unloading provisions of the vehicle\u2019s insurance policy were held not to provide coverage to the owner of the loading platform. The driver of the truck fell into an open stairwell, after presumably tripping over \u201ca three-foot slat of wooden dunnage, which was not used in the unloading process.\u201d Sapolin was alleged to have been negligent in failing to maintain a reasonably safe place to work. Judge Furman, then sitting in the Chancery Division, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-5\">The regular inspection of the loading platform, the remedying of a hazardous condition or the communication of an adequate warning may be viewed broadly as necessary for safe unloading. But the fulfillment of such duty was not a step in the specific operation of unloading the National Lead truckload. To construe the maintenance of the loading platform as a 'use of the automobile\u2019 in unloading would be to extend automobile liability coverage to negligence occurring prior to the arrival of the truck, that is, failing to remove dunnage from proximity to the open stairwell, and to a nuisance grounded in negligence, that is, the stairwell without guardrail. No New Jersey reported opinion has so held. <em>[Id. </em>at 183.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">In <em>Atlantic Mutual </em>we essentially agreed with Judge Fur-man\u2019s conclusion that the insurance covering the truck should not extend to negligent maintenance of the loading dock, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>\u201cshould be limited to negligence in loading or unloading the automotive vehicle, including preliminary and subsequent measures proximate in time related to its loading or unloading.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">We are satisfied that <em>Neuman v. Wakefern Foods, supra; Wakefern Food Corp. v. General Acc. Group, </em>188 <em>N.J.Super. </em>77 (App.Div.1983); <em>Cenno v. W. Virginia Paper, supra; </em>and <em>Atlantic Mutual Ins. Co. v. Richards, supra, </em>properly express the appropriate test and the present state of the law. We also note that in <em>Halifko v. Cities Service Oil Co., </em>510 <em>F.Supp. </em>1131 (D.N.J.1981), aff\u2019d o.b. mem. 676 F.2d 684, 685 (3rd Cir.1982), the federal court criticized rather than distinguished <em>Streeter, </em>and chose instead to rely on earlier New Jersey decisions, such as <em>Cenno, supra </em>and <em>Atlantic, supra, </em>which applied a more limited interpretation of the use requirement. <em>Id. </em>at 1134-1137. The judge applied what he construed to be New Jersey law and concluded that the New Jersey Supreme Court would not extend coverage by the truck owner\u2019s liability insurer to Cities Service Company for negligent maintenance of the loading platform. <em>Id. </em>at 1133-1137.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">In our view, <em>Streeter </em>was wrongly decided. Our dissatisfaction with <em>Streeter </em>was perhaps evident in <em>Wakefern Food Corp. v. General Acc. Group, supra </em>(where the truck driver tripped over debris on the loading platform) when we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"abe-dedup-0\">We are mindful of this court\u2019s decision in <em>Streeter v. Heide Inc., </em>171 <em>N.J.Super. </em>58 (App.Div.1979), a case where the \u2018complete operation doctrine\u2019 was, in a terse opinion, applied with a broad brush. We see no reason to take such an approach in this case. <em>Streeter </em>is distinguishable. The placement of the malfunctioning loading dock plate was \u2018an integral part of the loading operation.\u2019 To that extent, the malfunctioning dock plate may be said to \u2018within reason\u2019 have a causal relationship to the loading process, just as the clogged and malfunctioning pipeline involved in <em>Drew, supra, </em>had a causal connection to that unloading operation. The same cannot be said of the debris-strewn dock <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>area maintained by Wakefem and furnished to its invitees. The negligent accumulation of debris in a delivery area is hardly a \u2018use\u2019 of the vehicles that come to those premises. [188 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 84].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">In the instant case we think that the comment in <em>Wakefem Food </em>(also quoted in Neuman), is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-6\">We feel constrained to observe pragmatically that declaratory judgment suits like the present one are, by large measure, solely between an automobile insurance carrier and a general liability carrier who covers the premises and operations liability of a business to whom goods are delivered or from whom goods are taken. One of the purposes for which the latter coverage is purchased is to protect the business operator from the risk of liability to his invitees resulting from the negligent maintenance of his premises. \u2018Use\u2019 provisions and \u2018loading and unloading\u2019 clauses are intended to protect the named insured and others who, in the pick-up or delivery process, are actually using the motor vehicle and its contents during the \u2018complete operation.\u2019 When an accident, such as the one here presented, is occasioned by negligent maintenance of the premises and the only connection to that event is the fact that the motor vehicle and its operator are present because a delivery or pick-up is to be made, no realistic social or public policy is served by straining to shift coverage. Moreover, no reasonable contractual expectations are disappointed or denied and the \u2018reasonable contemplation of the parties\u2019 mentioned in <em>Drew, supra </em>90 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 587, is hardly placed at hazard. [188 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 86-87.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">We are unable to discern how negligence of the owner of premises in the inspection, maintenance and repair of its own loading dock, resulting in collapse of the docking plate upon a trucker engaged in attempting to prepare to unload, can reasonably be viewed as negligent use of the truck, triggering insurance coverage under the vehicle\u2019s policy. See <em>Wakefern Food Corp. v. General Acc. Group, supra </em>(188 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 84). We distinguish between cases where there is negligence in the actual loading and unloading operation, such as by an employee of a warehouse in loading a truck, and those cases where the negligence is not directly related to the loading and unloading, but the accident occurs during the loading and unloading process, such as where there is a dangerous condition on the premises of the warehouse. Except for <em>Streeter </em>our cases are in harmony with that conceptual framework. <em>Neuman v. Wakefern Foods, supra </em>(205 <em>N.J.Super. </em>263); <em>Wakefern Food Corp. v. General Acc. Group, supra </em>(188 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 77); <em>Cenno v. W. Virginia Paper &amp; Pulp Co., supra, </em>(109 <em>N.J.Su</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number><em>per. </em>at 41); <em>Maryland Casualty Co. v. N.J. Manufacturers, </em>48 <em>N.J.Super. </em>314 (App.Div.1958), affd 28 <em>N.J. </em>17 (1958). See also <em>Halifko v. Cities Service Oil Co., supra. </em>(510 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 1131). Hence, we decline to follow <em>Streeter.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Here, the allegations of negligence that Teledyne failed to maintain its loading dock plate in proper condition or warn of its dangerous condition, is analogous to negligent maintenance of the loading dock itself and any liability for that condition would rest with Teledyne, and its insurer, Hartford. We are satisfied that the attempt to adjust the loading dock plate, although necessary to unload the truck, should not be construed to constitute a use of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b643-9\">The complaint also contained products liability allegations against defendants other than Teledyne who are not implicated in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b645-12\">The result was that the trucking company\u2019s vehicle insurance was then affording coverage and a defense for a claim by its own employee, when that employee\u2019s direct claim against it would be barred in the usual case because of the bar of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-8; <em>Wellenheider v. Rader, </em>49 <em>N.J. </em>1, 9 (1967); <em>Tremonte v.
