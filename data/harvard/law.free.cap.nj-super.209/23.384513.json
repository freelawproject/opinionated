Bottomly was convicted of driving while under the influence of alcohol <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50); refusal to submit to a chemical test <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2); and failure to have a license and registration in his possession <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-29). The judge imposed a fine of five dollars and assessed five dollars in court costs on the license and registration violations. In addition he fined Bottomly $250 and assessed court costs of $15 on each of the alcohol related offenses. Bottomly also was assessed a $100 insurance surcharge and his driver\u2019s license was suspended for one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">The sentence was stayed and an appeal <em>de novo </em>was heard in the Superior Court, Law Division where Judge Bachman again found Bottomly guilty of all four offenses. He imposed the exact sentence which had been stayed in the Municipal Court with an additional assessment of court costs. Thereafter Bottomly successfully applied for modification of his sentence, the suspension portion of which was reduced from one year to six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">This appeal ensued in which Bottomly claims that the following errors warrant reversal.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-9\">Point I The stop of appellant\u2019s vehicle by the Woodbridge Township Police officers was without probable cause and constituted an unlawful search and seizure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-10\">Point II Appellant was not afforded Miranda rights, hence, his responses to questions posed during custodial interrogation are inadmissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-11\">We find that these contentions are without merit. In our view Judge Bachman\u2019s analysis of the issues presented was entirely proper as was his conclusion that there was ample admissible evidence in the record to undergird Bottomly\u2019s convictions. We thus affirm substantially for the reasons expressed in Judge Bachman\u2019s opinion of November 5, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
