He makes four contentions. He contends that his rights were violated when the prosecutor questioned a witness about his previous crimes. He also contends that the federal trial court judge violated his rights in allowing the questioning. These two issues were raised in petitioner\u2019s direct appeal, United States v. Webb, 5 Cir. 1972, 463 F.2d 1324, cert. denied 409 U.S. 986, 93 S.Ct. 338, 34 L.Ed.2d 251, and we are thus foreclosed from reconsidering them here, Lacaze v. United States, 5 Cir. 1972, 457 F.2d 1075 at 1078, cert. denied 409 U.S. 921, 93 S.Ct. 251, 34 L.Ed.2d 180. Petitioner also argues that he was not effectively assisted by counsel, and that he was denied access to the trial court\u2019s hearing, in chambers, of a severed co-defendant\u2019s motion for a continuance. But petitioner was not denied effective assistance of counsel and the hearing to which he refers had nothing to do with the merits of his own case. The district court\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s motion is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
