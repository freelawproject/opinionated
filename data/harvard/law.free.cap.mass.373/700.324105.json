LaCorte (LaCorte) was indicted for murder in the first degree in connection with the death of Richard White in White\u2019s Boston apartment on May 29, 1974. After a five-day trial in the Superior Court, a jury found LaCorte guilty of murder in the second degree, and the judge sentenced him to fife imprisonment. The defendant\u2019s assignments of error are here pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G, as amended. We conclude that there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">Responding to a call from a neighbor, Boston police officers entered White\u2019s Marlborough Street apartment at approximately 6:05 a.m. and found White dead on the floor, bleeding from multiple stab wounds, a scarf tied around his neck like a noose. The jury were warranted in finding the following facts based on the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence. LaCorte had been with White on the night in question. He was seen in a restaurant with White about 11 p.m., and a third man was present with them. LaCorte and the unidentified man left together, but were seen with White again outside the restaurant about 1:25 a.m. At that time, the men seemed to be arguing. White was trying to walk away from the others, but LaCorte kept tugging at White\u2019s jacket and led him in another direction, saying, \u201cCome on here, come on this way.\u201d About 6 a.m. a neighbor in an apartment adjacent to White\u2019s was awakened by loud screaming. Looking out her window, she saw two men running from White\u2019s building accompanied by a woman. In White\u2019s apartment, police found two cardboard coffee cups, one of which bore fingerprints which, in the opinion of the Commonwealth\u2019s expert witness, were \u201cidentical\u201d to prints taken from LaCorte at the time of his arrest. Approximately four months later, in October, 1974, LaCorte <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>bragged to a group of friends about crimes he had committed in the past, including a murder \u2014 which he reenacted for them. He related how he and a friend had \u201croundhoused\u201d a Marlborough Street man who had \u201cripped us off.\u201d He illustrated his story by standing up one of his listeners, spinning him around, and pretending to stab him repeatedly at each turn. LaCorte told his friends \u2014 two of whom testified at trial \u2014 that his victim had fallen through a glass window during the struggle. Police found a broken window in White\u2019s apartment, and tests revealed that pieces of the broken glass were stained with blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">1. The defendant argues that the cardboard cup bearing his fingerprint should have been excluded at trial because the prosecution failed to establish that the fingerprint was placed thereon in the apartment during the commission of the crime. This foundation, the defendant argues, is necessary to eliminate the possibility that LaCorte may have left the fingerprint during a previous visit to the apartment unrelated to the crime. Without it, he seems to argue, the evidence is irrelevant. We disagree. Certainly fingerprints found in the apartment of the victim immediately after the homicide have some tendency to prove the identity of the killer. It is this rational tendency to prove an issue in the case that makes the cup relevant and, subject to other rules, admissible. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>361 Mass. 665, 679-680 (1972), judgment vacated, 410 U.S. 901, aff\u2019d on rehearing, 363 Mass. 665, cert, denied, 414 U.S. 1080 (1973). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durkin, </em>257 Mass. 426, 427-428 (1926). The defendant\u2019s argument goes only to the weight of the evidence, not to its admissibility, and it is for the jury to determine \u2014 after listening to cross-examination and the closing arguments of counsel \u2014 what significance, if any, they will attach to the discovery of the defendant\u2019s fingerprints at the scene of the crime.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kahaner, </em>317 F.2d 459, 471-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>472 (2d Cir. 1963); 1 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 29, at 411 (3d ed. 1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">That is not to say, of course, that the mere discovery of the defendant\u2019s fingerprints at the scene of the crime, without further evidence linking the defendant to the crime, would be sufficient identification to support a conviction. Courts universally consider the fingerprint comparison to be an adequate and reliable method of identification. 2 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 414, at 390 (3d ed. 1940). See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bartolini, </em>299 Mass. 503, 513, cert, denied, 304 U.S. 565 (1938). Moreover, when the prosecution can establish that fingerprints found at the scene of the crime could have been impressed only during the commission of the crime, fingerprint evidence pointing to the defendant almost certainly will support a conviction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>360 Mass. 498, 501 n.2 (1971); <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>49 Ohio St. 2d 198 (1977). Nevertheless, when fingerprints constitute the only identification evidence, most jurisdictions require the prosecution to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the fingerprints in fact were placed at the scene during the commission of the crime. E.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Corso, </em>439 F.2d 956, 957 (4th Cir. 1971); <em>State </em>v. <em>Mayell, </em>163 Conn. 419, 426 (1972); Annot., 28 A.L.R.2d 1115, 1155-1157 (1953). But cf. <em>Borum </em>v. <em>United States, </em>380 F.2d 595, 598-602 (D.C. Cir. 1967) (Burger, J., dissenting), cited with approval in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, supra. </em>We need not reach this question because in this case the prosecutor introduced abundant evidence \u2014 including the defendant\u2019s own admissions \u2014 linking him to the murder in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">2. Defense counsel argues that a standard fingerprint card, kept as an arrest record by the Boston police department, was not adequately authenticated as one bearing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>prints of the defendant and thus could not furnish a relevant standard against which the expert witness could compare the fingerprint found in White\u2019s apartment. We disagree. The Commonwealth offered the card through the police officer who fingerprinted LaCorte at the time of the arrest. The officer testified that on October 29, 1974, he took the fingerprints of a person \u2014 whom he identified in court as the defendant \u2014 and recorded them, together with that person\u2019s photograph and signature, on a standard fingerprint card. Defense counsel appears to have conceded at trial that the photograph and signature were genuine.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">The officer identified the card offered by the prosecutor as the card on which he had taken LaCorte\u2019s fingerprints, and the judge received the card in evidence as an exhibit. The prosecutor made no attempt to account for the custody of the fingerprint card between the date of arrest and the date of the trial. The defendant argues that this constitutes a gap in the evidence fatal to the authentication and that the judge erred in admitting the card as a genuine set of LaCorte\u2019s fingerprints. This argument mis-perceives the nature of the authentication requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">In order to be material, a thing offered in evidence genuinely must be what its proponent represents it to be. Its authenticity must be stipulated or else proved like any other fact. \u201cSuch proof of authenticity usually takes the form of testimony of a qualified witness either (1) that the thing is what its proponent represents it to be, or (2) that circumstances exist which imply that the thing is what its proponent represents it to be.\u201d W.B. Leach &amp; P.J. Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence 265 (4th ed. 1967). In this case there was testimony from the officer who had taken the defendant\u2019s fingerprints that the proffered card was the one used in the fingerprinting. In light of such direct identification of the card and its contents, uncon-troverted in cross-examination or by any other evidence, there was no necessity to authenticate the card by circumstantial proof, such as showing the chain of custody of the card since the fingerprints were taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>3. The Commonwealth\u2019s expert testified that he considered one of the fingerprints on the coffee cup \u201cto be identical with the left middle finger of one Michael Vincent LaCorte.\u201d The defendant took exception to the use of the word \u201cidentical\u201d and argues that the expert invaded the province of the jury by expressing an opinion as to an ultimate fact. There was no error. This court has held that \u201ca question which calls for an opinion which is in the domain of the expert\u2019s professional knowledge is not necessarily to be excluded merely because the conclusion of the witness reaches or approaches the ultimate issue before the jury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montmeny, </em>360 Mass. 526, 527-528 (1971). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lannon, </em>364 Mass. 480, 484 (1974), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boudreau, </em>362 Mass. 378, 380 (1972), with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>350 Mass. 664, 665-667 (1966). The many jurisdictions that have considered the issue essentially agree that such testimony by a fingerprint expert does not usurp the function of the jury, even though it may touch on an ultimate fact which the jury must determine. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>201 N.W.2d 724, 726-727 (Iowa 1972), overruling <em>State </em>v. <em>Steffen, </em>210 Iowa 196, 200 (1930); Annot., 28 A.L.R.2d 1115, \u00a7 25 (1953 &amp; Supps. 1970, 1977). We find that there was no danger here \u201cthat the jury might forego independent analysis of the facts and bow too readily to the opinion of an expert or otherwise influential witness.\u201d McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 12, at 27 (2d ed. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">4. The defendant has assigned as alleged errors several evidentiary rulings by the judge excluding questions put to prosecution witnesses on cross-examination. We hold that there was no error in any of the rulings. The questions raised are not novel, and all involved the element of judicial discretion with no showing of any abuse of that discretion. We therefore describe the alleged errors only to the extent necessary to identify them in disposing of the claims of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">(a) While cross-examining one Officer Charbonnier, defense counsel showed the witness certain photographs, admitted as exhibits, depicting the room where White\u2019s body <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>was discovered. Counsel was attempting to demonstrate where the coffee cup bearing LaCorte\u2019s fingerprints was to be found in each picture. After a number of similar questions, the judge excluded further oral testimony and submitted the photographs to the jury. The witness had not been present when the photographs were taken, and his responses were nothing more than his own interpretation of them. The exclusion reveals no error. See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sandler, </em>368 Mass. 729, 737-738 (1975). A trial judge may, in his discretion, limit cross-examina-tian in the interest of clear and orderly presentation of the evidence. The judge\u2019s action in no way precluded counsel from proving, if he could, that the fingerprint on the cup was due to LaCorte\u2019s presence in the apartment on some occasion prior to the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">(b) The trial judge excluded a question put to witness Sapauskas which would have established that Sapauskas entered the Warrenton Center for Addiction on October 9, 1974 \u2014 five days after LaCorte had reenacted the murder in the presence of Sapauskas and others. The judge ruled the testimony immaterial, and we agree. The defendant argues that this exclusion prevented counsel from inquiring into the witness\u2019s possible mental impairment at the time he witnessed LaCorte\u2019s dramatization. We find from the record, however, that Sapauskas\u2019s drug addiction at the time of the reenactment was the subject of extensive cross-examination. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">(c) The patrolman who discovered White\u2019s body, one Officer Bickerton, was asked on cross-examination whether he \u201chad some information whether or not a woman had been in the apartment at about 5:30 that morning?\u201d The prosecutor did not object, but the judge excluded the question on his own motion. It is true that the neighbor who had called the police testified to seeing a woman running from White\u2019s building with two men. Officer Bick-erton himself testified that he had found women\u2019s clothing in White\u2019s apartment. Clearly, however, Officer Bickerton could have had no first hand knowledge of the presence of a woman at the scene prior to his arrival, and the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>might have excluded the question on this ground. Since there is no suggestion by the defense that Officer Bick-erton had any such knowledge, counsel\u2019s reliance on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>365 Mass. 534 (1974), is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">5. The defendant argues that the prosecutor asserted his personal belief in the defendant\u2019s guilt during his closing argument to the jury. There is no merit to this contention. The prosecutor said: \"I\u2019m fully confident... as sure as my name is Doyle, that I expect a truthful verdict by twelve people of courage, by twelve people joined together in a single unit dedicated to one purpose and one purpose alone: What is the truth in this case.\u201d This argument was not improper. Both judge and counsel may properly impress upon the jury their duty to act with courage as well as impartiality. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>292 Mass. 409, 411 (1935). The defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">6. We have reviewed the entire record in accordance with our duties under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. We find that the verdict is in accordance with the law and the weight of the evidence, and we observe nothing which in justice indicates that we should modify the result reached by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b716-6\"> Since the defendant may have been in White\u2019s apartment on other occasions, the defendant might have been entitled to a limiting instruction emphasizing that the fingerprints were admitted in evidence to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>show only that the defendant was present there at some time. However, because of other circumstantial evidence in this case, the judge might well have ruled that the defendant was not entitled to such an instruction. In any event, the question is not before us, because the defendant requested no such instruction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
