The jury returned a verdict of guilty of murder in the second degree. The case, having been subject to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33H, comes here on Dias\u2019s appeal. Dias challenges his conviction on the ground that the trial judge\u2019s questioning of a defense witness deprived him of a fair trial. Additionally, Dias urges this court to exercise its extraordinary power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to reduce the verdict to manslaughter. We find no error, and affirm the conviction. We decline to grant the relief authorized by c. 278, \u00a7 33E.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-11\">The relevant facts are summarized.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-12\">On the evening of March 15, 1974, the victim Gerald Travis (Travis), accompanied by Russell Greene (Greene), and Fernando Mello (Mella), went to a bar, The Republican Club, in Fall River. There the group met another friend, Thomas Wing (Wing). Each of them consumed several beers. In the course of the evening, the young men traveled to another bar where they continued their beer drinking and socializing until closing time, whereupon they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>proceeded to a third tavern, which had also closed. Not yet ready to call an end to the evening\u2019s activities, Mello\u2019s companions accepted his invitation to go to Dias\u2019s apartment; Mello, the only member of the group acquainted with Dias, had been staying at his apartment for several days prior to March 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Though no one was at home, the group entered the apartment, and, while Mello gave Wing and Greene a tour of the premises, Travis retired to the kitchen and began frying eggs and sausages. In the course of their tour, Mello happened on two shotguns leaning against the bureau in Dias\u2019s bedroom and a box of shotgun shells atop the bureau. One of the shotguns, from which the parties agree the fatal shot was fired, was capable of firing only once, and then had to be \u201cbroken open\u201d to be reloaded. Although noticing that this gun was unloaded, Mello, wary that his friends might engage in horseplay, hid the gun under a couch in the livingroom and put the bullets in Dias\u2019s bureau.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Soon after, Dias returned to his apartment in the company of several friends. Except for Dias, no one in the group arriving was acquainted with any member of Mello\u2019s party. Dias appeared upset. According to various accounts, this was because he had lost his wallet, because of the unexplained presence of unknown persons who had placed the kitchen in a state of disarray, or because he could not locate his guns. At any rate, Dias found a gun and shells, loaded the gun, and came into the kitchen. He pointed the gun at Greene, and demanded that the premises be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">There was a conflict in the testimony as to what transpired thereafter. Mello, Greene, and Wing, whose accounts essentially coincided, testified that as Dias entered the kitchen the shotgun was in the \u201cclosed\u201d position and the hammer was cocked. Greene pushed the barrel of the shotgun away from his face. At the same time, Travis jumped toward Dias, the lights went out momentarily, and Travis was fatally shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">Michael Sturgeon (Sturgeon), the only defense witness, was in the group which accompanied Dias to the apart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>ment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He testified that as Dias came into the kitchen, the shotgun which he w\u00e1s brandishing was in the \u201cbroken\u201d position, and thus could not be fired. According to his version, Travis jumped toward Dias, and, grabbing the shotgun by the barrel, tore it from the defendant\u2019s hand. Still holding the barrel, Travis swung the shotgun at Dias, attempting to use the butt end as a club. Dias put up his arm to fend off the blow, and, on contact, the shotgun slammed shut and accidentally discharged into Travis\u2019s chest area.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">1. <em>Judicial Questioning of Defense Witness.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">The judicial questioning of which Dias now complains occurred during the cross-examination of Sturgeon sifter he had given the above-recounted testimony. As Sturgeon was being cross-examined, the following exchange took place: The witness: \u201cThere was a shell in the gun, there had to be, it went off.\u201d The judge: \u201cWhen did it go off?\u201d The witness: \u201cWhen he struck his arm, the gun went off.\u201d The judge: \u201cAre you telling us that when he struck Dias\u2019 arm with the gun broken, that the gun then went off? Is that what you are saying?\u201d The witness: \u201cThe gun couldn\u2019t have been open when he swung it.\u201d The judge: \u201cHm, hm. I understand. It also won\u2019t cock in that position, either.\u201d The witness: \u201cRight.\u201d The judge: \u201cBut it is your testimony that whatever happened, that the gun went off when it struck Dias\u2019 arm, is that right?\u201d The witness: \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">Immediately, the defendant\u2019s counsel moved for a mistrial on the ground that the judge, by saying, \u201cHm, hm,\u201d in effect found as fact that the gun could not have been open when Travis swung it at Dias. On appeal, the defendant contends that the judge, by stating, \u201cIt also won\u2019t cock in that position, either,\u201d was finding a fact, a function which rests exclusively with the jury. G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>In essence, Dias contends that, by engaging in this exchange with the witness, the judge was indicating that he found incredible the version of events to which Sturgeon testified on direct examination. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">A trial judge \u201cneed take no vow of silence. He is there to see that justice is done or at least to see that the jury have a fair chance to do justice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haley, </em>363 Mass. 513, 519 (1973), quoting H. Lummus, The Trial Judge 19-21 (1937). He or she \u201cought to be always the guiding spirit and the controlling mind at a trial.\u201d <em>Goldman </em>v. <em>Ashkins, </em>266 Mass. 374, 380 (1929). Accordingly, a judge may properly question a witness, even where to do so may strengthen the Commonwealth\u2019s case, so long as the examination is not partisan in nature, biased, or a display of belief in the defendant\u2019s guilt. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Festa, </em>369 Mass. 419, 422 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">There exists no quantitative test for determining whether the judge has gone beyond the bounds which the law imposes; \u201c[m]uch depends on the nature of the proceeding.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>371 Mass. 40, 45 (1976). The judge should utilize a \u201crule of reason\u201d in applying the foregoing standard. <em>Id. </em>We do not believe that the judge violated that standard in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">During the presentation of the Commonwealth\u2019s case in chief, a firearms expert expressed substantial doubt whether the weapon in question could have fired in the \u201cbroken\u201d position and whether it would discharge on concussion without the squeezing of its trigger. The witness, not a firearms expert, apparently was attempting to testify, in a rambling narrative style, that the gun did indeed discharge in that manner. During cross-examination, the judge merely made several inquiries in an attempt to clarify the testimony of this witness. The judge was not attempting to coerce the witness to retract his testimony, cf. <em>Webb </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>409 U.S. 95 (1972), nor did the judge, despite the existence of conflicting testimony relating to a crucial issue, inform the jury that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was not disputed. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hanscomb, </em>367 Mass. 726 (1975). His questions were not biased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>or coercive; they were aimed at developing the most trustworthy testimony and clarifying for the jury the witness\u2019s testimony. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fiore, </em>364 Mass. 819, 827 (1974). Moreover, the judge instructed the jury that \u201cit is your function and yours alone to determine factually what happened. It is your province and yours alone to determine what part \u2014 all, or part, or none \u2014 of the story that any witness or the opinion of any witness is expressed that you are going to believe and follow. This is your function, not mine.\u201d This directive served to overcome any possible prejudicial effect which might have derived from the judge\u2019s questioning. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>371 Mass. 40 (1976); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Festa, </em>369 Mass. 419 (1976). Though it might have been preferable to have left the clarification of the witness\u2019s testimony to the interrogation of the respective attorneys, we note that \u201cthe most conscientious judge [is] one who is not content to leave vital questions unasked.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hanscomb, supra </em>at 733 (Hennessey, J., concurring). We conclude there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">2. <em>Section 33E Questions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Dias urges that a verdict of manslaughter would have been \u201cmore consonant with justice\u201d than a verdict of murder, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>346 Mass. 107, 109 (1963), and he therefore asks us to use our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to order the verdict reduced. He argues that the instant case presents a factual situation similar to that in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baker, supra </em>at 110, where we exercised our \u00a7 33E mitigating powers because we found that a \u201cminor controversy... where the principals were acquainted only slightly, if at all\u201d had \u201cexplode [d] into the killing of a human being.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">As required by \u00a7 33E, we have examined all the evidence presented in the trial court. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahnke, </em>368 Mass. 662, 700 (1975), cert, denied, 425 U.S. 959 (1976). There was a plethora of eyewitness testimony, cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahnke, supra </em>at 701, and the jury were instructed correctly on the respective elements of murder, manslaughter, and accidental death. See <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Deeran, </em>364 Mass. 193 (1973). Our perusal of the record leads us to conclude that the defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baker, supra, </em>is misplaced. In <em>Baker </em>at 119 we exercised our \u00a7 33E power on the ground that the evidence clearly showed that the intention to use a deadly weapon \u201cwas formed in the heat of sudden affray or combat.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>366 Mass. 805, 809 (1975), construing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>346 Mass. 107, 119 (1963). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>326 Mass. 597, 601 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">In the instant case, there was evidence from which the jury could have found, as apparently they did, that Dias, after discovering the presence of unknown persons in his home, procured an unloaded shotgun, loaded it, and entered his kitchen \u2014 a small area then occupied by several persons \u2014 brandished the gun and demanded that the premises be vacated. The victim was killed by a shot from that gun. \u201cIt has long been recognized in this Commonwealth that malice may be inferred from the intentional use of a deadly weapon.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gagne, </em>367 Mass. 519, 522 (1975). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Festa, </em>369 Mass. 419, 424 (1976). There was no evidence of \u201csudden combat in which the deceased was originally the aggressor,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kendrick, </em>351 Mass. 203, 210 (1966), or that the defendant \u201cwas subjected to any angry confrontation,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kinney, </em>361 Mass. 709, 713 (1972) , nor was it a case of \u201cuncontrolled anger and violent action on the part of both the defendant and the decedent,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ransom, </em>358 Mass. 580, 583 (1971) .</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">Instead, we are confronted with a killing which resulted from the defendant\u2019s deliberate use of a deadly weapon. Under similar facts we have declined to exercise our \u00a7 33E powers. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rooney, </em>365 Mass. 484, 495 <em>(1974); Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nordstrom, </em>364 Mass. 310, 312 (1973); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Deeran, </em>364 Mass. 193,196-197 <em>(1973); Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pratt, </em>360 Mass. 708, 715 (1972). Mindful that \u201cthe mitigating power under \u00a7 33E is to be exercised sparingly,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Seit, ante, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>83, 95 (1977), we conclude that the verdict of murder in the second degree is appropriate. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fournier, </em>372 Mass. 346, 350 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b429-8\"> While Sturgeon was the only witness who testified to this version of events, several other persons who arrived at the apartment with him had given similar accounts when questioned by the police.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b429-9\"> Despite this apparent change in counsel\u2019s view of that which was objectionable, we scrutinize this exchange as a whole.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
