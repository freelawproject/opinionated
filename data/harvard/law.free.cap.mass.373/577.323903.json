L. c. 265, \u00a7 23, and of committing an indecent assault and battery on a child under the age of fourteen years in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was sentenced to imprisonment in the State prison for a term of not less than five nor more than seven years on the first charge, and for a concurrent term of not less than three nor more than five years on the second charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-10\">He initially sought to have his sentences reviewed by the Appellate Division of the Superior Court (see G. L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 28A, 28B), but later withdrew his appeal. There was apparently no attempt to pursue a direct appeal on the merits of the convictions, rather only the abortive attempt to have the sentences modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-11\">Eight months after conviction, the defendant, now represented by new counsel, filed a motion for a new trial, which was denied. The proceedings were made subject to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G. The defendant appealed from the denial of his motion for a new trial, and we granted his application for direct appellate review. G. L. c. 211A, \u00a710 (A).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-12\">The sole assignment of error is that the judge erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>denying the motion which contended that G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 23, which prohibits \u201c[unlawful] sexual intercourse or unnatural sexual intercourse, and [abuse of] a child under sixteen years of age,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is, in the words of the assignment of error, \u201cnot clearly defined and is insufficient as a matter of law to allow a citizen to be cognizant of the type of conduct which the statute intends to prohibit and... is unconstitutional and void for vagueness.\u201d There is before us no appeal from the conviction of indecent assault and battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">We have before us a ten page transcript of the hearing on the motion for a new trial, and the transcript of the trial. The testimony at trial was as follows. The defendant stayed overnight at the house where the victim, a girl, seven and one-half years old, lived with her parents. After her bedtime, the defendant came to her bedroom, brought her to his bedroom, touched her genitals, penetrated her mouth with his penis, and ejaculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">We hold that the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial was properly denied, and that G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 23, is not unconstitutionally vague as applied to the defendant\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">1. <em>Vagueness. </em>The defendant\u2019s argument is that \u201cunnatural sexual intercourse\u201d as used in G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 23, is unconstitutionally vague because the term does not specify what conduct is prohibited, because the term has not yet been construed by a judicial opinion, and because no common law history or usage clarifies its meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">It is possible to discern several strands of analysis collected in the constitutional prohibition against vague statutes. First, and primary, is the doctrine that \u201c[a] law is unconstitutionally vague if it is not sufficiently explicit to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>give clear warning as to proscribed activities.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Orlando, </em>371 Mass. 732, 734 (1977), \u201c[A] statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application, violates the first essential of due process of law.\u201d <em>Connally </em>v. <em>General Constr. Co., </em>269 U.S. 385, 391 (1926). In the succinct language of <em>Lanzetta </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>306 U.S. 451, 453 (1939), \u201cNo one may be required at peril of life, liberty or property to speculate as to the meaning of penal statutes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Second, \u201cif arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is to be prevented, laws must provide explicit standards for those who apply them. A vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an <em>ad hoc </em>and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application.\u201d Gra<em>yned </em>v. <em>Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 108-109 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Third, \u201c[w]here a statute\u2019s literal scope, unaided by a narrowing state court interpretation, is capable of reaching expression sheltered by the First Amendment, the [vagueness] doctrine demands a greater degree of specificity than in other contexts.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Goguen, </em>415 U.S. 566, 573 (1974). See, Note, The Void-For-Vagueness Doctrine in the Supreme Court, 109 U. Pa. L. Rev. 67 (1960). There can be no conceivable argument that First Amendment freedoms are implicated in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">Yet the vagueness doctrine is not a counsel of perfection. \u201cThe root of the vagueness doctrine is a rough idea of fairness. It is not a principle designed to convert into a constitutional dilemma the practical difficulties in drawing criminal statutes both general enough to take into account a variety of human conduct and sufficiently specific to provide fair warning that certain kinds of conduct are prohibited.\u201d <em>Colten </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>407 U.S. 104, 110 (1972). \u201cA law is not vague... if it requires a person to conform his conduct to an imprecise but comprehensible normative standard so that men of common intelligence will know its meaning.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Orlando, supra </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>at 734. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jarrett, </em>359 Mass. 491, 496-497 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">A sufficiently definite warning may be achieved by judicial construction, common law meaning, or the statutory history of particular terms. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brasher, </em>359 Mass. 550, 553 (1971). The constitutional adequacy of a criminal statute must be \u201cmeasured by common understanding and practices.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jarrett, supra </em>at 497. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Balthazar, </em>366 Mass. 298, 300 (1974), habeas corpus granted sub nom. <em>Balthazar </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>428 F. Supp. 425 (D. Mass. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The United States Supreme Court has recently repelled vagueness challenges to statutes regulating unnatural sexual activity. In <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Locke, </em>423 U.S. 48, 50 (1975), the Tennessee statute proscribing the \u201ccrime against nature\u201d was held not vague as applied to cunnilingus, because it complied with the due process requirement \u201cthat the law give sufficient warning that men may conduct themselves so as to avoid that which is forbidden.\u201d The Court stated that \u201c[vjiewed against this [due process] standard, the phrase \u2018crimes against nature\u2019 is no more vague than many other terms used to describe criminal offenses at common law and now codified in state and federal penal codes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>414 U.S. 21 (1973). Cf. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney, </em>425 U.S. 901 (1976), aff\u2019g 403 F. Supp. 1199 (E.D. Va. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">\u201cIt is well established that vagueness challenges to statutes which do not involve First Amendment freedoms must be examined in the light of the facts of the case at hand.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>423 U.S. 87, 92 (1975). <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mazurie, </em>419 U.S. 544, 550 (1975). <em>United States </em>v. <em>National Dairy Prods. Corp., </em>372 U.S. 29, 33 (1963). We must thus assess the asserted vagueness of a statute forbidding \u201cunnatural sexual intercourse\u201d in the context of evidence that the defendant penetrated the mouth of a young girl with his penis.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">2. <em>Statutory discussion. </em>The evolution of the present statutory scheme requires some discussion. Prior to 1974, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 23, as appearing in St. 1966, c. 291, made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>it a crime to \u201cunlawfully and carnally [know] and [abuse] a female child under sixteen years of age....\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The crime had been described as \u201cconsensual intercourse with a female under the age of sixteen years... (commonly called \u2018statutory rape\u2019).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franks, </em>365 Mass. 74, 77 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">While it is unnecessary to trace the lineage of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 23, in great detail, it is clear that its history is entwined with that of the common and statutory law of rape. As stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCan, </em>277 Mass. 199, 203 (1931), \u201c[r]ape is the carnal knowledge of any woman above the age of consent against her will, <em>and of a female child under the age of consent with or against her wilt, </em>its essence is the felonious and violent penetration of the person of the female by the defendant\u201d (emphasis added). In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roosnell, </em>143 Mass. 32, 38 (1886), the court said that \u201cin Massachusetts the offence of unlawfully and carnally knowing and abusing a female child under the age of ten years is, and for more than two hundred years has been, known and designated as rape.\u201d The court then explained why in such a case it is \u201cnot necessary to aver or prove that the acts were done against her will, or without her consent. The reason is, that, from her tender years, she is held in law to be incapable of giving a valid consent to such acts, and the law conclusively presumes that she did not consent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 39.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sugland, </em>4 Gray 7, 10 (1855).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">\u201cThe statutory crime of carnally knowing and abusing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>a female child under the age of sixteen (G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 265, \u00a7 23), unlike the crime of rape (G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 265, \u00a7 22), does not require as elements to be proved that the acts of the defendant were done with force or without the consent of the victim. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roos-nell, </em>143 Mass. 32 [1886]. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hackett, </em>170 Mass. 194 [1898]. The matter of the consent of such a child is immaterial under the statute first above cited. That statute makes her incapable, as matter of law, of giving any effective consent. The statutory crime is committed even if [the act] is committed with her full consent. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>165 Mass. 66 [1895]. The Legislature as a matter of public policy, for the protection of female children under the age of sixteen, has fixed an age below which a female child is to be held legally incapable of consenting to assaults of this character.\u201d <em>Glover </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>299 Mass. 55, 58-59 (1937). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>359 Mass. 509, 514-516 (1971); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>321 Mass. 669 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">By St. 1974, c. 474, \u00a7 3 (1974 amendment), entitled \u201cAn Act redefining the elements constituting the crime of rape and related offenses,\u201d G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 23, achieved its present form. See note 2 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">The amendment to G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 23, must be viewed as part of a comprehensive attempt to redefine the legal elements of rape.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In general the 1974 amendment eliminated prior language which defined the victims of rape as \u201cfemale\u201d or \u201cfemale children.\u201d Instead, the victims are now defined as persons or children and the generic masculine pronoun is substituted throughout. Both males and females are protected from sexual assault by the same statute, which is neutral as to the gender of the victim. Nor does the statute define the various crimes with refer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>ence to the gender of the offender. The result is that the penalties for \u201csexual intercourse\u201d and \u201cunnatural sexual intercourse\u201d are the same without regard to the gender of the victim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">By extending the protection of the various rape statutes to men and male children, the statute necessarily reworks the common law definition of rape. The archaic terminology of \u201cravishing\u201d and \u201ccarnal knowledge\u201d is replaced by the more contemporary \u201csexual intercourse.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> By sexual intercourse, the Legislature undoubtedly intended the traditional common law notion of rape, the penetration of the female sex organ by the male sex organ, with or without emission.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coderre, </em>360 Mass. 869 (1971); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goldenberg, </em>338 Mass. 377, 382-383, cert, denied, 359 U.S. 1001 (1959); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCan, </em>277 Mass. 199, 203 (1931); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hussey, </em>157 Mass. 415, 416 (1892); R. Perkins, Criminal Law 154-156 (2d ed. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Similarly, the definition of \u201cunnatural sexual intercourse\u201d must be taken to include oral and anal intercourse, including fellatio, cunnilingus, and other intrusions of a part of a person\u2019s body or other object into the genital or anal opening of another person\u2019s body. Because males, by redefinition, may be the victims of \u201cunnatural sexual intercourse,\u201d the Legislature necessarily intended to treat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>modes of sexual connection other than common law rape as equally serious invasions of personal integrity. \u201cWhere it is possible, as it is here, a statute should be construed so as to avoid rendering words in that statute meaningless.\u201d <em>A Juvenile, petitioner, </em>364 Mass. 531, 536 (1974). \u201c[E]very phrase of a statute should be given some effect,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>366 Mass. 423, 428 (1974), and we briefly explore common law, related statutory enactments, prior judicial opinions, and common understanding to support our view of the Legislature\u2019s intended meaning of \u201cunnatural sexual intercourse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">3. <em>Related statutes. </em>The statutory prohibitions of \u201cunnatural and lascivious acts,\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7\u00a7 35, 35A, and of \u201cthe abominable and detestable crime against nature,\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 34, give some indication of the scope of the word \u201cunnatural\u201d as used in G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">We recently rejected a claim that the prohibition of \u201cunnatural and lascivious acts\u201d is void for vagueness in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Balthazar, </em>366 Mass. 298 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">We there reiterated the holding of <em>Jaquith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>331 Mass. 439, 442 (1954), that the words \u201cunnatural and lascivious act\u201d are \u201cwords of common usage and indicate with reasonable clarity the kind and character of conduct which the Legislature intended to prohibit and punish,\u201d and defined them to mean \u201cirregular indulgence in sexual behavior, illicit sexual relations, and infamous conduct which is lustful, obscene, and in deviation of accepted customs and manners.\u201d While we construed G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 35, as \u201cinapplicable to private, consensual conduct of adults,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Balthazar, supra </em>at 302, we found no constitutional infirmity in applying the prohibition to the defendant\u2019s acts of \u201ccompelling the victim to put her mouth on his genitals and on his buttocks or anus.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">The rationale of treating consensual adult conduct differently from coercive behavior has no application when the victim is a child incapable by law of consent to the act. The prior history of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 23, as noted pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>viously, makes irrelevant the consent of children under sixteen to the prohibited activities.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The 1974 amendment makes no change in that aspect of preexisting law, as may be seen by comparing G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22A, which requires proof that the defendant \u201ccompels... [a] child to submit by force and against his will or... by threat of bodily injury,\u201d with G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 23, which requires no such proof. The evidence at trial in the present case, that of fellatio with a seven-year-old girl, obviously takes the acts of the defendant out of the limited shelter recognized by the <em>Balthazar </em>case for consensual acts of adults committed in private.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">There is thus no doubt that the defendant has been found guilty of what is an \u201cunnatural and lascivious act\u201d within the context of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 35A.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>369 Mass. 332, 344-345 (1975), cert, denied, 427 U.S. 905 (1976); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hanscomb, </em>367 Mass. 726, 731 (1975); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaBella, </em>364 Mass. 550 <em>(1974); Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delano, 197 </em>Mass. 166 (1908); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dill, </em>160 Mass. 536 (1894); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Polidoro, </em>4 Mass. App. Ct. 794 (1976); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 770 (1975); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Deschamps, 1 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 1, 4-5 (1972). He cannot be heard to argue that his conduct was not prohibited by prior law. His argument ultimately becomes the claim that, if he had reflected on the legal implications of his conduct, he would have thought he was violating one statute \u2014 G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 35A \u2014 when in fact he was violating another \u2014 G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 23.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>seems apparent that the use of \u201cunnatural\u201d in both G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 35, and G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 23, was not coincidental, and that the Legislature meant to incorporate fellatio with a minor as an act forbidden as \u201cunnatural sexual intercourse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The \u201ccrime against nature,\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 34, constitutes a statutory enactment of the common law of sodomy, and reaches anal penetration and bestiality. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Snow, </em>111 Mass. 411 (1873); R. Perkins, Criminal Law 389-392 (2d ed. 1969); Note, The Crimes Against Nature, 16 J. Pub. L. 159 (1967). The changes enacted by the 1974 amendment suggest that anal intercourse was intended to be included within the prohibition against \u201cunnatural sexual intercourse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">4. <em>Other jurisdictions. </em>The 1974 amendment must also be viewed in the context of a nationwide movement to analyze, reformulate, and redefine the law governing rape and deviate sexual behavior.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Of particular interest, the House of Delegates of the American Bar Association adopted a resolution urging a revision of various aspects of the law of rape and calling for a \u201credefinition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>rape and related crimes in terms of \u2018persons\u2019 instead of \u2018women.\u2019\u201d 61 A.B.A.J. 465 (1975).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This resolution followed the adoption of the 1974 amendment, but evinces a spirit analogous to those changes.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">While it is difficult to generalize about the trend of these diverse and local changes, it seems clear that they are intended to broaden the scope of the crime, and to recognize that sexual intrusions other than those constituting \u201ccarnal knowledge\u201d deserve equivalent punishment. These enactments may have served as models for the adoption of the term \u201cunnatural sexual intercourse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">New York, for example, defines \u201cdeviate sexual intercourse\u201d to mean \u201csexual conduct between persons not married to each other consisting of contact between the penis and the anus, the mouth and penis, or the mouth and the vulva.\u201d N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 130.00 (2) (Consol. 1977). See Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 53a-65(2) (1977). While the defendant argues that such explicit enactments show the vagueness of \u201cunnatural sexual intercourse\u201d as used in G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 23, we think the Legislature may well have referred to those definitions in choosing that comprehensive and comprehensible term.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">5. <em>Model Penal Code. </em>The Model Penal Code has been the source of much of the recent legislation on rape and contains provisions very similar to the language adopted in the 1974 amendment. The rape provision, reproduced in the margin,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> prohibits \u201csexual intercourse [which] in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>eludes intercourse per os or per anum, with some penetration however slight.\u201d Another provision (\u00a7 213.2 [1]) prohibits \u201cdeviate sexual intercourse,\u201d virtually a cognate for the term \u201cunnatural sexual intercourse\u201d as used in G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22A, and is defined as follows: \u201cDeviate sexual intercourse means sexual intercourse per os or per anum between human beings who are not husband and wife, and any form of sexual intercourse with an animal.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">We have often looked to the Model Penal Code in our scrutiny of issues in the criminal law,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and it is likely that the Legislature considered this model in enacting the 1974 amendment. There is no question that the defendant\u2019s alleged acts would constitute deviate sexual intercourse as that term is used in the Model Penal Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">6. <em>Common understanding. </em>In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jarrett, </em>359 Mass. 491, 496-497 (1971), in considering a claim that a statute was unconstitutionally vague, this court said that \u201cif the language which is challenged conveys sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct <em>when measured by common understanding and practices, </em>it is constitutionally adequate\u201d (emphasis added). If ever the term \u201cunnatural\u201d deserves to be employed to characterize forbidden conduct, this is surely an appropriate case.

L. c. 265, \u00a7 23, to include the defendant\u2019s act of fellatio with a child. It is probable that the Legislature deemed fruitless any attempt to delineate the full variety of coercive sexual intrusions it wished to include in the overarching term \u201cunnatural sexual intercourse.\u201d While the scope of the term is broad, it is surely no broader than the conduct it seeks to encompass. \u201cWithout undertaking to consider acts not involved in this case, we conclude that there is no unconstitutional vagueness in [the statute] as applied to the defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Balthazar, </em>366 Mass. 298, 302 (1974). The defendant had clear notice that compelling fellatio by a child was a criminal act, <em>id., </em>and the legislative enactments making such conduct \u201cunnatural sexual intercourse\u201d give him no ground for complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b592-13\">The judge dismissed an indictment for committing an unnatural and lascivious act in violation of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 35A, for the reason that he considered it a lesser included offense of the charge of \u201cunnatural sexual intercourse.\u201d The propriety of this action is not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b593-9\"> General Laws c. 265, \u00a7 23, as appearing in St. 1974, c. 474, i 3, provides as follows: \u201cWhoever unlawfully has sexual intercourse or unnatural sexual intercourse, and abuses a child under sixteen years of age shall, for the first offense, be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for life or for any term of years, or, except as otherwise provided, for any term in a jail or house of correction, and for the second or subsequent offense by imprisonment in the state prison for life or for any term of years, but not less than five years.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b596-9\"> The full text of the statute before the 1974 amendment was as follows: \u201cWhoever unlawfully and carnally knows and abuses a female child under sixteen years of age shall, for the first offense, be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for life or for any term of years, or, except as otherwise provided, for any term in any other penal institution in the commonwealth, and for the second or subsequent offense by imprisonment in the state prison for life or for any term of years, but not less than five years.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b596-10\"> In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>165 Mass. 66, 69 (1895), this court said that \u201c[t]here is no doubt of the intention of the Legislature to treat the crime of having carnal connection with a girl under the age of sixteen years as rape, even if she gives her full consent so far as she is capable of consenting.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b597-7\"> The 1974 amendment changed the language of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22 (forcible rape), G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22A (forcible rape of a minor), G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 23 (consensual intercourse with a minor), G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 24 (assault with intent to rape), G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 24B (assault of a minor with intent to rape), and G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 39 (definitions for indictments).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b598-7\"> This change eliminated numerous incongruities. Prior to 1974, for example, forcible sexual intercourse with a female child under sixteen (G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22A) was punishable by a possible sentence to State prison for life, while forcible sexual intercourse with a male child would most likely have been charged as an unnatural and lascivious act with a child under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 35A, and punishable with a possible sentence to State prison for five years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b598-8\"> In many previous decisions, \u201cunlawful sexual intercourse\u201d is used synonymously with \u201cunlawful carnal knowledge.\u201d E.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Piccerillo, </em>256 Mass. 487, 489 (1926).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b598-9\"> \u201cBut from very early times, in the law, as in common speech, the meaning of the words \u2018camai knowledge\u2019 of a woman by a man has been sexual bodily connection.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Squires, </em>97 Mass. 59, 61 (1867).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b600-6\"> See the Reporters\u2019 Comments to the Model Penal Code, \u00a7 207.4, at 251-252 (Tent.

L. c. 265, \u00a7 23, is potentially more severe than under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 35A, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>there are several difficulties with this analysis. Arguments about incremental deterrence from varying potential punishments have no place in analyzing the vagueness of a statute. The salient point is that the defendant\u2019s conduct was prohibited long before any statutory amendment, and that there was fair notice that his acts were forbidden. Furthermore, the penalties in this case are not disproportionate to the offense, although \u201c[t]he possible penalties [under G. L. c. 265, \u00a723] remain Draconian.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>359 Mass. 509, 515 (1971). Within constitutional limitations not involved here, <em>id., </em>the Legislature has plenary power to determine the appropriate punishment for crimes. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>369 Mass. 904 (1976), with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neal, </em>367 Mass. 440, <em>S.

In this respect our provisions in the nature of rape are broader than those found in prevailing legislation, although some of the additional behavior would be covered by existing sodomy laws.

Tradition and biologic opportunity have rendered vaginal rape a particular political crime with a particular political history, but the invasion may occur through the mouth or the rectum as well. And while the penis may remain the rapist\u2019s favorite weapon, his prime instrument of vengeance, his triumphant display of power, it is not in fact his only tool. Sticks, bottles and even fingers are often substituted for the \u2018natural\u2019 thing. And as men may invade women through other orifices, so, too, do they invade other men. Who is to say that the sexual humiliation suffered through forced oral or rectal penetration is a lesser violation of the personal, private inner space, a lesser injury to mind, spirit and sense of self?</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">\u201cAll acts of sex forced on unwilling victims deserve to be treated in concept as equally grave offenses in the eyes of the law, for the avenue of penetration is less significant than the intent to degrade. Similarly, the gravity of the offense ought not be bound by the victim\u2019s gender. That the law must move in this direction seems clear.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
