L. c. 266, \u00a7 37,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for obtaining money by means of checks drawn against insufficient funds. They appealed under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a733A-33G, and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion. We hold that there was a fatal variance between the indictments and the proof, and reverse the convictions. The reversal may not bar reindictment for the same crimes. G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 8. We therefore decide the question, fully argued, whether the evidence would warrant conviction under proper indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">Each indictment contained two counts. The first alleged that the defendant, on August 29,1974, \u201cwith intent to defraud, did make, draw, utter or deliver a check for payment of money upon the Union Market National Bank with knowledge that the maker or drawer has not sufficient funds or credit at such bank for the payment of said check and thereby did obtain money, in the amount of Forty-Six Hundred dollars,\u201d property of the Union Market National Bank. In each indictment the second count was similar, except that the date was August 30, 1974, and the amount was $3,700.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">Evidence of the following facts was substantially undisputed. The defendants, Charles and Ronald Ohanian, were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>brothers who were engaged in business together. On August 29, 1974, with Charles\u2019s consent, Ronald signed Charles\u2019s name as drawer on a check for $4,600 drawn on the Coolidge Bank and Trust Company (Coolidge Bank), payable to Ronald; and Ronald cashed it at the Union Market National Bank (Union Market) the same day. The $3,700 check was drawn by Charles on the Coolidge Bank on August 26, 1974, postdated August 30, 1974, payable to Ronald; Charles mailed it to Ronald, and Ronald cashed it at the Union Market on August 30,1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">Both defendants knew before the checks were cashed that the funds in Charles\u2019s account at the Coolidge Bank were insufficient to cover either check. There was \u201cno credit line attached to the account.\u201d Both checks were dishonored, and the defendants stipulated \u201cthat payment was not made within the forty-eight hour statutory requirement.\u201d Apart from the stipulation, there was evidence that an officer of Union Market notified Ronald by telephone that the checks had been dishonored, that Charles was informed of their dishonor by his brother within a short period of time, and that the amount of the checks was eventually paid in full. The final payment of $1,700 was made March 9,1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">From the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement to the jury, it appeared that both checks were drawn on the Coolidge Bank and were cashed at the Union Market. The defendants thereupon moved to dismiss the indictments; the motion was denied, and they excepted. The proof was in accord with the opening, and the defendants moved for directed verdicts at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case. The judge reserved decision, and denied the motions after both sides had rested. On conviction, each defendant received two concurrent suspended sentences of six months in a house of correction and was placed on probation for two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">1. <em>Prima facie evidence. </em>\u201cAs against the maker or drawer thereof,\u201d the drawing of a check, \u201cpayment of which is refused by the drawee,\u201d is \u201cprima facie evidence of intent to defraud and of knowledge of insufficient funds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>in, or credit with, such bank,\u201d unless the drawer pays the holder \u201cwithin two days after receiving notice that such check... has not been paid by the drawee.\u201d G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 37. The defendants now contend that Charles was never notified of the return of the checks for insufficient funds, and hence that there was no \u201cprima facie evidence.\u201d We think this contention is barred by their stipulation \u201cthat payment was not made within the forty-eight hour statutory requirement.\u201d Moreover, we think that Charles received \u201cnotice\u201d when he was informed by his brother that the checks had been dishonored. Charles was the drawer of both checks. As against him, therefore, there was \u201cprima facie evidence\u201d of the essential intent and knowledge. See <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Home Indem. Co., </em>318 Mass. 37, 40-41 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">Ronald signed his brother\u2019s name as drawer of the $4,600 check, and we think he was sufficiently the \u201cdrawer\u201d to bring into play the statutory rule of \u201cprima facie evidence\u201d as to that check. But he was in no sense \u201cthe maker or drawer\u201d of the $3,700 check. We must therefore consider, as to that check, the Commonwealth\u2019s contention that there was sufficient evidence of Ronald\u2019s intent and knowledge apart from any prima facie evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">2. <em>Evidence of Ronald\u2019s intent and knowledge. </em>Apart from the statutory rule of prima facie evidence, there was evidence that Ronald uttered the $3,700 check and obtained money thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">There was also evidence of his admission that he knew that Charles, the drawer, had insufficient funds or credit at the Coolidge Bank for the payment of the check. As to his \u201cintent to defraud,\u201d we think the evidence was sufficient to warrant inferences that he knew the Union Market would not part with the possession of the money except in return for a check drawn on a sufficient deposit, and that he intended to obtain the money through the implied representation, known by him to be false, that the check was of that character. If there was such a fraud, his intent to repay the money at a later time would not excuse it. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coe, </em>115 Mass. 481, 502-503 (1874).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">3. <em>Variance. </em>We read the words \u201ccheck... upon any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>bank\u201d in G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 37, as referring to the drawee bank. The drawer impliedly represents that he has sufficient funds or credit at that bank for the payment of the checks drawn by him \u201cupon\u201d that bank. When Charles drew a check on the Coolidge Bank, he made no representation that he had funds or credit at the Union Market. Thus an indictment charging that he did \u201cdraw\u201d or \u201cutter\u201d a check on the Union Market did not accurately describe the act proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">Under G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 35, a defendant is not to be acquitted on the ground of variance between the allegations and proof \u201cif the essential elements of the crime are correctly stated, unless he is thereby prejudiced in his defence. He shall not be acquitted by reason of an immaterial misnomer of a third party____\u201d In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Azer, </em>308 Mass. 153, 154-155 (1941), the defendant was charged with unlawfully selling alcoholic beverages to Harry Jones. When it appeared that the true name of the purchaser was Wilfred Williams, a verdict of not guilty was directed. We upheld a second prosecution for the same sale. In the absence of proof that Williams was known as Jones, \u201cevidence of a sale to Williams would not warrant conviction for an alleged sale to Jones, unless the misnomer was \u2018immaterial.\u2019 ... The statute cited did not cure the variance, for without proof that the man was known by both names, the offence proved was wholly different from that charged, and the variance was not \u2018immaterial.\u2019\u201d Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Snow, </em>269 Mass. 598, 600-601 (1930), where proof of threats against Nora C. Downs was held sufficient under an indictment for threatening Nora Downs.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">In the present case the misnomer is not immaterial, and we do not think the essential elements of the crime were correctly stated. The indictments allege that the defendants knew that the drawer did not have sufficient funds or credit at the Union Market to pay the checks. But one who draws checks against an account in the Coolidge Bank is trader no obligation to have funds or credit at some other bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">Moreover, there is a substantial likelihood that the defendants were prejudiced in their defense. The Common<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>wealth introduced testimony that Ronald said he drew one of the checks on the Union Market, and that there were insufficient funds. On cross-examination of the defendants the Commonwealth obtained admissions that they had not arranged for credit from the Union Market. The judge\u2019s instructions to the jury did not make it clear that the insufficient funds or credit referred to in the statute meant funds or credit at the Coolidge Bank rather than at the Union Market. After the jury had deliberated for more than two hours, they asked for a copy of the statute. The judge denied the request, but read the statute to them slowly. In the light of the indictments and the proof, that reading must have been thoroughly confusing.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">The judgments must therefore be reversed, the verdicts set aside, and the indictments dismissed. Such an acquittal may not bar conviction for the same crimes on new indictments. G.
