Thornton died in 1852, before any of the testator\u2019s grandchildren had attained the age of twenty-one years. Eliza Ann Thornton, on January 1, 1856, married John S. \u00d1repps,' and died on January 23,1857, without lawful issue then living, and leaving her husband her heir at law; and he, on Novembe^.16,1872, conveyed the land in dispute to Britton, who, on March 8, 1873, conveyed an undivided half of it to Hogg; and on February 8, 1878, Britton and Hogg conveyed the whole to the defendant Wilson. Krepps died on November 16,1S73. The plaintiff, John Russell Thornton, was dhe sole surviving grandchild and heir at law of the testator, all the other grandchildren having died without issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b557-6\">There was conflicting evidence of the date of Eliza Ann\u2019s birth; the evidence ior the plaintiff tending to show that it was February 12, 1836; and the evidence for the.defendants tending to show that it was February 12, 1835.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b557-7\">The defendants requested the court to instruct the jury that, William S. Thornton having died in the lifetime of Eliza Ann,, she, as grandchild of the testator, and by virtue of the residuary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>clause in his will, became entitled in fee to the land in dispute, and that the defendants, having succeeded to her title, were entitled to a verdict. The court refused this instruction; and afterwards instructed the jury that the case turned upon their determination of the contested question of fact, whether she died before or after attainihg the age of twenty-one years; and that if she died under that age, and the plaintiff w^s the only living descendant of-the testator, he was entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b558-4\">The defendants put in evidence a certified copy of a record of the Circuit Court at May term 1878, of an action of eject- ' ment between the same parties for the same land, in which a spepia! verdict-was returned finding the facts above admitted, and also that Eliza Ann at the time of her death was above the age of -twenty-one years, and a judgment was rendered thereon, which was still in force and unreversed. The-defendants requested that the jury might be instructed that that verdict and judgment were conclusive evidence that Eliza Ann was of age at the time of her death, and therefore the verdict in this case must be for the defendants. This instruction was refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b558-5\">The. defendants then put in evidence a certified copy of a record of the Court of Common Pleas of Fayette County at. March term 1858, of an action of ejectment for the same land, brought by Joseph Thornton\u2019s executors against Krepps (under' whom these defendants claimed title), by which it appeared that a verdict was returned for Krepps under an instruction of the court that he was entitled to possession as the surviving husband of-Eliza Ann, and judgment was rendered thereon, which ,was still in full force and unreversed. The defendants requested the court to instruct the jury that the verdicts and judgments in the two cases, records of which had been put in evidence by them, availed in law to conclude the controversy, and the verdict in this case should be for the defendants. The court refused this instruction, because by the record of \u00cd858 it appeared that the only matter determined was that Krepps, as surviving husband of Eliza Ann, took a life estate as tenant by the curtesy; upon any construction of the will of Joseph Thornton, and wdiether she died under or above the age of twenty-one years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b559-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>The defendants excepted to the refusals to instruct and to the instructions given in this case, and, a verdict being returned for the plaintiff, sued out this writ of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b559-5\"><em>Mr. George Shiras, Jr., </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AHy\">I. In the proviso to the specific devise the testator was contemplating and providing for the death of Eliza Ann <em>in his lifetime. </em>The' testator used the same language in the devise to Joseph. It is not probable that he intended that they should take absolute estates in the residuary part of his estate, and defeasible estates in the land specifically devised to them. Our construction gives effect to both clauses of the will. See 3 Jarman on Wills, ch. 48; <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Sparrow, </em>13 East, 359. Another view is \u2022 that the testator may have meant the death of Eliza Ann before the time fixed for the division. <em>Besant </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>6 Ch. Div. 604; <em>Olivant </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>1 Ch. Div. 346. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania was in error in supposing that Eliza Ann died before the time for the division. \u2014 II. Not disputing that in Pennsylvania a single verdict and judgment in ejectment is not conclusive as to title, even between the same parties, we contend that the special verdict and judgment were conclusive as to the question of fact, Eliza Ann\u2019s age. The general principle is that a point or matter of fact, once adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction, may be shown and relied on as an estoppel in any subsequent suit, in! the same or any other court, when either party, or the privies of either party, allege anything inconsistent with it; and this, too, whether the subsequent suit is upon the same or a different cause of action. <em>Betts </em>v. <em>Starr, </em>5 Conn. 550; <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>6 Wheat. 109; <em>Outram </em>v. <em>Morewood, </em>3 East, 346; <em>Aurora City </em>v. <em>West, </em>7 Wall. 82, 94; <em>Tioga Railroad </em>v. <em>Blossburg Railroad, </em>20 Wall. 137.\u2014 III. Admitting the general rule in Pennsylvania that two successive verdicts and judgments in ejectment in favor of the same, party are conclusive, we claim that, if the record discloses, in one of the cases, that the verdict and judgment were obtained because of some fact in the case which was conclusive in that^ particular case only, then such verdict and judgment <em>do not count </em>as against the losing party. The act of April 13, 1807, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>by its 4th section provides that two successive verdicts and judgments' \u201c shall be final and conclusive and bar the right.\u201d Nothing is said in the statute as to the incidents or evidence in the trials. Its terms attribute final and conclusive effect to the verdicts and- judgments, regardless of other questions than the identity of the parties and of the causes of action.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b560-4\">Mr. Justice Gray</author>\n<p id=\"AVI\">delivered the opinion of the court. He recited the facts as above stated, and continued:</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">The question which lies at the foundation of this case is what estate Eliza Ann Thornton'took in the land which Joseph Thornton specifically devised to her, \u201c provided that, should the said Eliza Ann die in her minority, and without lawful issue then living, the lands hereby devised shall revert and become part of the residue of my estate hereinafter disposed of.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">By. this specific, devise, Eliza Ann Thornton took an*estate in fee, defeasible by -an executory devise over.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">That the estate devised, to her, though without words of inheritance, was not an estate for life merely, but was an estate in fee, is not disputed, and is apparent from the description of the subject of the devise as \u201c that plantation bought of Andrew Porter and John <em>Davis; </em>\u201d from the charge, imposed upon her personally, to pay an annuity out of the rents; and from the devise over in' the contingency of her dying under age and without issue then living, thereby implying that her estate would not be terminated by her death after coming of age or leaving issue; as \u25a0well as from the provision of the statkte of Pennsylvania of April 8,1833, that \u201c all devises of real estate shall pass the whole estate of the testator in the premises devised, although there be no words of inheritance or of perpetuity, unless it appear by a devise over, or by words of limitation or otherwise in the will, that the testator intended to devise a less estate.\u201d 2 Jarman on' Wills (5th Am. ed.) 270, 271, 276, and note 2; Purdon\u2019s Digest (10th ed.) 1475, \u00a7 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">It is equally clear that, upon her death under age and without issue then living, her estate in fee was defeated by the ex-ecutory devise over. When. indeed a devise is made to one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>person in fee, and <em>\u201c </em>in case of his death \u201d to another in fee, the absurdity of speaking of the one event which is sure to occur to all living as uncertain and contingent has led the courts to interpret the devise over as referring only to death in the testator\u2019s lifetime. 2 Jarman bn Wills, ch. 48; <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>9 Allen, 516; Lord Cairns in <em>O\u2019Mahoney </em>v. <em>Burdett, </em>L. R. 7 H. L. 388, 395. But when the death of the first taker is coupled, with other circumstances which may or may not ever take place, as, for' instance, death under age or without children, the devise over, unless controlled by other provisions of the will, takes effect, according to the ordinary and literal meaning of the words, upon death, under the circumstances indicated, at any time, whether before or after the death of the testator.' <em>O'Mahoney </em>v. <em>Burdett, </em>above cited; 2 Jarman on Wills, ch. 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">We find nothing in this will to take the case out of the general rule, or to support the argument of the plaintiff in error that the testator intended that the devise over should not take effect if Eliza Ann survived him, or at least if she survived his son William.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">The phrase in the specific devise that, in the. prescribed contingency, the land shall <em>\u201c </em>revert and become part of the residue,\u201d is quite as consistent with the happening of the contingency after the estate has once vested in the devisee, as with its happening in the testator\u2019s lifetime and before any estate has vested in her.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">The direction in the residuary clause that the residue shall be divided among all the testator\u2019s grandchildren when the oldest living grandchild shall attain the age of twenty-one years, or at the death of the testator\u2019s son William, whichever shall first occur, does not necessarily require a single and final division of the whole residue upon the' death of William or the coming of age of a grandchild; for either of those events might happen before the termination of the widow\u2019s estate for life in that part of the property, real 'and personal, which upon her death must fall into the residue; and the coming of age of a grandchild might happen during the life of William, to whom also the testator had devised a life estate in other land.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>The provision that Eliza Ann, a natural (laughter of the testator\u2019s son Nelson, shall be considered a grandchild and share as such in the residue, is coupled with a provision that the specific devise to her, according to an estimate to be made of its value, shall be changed to her as part of her share. The reasonable construction of this provision, as both parties .agree, is that the estimate made for that purpose shall be of the value of the. land 'devised to her, not of the value of her defeasible estate in'the land. By estimating the land at its full value, she would take an equal share with each grandchild in the whole property, if her estate in the land became indefeasible; and she w*ould lose no more than the land, if .her estate was defeated by the contingency prescribed in the specific devise, of her dy-\u201c ing .in her minority and without issue, then living.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">By the specific devise, it is. only upon that contingency that the land devised to her is to \u201c revert and become a part of the residue; \u201d and, upon a view of the whole will, we are satisfied that the Circuit Court rightly held that she took nothing in this land under the residuary devise, and that her. title under the specific devise was defeated by her dying under age and leaving no issue surviving her.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">This conclusion accords with that of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in an action of ejectment for the same land, brought in 1874 by John Russell Thornton, the present plaintiff, against Britton,-one of the grantors of the present defendant Wilson, in which that court, as appears by opinions not officially reported, but copies of which have been submitted to us, held, and, upon petition for reargument, reaffirmed, that, \u201c as to this particular tract of land, the' estate of Eliza Ann became extinct, by the terms of the will itself, at the tune of her death vtithout issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">The other questions in the case depend upon the construction and effect of the statute of Pennsylvania of April 13, 1807, by which, \u201c when two verdicts shall, in any writ of ejectment between the same parties, be given in succession for the plaintiff or defendant, and judgment be rendered thereon, no new ejectment shall be brought; but when there may be verdict against verdict between the same parties, and judgment thereon, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>third ejectment in such case, and judgment thereon, shall be final and,conclusive, and bar the right.\u201d Purdon\u2019s Digest, 535, \u00a715.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">This statute, giving a conclusive effect to judgments in ejectment, which they did not have at common law, establishes a rule of property concerning the title in land within the State of Pennsylvania, and binds the courts of the United .States as well as the courts of the State. <em>Miles </em>v. Caldwell, 2 Wall. 35; <em>Blanchard </em>v. Brown, 3 Wall. 245; <em>Equator Co. </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>106 U.S. 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">By the clear intention of this st\u00e1tute, as by its uniform interpretation by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, it requires two concurring verdicts and judgments thereon in a common-law ejectment between the same parties, upon the same title, to conclude the right. The words \u201c'the same parties\u201d of course include their heirs or assigns. <em>Evans </em>v. Patterson, 4 Wall. 224; <em>Drexel </em>v. <em>Man, </em>2 Penn. St. 267. An award of referees has been made by the legislature, and a judgment after full hearing upon general demurrer or case stated has been deemed by the court equivalent to a verdict. <em>Ives </em>v. <em>Leet, </em>14 S. <em>&amp; </em>R. 301; <em>Mercer </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>1 Watts, 330. But in <em>Mercer </em>v. <em>Watson </em>the court, after full consideration of the terms of the statute and of the reasons for its passage, concluded that \u201cthe legislature did not intend to bar the party from bringing a new action of ejectment for the same land, upon the same title, until after two decisions should be had against him upon a full view and consideration of the whole of his case, and all the circumstances connected with it which he might thinlc material, either by two judgments of a court of competent jurisdiction rendered upon general verdicts, special verdicts, cases stated, or in cases of demurrer to the pleadings or the evidence.\u201d 1 Watts, 344. And <em>m Treaster </em>v. <em>Fleisher, </em>7 W. <em>&amp; </em>S. 137, it was adjudged that, although the statute did not expressly say so, the former verdicts and judgments must have been on the same title; because, in the words of Chief Justice Gibson, \u201cit certainly could not have been intended that a title should be barred by adjudication without having been adjudicated.\u201d 7 W. <em>&amp; </em>S. 138. To the same effect are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number><em>Kinter </em>v. Jenks, 43 Penn. St. 445; <em>Chase </em>v. Irvin, 87 Penn. St. 286; <em>Barrows </em>v. Kindred, 4 Wall. 399, and <em>Merryman </em>v. <em>Bourne, </em>9 Wall. 592.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">The special verdict in the former action in the Circuit Court had no greater effect than \u00e1 general verdict, and could not, consistently with the statute, be held to be of itself conclusive upon the general question of title, or upon any question necessarily involved in the determination of that title.-</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">The verdict and judgment in the former action in the Court of Common Pleas were incompetent evidence under the statute, because, as the bill of exceptions in the present case shows, they did not pass upon the question whether Eliza Ann had an indefeasible title in the land, but only upon the point that her husband had a title by the curtesy therein, whether her title was defeasible or indefeasible. ~ In Pennsylvania, birth of issue is, not necessary to create an estate by the curtesy.
