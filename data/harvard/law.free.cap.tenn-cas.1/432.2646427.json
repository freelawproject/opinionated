The husband attempts, without the consent of the wife, evidenced as required, to alienate the homestead. It cannot make a difference that the sale was for full value in money, or other real estate, or other tilings; here was a homestead in \u201cthe possession of the head of a family,\u201d the relation of husband and wife existed, the wife has not consented, by conveyance duly executed as required by law for married women, so then the attempted alienation must fail. This rule obtains as to the right of homestead only. The fee remains qualified by the right of \u25a0occupancy, which cannot be disturbed, while the relation .supporting the right of homestead exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">The purpose of the law.is to protect married women .and minor children from the improvidence of unfortunate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>or dissipated husbands and fathers. The facts of this case illustrate its -wisdom.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">Complainant has failed to make a case for the declaration of a resulting trust in the purchase of the lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Reverse the decree with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
