It further appears from the evidence introduced by appellee that although appellee\u2019s products are manufactured in the United States, certain \u201cessence compounds,\u201d used as ingredients therein, are produced in France.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-9\">It is apparent from the record that appellee is the prior user of the term \u201cShanghai,\u201d and that the goods of the parties possess the same descriptive properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-10\">Although It is contended by counsel for appellant that the geographical term \u201cShanghai\u201d is used on appellee\u2019s labels in such manner as to lead the public to believe that appellee\u2019s goods are produced in Shanghai, that Shanghai is one of the various addresses of appellee, or that appellee\u2019s products are popular in Shanghai, we find nothing on appellee\u2019s labels of record to support those contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-11\">It is argued by counsel for appellant that the word \u201cShanghai\u201d is a geographical term and, therefore, is not susceptible of exclusive ownership by appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-14\">The right of appellee to oppose the registration of appellant\u2019s mark does not depend upon the exclusive ownership by appellee of its trade-mark \u201cShanghai.\u201d It is only necessary that appellee establish that it would probably be damaged by the registration of appellant\u2019s mark. California Cyanide Co. v. American Cyanamid Co., 40 F.2d 1003, 17 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1198; Trustees for Arch Preserver Shoe Patents v. James McCreery &amp; Co., 49 F.2d 1068, 18 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1507; Helzberg v. Katz &amp; Ogush, Inc., 73 F.2d 626, 22 C.C.P.A., Patents, 768; Pep Boys, Manny, Moe &amp; Jack v. Fisher Bros. Co. (cross appeals), 94 F.2d 204, 25 C.C.P.A., Patents, 818. Accordingly, the only remaining issue to be determined is whether the marks in question, when used concurrently by the parties on their respective goods, would be likely to cause confusion or mistake in the mind of the public or deceive purchasers. In considering that issue and the right of appellant to register its mark, it should be understood that it is not of vital importance that appellant in its application for registration has disclaimed the term \u201cShanghai\u201d apart from its mark as shown. Walgreen Co. v. Godefroy Mfg. Co., 58 F.2d 457, 19 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1150; Gillette v. Gillette Safety Razor Co., 65 F.2d 266, 20 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1177; Helzberg v. Katz &amp; Ogush, Inc., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-15\">We have given careful consideration to the arguments presented here by counsel for appellant that considering the marks as a whole they are not confusingly similar. However, we are not persuaded that counsel is right in his contentions. On the contrary, we are of opinion that those of the purchasing public who are familiar with appellee\u2019s mark \u201cShanghai\u201d might readily believe that appellant\u2019s goods sold under the trade-mark \u201cNight in Shanghai\u201d were produced by appellee, and that the concurrent use by the parties of their marks on their respective goods would be likely to cause confusion or mistake in the mind of the public or deceive purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>For the reasons stated, we are of opinion that the tribunals of the Patent Office were right in sustaining appellee\u2019s notice of opposition and holding that appellant is not entitled to have its mark registered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-4\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1012-12\"> This cause was originally decided by this court on the first day of December, 1942. Thereafter, counsel for appellee filed a petition for rehearing, requesting that the court revise certain language in its decision which, it was contended, was not necessary to a decision in the ease. The rehearing was granted, January 29, 1943,' solely for the purpose of permitting the court to revise the language in its decision to which counsel for appellee had directed the court\u2019s attention.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
