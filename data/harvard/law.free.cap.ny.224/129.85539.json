A paper which purports to be a copy of a record of birth in a foreign country which does not disclose that it was compared with the original record and fails to disclose it was certified in accordance with the form in use in that country or that it was duly authenticated, does not comply with the requirements of law with reference to the admission of documentary evidence.

On the trial of defendant for rape in the second degree, where it was incumbent upon the People to establish that the female was under the age of eighteen years, the charge is susceptible of being construed as instruction by the court to the jury that such a document, having been received in evidence, was as matter of law not only official but a legally authenticated document.

Her mother is dead. She had been in the United States seven years in July (1916). She cattle to this country in July, 1911, then being ten years of age, accompanied by her mother and stepfather; that her father and stepfather are in Italy.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The foregoing was the only parole evidence adduced by the People upon the subject of the age of the female. Upon cross-examination the witness freely admitted that she had been guilty of numerous acts of such character as might lead a jury to hesitate or refuse to credit her as a witness. So far only as bears upon her age will reference be made to the cross-examination. She testified she was known as Rose Nuitta when she attended school, that her stepfather\u2019s name is Joe Nuitta, and that he and her father are still alive. When she went to school, seven years ago, in July, 1911, she gave her age as twelve years; in 1914 after leaving school she applied for work under the name of Rose Nuitta and being required to give her age she said she was then sixteen years old. In May, 1915, she was married to a man with whom she lived about three weeks. Upon application for the marriage license she made affidavit that her age was eighteen years.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">Upon re-direct examination she said her mother gave her age as twelve years in the school in her presence, and likewise she was told to give her age as sixteen years to secure employment and of eighteen years to secure a license to be married.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">The district attorney offered in evidence a paper which he characterized as a transcript of the record of the birth of the witness. Translated, the paper reads: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number><em>\u201c </em>Province of Reggio Calabria \u2014 District of Gerace.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AS_\">Municipality of Palcanica.

The objection was overruled and an exception noted. The paper was admitted as evidence for the purpose of not only establishing the age of the female but as corroboration of the testimony given by her as to her age.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">The reception of the paper in evidence constituted material error. Section 956, Code of Civil Procedure, provides that a record or document on file in a public office of a foreign country, certified according to the form in use in that' country, is evidence when authenticated in the manner prescribed in that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Section 392, Code of Criminal Procedure, provides: <em>\u201c </em>The rules of evidence in civil cases are applicable also to criminal cases, except as otherwise provided in this Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">The district attorney contended that the .paper was admissible in evidence under section 817, Penal Law, as a transcript of the record of birth recorded in a bureau of vital statistics or board of health, duly authenticated by its secretary or under its seal.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">The section referred to is designated as <em>\u201c </em>Presumption of responsibility in general as to child of seven years or more.\u201d Without deciding whether or not the section referred to has any application to the present case, the paper was not authenticated as required by law to permit the same to be read in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">The paper is what purports to be a copy of a record. It does not disclose that it was compared with the original record (Code of Civil Procedure, section 957); it fails to disclose it' was certified in accordance with the form in use in Italy or that the same was duly authenticated, and generally fails to comply with the requirements of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>law with reference to the admission of documentary evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">It was the duty of the trial judge to determine in the first instance as matter of law the sufficiency of the paper as evidence. That he did so by overruling the objection may be granted, but subsequently in his charge to the jury, he, in effect, permitted the jurors to determine the authenticity and sufficiency of the paper as evidence. Referring to the paper, he charge'd the jury: \u201c If you accept Exhibit 1 as an authentic instrument, a copy of a record and believe it, it would be very good evidence of her age and it would meet the legal requirements of corroboration, providing you believe it a <em>bona fide </em>official document and that it relates to Laura Passerella in fact. *' * * Is this Exhibit 1, this certificate, is that certificate a certificate of her birth? Of course, if you are convinced of that it would furnish very strong corroboration of what she says.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">That the jurors entertained doubt as to the charge of the trial judge relating to the effect of the paper is evident from the record which discloses that the jury retired at 2:30 p. m. in possession of the exhibits, that at 5 p. m. the jury returned into court for instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">One of the jurors, addressing the court, said: <em>\u201c </em>If the court please, we came out for further instructions in regard to the validity, or if this would be an authentic record of the birth of this girl as stated in this document, Exhibit 1? \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">The court replied: \u201c Why, gentlemen, it is not for me to say that it is or that it is not. It apparently is an official document. It apparently comes from an official source in Italy, and I think as to that I can say to you that it is official and <em>presumably authentic. </em>Now as to whether that applies to and refers to the girl in this case is for'you to decide and not for me. That perhaps is a question of fact, if that is the question that is troubling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>you, you would have a right to consider the name of the infant, and the name of her parents, as they appear in there. That is a question which as I say is one of fact and is for you to decide, but as the document stands in this case it has been received in evidence and thereby recognized as an official instrument and an authentic document. Does that cover what you want to know? \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Juror, \u201c Yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">An exception was duly taken to this part of the charge. The jury then retired and at 5:15 p. m. returned with a verdict of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">I have quoted this incident at length as bearing upon the materiality of the error in the admission of the paper, especially in view of the fact that the affirmance by a divided court at the Appellate Division was made under the provisions of section 542 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">While in the main charge to the jury and in the first part of the supplementary charge the jury was permitted to find whether or not the paper was a <em>bona fide </em>official document, as well as a certificate of birth of the female, the closing words of the charge are susceptible of an instruction to the jury that the document having been received in evidence was as matter of law not only official but a legally authenticated document. The document being inadmissible, the exception to the charge was well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">The jury had deliberated nearly three hours before returning for additional instructions. It is fair to assume that during that time due consideration had been given to the oral testimony of the female as to her age and the credibility of her evidence as well as to her apparent age from her appearance on the witness stand. The fact that the jury returned a verdict within fifteen minutes after the final instruction that the document was official and authentic permits of an implication that the presence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>of such document so characterized by the court had material weight in the determination of the case adverse to the defendant. Therefore, the error of the court was material.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">The judgment of conviction should be reversed and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">His cock, Ch. J., Chase, Collin, Cuddeback, Cardozo and McLaughlin, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">Judgment of conviction reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
