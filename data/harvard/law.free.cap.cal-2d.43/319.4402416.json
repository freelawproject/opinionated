Defendants and John True were jointly charged by indictment in Count I with conspiracy to violate sections 211 (robbery), 459 (burglary) and 187 (murder) of the Penal Code, and in Count II with murder. On motion of the People a severance was granted as to the two counts, and the cause proceeded to trial as to Count II (murder) only. Count I was ordered off calendar. Count II was dismissed as to John True and he testified on behalf of the People.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">Defendants\u2019 main contention is that the testimony of the principal prosecution witness, the accomplice John True, was insufficiently corroborated. We have concluded, for the reasons hereinafter elucidated, that this and other contentions of defendants are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">Mrs. Mabel Monahan, victim of the homicide, had been the mother-in-law of Tutor Scherer, a Las Vegas gambler. Mrs. Monahan lived in Burbank, California. She was 64 years old, crippled, and lived alone. From the evening of March 8, 1953, until the afternoon of March 9 she had a house guest. When the guest left, Mrs. Monahan\u2019s house was neat. At about 6 p. m. on March 9 the guest spoke with Mrs. Monahan on the telephone. So far as the evidence discloses, this was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>last time Mrs. Monahan communicated with anyone other than the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">On the morning of March 11, 1953, Mrs. Monahan\u2019s gardener, when he came to work, discovered the front door of the house ajar and telephoned the police. The interior of the house was greatly disarranged; apparently it had been ransacked; and there were spots of blood on the walls of the living room and halls. The body of Mrs. Monahan was on the floor, partially in a closet, with her head on a pillowcase which was torn and saturated with blood. Mrs. Monahan\u2019s hands were tied behind her. A strip of cloth, knotted but not tightened, was around her neck. The cause of death was asphyxia due to strangulation. On Mrs. Monahan\u2019s face and head were severe cuts and bruises which could have been inflicted with the muzzle of a revolver. In a closet among other purses was a purse which contained $474 and jewelry.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">About March 12 or 14 William Upshaw and Baxter Shorter were arrested in connection with the investigation of the Monahan killing. They were released after being held in custody a few days. On March 31 Shorter, with his attorney, met with several law enforcement officers and made a statement which was taken down by a stenographer. About April 14 Shorter disappeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">On April 11 John True was arrested in Grass Valley and informed that Shorter had implicated him in the killing, lie was held in the Burbank jail until April 16 and was released after he had repeatedly denied any participation in the offense and disclaimed acquaintance with any defendant except Santo. True was rearrested on June 2 in San Francisco and agreed to testify as a witness for the People in return for an agreement by a Los Angeles deputy district attorney that if True told the truth he would not be prosecuted for any offense in Los Angeles County.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">True\u2019s testimony was substantially as follows: True became acquainted with Santo in Grass Valley in January, 1952. In early March True mentioned to Santo that he intended to go to Los Angeles to inquire about a job; Santo said that he was going to Los Angeles on business; and True accepted Santo\u2019s invitation to ride with him. As they drove to Los Angeles Santo told True that he was making the trip because of \u201ca gold deal . . . He said he had access to placer gold.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">True and Santo stayed at a motel in El Monte for two days. While they were there Santo introduced True to Perkins. Santo and True then moved to another motel, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Sunlight Motel in El Monte, where they stayed for one night. On March 7, 1953, they moved to the La Bonita Motel, also in El Monte. Shorter and Upshaw visited Santo there; True met them, then left the motel while they talked with Santo. Thereafter Santo told True that Shorter was a \u201cbox man\u201d and explained that this meant that Shorter was experienced in \u201cblowing a safe, opening a safe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">On the morning of March 9 Perkins brought Mrs. Graham to the La Bonita Motel. The three defendants and True drove in Santo\u2019s car to a \u201cdrive-in stand\u201d where they met Upshaw and Shorter. Santo got in the car with Upshaw and Shorter and conversed with them. True heard only a part of the conversation; he heard Upshaw say, \u201cI don\u2019t want no part of it\u201d; Shorter said that he did not \u201clike the idea of a woman going along\u201d and Santo replied, \u201cI will assure you this one is all right in the event that we need her to make an entrance. \u2019 \u2019 Santo returned to his own car, said that Upshaw \u201chas backed completely out,\u201d and asked, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Perkins and Mrs. Graham replied, \u201cWhatever you want to do.\u201d True said, \u201cWhatever you folks want to do.\u201d Santo returned to Shorter\u2019s car after telling Perkins to follow Shorter. True heard no one say where they were going. The two ears drove past the Monahan home. Santo pointed to the house and Perkins said, \u201cThat must be the place.\u201d Thereafter Santo told Shorter to meet defendants and True that evening at a designated parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">After True and Santo returned to the motel, True asked Santo \u201cwhat the score was.\u201d Santo said that Tutor Scherer had brought money from Las Vegas a \u201chundred thousand dollars at a time\u201d and hidden it in the Monahan house. True said that he would \u201cgo . . . along on the job\u201d if Santo could assure him that no one would be hurt.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">. About 6 p. m. on March 9 defendants, True, and Shorter met at the parking lot. True, the only member of the party without gloves, purchased a pair. Perkins gave True a gun and told him not to come back without it. The party drove to Mrs. Monahan\u2019s house. Santo told Mrs. Graham to \u201cring the doorbell . . . and if there was anyone home, to detain them until we got there.\u201d Mrs. Graham entered the house. True followed her and saw her striking Mrs. Monahan on the face and head with a gun. Mrs. Monahan collapsed and Mrs. Graham put a pillow slip over her head. Meanwhile, Santo, Perkins, and Shorter had entered the house. Perkins tied Mrs. Monahan\u2019s hands behind her and dragged her to a closet. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>Santo tied a strip of cloth around her face. Defendants, True, and Shorter searched the house for fifteen or twenty minutes; they found no safe, money, or jewels. They left the house together; True and the defendants returned to the La Bonita Motel; and about midnight Santo and True left for Grass Valley.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The following evidence was introduced by the People in corroboration of True\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">William Upshaw testified as follows: He met Santo in Auburn in February, 1953, and in Los Angeles on March 6 in connection with \u201ca gold transaction.\u201d On the morning of March 7 Upshaw took Shorter to meet Santo at the La Bonita Motel. There Upshaw and Shorter were introduced to True. True left the motel while the other three talked about the purchase of gold. On March 9 Shorter and Upshaw met defendants and True at the \u201cdrive-in.\u201d Santo got in Shorter\u2019s car, which was parked very close to Santo\u2019s car. Shorter told Santo that he \u201cdecided he wasn\u2019t going to go\u201d and Upshaw \u201cwasn\u2019t going to go\u201d because a \u201crecord downtown\u201d indicated that they \u201chad previously eased the place, or one of Tutor Scherer\u2019s places.\u201d Santo replied that \u201che was definitely going to go through with it . . . [W]e are going to go in the place tonight.\u201d Shorter said that he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to have anything to do with women anyway, \u2019 \u2019 and Santo said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about her because she knows what the hell will happen if she ever opens her mouth.\u201d Shorter then said, \u201cWell, if I am going to get the blame for it, I might as well go for the money.\u201d Santo returned to his car, told Perkins, Mrs. Graham, and True that Shorter \u201chad decided to go\u201d but that Upshaw \u201cdefinitely wasn\u2019t going to go.\u201d Santo asked Perkins, Mrs. Graham, and True what they wished to do, and they all agreed to accompany him. Santo returned to Shorter\u2019s car, said \u201cwe\u2019ll drive by the place,\u201d told Perkins, Mrs. Graham, and True to follow, directed Shorter to the Monahan house, and pointed at it as they drove past. Santo arranged to meet Shorter at a parking lot that afternoon,- then returned to the other defendants and True.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Samuel Sirianni, a policeman, gave the following testimony, which was offered and received only against Mrs. Graham to show consciousness of guilt and admissions against interest: Sirianni had three conversations with Mrs. Graham while she was in jail awaiting trial. He represented to her that he intended to help her account for her whereabouts on the night of the murder. During one of these conversations Mrs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>Graham admitted that she was with Santo, Perkins, and True on March 9 from 8 p. m. until midnight. She also said, \u201cWithout you as an alibi, I\u2019m doomed to the gas chamber.\u201d Sirianni asked when the murder took place; Mrs. Graham replied that it was on March 9; \u201c \u2018Actually,\u2019 she said, \u2018it was the morning of the 10th. \u2019 \u201d Sirianni inquired several times about Shorter; Mrs. Graham said, \u201cHe is well taken care of . . . Yes, been done away with. I assure you he won\u2019t be at the trial. \u2019 \u2019 In reply to Sirianni\u2019s question whether she thought their alibi would be sufficient, she said, \u201cI do\u2014for this reason \u2014there\u2019s not one shred of evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The People also introduced evidence that about April 10 defendants left their respectives homes and took up residence at the Ambassador Motel. At that time the newspapers were carrying the story that defendants had been implicated in the Monahan killing. Mrs. Graham testified that about the time defendants moved they heard from a friend of Perkins that True had named them in connection with the murder. Prom the Ambassador Motel defendants moved to Seal Beach. After about three days they went to Lynwood, to a building which was in part a machine shop and in part a small apartment ; they were arrested there on May 4, 1953.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">\n<em>The Witness Vpshaw as an Accomplice</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A0C\">Defendants contend that Upshaw was an accomplice as a matter of law; that, therefore, his testimony cannot be considered in corroboration of True; and that the court erred in failing to so instruct the jury. An accomplice is \u201cone who is liable to prosecution for the identical offense charged against the defendant on trial in the cause in which the testimony of the accomplice is given.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1111.)  If the undisputed evidence establishes that a witness is an accomplice, the jury should be so instructed, but if the facts as to complicity are in dispute, the question should be left to the jury. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Barclay </em>(1953), 40 Cal.2d 146, 151-152 [252 P.2d 321], and eases there cited.)  Upshaw testified that Shorter, in Upshaw\u2019s presence, told Santo that Upshaw would not join in the proposed criminal enterprise; he testified further that he (Upshaw) was not in defendants\u2019 company on the evening of the murder. His mere presence in the automobile when the defendants and True \u201ccased\u201d the Monahan home would not make him an accomplice.  Since it could be inferred that Upshaw was not an accomplice, the question whether he was, was properly left to the jury, and as a reviewing court, we are bound to presume in favor of affirming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>the judgment that the jury found that he was not an accomplice.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">\n<em>Sufficiency of the Corroboration of True</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">Defendants\u2019 main contention is that the People failed to produce sufficient evidence corroborative of the testimony of the accomplice True. Section 1111 of the Penal Code, quoted in part above, provides, \u201cA conviction cannot be had upon the testimony of an accomplice unless it be corroborated by such other evidence as shall tend to connect the defendant with the commission of the offense; and the corroboration is not sufficient if it merely shows the commission of the offense or the circumstances thereof. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">The accomplice need not be corroborated as to every fact to which he testifies.  The evidence which corroborates the accomplice need not be direct; it may be circumstantial.  Although the corroborating evidence must do more than raise a conjecture or suspicion of guilt, it is sufficient if it tends in some degree to implicate the defendant. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Henderson </em>(1949), 34 Cal.2d 340, 342-343 [209 P.2d 785]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Barclay </em>(1953), <em>supra, </em>40 Cal.2d 146, 156; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wayne </em>(1953), 41 Cal.2d 814, 822 [264 P.2d 547].)  To be sufficient the implicating evidence \u201cmust relate to some act or fact which is an element of the offense.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gallardo </em>(1953), 41 Cal.2d 57, 63 [257 P.2d 29].)</p>\n<p id=\"AUy\">The independent evidence which tends to connect Mrs. Graham with the crime (her admissions to Officer Sirianni, her attempt to rig a false alibi, and her flight after she knew she was suspected of the crime) is sufficient.  False and contradictory statements of a defendant in relation to the charge are themselves corroborative evidence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Taylor </em>(1924), 70 Cal.App. 239, 244 [232 P. 998].)</p>\n<p id=\"b351-12\">Mrs. Graham in her testimony \u201cventured upon an explanation [of her flight] so unusual that the triers of fact could conclude that it was an intentional fabrication indicating consciousness of guilt and the absence of any true exculpatory explanation.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wayne </em>(1953), <em>supra, </em>41 Cal.2d 814, 823.) She testified that in early April, 1953, after she had left her home and was staying in a house in El Monte owned by Perkins, Santo also moved into the El Monte house; that the defendants then moved to the Ambassador Motel on Figueroa Street in Los Angeles \u201cto meet a friend of ours on a guano deal. . . . [T]he party that was supposed to come down on business for the guano we didn\u2019t know whether he would be able to locate the place in El Monte, he wasn\u2019t too <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>familiar with it; so we figured that out there [the Ambassador Motel] he wouldn\u2019t have any trouble finding it\u201d; that she was interested in the guano deal because she thought that she might invest some money in it; that she anticipated getting this money by gambling, one of her usual occupations (she worked for Perkins as a \u201cshill\u201d). In addition to the foregoing testimony as to the reason for defendants\u2019 moving to the Ambassador Motel, Mrs. Graham, in answer to the question, \u201cwhat was the occasion for your moving?\u201d testified, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t recall now whether it was just after we had moved to the motel or if it was just before, . . . but someone had called Mr. Perkins and told him that the police had arrested a Mr. John True in connection with the Monahan murder case; and Mr. True had implicated . . . Mr. Perkins and Mr. Santo and myself.\u201d Mrs. Graham further testified that she read newspaper articles which stated that True had accused defendants of the Monahan killing (this information was first published the night of April 13) and that about the time she read such articles defendants moved from the Ambassador Motel to the Sunset Motor Motel in Seal Beach ; that they stayed there \u201cfrom one to three days, I believe, I am not sure, \u2019 \u2019 and that they then moved to an apartment in Lynwood and remained there until May 3, when they were arrested; that she read in the newspapers that Baxter Shorter had disappeared on the night of April 14, 1953, and that it was believed he had been kidnapped; that after the newspapers stated that True had accused defendants of the Monahan killing defendants engaged an attorney and on his advice defendants moved to the Lynwood apartment, which belonged to an investigator to whom the attorney had referred defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">There is other nonaccompliee testimony, sufficient although perhaps slight, which tends to show that the association of Santo, Perkins, and True, as well as Mrs. Graham, was not innocent but connected with and for the purpose of committing a crime on the night of March 9 at the house of Mrs. Monahan. According to the witness William Upshaw, not a conspirator, on the morning of March 9 Santo, Perkins, Shorter, True and Mrs. Graham agreed that on that evening they would join in some sort of activity in which Upshaw refused to participate; Santo said, \u201cwe\u2019ll drive by the place,\u201d and at his direction the entire party drove past Mrs. Monahan\u2019s house; Santo thereafter arranged to meet Shorter on the evening of March 9 at the place where, according to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>testimony of the witness True, the persons who did participate in the Monahan killing met.  Independent evidence, not corroborative because it merely shows the commission of the offense and the circumstances thereof (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1111), supports the conclusion that the crime was first degree murder in the attempt to commit robbery;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> there is corroborative evidence relating to an act or fact which is an element of the offense; i.e., there is evidence that the purpose of the planned visit to Mrs. Monahan\u2019s house was the obtaining of money<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in a criminal manner.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> From the common intent of defendants and of Shorter and True, as evidenced to the witness Upshaw, it may be inferred, in the light of the other circumstances shown, that the defendants did go to the Monahan dwelling and commit the crime of which they have been convicted. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Alcalde </em>(1944), 24 Cal.2d 177, 185 [148 P.2d 627].)</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The record contains the following nonaccomplice testimony as to the conduct of defendants after March 9, the night of the slaying: Mrs. Perkins testified that her husband left their home in Alhambra \u201cthe first week of April\u201d and never returned. Harriet Henson, common law wife of Santo, testified that Santo returned from Los Angeles to their home in Auburn on the afternoon of March 10; that later that evening True came to their house. On the afternoon of April 10, 1953, Santo registered for defendants at the Ambassador Motel under the designation \u201cJ. S. Santo &amp; Party\u201d; Mrs. Graham had her infant boy with her, but the child was no longer with the party when they checked out on April 14. As previously indicated, Los Angeles newspapers published the night of April 13 contained articles which stated that True was in custody in connection with the Monahan killing and had accused persons named \u201cJack,\u201d \u201cEmmett,\u201d and \u201cBarbara.\u201d On the afternoon of May 4, 1953, defendants were arrested in Lynwood in the small apartment adjoining a machine shop. The apartment consisted of a front room which contained a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>mattress lying on the floor, a \u201cbedroom with a bed and some miscellaneous furniture, very small,\u201d a kitchen and a service porch.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">In connection with the evidence last above summarized, defendants Santo and Perkins urge that the evidence of their association is not sufficient corroboration; that \u201cThere was nothing ... in connection with their registration as occupants of the Ambassador Motel to indicate that any attempt had been made to conceal their identity. Their removal from that Motel and their occupancy of other premises at the time of their arrest was, . . . upon the undisputed testimony [the testimony of Barbara Graham], upon the instigation and advice of an attorney upon whom they had every legal right to rely. ... As to the association of [Santo and Perkins] . . . with their co-defendant Barbara Graham, following the commission of the offense charged in the indictment, ... it may reveal some anxiety under the reported disappearance of Baxter Shorter, but no where does it show flight, concealment or consciousness of guilt in connection with the alleged murder of Mabel Monahan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">It is true that the evidence of the conduct of defendants between the time of the slaying and the time of the arrest does not specifically and directly evidence consciousness of guilt of the killing of Mrs. Monahan, any more than it evidences consciousness of guilt of the reported kidnapping of Shorter or consciousness of preparation for a \u201cguano deal.\u201d It was for the jury to determine the weight, if any, against defendants of such evidence. They could view the conduct of defendants as evidence of flight.  And the flight of one who knows that he is suspected of or charged with crime may be indicative of guilt <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hoyt </em>(1942), 20 Cal.2d 306, 313 [125 P.2d 29]) and corroborative of an accomplice\u2019s testimony <em>(People </em>v. <em>Armstrong </em>(1896), 114 Cal. 570, 574 [46 P. <em>611]; People </em>v. <em>Taylor </em>(1924), <em>supra, </em>70 Cal.App. 239, 244; <em>People </em>v. <em>White </em>(1941), 48 Cal.App.2d 90, 95 [119 P.2d 383]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Parker </em>(1947), 80 Cal.App.2d 128, 134 [181 P.2d 16]). Whether the actions of defendants amounted to flight and denoted a consciousness of guilt was for the jury\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">\n<em>Publicizing of the Case, Presence of Armed Guards, and Searching of Spectators at the Trial as Deprivation of Fair Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">Defendants contend that the trial court abused its discretion in denying their motions for mistrial and change of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>venue made at the conclusion of the evidence. They argue that they were not accorded a fair trial for the following reasons: Newspaper, radio, and television publicity during the trial accused them of participation in various murders and other felonies throughout the state; armed officers were present in the courtroom during the entire proceedings; persons coming into the courtroom were searched before they were allowed to enter. It was stipulated that no member of the district attorney\u2019s office had any part in the adverse publicity. There was nothing to show that this adverse publicity was conveyed to the jury. Immediately after the jury were sworn, the trial court admonished them to avoid reading about the case in the newspapers or hearing about it on radio or television. As this court stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Gomez </em>(1953), 41 Cal.2d 150, 162 [258 P.2d 825], \u201cPresumably the jurors heeded these admonitions and, upon the entire record, we cannot hold that because of the publications mentioned the defendant was deprived of a fair trial.\u201d To support their contention that the adverse publicity prevented a fair trial defendants rely upon the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Jackson, joined by Mr. Justice Frankfurter, in <em>Shepherd </em>v. <em>Florida </em>(1951), 341 U.S. 50 [71 S.Ct. 549, 95 L.Ed. 740]. There is nothing to indicate that there existed here a situation such as that which Justice Jackson found in the Shepherd case, where \u201cdefendants were prejudged as guilty and the trial was but a legal gesture to register a verdict already dictated by the press and the public opinion which it generated\u201d (p. 51).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Defendants do not contend that the searching of the persons who entered the courtroom was in the presence of or came to the knowledge of the jury. Defendants, therefore, could not have been prejudiced by the searching. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ruef </em>(1910), 14 Cal.App. 576, 606 [114 P. 48, 54].) The trial judge stated that he felt armed officers necessary to assure an orderly trial;  the judge was correct in his conclusion that it was his duty to take whatever steps were necessary to see that no conduct on the part of any person obstructed the administration of justice. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1920), 45 Cal.App. 547, 552-553 [188 P. 65].)</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">\n<em>Other Claims of Error by Defendant Graham</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">Mrs. Graham contends that a separate trial should have been ordered as to her because evidence was introduced at the trial which would have been inadmissible if she had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>tried separately and because it was to her disadvantage to be associated with \u20181 these other sordid characters. \u2019 \u2019  A defendant is not entitled as a matter of right to a separate trial. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7 1098.)  A motion for a severance must be decided upon the showing made at the time of the making of the motion and not upon what may have transpired thereafter at the trial. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pierson </em>(1934), 139 Cal.App. 734, 736 [34 P.2d 755].) The judge admonished the jury to consider evidence which was admissible against only one defendant in connection with that defendant only.  It is not necessarily an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion to refuse a motion for separate trials made on the ground that damaging testimony admissible against one defendant and not admissible against another may be received ; in the absence of a strong showing to the contrary it is to be presumed that an instruction such as the one given here sufficiently protects the defendant. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Isby </em>(1947), 30 Cal.2d 879, 897 [186 P.2d 405].) Furthermore, the record here fails to disclose that defendant Graham moved for a severance.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Mrs. Graham also attacks the action of the trial court in overruling her objections to certain testimony of Deputy Sheriff Bowers. Bowers was asked, \u201cDid you know in August of this year that at least one prisoner was in the County Jail involved in that [Monahan] case?\u201d Objections that \u201cThat assumes facts not in evidence\u201d and \u201c-[calls] for a conclusion on the part of this witness\u201d were overruled. Bowers answered \u201cYes\u201d and testified that such prisoner was named Barbara Graham.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">Mrs. Graham had testified as to being in jail and accused of the Monahan murder in August, 1953. If there was any error in the admission of Bowers\u2019 testimony it was so inconsequential that it cannot reasonably be considered to have prejudiced defendant Graham.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">For the reasons above stated the judgments and the orders denying a new trial are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">Shenk, Acting C. J., Carter, J., Traynor, J., Spence, J., and Dooling, J. pro tern.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">Appellant\u2019s (Graham) petition for a rehearing was denied September 8, 1954.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b353-7\">The body of the victim evidenced the use of force; the condition of the house evidenced a search for concealed property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b353-8\">The conspirator Shorter expressly stated, in the presence of the other conspirators, that he would join them \u201cfor the money.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b353-9\">In the presence of the other conspirators Shorter made a statement indicating that the enterprise would involve \u201cblame\u201d and Santo made a statement indicating that talking of the enterprise with persons who were not members of the conspiracy would involve reprisal; at the direction of Santo the entire party drove past Mrs. Monahan's house, a trip which, it could be inferred, would not have been called for if their proposed subsequent visit to the house was for a legitimate business or social purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b356-11\"> Assigned by Chairman of Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
