(Prob. Code, \u00a7 1080.) He previously attacked this ruling in a mandamus proceeding, contending that the superior court sitting in probate had erroneously failed to take jurisdiction of the heirship issue. We held that the court had acted in disposition of that issue when it determined that the \u201cattorney general [had] no standing to petition as an heir\u201d; and we further held that his remedy lay in an appeal from the adverse order. <em>(Attorney General </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>41 Cal.2d 249 [259 P.2d 1].)</p>\n<p id=\"b810-9\">The testatrix by her will left certain money \u201cin trust\u201d to her husband and another, and \u201cat their deaths ... to charity,\u201d naming neither a specific charity nor a trustee. Both legatees predeceased the testatrix. The will was admitted to probate. Thereafter the attorney general filed his \u201cpetition for the determination of interest in the estate,\u201d alleging that the will created a public charitable trust, which would not be allowed to fail for want of a trustee <em>(Estate of DeMars, </em>20 Cal.App.2d 514, 516 [67 P.2d 374] ; <em>Estate of Clippinger, </em>75 Cal.App.2d 426, 434 [171 P.2d 567] ; see 14 C.J.S. \u00a7 27, p. 460), and that he, acting for the state as <em>parens patriae, </em>sought to protect that trust. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cogswell, </em>113 Cal. 129, 136 [45 P. 270, 35 L.R.A. 269] ; see 5 Am.Jur. \u00a7 17, p. 246; notes 62 A.L.R. 882; 124 A.L.R. 1237, with cases cited.) Respondent, an heir who would inherit the estate in the event of intestacy, objected to the attorney general\u2019s petition on the ground that he was not authorized to initiate such proceeding for the determination of the heir-ship issue. We have concluded that respondent\u2019s position was well taken, and that the court\u2019s order denying the attorney general\u2019s petition must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>Probate Code, section 1080, provides: \u201cWhen the time to file or present claims against the estate has expired, and a petition for final distribution has not been filed, the executor or administrator, or any person claiming to be an heir of the decedent or entitled to distribution of the estate or any part thereof may file a petition setting forth his claim or reason and praying that the court determine who are entitled to distribution of the estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">\u201cProbate proceedings being purely statutory, and therefore special in their nature, the superior court, although a court of general jurisdiction, is circumscribed in this class of proceedings by the provisions of the statute conferring such jurisdiction, and may not competently proceed in a manner essentially different from that provided. <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Westerfield, </em>88 Cal. 374, 379 [26 P. 206].) \u201d <em>(Estate of Strong, </em>119 Cal. 663, 666-667 [51 P. 1078] ; see, also, <em>McPike </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>220 Cal. 254, 258 [30 P.2d 17] ; <em>Bales </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>21 Cal.2d 17, 24 [129 P.2d 685]; 13 Cal.Jur.2d \u00a7 10, p. 463.)  In view of these basic principles, the attorney general cannot prevail in his claim that he is authorized by statute to initiate the heirship proceeding. He is not the \u201cexecutor or administrator\u201d nor one \u201cclaiming to be an heir ... or entitled to distribution,\u201d and therefore he is without the class of persons authorized by statute to file the initiating petition. (Prob. Code, \u00a7 1080.)</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">However, this conclusion does not mean, as the attorney general suggests, that he would thereby be deprived of the opportunity to litigate the merits of his claims as to the validity of the charitable trust and the required appointment of a trustee for purposes of its administration. In the event that one of the authorized persons, such as an heir, should file the initial heirship petition, the attorney general might properly appear and urge the claim which he attempts to have litigated here. Likewise it would be appropriate, in the event that distribution should be sought, for the attorney general to appear and seek an adjudication of these same matters. The intervention of the attorney general in such circumstances would be proper under the broad language permitting the intervention of anyone \u201cwho has an interest in the matter in litigation.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 387; see Prob. Code, \u00a7 1233; <em>In re Los Angeles County Pioneer Society, </em>40 Cal.2d 852 [257 P.2d 1].) But no such broad language is found in section 1080 of the Probate Code, where the authority to initiate the heirship proceeding is strictly limited as above <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>indicated. We therefore conclude that the attorney general had no authority to initiate this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">Gibson, C. J., Shenk, J., Edmonds, J., Carter, J., Traynor, J., and Schauer, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
