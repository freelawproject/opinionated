It was alleged that Hallner offered the bribes with intent to influence the officials in their \u201cacts, decisions, votes, opinions and proceedings\u201d with respect to certain pending applications for permits to \u201cconduct games of skill and science business\u201d within the city. As stated by the trial judge in his memorandum opinion, the order was based upon the conclusion that \u201cexecutive officers of the City of Los Angeles are not executive officers of this state as defined in section 67 of the Penal Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">It is undisputed that the evidence presented to the grand jury establishes reasonable and probable cause to believe that the city officials were executive officers and that Hallner offered bribes to them to influence their official determinations.  The sole question is whether the term \u201cexecutive officer of this state,\u201d as used in section 67, includes an executive officer of a city.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">The People rely upon prior decisions of the District Court of Appeal construing the phrase \u201cof this state\u201d as being the equivalent of \u201cin this state.\u201d As Hallner reads the statute, it applies only to an offer of a bribe made to an officer of the State of California.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">In 1883, this court in dictum said that section 67 was all inclusive. \u201cThe sixty-seventh section of the Penal Code provides that any person who gives or offers a bribe to any executive officer, with intent to influence him in respect to any act, etc., as such officer is punishable. By the sixty-seventh section the offense defined is that of one- who <em>offers; </em>by the sixty-eighth, that of one who <em>receives </em>a bribe. \u2019 \u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Markham, </em>64 Cal. 157, 162 [30 P. 620, 49 Am.Rep. 700].)</p>\n<p id=\"b741-10\">Many years later, one Singh, who had been charged with offering and giving a bribe to a district attorney, applied to the District Court of Appeal for a writ of prohibition to stay all proceedings upon the indictment. In denying Singh relief, the court referred to section 343 of the Political Code, as then in effect (see Gov. Code, \u00a7 1001) which classified the district attorney as \u201ca civil executive officer.\u201d It also said: \u201c [T]here is no other section in the Penal Code which makes it a crime to give or offer a bribe to an executive officer, either county or state, for the purpose of corruptly influencing his official action than section 67, and we shall not commit ourselves to the belief . . . that the legislature has either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>intentionally or inadvertently omitted to pass a law authorizing the punishment of a person for corrupting or attempting to corrupt a county executive officer.\u201d <em>(Singh </em>V. <em>Superior Court, </em>44 Cal.App. 64, 67 [185 P. 985].)</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Hallner argues that, after the court determined the status of the' district attorney, further discussion of the questions presented constitutes dictum. But the holding that section 67 includes any executive officer \u201cin the state\u201d was expressly made the ground of decision. At the least, it was an alternative one. Dictum in <em>Gayer </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>60 Cal.App.2d 616, 619 [141 P.2d 514], supports this analysis of the Singh opinion. \u20181 [It] did not directly hold that the district attorney was a state officer, but held in view of the fact that the Legislature did not make any provision relating to the bribing of an executive county officer, as distinguished from an executive state officer, the term executive officer of the state was all inclusive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">Hallner next contends that if the Singh case is more than dictum, it should be overruled. He argues that section 67 is not ambiguous, hence not subject to interpretation.  But the word \u201cof\u201d has different meanings. It may be used in its possessive sense or to indicate geographic location. \u201cLand of the state\u201d means \u201cland within the state.\u201d <em>(Sisson </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors of Buena Vista County, </em>128 Iowa 442 [104 N.W. 454, 70 L.R.A. 440].) \u201cCity Court of Macon\u201d means the city court should be located in Macon. <em>(Ivey </em>v. <em>State, </em>112 Ga. 175 [37 S.E. 398].) \u201cHighways of Baltimore city\u201d is not descriptive of or relating to title or ownership, but refers to location and municipal jurisdiction. <em>(Patapsco Electric Co. </em>v. <em>City of Baltimore, </em>110 Md. 306 [72 A. 1039, 1041].) \u201cCourts of the state\u201d means \u201ccourts in the state.\u201d <em>(Gregory </em>v. <em>City of Memphis, </em>157 Tenn. 68 [6 S.W.2d 332].) \u201cOf a city\u201d was used in a geographic sense, not in a possessive one. <em>(Avant </em>v. <em>Ouachita Parish School Board, </em>215 La. 990 [41 So.2d 854].)</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">At the time the Singh case was decided, section 68 of the Penal Code, enacted at the same time as the preceding section, declared it to be unlawful for any \u201cexecutive officer or person elected or appointed to an executive office\u201d to accept a bribe. By the judicial construction of section 67, that enactment and section 68, as then in effect, were complementary statutes insofar as they concerned executive officers. Bach of these statutes made the defined crime a felony and prescribed punishment of imprisonment for from one to 14 years with the additional penalty of disqualification from holding any office in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>In 1929, by the enactment of section 67% of the Penal Code, the Legislature made it unlawful for any person to give or offer any bribe \u201cto any ministerial officer, employee, or appointee of the State of California, county or city therein or political subdivision thereof. \u2019 \u2019 One who violated the statute was guilty of a misdemeanor. In 1939, the punishment was increased by providing that, if the theft of the thing given or offered as a bribe would be grand theft, the offense is a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Section 68 was enlarged by the Legislature of 1933 to make it unlawful for any \u201cexecutive or ministerial officer, employee or appointee of the State of California, county or city therein, or political subdivision thereof,\u201d to ask for, agree to receive, or receive a bribe. The amendment made no change in the prescribed punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">It is significant that since the decision in the Singh case, although the Legislature has considered the subject of bribery of public officers and made a number of statutory changes, it has not amended section 67.  Where a statute has been construed by judicial decision, and that construction is not altered by subsequent legislation, it must be presumed that the Legislature is aware of the judicial construction and approves of it. <em>(Slocum </em>v. <em>Bear Valley Irr. Co., </em>122 Cal. 555, 556 [55 P. 403, 68 Am.St.Rep. 68]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Southern Pac. Co., </em>209 Cal. 578, 595 [290 P. 25].)</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">The legislative intent should be ascertained not alone from the literal meaning of the words of the statute but upon a consideration of all of the law relating to the same subject matter. <em>(Stafford </em>v. <em>Realty Bond Service Corp., </em>39 Cal.2d 797, 805 [249 P.2d 241]; <em>County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Frisbie, </em>19 Cal.2d 634, 639 [122 P.2d 526]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Roland, </em>134 Cal.App. 675, 683 [26 P.2d 517].)  The statutes now in effect, in conjunction with the interpretation given section 67 in the Singh case, present a consistent pattern for the punishment of a person giving or offering to give a bribe to a public officer, or one who, as a public officer, asks for or receives a bribe. The offeror of a bribe to an executive officer in the state is guilty of a felony and is disqualified from holding public office. (\u00a767.) Any such officer who asks for or receives such a bribe is subject to the same penalty. (\u00a768.) It is also a crime to give or offer a bribe to any ministerial officer, the penalty being dependent upon the value of the bribe. (\u00a767%.) The ministerial officer who asks for or receives such a bribe is guilty of a felony, regardless of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>amount of the bribe. (\u00a7 68.) Giving or offering a bribe to a judicial officer is punishable as a felony. (\u00a792.) It is also a felony for a judicial officer to ask for or to receive a bribe. (\u00a7 93.) A person who gives, or offers, a bribe to a member of any legislative body of the state or of its political subdivisions, or a member of any such body who asks for or receives a bribe, is guilty of a felony. (\u00a7\u00a785, 86, 165.) There are no overlapping statutes and no omissions if section 67 is applicable to any executive officer in the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Since the decision in the Singh case, five convictions for violation of section 67, or for conspiracy to violate it, have been upheld although the person bribed was not a state officer. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>42 Cal.2d 540 [268 P.2d 6] [policeman] <em>; People </em>v. <em>Mathews, </em>124 Cal.App.2d 67 [268 P.2d 29] [policeman] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>98 Cal.App.2d 1 [219 P.2d 519] [sheriff]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Keyes, </em>103 Cal.App. 624 [284 P. 1096] [district attorney].) In each of the last four cases a petition for hearing in this court was denied. Only in the Mathews case was the meaning of the statute challenged and the court followed the Singh decision.  \u201cAfter the enactment of a statute, when a construction has been placed upon it by the highest court of the state, it will be steadily adhered to in subsequent cases, unless very plainly shown to have been wrong, and more especially where the construction so given is supported by a line of uniform decisions, and where it has been acquiesced in by the legislature for a succession of years. In that case, the construction becomes as much a part of the statute as if it had been written into it originally.\u201d (Black, Construction and Interpretation of the Laws, 2d ed., 1911, \u00a7 93, p. 298; see also <em>Alferitz </em>v. <em>Borgwardt, </em>126 Cal. 201, 208 [58 P. 460].)</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Hallner contends that to construe section 67 as applicable to any executive officer in the state makes the statute so uncertain as to give him inadequate notice of the offense of which he might be charged and thus deny him due process of law.  However, <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>[r] easonable certainty, in view of the conditions, is all that is required, and liberal effect is always to be given to the legislative intent when possible.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>21 Cal.App.2d 185, 193 [69 P.2d 224].)  A statute will not be declared void as being indefinite if it contains \u201ca reasonably adequate disclosure of the legislative intent regarding an evil to be combatted in language giving fair notice of the practices to be avoided. \u2019 \u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Deibert, </em>117 Cal.App.2d 410, 418 [256 P.2d 355].) As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>declared by the United States Supreme Court in a comparable situation, \u201c [t]he canon in favor of strict construction is not an inexorable command to override common sense and evident statutory purpose. It does not require magnified emphasis upon a single ambiguous word in order to give it a meaning contradictory to the fair import of the whole remaining language.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>333 U.S. 18, 25 [68 S.Ct. 376, 92 L.Ed. 442]; see also <em>Gooch </em>v. <em>United States, </em>297 U.S. 124, 128 [56 S.Ct. 395, 80 L.Ed. 522] ; <em>Kordel </em>v. <em>United States, </em>335 U.S. 345, 349 [69 S.Ct. 106, 93 L.Ed 52] ; <em>Boyce Motor Lines </em>v. <em>United States, </em>342 U.S. 337, 340 [72 S.Ct. 329, 96 L.Ed. 367].)</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Furthermore, even if prior to the judicial decisions construing it section 67 might have been subject to attack upon the ground of uncertainty, such an objection no longer is tenable. The construction of a statute by judicial decision becomes a part of it, and the standard thus established may be sufficient to satisfy the requirement of due process of law that one be given adequate warning of an offense with which he may be charged. (See <em>Lanzetta </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>306 U.S. 451, 456 [59 S.Ct. 618, 83 L.Ed. 888] ; <em>Winters </em>v. <em>New York, </em>333 U.S. 507, 510 [68 S.Ct. 665, 92 L.Ed. 840].) Since the Singh decision, one who gives or offers a bribe to an executive officer in this state is given ample notice that he is committing a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">The order is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">Gibson, C. J., Shenk, J., Schauer, J., and Spence, J., concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b745-9\">TRAYNOR, J.</author>\n<p id=\"APK\">The majority opinion interprets the phrase \u20181 executive officer <em>of </em>this state\u201d to mean, not what it says, but 11 executive officer <em>in </em>this state, \u2019 \u2019 and therefore to include an executive officer of a freeholder-charter city despite the settled law that an executive officer of such a city is not an executive officer of the state. <em>(Civic Center Assn. </em>v. <em>Railroad Com., </em>175 Cal. 441, 448 [166 P. 351]; <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>Hance, </em>153 Cal. 162, 169 [94 P. 620]; <em>Popper </em>v. <em>Broderick, </em>123 Cal. 456, 462 [56 P. 53]; <em>Otis </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, </em>52 Cal.App.2d 605, 611-612 [126 P.2d 954] ; Const., art. XI, \u00a7\u00a7 6, 8, 8%; art. XX, \u00a716.) It is urged that \u201cof\u201d was not used in a possessive sense but in a geographic sense to mean \u201cin\u201d or \u201cwithin,\u201d even though according to standard dictionaries of the English language, \u201cof\u201d is not the equivalent of \u201cin\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>or \u201cwithin.\u201d (Webster\u2019s New Internat. Diet., p. 1689 [2d ed., 1948, unabridged]; Funk and Wagnalls\u2019 New Standard Diet., p. 1712 [1933].) The very language of section 67 itself, which includes both \u201cof\u201d and \u201cin,\u201d demonstrates that the Legislature did not regard \u201cof\u201d as the equivalent of \u201cin,\u201d and that when it used \u201cof\u201d it meant \u201cof\u201d and when it used \u201cin\u201d it meant \u201cin\u201d: \u201cEvery person who . . . offers any bribe to any executive officer <em>of </em>this state ... is punishable by imprisonment . . . and is disqualified from holding any office <em>in </em>this state.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">There is no substance to the,court\u2019s argument in <em>Singh </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>44 Cal.App. 64, 68 [185 P. 985], on which the majority opinion relies, that \u201cif the legislature had intended to limit the application of section 67 to state officers, it would have been a very easy matter for it to have given apt and unambiguous expression of such intention. It would have undoubtedly said if such had been its purpose, \u2018any state executive officer,\u2019 in place of \u2018any executive officer of the state.\u2019 \u201d There is no more difference in the meaning of these phrases than there is in the phrases \u201cany Supreme Court opinion\u201d and \u201cany opinion of the Supreme Court.\u201d Each phrase has exactly the same meaning; neither is more \u201capt and unambiguous\u201d than the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">That the Legislature did not mean \u201cin\u201d when it used \u201cof\u201d is also made clear by the language of former section 74a of the Peiial Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which was added in 1905 to the same title of the code in which section 67 appears (Stats. 1905, p. 646), 14 years before the decision in the Singh case. In that section the phrase \u201cevery officer of this state\u201d was set off from the phrase \u201cor of any county, city and county, city, or township therein,\u201d thus demonstrating that \u201cofficer of this state\u201d meant an officer of the state as distinguished from an officer \u201cof any county, city and county, city, or township therein.\u201d But, according to the majority opinion herein, it was an idle act to separate these phrases, and despite an established rule of construction <em>(County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Frisbie, </em>19 Cal.2d 634, 641-642 [122 P.2d 526]), we must regard the latter phrase as superfluous. Usages similar to those in section 74a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>can be found in sections 67%,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 68,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 70<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> ***8of the Penal Code. These sections also lead me to believe that the Legislature did not mean \u201cin\u201d when it used \u201cof.\u201d Since this court, however, now holds that \u201cof\u201d means \u201cin,\u201d the phrase \u201cofficer, employee or appointee of . . . [any] county or city therein or political subdivision thereof,\u201d which appears in each of these sections, has also become superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Even if we believed, as the court apparently did in the Singh case (44 Cal.App. 64, 67-68), that at the time of the enactment of section 67 the Legislature inadvertently omitted to provide for the giving or offering of a bribe to an executive officer of a freeholder-charter city, we cannot create an offense that the Legislature failed to create. We must assume that the Legislature meant the section to be read as it was written, however unwise we may think the Legislature was in not creating an offense that we may think should have been created. We cannot create such an offense by enlarging the statute, or by inserting or deleting words, nor should we do so by giving a false meaning to its words. (Pen. Code \u00a7 7, subd. 16; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1858; <em>People </em>v. <em>Knowles, </em>35 Cal. 2d 175,182-183 [217 P.2d 1] ; <em>Seaboard Acceptance Corp. </em>v. <em>Shay, </em>214 Cal. 361, 365-366 [5 P.2d 882]; <em>City of Eureka </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>89 Cal. 467, 469 [26 P. 961] ; <em>Gayer </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>59 Cal.App.2d 255, 262-263 [138 P.2d 763]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Pacific Guano Co., </em>55 Cal.App.2d 845, 848-849 [132 P.2d 254].) Such a practice makes it impossible for anyone to rely on the written word of the Legislature and only adds confusion to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>already difficult task of drafting statutes. Thus, hereafter the Legislature must ponder the possibility that \u201cof\u201d will be construed to mean \u201cin\u201d and that other common words may also be given a distorted meaning. The harm attending the delay in legislative correction of its own omissions or its failure completely to attack an evil is outweighed by the confusion created by judicial correction of such lapses under the guise of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Nor is there any substance to the argument that the Legislature\u2019s failure to amend section 67 after the decision in the Singh case constitutes a legislative approval of the interpretation of the section in that case. As the Supreme Court of the United States said in <em>Helvering </em>v. <em>Hallock, </em>309 U.S. 106, 119 [60 S.Ct. 444, 84 L.Ed. 604, 125 A.L.R. 1368] [involving a previous interpretation by that court of \u00a7 302(c) of the Revenue Act of 1926], \u201cit would require very persuasive circumstances enveloping congressional silence to debar this court from re-examining its own doctrines.\u201d In the present case not even the reexamination of this court\u2019s own doctrines is involved. Not only has section 67 never been previously construed by this court<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but, in the words quoted in the majority opinion from Black on The Construction and Interpretation of the Laws, the construction of that section in the Singh case is \u201cvery plainly shown to have been wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">The doctrine that legislative silence constitutes approval of judicial construction \u201cmust be derived by a form of negative inference, a process lending itself to much guesswork. . . . There are vast differences between legislating by doing nothing and legislating by positive enactment, both in the processes by which the will of Congress is derived and stated and in the clarity and certainty of the expression of its will. And there are many reasons, other than to indicate approval of what the courts have done, why Congress may fail to take affirmative action to repudiate their misconstruction of its duly adopted laws. Among them may be sheer pressure of other and more important business. See <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Cleveland Ry. Co., </em>6 Cir., 108 F.2d 656, 660. At times political considerations may work to forbid taking corrective action. And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>in such eases, as well as others, there may be a strong and proper tendency to trust to the courts to correct their own errors, see <em>Girouard </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>[328 U.S. 69], as they ought to do when experience has confirmed or demonstrated the errors\u2019 existence. . . . More often than not the only safe assumption to make from Congress\u2019 inaction is simply that Congress did not intend to act at all. <em>Cf. United States </em>v. <em>American Trucking Ass\u2019n., </em>310 U.S. 534, 550 [60 S.Ct. 1059, 84 L.Ed. 1345]. At best the contrary view can only be an inference, altogether lacking in the normal evidence of legislative intent and often subject to varying views of that intent. In short, although recognizing that by silence Congress at times may be taken to acquiesce and thus approve, we should be very sure that, under all the circumstances of a given situation, it has done so before we rule and thus at once relieve ourselves from and shift to it the burden of correcting what we have done wrongly. . . . Just as dubious legislative history is at times much overridden, so also is silence or inaction often mistaken for legislation.\u201d (Mr. Justice Rutledge, concurring in <em>Cleveland </em>v. <em>United States, </em>329 U.S. 14, 23-24 [67 S.Ct. 13, 91 L.Ed 12].) In my opinion silence or inaction is mistaken here for legislation. The words \u201cof\u201d and \u201cin\u201d remain in section 67. They mean now what they meant when the section was enacted, and their insistent presence belies the notion that by silence and inaction the Legislature has changed their meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">If, despite its plain wording, section 67 includes officers of a freeholder-charter city, it will, when read with section 77<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>, overlap section 67%. Thus, one who offers as a bribe a thing, the theft of which would be petty theft, to an administrative or ministerial officer of a freeholder-charter city will be punishable either as a misdemeanant under section 67% (imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding six months, or a fine not exceeding $500, or both) or as a felon under section 67 (imprisonment in the state prison for one to fourteen years and disqualification from ever holding any public office) in the discretion of the grand jury or district attorney that returns the indictment or information against him. Such a result subverts the legislative purpose of providing a lesser penalty for the less heinous offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>Since there was no evidence before the grand jury either that the persons to whom defendant allegedly offered the bribes were \u201cexecutive officers of this state\u201d or that the bribes were allegedly offered with intent to influence their actions in any capacity as such officers <em>(Greenberg </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>19 Cal.2d 319, 321-322 [121 P.2d 713]; Pen.
