Levin, and that defendant Hyman Levin signed said 'firm name to the two notes of $600 each, payable to order of plaintiff, and sued upon in -this action. If the proof showed that these notes were, without Isaac\u2019s knowledge or consent, given by Hymen to pay or secure his individual indebtedness to the plaintiff, payee, then appellant would be right in his contention' that such payee cannot recover thereon as against such copartnership firm (Bank v. Underhill, 102 N. Y. 336, 7 N. E. 293), but such is not the proof, for plaintiff\u2019s uncontradicted and corroborated testimony is that, \u201cwhen these notes were given to me, I gave $600 for the first one and $600 for the second,\u201d and that they were made out and signed with the firm name of H. &amp; I. Levin, by Hyman, to whom plaintiff handed the sum of $600, when each was delivered to him by Hyman. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>is no evidence whatever that Hyman was at that time indebted to plaintiff in any sum, nor even that these two sums were loans to him individually, and the legal presumption is that the original contract was between the copartnership firm, who signed the notes, and the plaintiff, payee, who paid the full face thereof, in cash, to the member of the firm negotiating their discount. The authority, of one member of a firm to make and deliver the firm\u2019s notes, negotiate the discount thereof, and receive the cash therefor, cannot be questioned by the other members of such firm. The judgment and order are affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
