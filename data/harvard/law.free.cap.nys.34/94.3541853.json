The proceeding is prosecuted by her as guardian for the infant owners. For affirmative defense, it was pleaded and proved that she was indebted to the tenant, individually, in a sum exceeding the amount of the unpaid rent. Judgment went against the tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-20\">It is argued for the appellant that since the lease was by Essie M. Gallagher in her own right, and the petition is by her as general guardian of her infant children, the conventional relation of land<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>lord and tenant does not subsist between the parties to the proceeding. But, upon the evidence, the mother was guardian in socage of her infant children, and it appears that before the commencement of the proceeding she was duly appointed their general guardian. Whether as guardian in socage or general guardian, she had custody of the infants\u2019 real estate, was entitled to receive its rents and profits, might lease it and recover the rent in her own name, and might maintain trespass or ejectment in respect of her wards\u2019 land. Field v. Schieffein, 7 Johns. Ch. 150; Holmes v. Seely, 17 Wend. 78; Pond v. Curtiss, 7 Wend. 45; Thacker v. Henderson, 63 Barb. 271, 277, 278; In re Hynes, 105 N. Y. 560, 563, 12 N. E. 60; Byrne v. Van Hoesen, 5 Johns. 66. Such being the relation of the respondent to the demised premises, she had a right to lease them in her own name, and to maintain a summary proceeding for recovery of their possession. Sylvester v. Ralston, 31 Barb. 286. Though the premises be the property of her wards, in legal effect she is the landlord. Indeed, the tenant is estopped to dispute her title. This being so, it is contended that the debt against Essie M. Gallagher in favor of the tenant is a legal counterclaim in bar of the proceeding. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 2244, as amended in 1893. \u2022 But, by subdivision 3, \u00a7 502, of the Code, \u201cif the plaintiff is trustee for another; or if the action is in the name of another who has no actual interest in the contract on which it is founded; a demand against the plaintiff shall not be allowed as a counterclaim.\u201d The respondent prosecutes as guardian, i. e. as trustee for her wards; and, since she owes the debt in her own proper capacity, it is not available against her claim in the capacity of guardian. The judgment is affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
