The order so entered is an interlocutory order, under which testimony is to be taken for the information of the court. Upon the coming in of that testimony the court will enter a final judgment. No appeal can be taken from an order made upon a ruling of the trial judge \"during the trial. All exceptions to such rulings are presented by the appeal from the final judgment. This appeal from the interlocutory order is premature, and must be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
