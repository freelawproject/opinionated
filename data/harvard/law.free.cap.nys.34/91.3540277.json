Peil v. Reinhart, 127 N. Y. 381, 384, 27 N. E. 1077. The evidence suffices to authorize the inference that the way was blocked by an obstruction, and that the obstruction was caused by persons engaged in replacing the floor of the hall with tiles. It is not apparent, however, that these persons were the servants of the defendant, but it seems rather that they were workmen under an independent contractor. \u201cIn order to establish the liability of one person for an injury caused by the negligence of another, it is not enough to show that the latter was at the time acting under an employment by the former; it must be shown, in addition, that the employment created the relation of master and servant.\u201d Hexamer v. Webb, 101 N. Y. 377, 4 N. E. 755. Yor is it apparent that the defendant either knew or by due diligence would have known of the obstruction. How long it had existed at the time of the accident is not apparent; and, for aught in the evidence, it was interposed too recently for the defendant, though alert, to be aware of it. Yeither may it be said that the omission to light the hallway at 10:30 in the night was negligence, unless upon proof that the defendant was cognizant of the obstruction. Hilsenbeck v. Guhring, 131 N. Y. 674, 30 N. E. 580. When it is considered that the cause of plaintiff\u2019s injury was not a want of repair to the premises,\u2014she testifies that the repairs were then complete,\u2014but a casual obstruction in the hallway, the irrelevancy of the authorities adduced by appellant is sufficiently obvious. The conclusion is that the proof of defendant\u2019s negligence was too unsubstantial for submission to the jury. Dwight v. Insurance Co., 103 N. Y. 341, 359, 8 N. E. 654. Conceding the contrary, however, and still the dismissal of the complaint was not error. It is fundamental in the law of this state that, to support an action for negligent injury, the plaintiff must establish his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>own freedom from contributory negligence (Reynolds v. Railroad Co., 58 N. Y. 248, 250); and, \u201cwhen the circumstances point as much to the negligence of the plaintiff as to its absence, or point in neither direction, a nonsuit should be granted\u201d (Wiwirowski v. Railway Co., 124 N. Y. 420, 425, 26 N. E. 1023). In the case before us, the plaintiff knew that on Tuesday the hallway was not open to passage, that on the morning of Wednesday\u2014the day of the accident\u2014the men were still at work upon it, that \u201ca couple of planks outside seemed to be protecting some work at the side,\u201d and \u201ca few little boards may have been there.\u201d She knew, also, that the gas was not lit, and that the hallway was dark. Nevertheless, \u201csupposing that all was then done, and I could go right out to the water-closet,\u201d she ventured along in the darkness of the night until, \u201ca few feet from the back door, I struck against some hard substance, and hurt myself badly.\u201d Such is the plaintiff\u2019s story; and, assuming it to be true, it not only fails to show absence of negligence on her part, but plainly indicates that her injury was the effect of her own carelessness. Hilsenbeck v. Guhring, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">The exception to the exclusion of evidence of the condition of the hall on Monday is untenable, because the question was as to its condition on Wednesday, when, by the plaintiff\u2019s own testimony, it was in a very different state. Moreover, if the ruling be wrong, it does not affect the issue of contributory negligence, for which aione the complaint w'as properly dismissed. Judgment and order affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
