The issue of law was tried and decided while the issue of fact was still undisposed of. Whether the successful party should have costs of the demurrer was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>a matter in the discretion of the court. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 3232. The trial court exercised its discretion in favor of the party demurring and decided that- he was entitled to costs. The decision was as follows: \u201cDemurrer sustained, and said second cause of action in plaintiff\u2019s complaint dismissed, with ten dollars costs against plaintiff.\u201d The defendant moved the court to correct its decision by striking out the words \u201cten dollars.\u201d The motion was denied. The court having determined that the defendant was entitled to costs, he was, we think, entitled to the statutory costs. We do not see upon what theory the court could arbitrarily fix any different amount. It is provided by section 3251 of the Code that costs awarded to a party to an action must be at the following rates: \u201cFor the trial of an issue of law twenty dollars,\u201d etc. Van Gelder v. Van Gelder, 13 Hun, 118. The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion for the modification of the decision grant\u00e9d. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
