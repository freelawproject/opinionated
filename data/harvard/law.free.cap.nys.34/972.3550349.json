Simmons and others, to recover damages for personal injuries caused by the breaking of a platform or switch board on which plaintiff stood while working a switch in order to switch the course of the ice which was being put in defendants\u2019 ice house. Judgment was rendered in favor of plaintiff, and defendants appeal.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"Ahg\">Reversed.</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b992-10\">The part of the ice house in which the accident happened was divided into four rooms of nearly equal size (50 feet by 80 feet each) by partitions crossing at right angles. The four rooms were known as the \u201cNorth Front\u201d and \u201cNorth Rear\u201d and \u201cSouth Front\u201d and \u201cSouth Rear,\u201d respectively. James Dumetry was foreman of the north front and rear rooms, and William Kiersted of the south front and rear rooms. Each foreman had 21 men under him, divided about equally between the front and rear rooms, whose dufies were to store ice in their respective rooms. The ice was hoisted from the river by means of elevators, and from thence on runways into the ice house. The runways were swung parallel to and about 0 inches from the central partition dividing the north and south rooms, and thus parallel through the openings into the rear rooms about one-half their depth. Between the north and south front rooms was an opening, extending from the sill to the roof, 4 feet 2 inches wide. In this opening the plaintiff stood upon a platform 4 feet and 3 inches long, 10 inches wide, and 1 inch thick, supported by cleats fastened to the uprights. On either side of the plaintiff, and about 6 inches from his platform, were the runways. The duty of the plaintiff was to control the direction of the ice by raising or lowering the switch, which when raised would allow the ice to run down into the rear room, and when lowered diverted the ice by an apron runway down to the level of the ice in the front room. These runways were each 4 feet wide with slat bottoms, and as the filling of the house progressed these runways were hoisted about 5 feet at a time. Sixteen, cakes per minute passed down each runway. Immediately before the accident the block which controlled one of the switches gave way, the elevator was stopped, and work suspended. During this stoppage of the works, George Kiersted, a coservant employed in the room over which William Kiersted was foreman, jumped upon the runway, stepped on the platform upon which plaintiff was standing, which then broke, causing plaintiff\u2019s fall and the injuries complained of. There was no evidence given of any defect in the board or platform.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b992-13\">Argued before MAYHAM, P.

It follows from these conclusions that the judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial granted; costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">MAYHAM, P.

(dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"A0pK\">While not very clear about this case, it seems to me it was properly submitted to the jury. The admission of defendant Simmons, the statement of defendants\u2019 witness Dumery, which tended to show that plaintiff was properly on the board, and other evidence in the case, I think, allowed the judge to submit the case to the jury.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
