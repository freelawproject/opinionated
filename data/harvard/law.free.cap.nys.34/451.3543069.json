The counsel of defendant Meltsner declared in his opening that he would prove that his client was an accommodation indorser; that the firm makers, payees of the note, had failed; and that two years thereafter, but not before the maturity of the note, a member of that firm went to Schreiber with this note, and borrowed from him the money. But he did not state that he would prove that Schreiber knew of these facts, or of any of the facts which he said he would prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>that these plaintiffs knew of. The test is, could Schreiber have maintained this action on this note against this accommodation indorser had he continued the holder thereof? Assuming that the facts which counsel stated that he could prove would constitute sufficient defenses in favor of this indorser, as against the makers, payees, still they would not be good defenses as against Schreiber, who lent the money on the note before maturity, and without notice of any of these facts; and his cause of action would have been perfect, and not subject to these defenses; and so, too, they are of no avail as against these plaintiffs, irrespective of the question whether they had notice of them or not, for they have acquired all the rights of Schreiber by his indorsement and delivery to them of the note, and the opening concedes that Schreiber had no notice thereof. Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
