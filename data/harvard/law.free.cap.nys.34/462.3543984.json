The defendant Dennett, on the 22d day of May, 1893, was the proprietor of an eating house on Park Row, this city; and the defendant Tynan was his manager in charge, Dennett being in California at the time. On that date the plaintiff entered the establishment, and partook of food to the extent of 40 cents\u2019 worth as is claimed by the defendants, but to the extent of 30 cents\u2019 only as claimed by himself. On the refusal of the plaintiff to pay the additional sum, or 10 cents, demanded, the defendant Tynan summoned an officer, and caused the plaintiff\u2019s arrest. The plaintiff was taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>to a police station, where Tynan preferred a charge of disorderly, conduct against him, whereupon the plaintiff paid the additional 10 cents, and was released.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-3\">On the trial, after the opening of the case, at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, and before the submission of the case to the jury, the defendants moved to dismiss the action, upon the ground that there was no evidence that the arrest complained of was unlawful, which motion was denied. We think the trial justice erred. The plaintiff had a right to combine the two causes of action\u2014one for malicious prosecution, and another for false imprisonment\u2014in one complaint. Marks v. Townsend, 97 N. Y. 590. But at the trial the plaintiff declared that the action was for false imprisonment only. It is well settled that the action for false imprisonment can only be maintained where the arrest was unlawful, and without authority of law. Cunningham v. Electric Light Co. (Super. N. Y.) 17 N. Y. Supp. 372. As far as the complaint and evidence show, the arrest was lawfully effected.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">Without considering any of the other questions raised, the judgment appealed from must be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellants to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
