The defendant thereupon wrote her, proposing to take her goods, and store them for her, and asked her to give him an order for them, so that \u201cother creditors could not touch them.\u201d She agreed to this by letter in these terms: \u201cI hereby authorize you to take, remove, and keep\u201d the goods, \u201csame being in payment of your account made for supplies while living in your village.\u201d This, was August 20, 1890. On September 1st the plaintiff wrote, \u201cI give you order to hold said goods in your possession belonging to me until such time as I can take care of them.\u201d It is clear that up to this time the plaintiff had no thought of pledging her goods for payment of her husband\u2019s debt, nor to do anything more than to protect her right in them against her husband\u2019s creditors. She owed no debt, either to the plaintiff, or any one. On the same day she wrote to the defendant that she appreciated his kindness, and expressed her belief that he would \u201cdo right\u201d by her. There was evidently a very friendly relation between these parties, and no one carefully reading the evidence can fail to see that this woman confided fully in the honesty and friendship of the defendant. She seemed to believe that her goods might be taken to satisfy her husband\u2019s debts, and, fostering this belief, the def\u00e9ndant on the 2d of September, 1890, wrote her: \u201cI inclose a writing, which please sign, and return to me. When I have this, I can hold the goods together in face of due process of law any party may attempt. * * * Of course, this writing takes the goods absolute; but it is not my wish to hold them. I hope and trust the time will come when all these goods will be wanted and used as heretofore.\u201d The defendant knew that the plaintiff was not responsible for her husband\u2019s debt to him, nor for any other debt of his. It was a scheme to collect from her her husband\u2019s debt by representing to her-that her property would be safer from her husband\u2019s creditors in his hands than in hers, and, relying upon his representations and friendship; she placed them there. Afterwards the defendant sold them \u201cin such a way that he could get them together again\u201d if plaintiff would pay her husband\u2019s debt to him with interest, and his charges for storing the goods. The referee finds the value of the goods sold to pay a debt of $60, which the plaintiff did not owe, to be $331.33. The evidence in the case is practically without contradiction, and justifies the conclusion of the referee that the defendant obtained possession of* the goods by fraud. The question in the case is wholly one of fact, and, the referee having found for the plaintiff upon sufficient evidence, the judgment should not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-10\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.
