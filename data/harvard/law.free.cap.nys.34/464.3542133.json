The defendant, by its answer, denies that it has. sold or. manufactured, the articles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>referred to in the complaint, or is liable to the plaintiffs in any sum whatsoever. The plaintiffs obtained an order for the examination of the defendant before trial, in order to ascertain what goods it manufactured and sold during the quarter beginning January 1, 1895. The defendant moved to vacate said order on an affidavit of its secretary, who stated that defendant had not manufactured and sold, or imported and sold, any electric light fixtures during the quarter sued for in this action. The motion to vacate was denied, and from the order entered upon such denial this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Without considering the question as to the sufficiency of the plaintiffs\u2019 affidavit, we think the order for the examination of the defendant\u2019s officers should have been vacated, for the reason that the positive statement in the answer of the defendant, and in the affidavit of Charles H. Fischer, its secretary, is that nothing has been done during the quarter referred to in the complaint, and that the defendant had not sold or manufactured during the quarter commencing January, 1895, any fixtures covered by the patents referred to in the license agreement. The order appealed from must therefore be reversed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
