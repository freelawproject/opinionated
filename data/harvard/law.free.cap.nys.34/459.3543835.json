The defendant demurred to this complaint on the ground that the same fails to st\u00e1te facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, which demurrer was overruled, and, from the order overruling the demurrer, this appeal is taken. It has been repeatedly held that no appeal will lie from an order overruling a demurrer. Bank v. Lynch, 76 N. Y. 514; Stokes v. Stokes, 76 Hun, 314, 28 N. Y. Supp. 165; Nealon v. Frisbie, 9 Misc. Rep. 660, 30 N. Y. Supp. 551; Gray v. Rothschild, (N. Y. App.) 19 N. E. 847. The appeal must therefore be dismissed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
