This is the only exception in the record. The evidence upon this point, as well as upon every material fact at issue, is conflicting. Plaintiff testified that the defendant had dealt with him for about 12 years; that he ordered the goods in question, which were delivered and at his request taken upstairs to the head cook or chef, who receipted for them. When asked upon his direct examination whether he received the goods, defendant said, \u201cI do not know,\u201d and afterwards said he did not receive them. Plaintiff\u2019s testimony was corroborated by the evidence given by his employ\u00e9 who delivered a part of the goods; defendant\u2019s, by his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-17\">The determination of a justice of a district court, upon conflicting evidence, is not the subject of review by this court, unless it appears that he was influenced by prejudice, passion, or partiality. Prince v. Feller, 10 Misc. Rep. 422, 31 N. Y. Supp. 139. This judgment must therefore be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
