Rich v. Rich, 50 Hun, 199, 2 N. Y. Supp. 770. The real proposition with which the court must deal is whether a receiver appointed in an action for the partition of the realty, to which suit all persons interested are parties, can maintain an action for rent after the tenant in possession has recognized the receiver\u2019s title to the realty, by joining in the execution of a lease from him, in which she agrees to pay the receiver a stated rental; and this point must be decided in favor of the receiver. Whatever doubt might have arisen if the lease had not been executed is put at rest by the relation it creates. There was no fraud or imposition, and all the defendant claims is that the receiver assumed to have the right to exact the lease, and she supposed she was bound to execute it This, at most, was error of law, which furnishes no defense. \u201cIgnorantia juris non excusat.\u201d Whether the rent might have been fixed, liability determined, and the true measure of justice administered in the suit for partition (Code, \u00a7 1589; Rich v. Rich, supra) need not be considered, because the defendant by her act has estopped herself from asserting that the equitable remedy available therein is exclusive.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b715-11\">There must be judgment in favor of the plaintiff for \u00a7281, with costs.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b715-12\">Argued before FREEDMAN and GILDERSLEEVE, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b715-13\">Henry Cooper, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b715-14\">William H.
