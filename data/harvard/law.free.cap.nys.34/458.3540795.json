His-managing clerk testified that such sum was a reasonable compensation for . said services.. There was no other evidence as to value. <em>Meld, </em>that a verdict for plaintiff for part only of such sum was not against the evidence, as the jury might have found that plaintiff did not render all the services-testified to by him.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b478-10\">Appeal from trial term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b478-11\">Action by Charles F.

But the jury may have found, as they had the right, from the proof, to find, that he had not rendered all of the services which he testified he had, and that $25 was a-reasonable compensation for the services which he \u2022 had actually performed. Where the value of professional services is to be passed upon, it is the duty of the jury to consider the expert' testimony, and judge of its weight and force, and, from the evidence in the case as to the nature of the services, the time occupied in them, and the benefit derived from them, determine what, in their judgment, is their reasonable value. Reves v. Hyde, 14 Daly, 431. In that case plaintiff\u2019s lawyer witnesses testified that the professional services were reasonably worth from $150 to $250. This was not contradicted, and the judge charged the jury: \u201cYou will determine from the evidence presented to you from the witness stand what compensation between $150, as fixed by some of the witnesses, and $250, by the lawyer himself, he would be entitled to;\u201d and it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>held that the court erred in this instruction, and therefore that judgment for plaintiff must be reversed. Judgment and order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
