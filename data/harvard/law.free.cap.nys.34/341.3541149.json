J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ap3\">This is an appeal from an order resettling a decree of foreclosure. McHugh had a mechanic\u2019s lien upon the mortgaged premises, which attached after $10,500 had been advanced on plaintiff\u2019s mortgage. After the lien was filed, other advances were made on the mortgage, up to $15,000. The court decided that McHugh\u2019s lien and his costs must be paid after the plaintiff was paid $10,500 and his costs. By inadvertence, he gave an allowance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>of $200 to the plaintiff, to be paid before McHugh\u2019s lien and costs.. The decree, as resettled, corrects this, and makes the allowance payable after McHugh is paid. This is right. It was discretionary, at all events, with the trial court; and the order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
