Annexed to the return was the execution issued by a police justice on a judgment for $40. The execution recited that the action was for damages to plaintiff\u2019s house, and directed the arrest of defendant if sufficient personal property should not be found to satisfy the judgment. The complaint in the action alleged that defendant had damaged plaintiff\u2019s house to the amount of $40, and demanded judgment for that sum. The police justice, by Laws 1886, c. 602, had the same jurisdiction, as a justice of the peace, and nothing appeared to indicate that he did not have jurisdiction of the parties, or of the subject-matter. <em>Held, </em>that it appeared that defendant was in custody \u201cby virtue of the final judgment or decree of a competent tribunal of civil or criminal jurisdiction,\u201d within Code Civ.

The writ was granted, relator w\u00e1s discharged, and defendants appeal.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"Alpz\">Reversed.</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b754-13\">On the 28th day of November, 1894, the county judge of Herkimer county granted an order discharging the relator, James McLoughlin, from custody, which order contained the following language: \u201cOrdered, that said James Mc-Loughlin be, and he hereby is, discharged from the custody of the said Sylvester Wilson, as such sheriff, and from further imprisonment under and by virtue of said execution against the person, by which he was held and restrained by said sheriff.\u201d The order was filed and entered in the Herkimer county clerk\u2019s office December 12, 1894. The relator applied to the county judge on a petition dated November 27th, and verified on that day. The sheriff made a return to the writ of habeas corpus allowed by the county judge on the petition, in which return the sheriff stated that on the 27th day of November, 1894, and before said writ came to him, James McLoughlin was in his custody, and detained by him in the county jail, of Herkimer county, under and by virtue of a commitment, a copy of which was returned: \u201cIssued by H. G. Brown, Esq., police justice of th\u00e9 village of Little Falls, in said county, that the said James McLoughlin is still in my custody under said commitment.\u201d Notice of the issuance of the habeas corpus was given to Mary Haley. Annexed to the return was the execution given by the police justice upon a judgment rendered on the 31st of October, 1894, for the sum of $40 damages, and $1.90 costs. The execution contained the following recital: \u201cAnd whereas, this action was brought to recover damages to house and premises occupied by the defendant, and an order of arrest was- granted and duly executed herein, and not vacated.\u201d The execution then proceeded to state in. the usual form <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>that the constable was required to satisfy the same out of the property of the defendant McLoughlin, and then it contained the following clause:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b755-5\">\u201cAnd you are also commanded, if sufficient personal property cannot be found to satisfy the judgment, to arrest the said James McLoughlin, and convey him to jail of the said county, there to remain until he pays the judgment or is discharged according to law; and do you return this execution within sixty days from the date hereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b755-6\">\u201cDated Nov. 20th, 1894.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b755-7\">\u201c[Signed] H. C. Brown, Police Justice.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b755-8\">Upon the return of the writ, the relator traversed the return by stating: First, that said police justice, H. C. Brown, Esq., had no authority and jurisdiction to issue said mandate or said execution against the person of this relator; and, second, the said execution issued by the police justice was \u201cupon a judgment on contract, and not in tort, nor in any manner sounding in tort, nor for a penalty. That the complaint filed with the plaintiff in the action before the said police justice or in his court, in which said judgment was rendered, and the evidence given before said police justice, neither alleged, nor established, nor tended to establish, any wrong or tort. * * * And your relator further alleges that no order of arrest or any other process except a summons was issued or served therein, except the ordinary summons to commence the action.\u201d In the complaint filed in the justice\u2019s court in the suit of Mary Haley against James McLoughlin it was averred: \u201cThat on or about the 1st of March, 1891, plaintiff rented her said premises to defendant, and defendant occupied said premises of plaintiff for about three years, and during such occupancy of defendant he damaged the said premises and house of this plaintiff to the amount of $40, of which amount he never paid any part, nor repaired none of such damage, and is now owing this plaintiff therefor the sum of 840.\u201d It appears by the minutes taken before the county judge upon the hearing before him that the papers already referred to were presented, \u201cand no other evidence was given,\u201d and that, after hearing counsel for the parties, he made the order which is the subject of this appeal.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b755-9\">Argued before HARDIN, P.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AMdt\">Section 2015 of the Code contains a general provision for the allowance of a writ of habeas corpus to be made, \u201cexcept in one of the cases specified in the next section.\u201d The next section, to wit, section 2016, prescribes expressly as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-13\">\u201cA person is not entitled to either of the writs specified in the last section, in either of the following cases: * * * (2) Where he has been committed, \u2022or is detained, by virtue of the final judgment or decree, of a competent tribunal of civil or criminal jurisdiction. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-14\">Section 2032 of the Code provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-15\">\u201cThe court or judge must forthwith make a final order to remand the prisoner, if it appears that he is detained in custody for either of the following \u25a0causes, and that the time for which he may legally be so detained has not expired: * * * (2) By virtue of the final judgment or decree of a competent tribunal of civil or criminal jurisdiction. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-16\">Chapter 602 of the Laws of 1886 conferred upon the police justice of Little Falls \u201call the jurisdiction, power, and authority * * * In all respects as are or may by law be vested in or required from justices of the peace of the town of Little Falls.\u201d In People v. Protestant Episcopal House of Mercy, 128 N. Y. 185, 28 N. E. 473, Ruger, C. J., says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-17\">\u201cThe Code of Civil Procedure provides that wffien it appears, among other things, that the prisoner is detained in custody \u2018by virtue of the final judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>or decree of a competent tribunal of civil or criminal jurisdiction,\u2019 and the-time for which he is required to be retained has not expired, the court must remand him. Section 2032. Section 2034 of the same Code enacts that the court or judge is prohibited in such case, on a return to the writ, from inquiring into the legality of any mandate, judgment, decree, or final order.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">In a later part of the opinion, the learned chief judge says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-6\">\u201cWe are of the opinion that the order of the judge was erroneous, and that, it having been established by the conceded facts that the prisoner was held under the final judgment of a competent tribunal of criminal jurisdiction under the express provisions of the Code, she should have been remanded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">Nothing appeared before the county judge to indicate that Brown,, the police justice, did not have jurisdiction of the parties, and especially of the defendant, in the suit before him; nor did anything appear to indicate that the police justice did not have jurisdiction of the subject-matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">In article 3, tit. 2, c. 19, of the Code, authority is given to a justice to grant an order for the arrest of the defendant. In the second subdivision of section 2895 of the Code, it is provided that an order of arrest shall not be granted except where the action is brought \u201cto recover damages for a personal injury, of which a justice of the peace has jurisdiction; an injury to property, including the wrongful taldng, detention, or conversion of personal property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">In People v. Norton, 76 Hun, 7, 27 N. Y. Supp. 851, it was said to be irregular to go into proof, before a county judge to a return of habeas corpus, except to traverse the return, and that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-10\">\u201cIt is a general rule that a habeas corpus cannot be used to review trials before magistrates. If it appears that the magistrate had jurisdiction of the person and the subject-matter, and the mittimus shows upon its face these two facts, the writ will be dismissed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-11\">In Re Donohue, 1 Abb. N. C. 10, it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-12\">\u201cIt is safe and better, when a judgment has been, rendered, which an express statute authorizes, to leave its review to the regular and more deliberate process of the higher courts than to make of every court and officer authorized to issue this writ a tribunal summarily to decide such grave and momentous questions. People v. Fancher, 2 Hun, 226.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-13\">We are inclined to the opinion that it was the duty of the county judge, by virtue of section 2032 of the Code, to make an order to remand the prisoner,- as it appeared that he was detained in custody \u201cby virtue of the final judgment or decree of a competent tribunal of civil or criminal jurisdiction,\u201d and that it is not necessary upon, this appeal to consider the questions urged by the learned counsel for the respondent as to the nature and character of the complaint filed in the justice\u2019s court. In respect to that, however, it may be suggested that great liberality is allowed in justices\u2019 courts, and that the cases cited by him\u2014Goodwin v. Griffis, 88 N. Y. 631, and Wood v. Henry, 40 N. Y. 124, and Austin v. Rawdon, 44 N. Y. 63\u2014differ from the case in hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-14\">The foregoing views lead to the conclusion that an order should be made in this case similar to the one pronounced in People v\u201e Protestant Episcopal House of Mercy, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-15\">Order reversed, and the defendant remanded to the custody of the sheriff of Herkimer county.</p>\n<author id=\"b757-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>MARTIN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ac-g\">I am of the opinion that the action was for injury to property, and an execution against the person was authorized. X, therefore, concur in the result</p>\n<author id=\"b757-5\">MERWIN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ajg\">I think it was a case for a body execution, and that the order should be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
