Taylor, the treasurer of the plaintiff. It is alleged that the treasurer is a defaulter to the state in a sum exceeding the penalty of the bond. The answer does not contain a general denial,\u2014a denial of all the allegations in the complaint,\u2014but there are several specific denials set forth in the first defense. In all the other d\u00e9fenses, 2 to 8, inclusive, new matter is set up as defenses; and in all of them the following words appear, which the plaintiff moves to strike out: \u201cReiterates the denials of the first defense, and alleges.\u201d Then follows the new matter. An affirmative defense, not including a counterclaim, necessarily admits and avoids the cause of action set out in the complaint, and a denial, general or specific, cannot be included and form a part of such defense. A denial, general or specific, may be pleaded in the same answer as a separate defense, but not as a part of a plea of new matter. \u201cIt is elementary that a defense of new matter should be pleaded; and, as new matter must of necessity be a distinct defense from a denial, it follows that it cannot properly be associated or mingled up with denials, general or specific, in one paragraph or plea.\u201d Pom, Code Rem. \u00a7 690. By permitting a general or specific denial to be joined with an affirmative defense, a plaintiff would be effectually deprived of the right to demur to the new matter pleaded as an affirmative defense. In case an action should be brought to recover on a contract for the payment of money, and the defendant should plead as a separate defense that, the contracting parties being more than 50 years of age, the contract was void, and then conclude the new matter with a g\u00e9neral or specific denial, the plaintiff could not safely demur to the defense. In the case supposed, the plaintiff could move to strike out the new matter as frivolous; but, in case the new matter should require argument to show that the defense was frivolous, the validity of the defense could not be tested on motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
