The parties in interest, having elected to take the land as such, have worked an equitable reconversion. It is again land, and the title is in them in fee. Cases cited in 9 Mise. Rep. 686, 30 N. Y. Supp. 545; affirmed 144 N. Y. 566, 39 N. E. 642. The infant, by its testamentary guardian and its guardian ad litem, with the sanction of the court, hereby expressed, has joined with the adults in the election, so as to make it the united as well as the binding act of all. The reconversion is complete and the power of sale extinguished. If the executor, as he claims, has incurred expenses in reference to the land prior to the reconversion, and he cannot obtain reimbursement from the estate in his hands, he may plead the facts, that the court may in its final decree protect, by equitable lien or otherwise, any just demand he may have. Those who seek equity must do equity. In the meantime the injunction prayed for, restraining further interference with the land by the executor, will be granted. No costs.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b712-14\">Argued before FREEDMAN and GILDERSLEEVE, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b712-15\">William J.
