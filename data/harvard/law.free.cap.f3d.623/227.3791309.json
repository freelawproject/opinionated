We VACATE the exclusion order and REMAND this matter for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-20\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b254-21\">Defendants Mose Jefferson and Renee Gill Pratt are charged, <em>inter alia, </em>with conspiracy to violate the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act. On August 21, 2009, Jefferson was convicted of two counts of bribery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666(a)(2) and two counts of obstruction of justice in violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(b)(3). The government moved to introduce evidence of Jefferson\u2019s prior convictions in its case-in-chief as intrinsically related to the conduct at issue in the pending trial pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court denied the government\u2019s motion by written order on August 27, 2010, but stated that \u201cthe Government is allowed to use defendant Mose Jefferson\u2019s prior conviction for purposes of cross-examination if the defendant testifies.\u201d (emphasis in original).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Jefferson later made a motion to change venue and Defendants made a joint motion to quash jury venire. In those motions, Defendants raised the issue of <em>voir dire </em>regarding jurors\u2019 knowledge of Jefferson\u2019s convictions. United States District Judge Ivan L.R. Lemelle held a hearing on the motions and ordered additional briefing. After receiving the additional briefs, Judge Lemelle denied both motions, but \u201cFURTHER ORDERED that evidence of Defendant Mose Jefferson\u2019s prior conviction is inadmissible.\u201d (emphasis in original). The government then moved for reconsideration, or in the alternative, to continue the trial for forty days so that the government could seek authorization to appeal the district court\u2019s decision. Defendants filed an opposition. On September 29, 2010, the district court denied the government\u2019s motion to reconsider and its alternative motion to continue the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">That same day, the government filed a notice of appeal to this court pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731, accompanied by the required certification of United States Attorney Jim Letten to the district court that \u201cthe instant appeal is not taken for purposes of delay and that the evidence [excluded by Judge Lemelle\u2019s order] is substantial proof of a fact material in the proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Later in the same day, the district court held a status conference during which the government moved for stay of the criminal trial proceedings. Judge Lemelle denied the motion for stay, stating \u201cit was my interpretation under the cited statute [\u00a7 3731] then that evidence of a prior conviction in this context is not an essential element of the crime charged and, therefore, in my interpretation, not substantial proof of a fact material in the proceedings.\u201d Judge Lemelle gave the government until noon the following day, September 30, to comply with its other pre-trial orders, to submit \u201csomething on point on [the issue of whether the district court was divested of jurisdiction upon the filing of the \u00a7 3731 appeal] before we start trial,\u201d or face dismissal of the Third Superseding Indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>On September 30, the government filed an emergency motion seeking stay of the criminal trial proceedings<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in this court, which Defendants opposed. That same day, this court granted the emergency motion for stay until October 11, 2010. This court additionally ordered simultaneous expedited briefing on the merits of the appeal and ordered the district court to instruct the jury venire to be available for trial on October 11, 2010. Immediately before this court granted the government\u2019s emergency motion, and although without jurisdiction to do so, the district court reconsidered its earlier order. Judge Lemelle reiterated his belief that \u201c\u00a7 3731 does not apply to an evidentiary ruling concerning a matter that is not an element of the charged offense\u201d and stated that \u201cthe Government\u2019s appeal in this case does not require this Court to relinquish jurisdiction.\u201d He then concluded that \u201cbecause as far as this Court can determine, the underlying evidentiary ruling is one of first impression, the Court will stay the case to allow the Government to seek relief from the Fifth Circuit.\u201d In granting the government\u2019s emergency motion to stay, this court explained it would render a decision in an expedited manner. This matter is ripe for adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AHu\">\n<em>I. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Issues of subject matter jurisdiction are questions of law and are reviewed <em>de novo. See Am. Rice, Inc. v. Producers Rice Mill, Inc., </em>518 F.3d 321, 327 (5th Cir.2008) (quotations omitted). Before turning to the merits of the appeal, this court will address Defendants\u2019 and the district court\u2019s misconception regarding our jurisdiction over appeals taken pursuant to \u00a7 3731. Section 3731 \u201cpermits the United States to appeal orders \u2018suppressing or excluding\u2019 evidence in criminal cases so long as the relevant United States Attorney \u2018certifies to the district court that the appeal is not taken for purpose of delay and that the evidence is substantial proof of a fact material in the proceeding.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>135 F.3d 963, 967 (5th Cir.1998) (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731). \u201cThe provisions of this section shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731. We have interpreted \u00a7 3731 as providing \u201cthe government with as broad a right to appeal as the Constitution will permit.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>135 F.3d at 967.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">The Supreme Court addressed the \u201crequisites of \u00a7 3731\u201d appeals in <em>United States v. Helstoski, </em>442 U.S. 477, 487 n. 6, 99 S.Ct. 2432, 61 L.Ed.2d 12 (1979). Specifically, the Court found that \u00a7 3731 requires that \u201c[t]here was an order of a District Court excluding evidence; a United States Attorney filed the proper certification; and the appeal was taken within 30 days.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court also noted that \u201cthe purpose of the section was to remove all statutory barriers to Government appeals and to allow appeals whenever the Constitution would permit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">We have little difficulty concluding that \u00a7 3731 affords the government a basis for an appeal in this case: 1) the district court entered an order excluding evidence; 2) United States Attorney Jim Letten filed the proper certification; and 3) the appeal was taken within 30 days. The \u201crequisites of \u00a7 3731 [are] met.\u201d <em>Helstoski, </em>442 U.S. at 487 n. 6, 99 S.Ct. 2432. The district court\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7 3731 \u201cdoes not apply to an evidentiary ruling concerning a matter that is not an element of the charged offense\u201d is erroneous. First, the statute contains no such limitation and in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>structs courts to \u201cliberally construe [the statute] to effectuate its purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Second, the plain text of \u00a7 3731 limits it to \u201cevidence [that] is substantial proof of a fact material in the proceeding,\u201d <em>id., </em>not evidentiary rulings concerning matters that involve elements of the charged offense as stated by the district court. Evidence may be \u201csubstantial proof of a fact material in the proceeding\u201d without being an element of the charged offense. Moreover, and more importantly, the evaluation as to whether the evidence excluded by the district court \u201cis substantial proof of a fact material in the proceeding\u201d is to be made <em>by the United States Attorney, </em>not the district court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Indeed, once the government timely files an appeal under \u00a7 3731 and the United States Attorney makes the required certification, <em>we </em>cannot evaluate the materiality of the excluded evidence to determine whether or not to hear the appeal. Defendants rely on <em>Smith </em>for the proposition that this court must look beyond the United States Attorney\u2019s certification and make an independent inquiry as to whether the evidence sought was \u201csubstantial proof of a fact material to the proceeding.\u201d Although <em>Smith </em>did state that the evidence excluded in that case, a videotape containing allegedly false allegations, was substantial proof of a fact material to that ease, <em>Smith </em>does not stand for the proposition that this court <em>must </em>make a materiality determination prior to hearing a \u00a7 3731 appeal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Smith </em>is also distinguishable from this case because it required the court to determine whether the equities of the case excused the government\u2019s failure to comply with \u00a7 3731\u2019s non-jurisdictional timing requirements. <em>Smith, </em>135 F.3d at 967-68. In <em>Smith, </em>the court had the <em>discretion </em>to exercise appellate jurisdiction under \u00a7 3731 because the government\u2019s appeal was untimely. <em>Id. </em>at 967 (\u201c[W]e <em>may </em>still entertain \u00a7 3731 appeals certified in an untimely manner.\u201d) (emphasis added). Where, as here, the appeal is timely filed, \u201c[a]n appeal by the United States <em>shall </em>lie to a court of appeals ...\u201d and we need not consider the equities of this case because we do not have the discretion to decline jurisdiction.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">Our sister circuits that have considered this issue are in accord that the United States Attorney\u2019s certification is sufficient to establish appellate jurisdiction. <em>See, e.g., United States v. W.R. Grace, </em>526 F.3d 499, 506 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc) (\u201c[W]e now hold that a certification by a United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>States Attorney (personally, not by an Assistant United States Attorney) that the appeal is not taken for the purpose of delay and that the evidence is substantial proof of a fact material in the proceeding is sufficient for purposes of establishing our jurisdiction under \u00a7 3731.\u201d); <em>United States v. Centracchio, </em>236 F.3d 812, 813 (7th Cir.2001) (\u201cWe therefore treat as conclusive of our jurisdiction over a [\u00a7 3731] Paragraph 2 appeal the submission of the [United States Attorney\u2019s] certification required by the statute.\u201d); <em>In re Grand Jury Investigation, </em>599 F.2d 1224, 1226 (3d Cir.1979) (\u201cPursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731, the United States Attorney has certified that this appeal \u2018is not taken for the purpose of delay and that the evidence is a substantial proof of a fact material in the proceeding.\u2019 The district court having received this certification, we are not required by section 3731 to evaluate independently the substantiality or the materiality of the contested material.\u201d); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>228 F.3d 920, 924 (8th Cir.2000) (\u201cThe language of \u00a7 3731 implies that mere certification is required to demonstrate materiality.\u201d); <em>United States v. Juvenile Male No. 1, </em>86 F.3d 1314, 1326 (4th Cir.1996) (Wilkinson, J., concurring) (\u201c[C]ertification by the U.S. Attorney under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731 that an appeal from an adverse suppression ruling is not taken for purposes of delay and involves evidence material to the proceedings\u201d is an \u201cexecutive determination [that has been] deemed outside the scope of judicial review\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">In <em>United States v. DeQuasie, </em>the Fourth Circuit concisely explained the policy underlying \u00a7 3731\u2019s certification requirement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-5\">The certification requirement of \u00a7 3731 operates to ensure that before the United States interrupts a criminal proceeding (and thereby delays a defendant from obtaining resolution of the charges against him) by taking an interlocutory appeal, it has evaluated whether the appeal is warranted ... the certificate itself operates as proof of the evaluation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">373 F.3d 509, 515 (4th Cir.2004); <em>see also United States v. Smith, </em>263 F.3d 571, 577 (6th Cir.2001) (quotation omitted) (\u201cThe certification is intended to ensure a \u2018conscientious pre-appeal analysis by the responsible prosecuting official.\u2019 \u201d); <em>United States v. Herman, </em>544 F.2d 791, 794 (5th Cir.1977) (\u201cThe requirement is not a mere formality; its purpose is to protect the accused from undue delay.\u201d). We additionally note that, although not required by the statute, the United States Attorney\u2019s Manual provides an additional level of review \u2014 \u201c[a]ll appeals to the lower appellate courts handled by ... United States Attorneys ... must be authorized by the Solicitor General. This includes interlocutory appeals .... \u201d U.S. Atty Manual 2-2.121.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">This is not a close case. The statute is clear \u2014 the United States Attorney\u2019s certification that the appeal is not taken for purpose of delay and that the evidence excluded by the district court\u2019s order is a substantial proof of a fact material in the proceeding is the final word on materiality for the purposes of determining whether we have jurisdiction to hear the appeal. Neither the district court nor this court can hold otherwise. As the government recognizes, the United States Attorney remains subject to this court\u2019s general supervisory powers for discipline for frivolous or abusive interlocutory appeals. But that in an appropriate case we may potentially sanction the government for abusing its authority under \u00a7 3731 does not mean that we do not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, we hold that we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>have jurisdiction to hear the appeal under \u00a7 3731, and that as of the time the government filed its notice of appeal and the United States Attorney filed the required certification under the statute, the district court was instantly divested of its jurisdiction to take any further action in the case pending resolution of the appeal and remand from this court. All orders entered by the district court following the filing of the notice of appeal and United States Attorney Letteris certification pursuant to \u00a7 3731 are hereby VACATED AS ISSUED WITHOUT JURISDICTION.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">\n<em>II. Whether the District Court Erred by Excluding Evidence of Jefferson\u2019s Convictions for Impeachment Purposes</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Having determined that we have jurisdiction to hear this appeal, we turn to its merits. Evidentiary rulings are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Parks, </em>68 F.3d 860, 867 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">Federal Rule of Evidence 609 governs the admissibility of evidence of convictions for impeachment purposes. Relevant here, the rule provides that \u201c[f]or the purpose of attacking the character for truthfulness of a witness ... evidence that any witness has been convicted of a crime shall be admitted regardless of the punishment, if it readily can be determined that establishing the elements of the crime required proof or admission of an act of dishonesty or false statement by the witness.\u201d Fed R. Evid. 609(a)(2). \u201cCrimes qualifying for admission under Rule 609(a)(2) are not subject to Rule 403 balancing and must be admitted.\u201d <em>United States v. Harper, </em>527 F.3d 396, 408 (5th Cir.2008). Rule 609(a)(2) contains \u201cmandatory language [and] <em>requires </em>that a trial court admit evidence of such crimes to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>allow a party to impeach an adversary witness\u2019s credibility.\u201d <em>Coursey v. Broadhurst, </em>888 F.2d 338, 341-42 (5th Cir.1989) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">Jefferson\u2019s prior convictions for bribery are crimes involving dishonesty. \u201c[B]ribery is a <em>crimen falsi </em>in that it involves dishonesty .... Hence, it is automatically admissible [under] Fed.R.Evid. 609(a)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>642 F.2d 136, 140 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Jefferson\u2019s prior convictions for obstruction of justice in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(b)(3) are admissible under Rule 609(a)(2) \u201cif it readily can be determined that establishing the elements of the crime required proof or admission of an act of dishonesty or false statement by the witness.\u201d Fed R. Evid. 609(a)(2). Section 1512 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-6\">(b) Whoever knowingly uses intimidation, threatens or corruptly persuades another person, or attempts to do so, or engages in misleading conduct toward another person, with intent to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-7\">(3) hinder, delay, or prevent the communication to a law enforcement officer or judge of the United States of information relating to the commission or possible commission of a Federal offense or a violation of conditions of probation, supervised release, parole, or release pending judicial proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(b)(3). \u201cOrdinarily, the statutory elements of the crime will indicate whether it is one of dishonesty or false statement.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 609, advisory committee\u2019s note to 2006 amendments. A defendant can be convicted of \u00a7 1512(b)(3) for intimidating or threatening another person\u2014actions which do not involve acts of dishonesty or false statement. The statutory elements of \u00a7 1512(b)(3) therefore do not indicate whether Jefferson\u2019s convictions thereunder are crimes of dishonesty or false statement warranting automatic admission under Rule 609(a)(2). However, \u201c[w]here the deceitful nature of the crime is not apparent from the statute and the face of the judgment ... a proponent may offer information such as an indictment ... or jury instructions to show that the factfinder had to find ... an act of dishonesty or false statement in order for the witness to have been convicted.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b260-11\">We turn to the indictment in the earlier case and conclude that Jefferson\u2019s convictions for obstruction of justice involve dishonesty or false statement. The obstruction of justice charges contained therein, counts 6 and 7, read, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-12\">Count 6: On or about May 21, 2007, in the Eastern District of Louisiana, defendant MOSE JEFFERSON did knowingly and corruptly attempt to persuade Ellenese Brooks-Simms to lie to federal law enforcement authorities ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-13\">Count 7: On or about May 25, 2007, in the Eastern District of Louisiana, defendant MOSE JEFFERSON did knowingly and corruptly attempt to persuade Ellenese Brooks-Simms to lie to federal law enforcement authorities ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGK\">Indictment at 9, <em>United States v. Mose Jefferson, </em>No. 08-CR-085 (E.D.La. Apr. 2, 2009). Because counts 6 and 7 each charge that Jefferson knowingly and corruptly attempted to persuade another to lie to the authorities, we hold that the indictment shows that \u201cthe factfinder had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>to find ... an act of dishonesty or false statement in order for [Jefferson] to have been convicted.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 609, advisory committee\u2019s note to 2006 amendments. Accordingly, we hold that evidence of Jefferson\u2019s obstruction of justice convictions must be admitted for impeachment purposes under Rule 609(a)(2) should he choose to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">The record reflects that the district court was concerned with the effect that Jefferson\u2019s convictions might have on the jury pool during <em>voir dire. </em>First, we note that this matter is not before this court and that we express no opinion on the district court\u2019s management of the <em>voir dire </em>process, which has yet to begin.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> But the district court\u2019s decision to avoid applying Rule 609(a)(2) due to its view that the \u201coverriding principal [sic] is constitutional law in the criminal context [and] is to avoid manifest injustice period\u201d was an abuse of discretion. \u201c[R]eliance on the \u2018interest of justice,\u2019 without more, does not afford the district court any basis to ignore the Federal Rules of Evidence .... \u201d <em>United States v. Atkins, </em>294 Fed.Appx. 892, 894 (5th Cir.2008) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">\u201cThe admission of prior convictions involving dishonesty and false statement is not within the discretion of the Court.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 609, advisory committee\u2019s note to subsection (a). \u201cSuch convictions are peculiarly probative of credibility and, under this rule, are always to be admitted. Thus, judicial discretion granted with respect to the admissibility of other prior convictions is not applicable to those involving dishonesty or false statement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we hold that the district court abused its discretion in excluding evidence of Jefferson\u2019s convictions for impeachment purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b261-11\">All orders entered by the district court following the filing of the notice of appeal and United States Attorney Letten\u2019s certification pursuant to \u00a7 3731 are VACATED AS ISSUED WITHOUT JURISDICTION. The district court\u2019s order excluding evidence of Jefferson\u2019s convictions for purposes of impeachment is VACATED and this case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b254-11\">.

Defendants additionally rely on <em>United States v. Arce-Jasso </em>for the same proposition. 389 F.3d 124 (5th Cir.2004). In <em>Arce-Jasso, </em>the court rejected the government's contention that \"a post-verdict suppression order fails to become material to the proceedings until the court decides to grant acquittal\u201d such that \u00a7 373 l's 30-day time limit was tolled. <em>Id. </em>at 129. Although the court discussed the materiality of the suppressed evidence to determine when the 30-day period began to run, it did not evaluate materiality in order to determine its jurisdiction. Indeed, the court dismissed the appeal on the basis of untimeliness, not materiality. <em>Id. </em>at 130 (\"The Government did not appeal in time; therefore, we lack jurisdiction to review the suppression decision.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b258-6\">. There is no abuse of authority in this case. We need devote only a footnote to dismissing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>Defendants\u2019 contention that Mose Jefferson\u2019s prior convictions are not substantial proof of a fact material in the proceedings. <em>If he testifies, </em>Jefferson\u2019s prior convictions are \"substantial proof of a fact material in the proceedings.\" We again highlight the district court's conflation of \"substantial proof of a fact material in the proceedings\u201d with \"an evidentiary ruling concerning a matter that is not an element of the charged offense.\u201d A practitioner\u2019s treatise defining materiality in the context of evidence law is instructive: \"Materiality is the relationship between the proposition on which the evidence is offered and the issues in the case.\u201d Anthony J. Bocchino &amp; David A. Sonenshein, A Practical Guide to Federal Evidence 46 (Nat'l Institute of Trial Advocacy 2006). In this case, if he testifies, the proposition for which evidence of Jefferson's convictions will be offered is Jefferson's credibility. If he testifies, Jefferson will have made his credibility an issue in the case \u2014 his credibility clearly will be \"a fact material in the proceedings\u201d and his convictions will clearly be \"substantial proof\u201d of that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"AG\">The authorities cited by Defendants, neither of which involve \u00a7 3731 appeals, are inapposite. In <em>United States v. Lafayette, </em>the D.C. Circuit held that \u201d[i]mpeachment of a witness who testified as to a peripheral fact as a part of a substantial and massive government case\u201d was not material enough to warrant a new trial. 983 F.2d 1102, 1106 (D.C.Cir.1993). Jefferson is a defendant, not merely a witness, and presumably the questions directed at him on cross-examination will expand beyond peripheral facts. Contrary to Defendants\u2019 assertions, <em>Lafayette </em>does not stand for the proposition that impeachment evidence is always peripheral such that it cannot be considered substantial proof of a fact material in the proceeding. Nor is the unpublished report and recommendation from a Magistrate Judge in <em>Skinner v. Duncan, </em>No. 01 Civ. 6656, 2003 WL 21386032 (S.D.N.Y. June 17, 2003) helpful to Defendants. \u201cSuppressed impeachment evidence is material ... where the likely impact on the witness\u2019s credibility would have undermined a critical element of the prosecution\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *23 (discussing suppressed evidence to impeach government\u2019s witness and concluding that where the witness did not testify, the suppressed impeachment evidence was not material). Here, of course, the evidence of Jefferson\u2019s convictions will only be admitted if he chooses to testify.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b260-9\">. We note with express disapproval that <em>none </em>of the cases cited by Defendants in support of their proposition that Jefferson\u2019s convictions should not be admitted for impeachment purposes involved a court applying Rule 609(a)(2). Defendants' uncontroversial assertion that convictions admitted under Rule 609(a)(1) are subject to balancing by the district court under Rule 403 is irrelevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b261-7\">. Relatedly, although we are highly dubious of Defendants' argument that the application of Rule 609(a)(2) contravenes the constitutional safeguard of the right to a fair trial, this argument is not ripe. Evidence of Jefferson's convictions has not yet been introduced and indeed may ultimately never be introduced if Jefferson chooses not to testify.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
