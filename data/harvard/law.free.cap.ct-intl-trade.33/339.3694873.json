Based on the following analysis, the Court denies Plaintiff\u2019s motion and sustains the decision of the Department of Labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-16\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b361-17\">Hutchinson Technology, Inc., is a manufacturer of suspension assemblies for disk drives. (Admin. Record (\u201cAR\u201d) at 7.) The Plaintiff, Former Employees of Hutchinson Technology, Inc. was separated from Hutchinson Technology, Inc. (\u201cHutchinson\u201d) during the week of June 4, 2007. (Pl.\u2019s Mot. for Summ. J. on the Agency Record (\u201cPl.\u2019s Mot.\u201d) 3.) Plaintiff submitted an application for Trade Adjustment Assistance (\u201cTAA\u201d or \u201cworker adjustment assistance\u201d) and Alternative Trade Adjustment Assistance (\u201cATAA\u201d) on June 21, 2007. <em>(Id.) </em>This application was denied on July 10, 2007 <em>(Id.) </em>on the grounds that \u201c[t]he subject firm did not shift production abroad, nor does it import suspension assemblies for disk drives.\u201d (AR at 19.) After Plaintiff filed this case, Defendant U.S. Department of Labor (\u201cLabor\u201d) sought, and was granted, a voluntary remand for further investigation of Plaintiff\u2019s claim with respect to \u201cadditional information regarding the subject firm\u2019s customers.\u201d (Supp. Admin. Record (\u201cSAR\u201d) at 32.) This voluntary remand also resulted in a negative determination on Janu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>ary 18, 2008. (Pl.\u2019s Mot. 4.) Plaintiff now requests that the Court \u201cgrant judgment in [its] favor... pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2395(c) and USCIT R. 56.1.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>This Court has jurisdiction over this case pursuant to 28 U.S.C.' \u00a7 1581(d)(1) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">The court will sustain the Department of Labor\u2019s determination if it is supported by substantial evidence and is otherwise in accordance with law. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2395(b) (2000); <em>see also Woodrum v. Donovan, </em>5 CIT 191, 193, 564 F.Supp. 826, 828 (1983), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>737 F.2d 1575 (Fed. Cir. 1984). The findings of fact by the Secretary are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2395(b) (2000). \u201cSubstantial evidence is something more than a \u2018mere scintilla,\u2019 and must be enough reasonably to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Ceramica Regiomontana, S.A. v.

Cir. 1987) (citations omitted). \u201cAdditionally, \u2018the rulings made on the basis of those findings [must] be in accordance with the statute and not be arbitrary and capricious, and for this purpose the law requires a showing of reasoned analysis.\u2019 \u201d <em>Former Employees of Gen. Elec. Corp. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>14 CIT 608, 611 (1990) <em>(quoting Int\u2019l Union v. Marshall, </em>584 F.2d 390, 396 n. 26 (D.C. Cir. 1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">In order to qualify for worker adjustment assistance as directly-impacted (primary) workers, the Department of Labor must first find that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-8\">(1) a significant number or proportion of the workers in such workers\u2019 firm, or an appropriate subdivision of the firm, have become totally or partially separated, or are threatened to become totally or partially separated].]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2272(a)(1) (Supp. V 2005). In addition, Labor must find that one of two sets of further criteria are satisfied. The first set of criteria is satisfied if Labor finds that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-10\">(2)(A)(i) the sales or production, or both, of such firm or subdivision have decreased absolutely;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-11\">(ii) imports of articles like or directly competitive with articles produced by such firm or subdivision have increased; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-12\">(iii) the increase in imports described in clause (ii) contributed importantly to such workers\u2019 separation or threat of separation and to the decline in the sales or production of such firm or subdivision;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2272(a)(2)(A) (Supp. V 2005) (emphasis added). In this case, Labor found that there had been no increase of imports of articles like or directly competitive with the article produced by Hutchinson, and therefore denied Plaintiff eligibility under the first set of criteria. (AR at 19 (see <em>also </em>SAR at 75-77 (reaching the same conclusion after Labor\u2019s voluntary remand)).)</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">A group of displaced workers may also qualify for primary TAA benefits if Labor finds the second set of criteria is satisfied, namely that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-6\">(B)(i) there has been a shift in production by such workers\u2019 firm or subdivision to a foreign country of articles like or directly competitive with articles which are produced by such firm or subdivision; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-7\">(ii)(I) the country to which the workers\u2019 firm has shifted production of the articles is a party to a free trade agreement with the United States;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-8\">(II) the country to which the workers\u2019 firm has shifted production of the articles is a beneficiary country under the Andean Trade Preference Act..., African Growth and Opportunity Act..., or the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act...; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-9\">(III) there has been or is likely to be an increase in imports of articles that are like or directly competitive with articles which are or were produced by such firm or subdivision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2272(a)(2)(B) (Supp. V 2005) (emphasis added). In its first determination in this case, Labor found that Hutchinson had not shifted production abroad, and thereby concluded that Plaintiff did not qualify for TAA benefits under this second set of criteria. (AR at 19 <em>(see also </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2272(a)(2)(B)(ii)(I), highlighted above.) After voluntary remand, Labor considered whether \u201csorting\u201d work constituted production. Labor determined that sorting was not production, but even if it was, none of the three additional factors was satisfied. (SAR at 77-78 <em>(see also </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2272(a)(2)(B)(ii)(I), (II), and (III), highlighted above.) That is to say, sorting work had not been shifted to a country described in sections (B)(ii)(I) or (II) above, and there was also no evidence of an increase in imports of articles like or directly competitive with those produced by Hutchinson, as indicated in (B)(ii) (III), above.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">Plaintiff contends that Labor erred in several respects by denying it the right to TAA and ATAA benefits in this case, and targets the bulk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>of its arguments along three lines.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> First, Plaintiff argues that Hutchinson has shifted production abroad. (Pl.\u2019s Mot. 5-8.) Second, Plaintiff argues that there has been an increase of imports of articles like or directly competitive with the articles produced by Hutchinson. <em>{Id. </em>13-20.) Third, Plaintiff raises an argument that it did not make before the agency: that it qualifies as an adversely affected secondary worker pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2272(b). <em>{Id. </em>21-23.)</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">I. <em>Issue 1: Whether Plaintiff Shifted Production Abroad</em></p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">A. Parties\u2019 Contentions on Issue 1</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">The products that Plaintiff had been chiefly engaged in producing while employed at Hutchinson were suspension assemblies for disk drives \u2014 a product line known as Argon. (SAE at 29.) Labor determined that the primary cause for Plaintiff\u2019s separation from Hutchinson was a decline in exports of Argon to Hutchison\u2019s primary customer. (AK at 19.) Consequently, Plaintiff could not qualify for TAA benefits under the second set of criteria described above because production of Argon (or a like or directly competitive product) had not shifted abroad. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2272(a)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">Plaintiff argues that the record reflects that some of the terminated employees \u201cwere engaged in the \u2018sorting\u2019 of suspension assemblies at the subject firm\u2019s Wisconsin facility prior to the separation,\u201d and that such sorting constitutes production. (Pl.\u2019s Mot. 5 <em>{citing </em>SAR at 47 and 66.).) Plaintiff criticizes Labor for relying \u201csolely on the reports of the subject firm\u201d in determining that sorting did not constitute production. <em>{Id. </em>at 8-10.) Plaintiff argues that considering the \u201cunrebut-ted description of the \u2018sorting process\u2019 \u201d in light of case law establishes that quality control work, such as sorting, is \u201ca clear part of the production process.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at 6-7.) Plaintiff then argues that the record is vague about whether or not Hutchinson shifted this alleged \u201cproduction\u201d to a country with a free trade agreement with the United States, namely, [\u00b6] ]]. <em>{Id. </em>at 10-12 <em>{see also </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2272(a)(B)(ii)(D).)</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">Defendant responds by arguing that sorting does not constitute production in this instance. (Def.\u2019s Mem. in Opp. to Pl.\u2019s Mot. for J. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>upon the Agency R. (\u201cDef.\u2019s Resp.\u201d) 11-13.) Furthermore, Defendant contends that its investigation was sufficiently thorough, and that there is no record evidence that Hutchinson shifted any production to any other country, much less to a country with a free trade agreement with the United States. (Def.\u2019s Resp. 7-9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">B. Analysis on Issue 1</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">On this issue, the Court must decide whether there is substantial evidence on the record to support the Defendant\u2019s finding that the sorting performed by Plaintiff is not production, or to support the Defendant\u2019s finding that no production had been shifted to a preferred country described in the statute. Setting aside the issue of whether or not sorting constitutes production, this Court finds that there is substantial evidence to support Labor\u2019s determination that no production was shifted to \u201ca party to a free trade agreement with the United States\u201d or to \u201ca beneficiary country under the Andean Trade Preference Act, African Growth and Opportunity Act, or the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act.\u201d <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2272(a)(2)(B)(ii)(I) \u2014 (II) (Supp. V 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">First, when asked about its foreign facilities in [\u00b6] ]] Hutchinson responded that [\u00b6] ]] (SAR at 36.) Acting on Plaintiff\u2019s claim that sorting might constitute production and sorting may have been shifted to \u201cSingapore, Thailand, and/or China\u201d (SAR at 29-30), Labor made further inquiries of both Hutchinson and the petitioner Larry Haus. Hutchinson indicated that [\u00b6] ]] (SAR at 47.) The petitioner, Larry Haus, indicated in response to Labor\u2019s inquiry that he [\u00b6] ]] (SAR at 64.) Upon this suggestion, Labor specifically asked Hutchinson in a written questionnaire, and received the answers highlighted below: [\u00b6] ]] (SAR at 66 (emphasis added).) Plaintiff makes much of Hutchinson\u2019s answer to question 6, above. Specifically, Plaintiff claims that in this answer, Hutchinson \u201cignored] a pointed question about whether any [\u00b6] ]]\u201d (Pl.\u2019s Mot. 11), and that \u201cdetails concerning [ ]] asked but not yet answered, are necessary.\u201d (Pl.\u2019s Rep. to Def.\u2019s Mem. in Oppo. to Pl.\u2019s Mot. for Summ. J. upon the Agency R. (\u201cPl.\u2019s Rep.\u201d) 8.) This Court does not share Plaintiff\u2019s concern about Hutchinson\u2019s answer to these questions. Rather, based on the answer to question 6 along with all the other evidence detailed above, this Court holds that there is substantial evidence in support Labor\u2019s conclusion that any shifted production did not go to a preferred country within the meaning of the statute. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2272(a)(2)(B)(ii)(I)-(II) (Supp. V. 2005). Consequently, the Court does not reach the issue of whether or not \u201csorting\u201d constitutes production.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>II. <em>Issue 2: Whether There has been an Increase in Imports of Articles Like or Directly Competitive with the Domestic Product</em></p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">A. Parties\u2019 Contentions on Issue 2</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">1. <em>Importation of Hard Drives</em></p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Plaintiff also argues that Labor\u2019s finding that there had been no increase of imports of articles like or directly competitive with the articles produced by Hutchinson is not in accordance with law. (PL\u2019s Mot. 13-20.) This is an element of both sets of criteria for receiving TAA benefits listed in the statute, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2272(a)(2)(A)(ii) and (B)(ii)(III). <em>See </em>Discussion, <em>supra </em>3-4. Although Plaintiff does not point to an independent increase in imports of suspension assemblies, Plaintiff argues that suspension assemblies have been imported into the United States as components of fully constructed hard drives. (Pl.\u2019s Mot. 13.) To this end, Plaintiff points to a portion of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 90.2, which explains that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-7\">An imported article is <em>directly competitive with </em>a domestic article at an earlier or later stage of processing, and a domestic article is <em>directly competitive with </em>an imported article at an earlier or later stage of processing, if the importation of the article has an economic effect on producers of the domestic article comparable to the effect of the importation of articles in the same stage of processing as the domestic article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">29 C.F.R. \u00a7 90.2 (2006) (italics in original) (hereinafter \u201cRelevant Language\u201d); <em>(see also </em>Pl.\u2019s Mot. 13.) Plaintiff contends that imported hard drives \u201cmay very well have an economic effect on the producer of the suspension assemblies comparable to the effect of an increase in imported suspension assemblies,\u201d and consequently these imported hard drives could be directly competitive with suspension assemblies, and could possibly serve as a basis for Plaintiff to recover TAA/ATAA benefits. (Pl.\u2019s Mot. 13.)</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">Defendant pointed out in its Notice of Negative Determination on Remand that this court has previously held that when an imported article includes the domestic article as a component, the imported article cannot be considered \u201cdirectly competitive\u201d with that component. (SAR at 76-77 <em>(citing UAW, Local 834 v. Donovan, </em>8 CIT 13, 17-20, 592 F. Supp. 673, 677-79 (1984)).)</p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">2. <em>Sales to Hutchinson\u2019s Major Customer</em></p>\n<p id=\"b366-11\">Plaintiff makes an alternative argument with respect to importation of like or directly competitive articles. Challenging Labor\u2019s find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>ing that Plaintiff was laid off due to decreased exports to Hutchinson\u2019s major customer, Plaintiff argues that the record is inconsistent about whether sales to Hutchinson\u2019s major customer were exports or domestic sales. (Pl.\u2019s Mot. 21-23.) Plaintiff argues that Labor merely \u201ctheorize [d] that [the purchases of a competitor\u2019s product] are not imported into the U.S.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 21.) Apparently, Plaintiff\u2019s theory is that if Hutchinson\u2019s sales to its major customer were not exports, but rather domestic sales which the purchaser then shipped overseas, it is possible that when the customer purchased suspension assemblies from Hutchinson\u2019s competitor that those products were first imported into the United States before being similarly exported. (See <em>id. </em>at 21-23.)</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Defendant responds to this argument by pointing out that \u201cHutchinson never considered [its major customer] a domestic customer,\u201d but rather as a foreign customer to. which it would export suspension assemblies. (Def.\u2019s Resp. 7 <em>(citing </em>SAR at 39.)) Thus, Defendant contends that both of Plaintiff\u2019s arguments fail with respect to the importation of like or directly competitive articles.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">B. Analysis on Issue 2</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">1. <em>Importation of Hard Drives</em></p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">The issue for the Court to decide on the first of these two arguments is whether Labor\u2019s determination that \u201cincreased imports of computer hard drives cannot be the basis for the certification of the subject worker group,\u201d because \u201csuspension assemblies are not like or directly competitive with the computer hard drives produced abroad and imported,\u201d is based on substantial evidence and is otherwise in accordance with law. (SAR at 76-77 <em>(see also </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2272(a)(2)(A)(ii).)) This Court holds that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">Plaintiff misapprehends the operation of the Relevant Language of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 90.2. Specifically, Plaintiff rushes the analysis required by this regulation by suggesting that Labor erred when it failed to determine whether the importation of hard drives would have the same economic effect as the importation of suspension assemblies. (See Pl.\u2019s Mot. 13.) What Plaintiff has not addressed are the qircum-stances that trigger the applicability of the Relevant Language, <em>i.e., </em>when an imported article represents the domestic article at an earlier or later stage of processing.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">The Relevant Language from 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 90.2 is directly quoted from a definition statute in the Trade Act of 1974, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2481(5) (2000). This Court has previously explained the origin of the Relevant Language by resort to legislative history. <em>See W. Conference of Teamsters v. Brock, </em>13 CIT 169, 177-78, 709 F. Supp. 1159, 1166-67 (1989) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number><em>{citing </em>H.R. REP. NO. 87-1818, at 24 (1962)). Essentially, the legislative history reveals that Congress determined that a government agency had construed the definition of \u201cdirectly competitive\u201d too narrowly when that agency decided that a \u201craw cherry\u201d was not \u201cdirectly competitive\u201d with a \u201cglace cherry.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Congress reacted to the agency\u2019s decision by enacting a law with the Relevant Language permitting articles in different stages of production (such as raw cherries and glace cherries)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to be considered directly competitive with one another for the purposes of the Trade Act of 1974, when certain economic conditions are met. <em>See id. </em>In other words, even if two products do not meet the ordinary definition of \u201cdirectly competitive,\u201d because they are not \u201csubstantially equivalent for commercial purposes,\u201d they may be <em>constructively considered </em>directly competitive for the purposes of the Trade Act of 1974, if the Relevant Language applies. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 90.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">A plain reading of the Relevant Language from 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 90.2 reveals its inapplicability in this case. As this court has previously explained, the Relevant Language is only implicated if the imported product is an earlier or later stage of processing of the domestic product, or vice versa. <em>See Former Employees of Murray Eng\u2019g, Inc. v. United States, </em>29 CIT 648, 651-54, 387 F. Supp. 2d 1229, 1232-35 (2005). Based on Labor\u2019s determination that \u201c[sjuspension assemblies are components of computer hard drives, which incorporate multiple components,\u201d SAR at 76, it is clear to this Court that an assembled hard drive is not a suspension assembly at a later stage of processing, nor is a suspension assembly a hard drive at an earlier stage of processing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because of this, Labor was not required to reach the second step in the determination: whether \u201cthe importation of the article has an economic effect on producers of the domestic article comparable to the effect of importation of articles in the same stage of processing as the domestic article.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 90.2. Based on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>foregoing analysis, the Court holds that Labor\u2019s determination regarding the importation of like or directly competitive products is based on substantial evidence and is otherwise in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">2. <em>Sales to Hutchinson\u2019s Major Customer</em></p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">The Court notes that whether Hutchinson\u2019s sales to its major customer \u201care categorized as foreign sales, or are to be considered domestic sales,\u201d is not ultimately dispositive of Plaintiff\u2019s claim for TAA/ATAA benefits. (Pl.\u2019s Mot. 22.) The only issue for the Court to resolve with respect to this argument by Plaintiff is whether Labor\u2019s conclusion that \u201cno suspension assembly products have been imported into the United States by this customer\u201d is supported by substantial evidence on the record and is otherwise in accordance with law. (SAR at 76.) This Court holds that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">There are two pieces of evidence in the administrative record which support Labor\u2019s conclusion that when Hutchinson\u2019s major customer stopped purchasing suspension assemblies from Hutchinson and started purchasing them from a competitor of Hutchinson, that it did not import these suspension assemblies into the United States. The first piece of evidence is a comment written by a Labor investigator on a Hutchinson Technology Sales Analysis report stating that the major customer \u201c[[ ]] (SAR at 67.) The second piece of evidence in the administrative record supporting this conclusion is a handwritten comment, also written by a Labor investigator on a customer survey of Hutchinson\u2019s major customer, pointing to the first piece of evidence. (SAR at 46.) While marginalia comments written by Labor investigators are not as compelling as emails or notes of phone calls with affected parties in a given case, the Court finds that this evidence is more than a \u201cmere scintilla,\u201d and therefore constitutes substantial evidence to support Labor\u2019s conclusion. <em>See Cer\u00e1mica Regiomontana, </em>10 CIT at 405, 636 F. Supp. at 966.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">III. <em>Issue 3: Whether Plaintiffs were Adversely Affected Secondary Workers</em></p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">A. Parties\u2019 Contentions on Issue 3</p>\n<p id=\"b369-12\">Plaintiff also argues Labor should have considered whether or not Plaintiff was qualified to receive TAA/ATAA benefits as a group of \u201cadversely affected secondary worker[s],\u201d as defined by 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2272(b). (Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 15-20.) Plaintiff argues that although it did not indicate it was applying for benefits as an adversely affected secondary worker, the mere application for any TAA/ATAA both put Labor on notice that it was challenging the entire \u201cdecision of Defendant as</p>\n<p id=\"b370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>noticed in the Federal Register,\u201d and that Labor has an obligation to \u201ctake the lead in pursuing relevant facts,\u201d with respect to certification for secondary adjustment assistance.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>at 18-19.)</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">In response to this argument, Defendant points out that Plaintiff raised this argument for the first time in its response to Labor\u2019s negative determination on remand. (Def.\u2019s Resp. 13.) Plaintiff did not indicate it was seeking certification based on 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2272(b) when it filed its initial TAA petition, or during the course of Labor\u2019s voluntary remand. <em>(Id.) </em>Nevertheless, Defendant points out that it considered the possibility that Plaintiff might qualify for benefits as an adversely affected secondary worker in October 2007. <em>(Id.) </em>After learning that one of Hutchinson\u2019s customers had been certified for TAA in one of its branches a particular location, Labor investigated whether Hutchinson had been a supplier for this Customer at the particular location but determined that Plaintiff did not meet the requirements for such benefits. <em>(Id. </em>13-14 <em>(citing </em>SAR 45).)</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">B. Analysis on Issue 3</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">The issue for the Court to resolve in addressing this argument by Plaintiff is whether Labor\u2019s decision on Remand is supported by substantial evidence and otherwise in accordance with law, even though that decision did not explicitly address whether Plaintiff qualified for TAA/ATAA benefits as an adversely affected secondary worker pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2272(b). This Court holds that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">When Plaintiff filed its petition with Labor in this case, Plaintiff did not indicate that it sought certification for TAA/ATAA benefits as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>adversely affected secondary worker.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> While Plaintiff\u2019s failure to indicate that it was requesting such certification in its petition is not necessarily fatal, the fact that Plaintiff failed to raise such a request until after Labor issued its Notice of Negative Determination on Remand, is. (Def.\u2019s Resp. 13 <em>(see also </em>Pl.\u2019s Mot. 15-20.).) While there are no minimum pleading requirements, as such, before the agency, Labor must have some reason to know that a given group of displaced workers desires to be certified as eligible for TAA/ATAA benefits as adversely affected secondary workers. It appears that Labor was given no such reason in this case until after Plaintiff filed is motion in this case, which makes the fact that Labor investigated this issue of its own initiative all the more commendable. <em>(See </em>SAR at 45.) Labor was therefore not required to explicitly address Plaintiff\u2019s status as an adversely affected secondary worker in its Notice of Negative Determination on Remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">For the foregoing reasons, Labor\u2019s Notice of Negative Determination on Remand is supported by substantial evidence and is otherwise in accordance with law. The decision of the Department of Labor is affirmed. Judgment to be entered accordingly.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b364-10\"> Plaintiff also asserts a sundry of additional arguments, all of which the Court has considered, but none of which militate in favor of issuing a judgment for Plaintiff based on the agency record. Plaintiff argues, <em>inter </em>alia, that the questions posed by Labor in the investigation were \u201cbroad\u201d and \u201cvague\u201d' (Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 12), that Labor demonstrated a \u201ccavalier attitude . . . and prejudices\u201d in its investigation <em>(id.), </em>that the Plaintiff is entitled to more lenience because it initially appeared before the Court <em>pro </em>se <em>in forma pauperis, (id. </em>at 16), that Labor was required to obtain \u201cthe description of the assemblies produced by Hutchinson\u201d and to affirmatively determine \u201cwhat constitutes a like or directly competitive product\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 20) and that the value of sales to Hutchinson\u2019s major customer \u201cvary wildly throughout the administrative recorcbwithout explanation\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 22).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b368-5\"> The legislative history to this statute explains, \u201cthe term \u2018earlier or later stage of processing\u2019 contemplates that the article <em>remains substantially the same during such stages of processing, and is not wholly transformed into a different article. </em>Thus, for example, zinc oxide would be zinc ore in a later stage of processing, since it can be processed directly from zinc ore. For the same reason, a raw cherry would be a glace cherry in an earlier stage of processing, and the same is true of a live lamb and dressed lamb meat....\u201d <em>Brock, </em>13 CIT at 178 <em>(quoting </em>H.R. REP. NO. 87-1818, at 24 (1962) (emphasis added)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b368-6\"> The Court notes that when Labor finds that the domestic and imported products do not meet the definition of like or directly competitive, it would still be prudent for Labor to affirmatively assess whether or not the imported and domestic articles represent different stages of processing of essentially the same item. If Labor does not make such a determination, it may face a remand, depending on the circumstances of the case. For instance, the relationship between the imported and domestic articles in <em>Murray </em>was close enough that the court remanded that case to decide whether \u201cdesigns for heavy machinery represent an earlier stage of processing of the products manufactured on such machines.\u201d <em>Former Employees of Murray Eng\u2019g, Inc. v. United States, </em>28 CIT 1873, 1878, 358 F. Supp. 2d 1269, 1275 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b370-8\"> In its motion, it appears that Plaintiff uses the terms \u201cAlternative Trade Adjustment Assistance\u201d and \u201csecondary adjustment assistance\u201d (or \u201cadversely affected secondary worker\u201d) interchangeably. For instance, Plaintiff argues that because the title of the application for TAA benefits includes the term \u201cAlternative Trade Adjustment Assistance [, i]t follows that the completion of this application is for primary and secondary adjustment assistance.\u201d (PL\u2019s Mot. 15 (emphasis added).) Later, Plaintiff suggests that Defendant did not determine whether Plaintiff qualified for secondary adjustment assistance because Plaintiff had failed to check a box \u201cto qualify for alternative trade adjustment assistance.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>16 (emphasis added).) Defendant actually discussed the box-checking in the context of whether or not it could have known that Plaintiff wanted to be considered an adversely affected secondary worker. (Def.\u2019s Resp. to Pl.\u2019s Remand Cmts. 9.) Still later, Plaintiff claimed that if Defendant had performed its investigation properly, \u201cit would have easily uncovered ample evidence supporting certification under the alternative form of trade adjustment assistance.\u201d (Pl.\u2019s Mot. 17 (emphasis added).) The context of this sentence makes clear that Plaintiff actually intended to refer to its qualification as an adversely affected secondary worker.OSee <em>id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">Alternative trade adjustment assistance (\u201cATAA\u201d) is a program established to provide certain benefits to \u201colder workers\u201d when certain conditions are met. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2318(a) (Supp. V 2005). The term \u201cadversely affected secondary workers\u201d refers to group of workers that qualifies for Trade Adjustment Assistance benefits as a consequence of having been a \u201csupplier or downstream producer to a firm (or subdivision) that employed a group of workers who received a certification of eligibility under [the primary form of TAA certification found in] subsection (a) of this [statute].\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2272(b)(2) (Supp. V 2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b371-10\"> In the Petition for TAA and ATAA filled out by the TAA Coordinator for the state of Wisconsin on behalf of Plaintiff, Section 3 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">[i]n your opinion, does the worker group work at a firm or subdivision that has: (check appropriate box(es) below)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-12\">a) \u25a1 \u2022 Increased imports of like or directly competitive article(s) from a foreign country(s)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASM\">S3 \u2022 Shifted production of the article(s) to a foreign country(s)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-13\">E) \u2022 Customers that have increased imports from a foreign country(s)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-14\">b) \u25a1 Supplied component parts for articles produced by a firm with a currently TAA certified worker group</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-16\">c) <em>d </em>Assembled or finished articles provided by a firm with a currently TAA certified worker group</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-18\">(AR at 2.)
