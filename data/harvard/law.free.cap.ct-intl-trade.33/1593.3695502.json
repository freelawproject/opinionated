(\u201cTirus\u201d), (collectively, \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) and Defendant-Intervenor US Magnesium LLC (\u201cUSM\u201d) move for judgment on the agency record, challenging various aspects of the Department of Commerce\u2019s (\u201cDepartment\u201d or Commerce\u201d) final determination in <em>Magnesium Metal from the Russian Federation: Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, </em>73 Fed. Reg. 52,642 (Dep\u2019t Commerce Sept. 10, 2008) <em>(\u201cFinal Results\u201d). </em>For the reasons provided below, Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion for Judgment on the Agency Record is granted in part and denied in part, and the remaining issues are reserved by the court for adjudication after remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1615-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1615-16\">Background &amp; Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b1615-17\">A. The Industrial Processes at Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b1615-18\">The industrial processes at issue are at the heart of this case. AVISMA\u2019s facility produces magnesium metal and titanium sponge, along with other minor products. In the first processing stage, the mineral camalite goes through dehydration and electrolysis, which creates two main outputs: raw magnesium and chlorine gas. Most of the former undergoes further refinement to become the subject merchandise, pure and alloyed magnesium, which Plaintiffs sell on the open market. AVISMA uses the latter as a catalyst which reacts with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1594\">*1594</page-number>the mineral ilmenite to create titanium tetrachloride by separating titanium from titanium oxide. The titanium tetrachloride then is combined with an amount of raw magnesium to strip the chlorine from the titanium, resulting in titanium and magnesium dichloride. The titanium subsequently goes through additional processing to become a saleable product; the magnesium dichloride is separated into chlorine, which is recycled back into the ilmenite separation process, and unusable raw magnesium.</p>\n<p id=\"b1616-4\">B. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b1616-5\">In February 2004, USM filed an antidumping duty petition against imports of magnesium metal from the Russian Federation. <em>See Notice of Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value and Postponement of Final Determination: Magnesium Metal From the Russian </em>Federation, 69 Fed. Reg. 59,197, 59,197 (Dep\u2019t Commerce Oct. 4, 2004). At the conclusion of Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Commission\u2019s investigations, Commerce issued an anti-dumping duty order covering pure and alloyed magnesium. <em>Notice of Antidumping Duty Order: Magnesium Metal From the Russian Federation, </em>70 Fed. Reg. 19,930, 19,930 (Dep\u2019t Commerce Apr. 15, 2005) <em>{\u201cOrder\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1616-6\">Nearly two years later, Commerce published notice of opportunity to request an administrative review of the <em>Order </em>for the period from April 1, 2006 to March 31, 2007 (\u201cperiod of review\u201d). <em>Antidumping or Countervailing Duty Order, Finding, or Suspended Investigation; Opportunity to Request Administrative Review, </em>72 Fed. Reg. 15,650 (Dep\u2019t Commerce Apr. 2, 2007). Plaintiff AVISMA, a Russian magnesium metal producer, requested a review of its imports of the subject merchandise, and USM requested a review of the magnesium metal imports of AVISMA and Solikamsk Magnesium Works, another Russian producer. On May 30, 2007, Commerce commenced the Second Review of the <em>Order</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> Initiation of Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Administrative Reviews and Request for Revocation in Part, </em>72 Fed. Reg. 29,968 (Dep\u2019t Commerce May 30, 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b1616-7\">Commerce published its preliminary results for the Second Review nearly a year later. <em>Magnesium Metal from the Russian Federation: Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, </em>73 Fed. Reg. 24,541 (Dep\u2019t Commerce May 5, 2008) <em>{\u201cPreliminary Results\u201d). </em>In response to the Department\u2019s findings, AVISMA and USM submitted case briefs to support changes that they believed the De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1595\">*1595</page-number>partment should incorporate into the <em>Final Results. </em>Commerce rejected AVlSMA\u2019s first, and a portion of its second, brief on the ground that it contained new factual information, specifically an affidavit from Professor George Foster, an accounting expert.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Pis. Br. App. Tab 8-11; <em>see also </em>Pis. Br. App. Tab 8 Ex. 1 (\u201cFoster Affidavit\u201d). The Department issued the <em>Final Results </em>on September 10, 2008, wherein Plaintiff AVISMA received a final antidumping margin of 15.77 percent. <em>Final Results, </em>73 Fed. Reg. at 52,642-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b1617-4\">Plaintiffs and USM filed suit in this Court to contest the <em>Final Results. </em>Alcoa Inc. and Northwest Alloys, Inc. (collectively, \u201cAlcoa\u201d), domestic industrial consumers of the subject merchandise, filed a motion to appear as amicus curiae, which the court granted. Plaintiffs raise four objections to the <em>Final Results: </em>that Commerce (1) employed an erroneous method to allocate joint costs between magnesium and chlorine gas; (2) relied on outdated information when calculating the chlorine gas\u2019s net realizable value (\u201cNRV\u201d); (3) should have granted a constructed export price (\u201cCEP\u201d) offset to normal value when it calculated AVlSMA\u2019s antidumping duty margin; and (4) unlawfully rejected the portions of AVlSMA\u2019s case brief containing the Foster Affidavit. Pis. Br. 1-3. Like Plaintiffs, USM contests the method by which Commerce allocated joint costs between magnesium and chlorine gas. Def.-Int. Br. 1-4. USM also claims that, if the court affirms the Department\u2019s allocation methodology, the Department nevertheless erred in its adjustments to the chlorine gas\u2019s NRV. Def.Int. Br. 1-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1617-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1617-6\">Jurisdiction &amp; Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b1617-7\">The Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(c). The Court grants \u201ctremendous deference\u201d to Commerce\u2019s final antidumping determinations due to the \u201ctechnical\u201d and \u201ccomplex\u201d economic and accounting decisions involved, for which the Department \u201cpossess far greater expertise than [the Court].\u201d <em>Fujitsu Gen. Ltd. v. United States, </em>88 F.3d 1034, 1039 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (quotation marks omitted); <em>accord Thai Pineapple Pub. Co. v. United States, </em>187 F.3d 1362, 1367 (Fed. Cir. 1999). The Court will disturb a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1596\">*1596</page-number>determination only if it is \u201cunsupported by substantial evidence on the record, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(l)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b1618-4\">Substantial evidence on the record constitutes \u201cless than a preponderance, but more than a scintilla.\u201d <em>Novosteel SA v. United States, </em>25 CIT 2, 16, 128 F. Supp. 2d 720, 725 (2001) (quotation marks &amp; citation omitted), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>284 F.3d 1261 (Fed. Cir. 2002). It is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\u201d in light of the entire record, including \u201cwhatever fairly detracts from the substantiality of the evidence.\u201d <em>Atl. Sugar, Ltd. v. United States, </em>744 F.2d 1556, 1562 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (quotation marks omitted). This standard necessitates that the Department thoroughly examine the record and \u201carticulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u201d <em>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., </em>463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quotation marks omitted); <em>accord Bando Chem. Indus., Ltd. v. United States, </em>16 CIT 133, 137, 787 F. Supp. 224, 227 (1992). That the court may draw two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not preclude Commerce\u2019s ruling from being supported by substantial evidence. <em>Thai Pineapple Pub. Co., </em>187 F.3d at 1365; <em>Novosteel SA, </em>25 CIT at 12, 128 F. Supp. 2d at 730; <em>see FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., </em>129 S. Ct. 1800, 1810 (2009) (\u201c[A] court is not to substitute its judgment for that of the agency . . . .\u201d) (quotation marks &amp; internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1618-5\">To evaluate whether a Commerce determination is in accordance with law, the Court applies the two-step test articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council. </em>467 U.S. 837 (1984). First, the court determines whether Congress has spoken directly to the issue at hand. If Congress\u2019s intent is clear, the court and the D\u00e9partment must \u201cgive effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 843. If the court finds the relevant statute ambiguous or silent with respect to the specific issue, it must defer to the Department\u2019s interpretation as long as it is reasonable. <em>See id. </em>This deference extends to technical methodologies that Commerce may apply to fulfill its statutory mandate. <em>Thai Pineapple Pub. Co., </em>187 F.3d at 1365 (\u201cThe methodologies relied upon by Commerce in making its determinations are presumptively correct.\u201d); <em>see Hynix Semiconductor, Inc. v. United States, </em>29 CIT 995, 1000, 391 F. Supp. 2d 1337, 1342 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1597\">*1597</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-5\">A. Commerce\u2019s Decision Not to Grant a CEP Offset</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-6\">Plaintiffs challenge Commerce\u2019s decision not to grant a CEP offset to normal value in the <em>Final Results </em>as \u201cinconsistent with the statute and the facts on the record.\u201d Pis. Br. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-7\">1. CEP Offsets</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-8\">In antidumping actions, the duty imposed is the difference between the price charged for the subject merchandise in its home market, the \u201cnormal value,\u201d and the price charged in the United States. <em>Micron Tech., Inc. v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 1301, 1303 (Fed. Cir. 2001). In cases such as this one, where a foreign producer sells to an affiliated purchaser in the United States, Commerce calculates the U.S. price using a surrogate value, the CEP. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(b). To ensure a fair comparison, the Department may adjust the normal value and CEP to place them \u201cat a specific, \u2018common\u2019 point in the chain of commerce,\u201d i.e., at the same level of trade. <em>Micron Tech., </em>Inc., 243 F.3d at 1303 (quotation marks omitted); <em>see </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)(l)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-9\">If Commerce finds that the normal value and CEP differ partially or wholly due to a level-of-trade difference which \u201c(i) involves the performance of different selling activities; and (ii) is demonstrated to affect price comparability, based on a pattern of consistent price differences between sales at different levels of trade in the country in which normal value is determined,\u201d the Department will modify the normal value to compensate. \u00a7 1677b(a)(7)(A); <em>accord </em>19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.412(a)-(b). The party seeking such a level-of-trade adjustment must demonstrate that one is warranted. <em>Fujitsu Gen. Ltd., </em>88 F.3d at 1045-46; <em>Corus Staal BV v. United States, </em>27 CIT 388, 406, 259 F. Supp. 2d 1253, 1270 (2003), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>395 F.3d 1343 (Fed. Cir. 2005); <em>see </em>19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.401(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-10\">In some cases, the normal value is at a higher level of trade than the CEP, <em>i.e., </em>the level of trade in the home market is more advanced than in the U.S. market, but data allowing the Department to determine how much to adjust the normal value are unavailable. In these circumstances, the Department grants a CEP offset and reduces the normal value by \u201cthe amount of indirect selling expenses incurred in the country in which normal value is determined on sales of the foreign like product but not more than the amount of such expenses for which a deduction is made under [\u00a7 1677a(d)(l)(D)].\u201d \u00a7 1677b(a)(7)(B); <em>accord Micron Tech., Inc., </em>243 F.3d at 1305; \u00a7 351.412(f)(l)-(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1620-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1598\">*1598</page-number>2. Plaintiffs\u2019 Contentions &amp; Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b1620-4\">Plaintiffs insist that, when compared to AVISMA\u2019s sales of subject merchandise in the U.S. market, its sales in the Russian market experience \u201cmore marketing functions,\u201d Pis. Br. 8, and are made at a more advanced level of trade, Pis. Br. 29, and that the overlap in selling activities between the two markets is \u201cnot significant.\u201d Pis. Br. 8. Furthermore, Plaintiffs assert that there exists no similar level of trade in the home market against which to compare the U.S. market sales and that, consequently, the Department cannot calculate a level-of-trade adjustment to compensate for these differences. Pis. Br. 29. Specifically, they note that Tirus conducts nearly all of the subject merchandise selling functions with respect to end-customers in the U.S. market, leaving AVISMA with only the costs of order processing and freight and delivery charges. Pis. Br. 29-30. By contrast, AVISMA performs all of the more elaborate end-customer selling functions in the Russian market. Pis. Br. 29-30. To further buttress its argument for a CEP offset, AVISMA also notes that it has only one customer for its U.S. sales, Tirus, and made [\u00b6] ]] routine ocean freight shipments exclusively of the same product to Tirus during the period of review. Pis. Br. 31. Meanwhile, AVISMA conducted [\u00b6] ]] individual transactions with [\u00b6] ]] customers in the Russian market, which were composed of wildly varying sizes<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and numerous different products. Pis. Br. 32. Plaintiffs thus aver that \u201cit is axiomatic\u201d that AVISMA incurs significantly greater selling expenses in its home market than in the U.S. Pis. Br. 32. Accordingly, they believe that Commerce should grant them a CEP offset.</p>\n<p id=\"b1620-5\">Plaintiffs have not met the burden of proof to receive a CEP offset. They provided Commerce with a document entitled \u201cAVISMA - Selling Functions Chart,\u201d which purports to list the \u201cSelling Activity / Function\u201d differences between AVISMA\u2019s home market sales to end users, its sales to Tirus in the U.S., and Tirus\u2019s sales to U.S. customers. Pis. Br. App. Tab 1 Ex. 6. The different levels of activity are described as \u201cNO,\u201d \u201cL,\u201d \u201cM,\u201d \u201cH,\u201d or variations thereof. Although it appears comprehensive, the chart nowhere indicates the measure by which Plaintiffs made their evaluations. The chart could refer to the frequency, intensity, cost, or aggregate volume of sales activity; it is impossible to discern. In other words, the chart does not illuminate to what degree, if any, the disparity between the normal value and CEP results from differing levels of trade. Likewise, the data on the number of shipments made to the U.S. provide no insight when compared to the number of transactions made in Russia. A shipment could contain any number of transactions or a single transaction with any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1599\">*1599</page-number>number of shipments. Finally, the different number of customers for AVISMA\u2019s home market and U.S. sales could lead to significantly different sales activities, but Plaintiffs have not buttressed this assertion with facts. Commerce cannot base its decisions on conclusory statements alone. <em>See NSK Corp. v. United States, </em>Slip Op. 09-91, 2009 Ct. Int'l. Trade LEXIS 98, at *28 (Aug. 31, 2009). Despite their claims to the contrary, Plaintiffs have not provided the Department with the quantifiable data, or even logically sound reasoning, that would allow Commerce to grant a CEP offset. Commerce\u2019s decision not to grant the offset is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1621-4\">B. The Foster Affidavit</p>\n<p id=\"b1621-5\">The Foster Affidavit presents George Foster\u2019s opinion on how the Department should use data on the record to calculate the NRV of raw magnesium and chlorine gas in AVISMA\u2019s production process. Plaintiffs first contend that the Department acted unlawfully when it rejected the affidavit\u2019s inclusion in their case brief on the grounds that the affidavit constitutes untimely submitted new factual information pursuant to 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.301(b)(2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> According to Plaintiffs, the affidavit \u201cinterprets the facts [on the record], rather than substitutes or adds facts,\u201d Pis. Br. 34, and \u201ccorroborates claims and data\u201d previously submitted. Pis. Br. 36. It therefore falls outside the regulation\u2019s purview because it does not constitute new factual information. Pis. Br. 36. Plaintiffs also argue that 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.309(c)(2) requires that the Department take the Foster Affidavit into consideration.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Pis. Br. 34. They bolster this assertion with their insistence that the Department\u2019s NRV calculation method for magnesium and chlorine gas, which the Foster Affidavit critiques, first appeared in the <em>Preliminary Results. </em>Pis. Br. 34 \u2014 35. According to Plaintiffs, even if the affidavit presents new factual information, without its admission, they will not receive a fair opportunity to contest the <em>Preliminary Results. </em>Finally, Plaintiffs liken the contents of the Foster Affidavit to witness testimony and \u201cadditional written argument\u201d allowed at hearings pursuant to 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.310(d)(2) \u2014 hearings that occur after publication of the preliminary results and well after the submission deadline in \u00a7 351.301(b)(2). Pis. Br. 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b1621-6\">While Plaintiffs\u2019 ultimate conclusion in this instance may be correct, their reasoning is not. Long-established principles of administrative law imbue agencies with ample discretion to craft their own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1600\">*1600</page-number>rules and procedures, including \u201cthe authority to establish and enforce time limits concerning the submission of written information and data.\u201d <em>Coalition for the Pres. of Am. Brake Drum &amp; Rotor After-mkt. Mfrs. v. United States, </em>23 CIT 88, 94 \u2014 95, 44 F. Supp. 2d 229, 237 (1999) (citing <em>Vt. Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>435 U.S. 519, 544-45 (1978)) <em>(\u201cAm. Brake Drum\u201d). </em>With respect to Commerce\u2019s handling of antidumping matters in general and \u00a7 351.301 specifically, the Court has upheld Commerce\u2019s policy of establishing time limits for the submission of factual information, because \u201cCommerce clearly cannot complete its work unless it is able at some point to \u2018freeze\u2019 the record and make calculations and findings based on that fixed and certain body of information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 97, 44 F. Supp. 2d at 239 (quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As already noted, \u00a7 351.301(b)(2) sets the deadline for the submission of new factual information to Commerce for the final results in administrative reviews 140 days after the last day of the anniversary month of the order under review, in this case on September 17, 2007. <em>See </em>Def. Br. 35. Plaintiffs first attempted to submit the Foster Affidavit on June 12, 2008, well after the deadline. <em>See </em>Pis. Br. App. Tab 8 at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1622-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 hope to circumvent this deadline by characterizing the Foster Affidavit as opinion and commentary, rather than new factual information, fails. \u201c[F]actual information\u201d for the purposes of anti-dumping proceedings includes: \u201c(i) Initial and supplemental questionnaire responses; (ii) Data or statements of fact in support of allegations; (iii) Other data or statements of facts; and (iv) Documentary evidence.\u201d \u00a7 351.102(b)(21). The Court has held that expert opinion analyzing reported information \u201cclearly assumes the weight of evidence\u201d and, as such, amounts to \u201c[d]ata or statements of fact in support of allegations,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>factual information. <em>Am. Brake Drum, </em>23 CIT at 98-99 &amp; n.19, 44 F. Supp. 2d at 240-41 &amp; n.19 (\u201cAn expert witness\u2019 testimony ... is evidence, even though its purpose is to help the fact finder understand the direct evidence presented.\u201d (brackets, quotation marks &amp; citation omitted)). The Foster Affidavit, which explicitly aims to guide Commerce in its assessment of data already on the record unambiguously falls into this category. <em>See </em>Foster Aff. \u00b6 1. The court, therefore, typically would affirm the Department\u2019s decision to exclude the affidavit. <em>See, e.g., Am. Brake Drum, </em>23 CIT at 98, 44 F. Supp. 2d at 240; <em>Asociacion Colombiana de Exportadores de Flores v. United States, </em>13 CIT 13, 24-25, 704 F. Supp. 1114, 1124 (1989), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>901 F.2d 1089 (Fed. Cir. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b1623-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1601\">*1601</page-number>However, the circumstances before the court are not typical. As the Department admits in the <em>Final Results </em>and in its brief, how to calculate the NRV of the chlorine gas in this case is an issue of first impression for the agency. Def.-Int. Br. App. Tab 20 <em>{\u201cI&amp;D Memo\u201d) </em>at 15 (\u201cWe have not had a joint-product scenario where one of the joint products was used as a catalyst to facilitate a second joint-product scenario.\u201d); Def. Br. 6-7. Confronted with this blank slate, Commerce turned to seminal accounting texts, including one co-authored by George Foster, for guidance. <em>See I&amp;D Memo </em>at 15 n.5; Def. Br. 15-16, 17, 20. Although the Department has wide latitude to develop procedures to accommodate the shifting economic landscape in which it operates, the court cannot ignore that a leading accounting expert \u2014 one to whom Commerce frequently turns for guidance<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u2014 has deemed the accounting method used in the <em>Final Results </em>\u201cclearly inappropriate\u201d and stated that the results from this method \u201ccannot be correct.\u201d Foster Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 5.5, 6.3. In this situation, especially where the Department may establish methodological precedent for future similar investigations, the court\u2019s role in striking a balance between the need for agency finality and the mandate for accuracy in antidumping determinations becomes paramount. <em>Timken U.S. Corp. v. United States, </em>434 F.3d 1345, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2006); <em>see Mittal Steel USA, Inc. v. United States, </em>Slip. Op. 07-117, 2007 WL 2701369, at *2 (CIT Aug. 1, 2007) (noting Commerce\u2019s \u201cduty to calculate antidumping rates as accurately as possible\u201d); <em>Helmerich &amp; Payne v.

No. 98-725, at 43 (1984) (\u201cThe Committee ... believes it essential [for] the proper enforcement of the laws that information used in determining . . . the actual amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1602\">*1602</page-number>any-. . . antidumping duty to be assessed under outstanding orders [be] accurate to the extent possible.\u201d); <em>see also Koyo Seiko Co. v.

Consequently, the court finds that to ensure the intent of the antidumping laws is upheld, the Department should take into account the Foster Affidavit when considering the best methodology for calculating the NRV for the chlorine gas. <em>See NEC Home Elecs., Ltd. v.

Specifically, it is</p>\n<p id=\"AB1\">ORDERED that Commerce\u2019s decision not to grant a constructed price export offset is affirmed; it is further</p>\n<p id=\"A_3\">ORDERED that Commerce admit the Foster Affidavit into the record and fully consider its arguments upon remand; and it is further</p>\n<p id=\"b1624-7\">ORDERED that Commerce shall have until January 29, 2010, to file its remand results with the Court.
