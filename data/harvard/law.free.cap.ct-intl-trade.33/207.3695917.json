Domestic steel manufacturers Nucor Corporation, Gerdau AmeriSteel Corporation, and Commercial Metals Company (collectively, the \u201cDomestic Producers\u201d) and ICDAS Celik Enerji Tersane ve Ulasim Sanayi, A.S. (\u201cIC-DAS\u201d) - a Turkish producer/exporter of the subject merchandise - separately challenge various aspects of the final results of the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s seventh administrative review of the an-tidumping duty order on Certain Steel Concrete Reinforcing Bars From Turkey. <em>See generally </em>Certain Steel Concrete Reinforcing Bars From Turkey; Final Results, Rescission of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review in Part, and Determination To Revoke in Part, 70 Fed. Reg. 67,665 (Nov. 8, 2005) (\u201cFinal Results\u201d). Also here in dispute are the results of a voluntary remand to Commerce on the issue of the date of sale for ICDAS\u2019 U.S. sales, for use in Commerce\u2019s antidumping margin calculations. <em>See </em>Final Results of Redetermination Pursuant to Court Remand (\u201cRemand Results\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">In particular, the Domestic Producers contend that Commerce erred in the Final Results by classifying ICDAS\u2019 sales through its U.S. affiliate as Export Price (\u201cEP\u201d) sales, rather than Constructed Export Price (\u201cCEP\u201d) sales. <em>See </em>Memorandum in Support of Plaintiffs\u2019Motion for Judgment on the Agency Record (\u201cDomestic Producers Brief\u2019); Plaintiffs\u2019 Reply Brief (\u201cDomestic Producers Reply Brief\u2019) at 1-8.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Domestic Producers further assert that ICDAS\u2019 attacks on the Final Results are unfounded, and that the Final Results therefore should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>be sustained in all other respects - with one major exception. <em>See </em>Response Brief of the Domestic Producers (\u201cDomestic Producers Response Brief\u2019). Specifically, the Domestic Producers assert that the Final Results erred in using contract date as the date of sale for ICDAS\u2019 U.S. sales, and that the Remand Results - where Commerce reversed itself - are correct. <em>See </em>Domestic Producers Brief at 2 n.l; Domestic Producers Reply Brief at 1, 8-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">For its part, ICDAS challenges four aspects of the Final Results: (1) Commerce\u2019s disallowance of a start-up adjustment for ICDAS\u2019 Biga melt shop; (2) Commerce\u2019s decision to treat ICDAS\u2019 foreign exchange gains within the category of \u201cfinancial expenses,\u201d and to cap ICDAS\u2019 total financial expenses at zero; (3) Commerce\u2019s use of the average cost of manufacturing for the entire period of review (\u201cPOR\u201d), rather than ICDAS\u2019 quarterly costs, in the agency\u2019s \u201csales below cost\u201d analysis; and (4) Commerce\u2019s use of the date of entry, rather than the date of sale, to define ICDAS\u2019 universe of sales. <em>See </em>Plaintiff ICDAS\u2019 Memorandum in Support of its Motion for Judgment on the Agency Record Pursuant to Rule 56.2 (\u201cICDAS Brief\u2019); Plaintiff ICDAS\u2019 Reply Brief in Support of Its Motion for Judgment on the Agency Record Pursuant to Rule 56.2 (\u201cICDAS Reply Brief\u2019). In addition, ICDAS contests Commerce\u2019s decision in the Remand Results to use invoice date as the date of sale for ICDAS\u2019 U.S. sales, rather than using contract date (as the agency did in the Final Results). <em>See </em>Defendant-Intervenor ICDAS\u2019 Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion for Judgment on the Agency Record at 1-3, 5-30 (\u201cICDAS Response Brief\u2019); Defendant-Intervenor ICDAS\u2019 Supplemental Reply Brief Regarding the Date of Sale Issue (\u201cICDAS Supp. Reply Brief\u2019). ICDAS maintains that Commerce properly treated all of ICDAS\u2019U.S. sales as Export Price (\u201cEP\u201d) sales, rather than Constructed Export Price (\u201cCEP\u201d) sales, and therefore opposes the Domestic Producers\u2019 Motion for Judgment on the Agency Record. <em>See </em>ICDAS Response Brief at 1, 3-4, 30-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The Government maintains that the Final Results should be sustained in all respects, save three. <em>See </em>Defendant\u2019s Response to Plaintiffs\u2019 and Defendant-Intervenor\u2019s Motions for Judgment Upon the Agency Record (\u201cDef. Response Brief\u2019). First, the Government requests that two issues be remanded to Commerce for further consideration - specifically, Commerce\u2019s use of the POR average cost of manufacturing (rather than ICDAS\u2019 quarterly costs) in the agency\u2019s \u201csales below cost\u201d analysis, and Commerce\u2019s use of the date of entry (rather than the date of sale) to define ICDAS\u2019 universe of sales. <em>See </em>Def. Response Brief at 1-3, 8-9, 11-12, 28-29, 36. In addition, the. Government asserts that, as to the issue of the date of sale for ICDAS\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>U.S. sales, the Remand Results (which used invoice date as the date of sale) - rather than the Final Results (which used contract date) - should be sustained. <em>See </em>Defendant\u2019s Response to Defendant-Intervenor\u2019s Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiff\u2019s Motion for Judgment on the Agency Record (\u201cDef. Supp. Response Brief\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Jurisdiction lies under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(c) (2000).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For the reasons set forth below, the Domestic Producers\u2019 Motion for Judgment on the Agency Record challenging Commerce\u2019s decision to treat sales made through ICDAS\u2019 U.S. sales affiliate as EP sales must be denied. ICDAS\u2019 Motion for Judgment on the Agency Record must similarly be denied as to ICDAS\u2019 claims that Commerce improperly denied IC-DAS\u2019 request for a startup adjustment, and that Commerce erred in its treatment of ICDAS\u2019 foreign exchange gains as well as in its decision to cap ICDAS\u2019 total financial expenses at zero. On the other hand, ICDAS\u2019 Motion for Judgment on the Agency Record is granted as to ICDAS\u2019 challenges to Commerce\u2019s use of invoice date (rather than contract date) as the date of sale for ICDAS\u2019 U.S. sales, Commerce\u2019s use of the POR average cost of manufacturing (rather than ICDAS\u2019 quarterly costs) in the agency\u2019s \u201csales below cost\u201d analysis, and Commerce\u2019s use of the date of entry (rather than the date of sale) to define ICDAS\u2019 universe of sales; and this matter is remanded to the Department of Commerce for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">I. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">In reviewing a challenge to a final determination by the Commerce Department in an antidumping administrative review, the court must hold unlawful any agency determination, finding, or conclusion that is found to be \u201cunsupported by substantial evidence on the record, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(l)(B)(i); <em>see also Elkem Metals Co. v. United States, </em>468 F.3d 795, 800 (Fed. Cir. 2006). Substantial evidence is \u201cmore than a mere scintilla\u201d; rather, it is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Universal Camera Corp. v. Nat\u2019l Labor Relations Bd., </em>340 U.S. 474, 477 (1951) <em>(quoting Consol. Edison Co. v. Nat\u2019l Labor Relations Bd., </em>305 U.S. 197, 229 (1938)); <em>see also Nippon Steel Corp. v. United States, </em>337 F.3d 1373, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">Moreover, \u201cthe substantiality of evidence must take into account whatever in the record fairly detracts from its weight,\u201d including \u201ccontradictory evidence or evidence from which conflicting inferences could be drawn.\u201d <em>Suramerica de Aleaciones Laminadas, C.A. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number><em>United States, </em>44 F.3d 978, 985 (Fed. Cir. 1994) <em>(quoting Universal Camera, </em>340 U.S. at 487-88). On the other hand, the mere fact that \u201cit [may be] possible to draw two inconsistent conclusions from evidence in the record... does not prevent Commerce\u2019s determination from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Am. Silicon Techs. v. United States, </em>261 F.3d 1371, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <em>see also Consolo v. Federal Maritime Commission, </em>383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">II. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">In April 1997, the Department of Commerce issued an antidumping order covering rebar from Turkey. <em>See </em>Antidumping Duty Order: Certain Steel Concrete Reinforcing Bars From Turkey, 62 Fed. Reg. 18,748 (April 17,1997). Subsequently, in every annual administrative review that Commerce has conducted for ICDAS since 1999 - including three consecutive administrative reviews, covering the periods April 1, 2001 through March 31, 2004 - Commerce consistently found that the dumping margin for ICDAS\u2019 U.S. sales was zero or <em>de mini-mis</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(at least until the Remand Results here in dispute were issued).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The administrative review which is the subject of this action - the seventh such review - began in April 2004, when Commerce gave notice of the opportunity to request a review of the antidumping order on rebar from Turkey, for the period April 1, 2003 through March 31, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>2004. <em>See generally </em>Antidumping or Countervailing Duty Order, Finding, or Suspended Investigation; Opportunity To Request Administrative Review, 69 Fed. Reg. 17,129 (April 1, 2004). At the request of both the Domestic Producers and ICDAS, <em>inter alia, </em>Commerce initiated an administrative review the following month. <em>See generally </em>Initiation of Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Administrative Reviews and Request for Revocation in Part, 69 Fed. Reg. 30,282 (May 27, 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">In the Preliminary Results of the administrative review, Commerce calculated a margin of 0.47% for ICDAS. In light of that <em>de minimis </em>margin, and the company\u2019s record of zero or de minimis margins in the two prior administrative reviews, the agency also announced its intention to revoke the antidumping order as to ICDAS. <em>See generally </em>Certain Steel Concrete Reinforcing Bars from Turkey; Preliminary Results and Partial Rescission of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review and Notice of Intent to Revoke in Part, 70 Fed. Reg. 23,990, 23,991, 23,995 (May 6, 2005) (\u201cPreliminary Results\u201d); <em>see also Gerdau AmeriSteel Corp. v. United States, </em>519 F.3d 1336, 1337-38 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (summarizing history of <em>de minimis </em>findings in administrative reviews of ICDAS, leading to Commerce\u2019s determination to revoke antidumping order as to ICDAS).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Following briefing and oral argument by the parties before the agency, Commerce published the Final Results of the administrative review. <em>See generally </em>Certain Steel Concrete Reinforcing Bars From Turkey; Final Results, Rescission of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review in Part, and Determination To Revoke in Part, 70 Fed. Reg. 67,665 (Nov. 8, 2005) (\u201cFinal Results\u201d); <em>see also </em>Issues and Decision Memorandum for the Antidumping Duty Administrative Review on Certain Steel Concrete Reinforcing Bars From Turkey - April 1, 2003, through March 31, 2004 (Nov. 2, 2005) (Pub. Doc. No. 256) (\u201cDecision Memo\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">In reaching the Final Results, Commerce decided, <em>inter alia, </em>(1) to treat all of ICDAS\u2019 U.S. sales as Export Price (\u201cEP\u201d), rather than Constructed Export Price (\u201cCEP\u201d), transactions; (2) to disallow a start-up adjustment for ICDAS\u2019 Biga melt shop; (3) to treat ICDAS\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>foreign exchange gains within the category of \u201cfinancial expenses\u201d for purposes of calculating ICDAS\u2019 cost of production, and to cap ICDAS\u2019 total financial expenses at zero; (4) to use contract date (rather than invoice date) as the date of sale for ICDAS\u2019 U.S. sales, for purposes of calculating ICDAS\u2019 antidumping duty margin; (5) to use in its \u201csales below cost\u201d analysis the weighted average cost of manufacturing for the entire one-year period of review, rather than ICDAS\u2019 quarterly average costs; and (6) to use the date of entry, rather than the date of sale, to define ICDAS\u2019 universe of sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">Based on Commerce\u2019s analyses as reflected in its Final Results, the final dumping margin for ICDAS was calculated to be 0.16% - once again, a <em>de minimis </em>margin. <em>See </em>Final Results, 70 Fed. Reg. at 67,667. As a result of the company\u2019s <em>de minimis </em>dumping margin in the review at issue, as well as its <em>de minimis </em>or zero margins in the two previous administrative reviews, Commerce revoked the antidump-ing order as to ICDAS, in accordance with the agency\u2019s regulations. <em>See </em>Final Results, 70 Fed. Reg. at 67,666; 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.222(b)(2)(i) (providing for revocation of an order as to a particular exporter or producer of subject merchandise where, <em>inter alia, </em>the exporter or producer has \u201csold the merchandise at not less than normal value for a period of at least three consecutive years\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The Domestic Producers and ICDAS brought the two actions consolidated here, challenging various aspects of the Final Results. One of the two issues raised in the Domestic Producers\u2019 Complaint was Commerce\u2019s use of the contract date as the date of sale for ICDAS\u2019 U.S. sales. On behalf of Commerce, the Government requested and was granted a voluntary remand on that issue. On remand, Commerce reversed itself, changing its \u201cdate of sale\u201d methodology for ICDAS\u2019 U.S. sales, using the invoice date - rather than the contract date - as the date of sale. <em>See </em>Final Results of Redetermination Pursuant to Court Remand (\u201cRemand Results\u201d). As a result of that change, Commerce recalculated the dumping margin for ICDAS as above the <em>de minimis </em>level, and concluded that ICDAS does not qualify for revocation. <em>See </em>Remand Results at 2-3, 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The parties\u2019 pending cross-motions for judgment on the agency record are directed to the Final Results of Commerce\u2019s seventh administrative review, as well as the \u201cdate of sale\u201d issue addressed in Commerce\u2019s Remand Results.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>III. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">In their Motion for Judgment on the Agency Record, the Domestic Producers contend that, in the Final Results, Commerce wrongly treated sales made through ICDAS\u2019 U.S. affiliate as Export Price (\u201cEP\u201d) - rather than Constructed Export Price (\u201cCEP\u201d) - sales. In its Motion for Judgment on the Agency Record, ICDAS argues, in turn, that Commerce erred in denying ICDAS\u2019 request for a startup adjustment in the Final Results, that Commerce both improperly treated ICDAS\u2019 foreign exchange gains within the category of \u201cfinancial expenses\u201d for purposes of calculating ICDAS\u2019 cost of production in the Final Results and also improperly capped ICDAS\u2019 total financial expenses at zero, that Commerce erred on remand in using invoice date (rather than contract date) as the date of sale for ICDAS\u2019 U.S. sales, that Commerce erred in the Final Results by using in its \u201csales below cost\u201d analysis the weighted average cost of manufacturing for the period of review (\u201cPOR\u201d) (rather than ICDAS\u2019 quarterly average costs), and that Commerce erred in the Final Results by using the date of entry (rather than the date of sale) to define ICDAS\u2019 universe of sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Each of the parties\u2019 claims is discussed in detail below. As set forth there, there is no merit to the Domestic Producers\u2019 challenge to Commerce\u2019s decision to treat sales made through ICDAS\u2019 U.S. sales affiliate as EP sales. The Domestic Producers\u2019 Motion for Judgment on the Agency Record therefore must be denied. Similarly lacking in merit are ICDAS\u2019 challenge to Commerce\u2019s denial of ICDAS\u2019 request for a startup adjustment, and ICDAS\u2019 challenge to Commerce\u2019s treatment of ICDAS\u2019foreign exchange gains as \u201cfinancial expenses\u201d as well as the agency\u2019s decision to cap ICDAS\u2019 total financial expenses at zero. Accordingly, ICDAS\u2019 Motion for Judgment on the Agency Record must be denied as to those claims. In contrast, Commerce\u2019s use of invoice date (rather than contract date) as the date of sale for ICDAS\u2019 U.S. sales, Commerce\u2019s use of the POR average cost of manufacturing (rather than ICDAS\u2019 quarterly costs) in the agency\u2019s \u201csales below cost\u201d analysis, and Commerce\u2019s use of the date of entry (rather than the date of sale) to define ICDAS\u2019 universe of sales cannot be sustained on the existing administrative record. ICDAS\u2019 Motion for Judgment on the Agency Record therefore must be granted as to those claims, and this matter remanded to Commerce for further appropriate action.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">A. <em>Commerce\u2019s Treatment of ICDAS\u2019 U.S. Sales as Export Price (\u201cEP\u201d) Sales</em></p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Dumping takes place when merchandise is imported into the United States and sold at a price lower than its \u201cnormal value\u201d - i.e., the foreign market value of the subject merchandise. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>1673,1677(34). The difference between the normal value and the U.S. Price is the \u201cdumping margin.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(35). When normal value is compared to the U.S. Price and dumping is found, antidump-ing duties equal to the dumping margin may be imposed to offset the dumping. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">For purposes of an antidumping analysis, the U.S. Price is calculated using either the Export Price (\u201cEP\u201d) methodology or the Constructed Export Price (\u201cCEP\u201d) methodology. Commerce compares either the EP or the CEP with the \u201cnormal value\u201d of the subject merchandise, to ascertain whether dumping is occurring, and, if so, to calculate the dumping margin. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1673, 1677a. If a transaction is classified as a CEP sale, the statute requires that certain additional deductions be taken from the sales price in order to arrive at the U.S. Price.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The bottom line is that use of CEP is more likely to result in a finding of dumping. <em>See generally AK Steel Corp. v. United States, </em>226 F.3d 1361, 1364-65 &amp; n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Export Price (\u201cEP\u201d) is defined in the statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-6\">The term \u201cexport price\u201d means the price at which the subject merchandise is first sold (or agreed to be sold) before the date of importation by the producer or exporter of the subject merchandise outside of the United States to an unaffiliated purchaser in the United States or to an unaffiliated purchaser for exportation to the United States....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(a). The statute defines Constructed Export Price (\u201cCEP\u201d) as well:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-8\">The term \u201cconstructed export price\u201d means the price at which the subject merchandise is first sold (or agreed to be sold) in the United States before or after the date of importation by or for the account of the producer or exporter of such merchandise or by a seller affiliated with the producer or exporter, to a purchaser not affiliated with the producer or exporter....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">During the period of review, ICDAS exported merchandise to the United States both through a U.S. affiliate (which serves as importer of record, and is basically a \u201cpaper company\u201d), as well as directly to unaffiliated customers. In the Final Results at issue here, Commerce classified all of ICDAS\u2019 U.S. sales as EP sales, as it has since the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>2001-2002 review, applying <em>AK Steel </em>(which includes a detailed analysis of the differences between EP and CEP sales) and emphasizing the locations of the transactions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See generally </em>Final Results, 70 Fed. Reg. 67,665; Decision Memo at 63-68. Commerce concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AeC\">While we note that it is undisputed that ICDAS\u2019s U.S. importer is affiliated with ICDAS, this fact alone does not require a finding that the sales in question are CEP transactions. Under <em>AK Steel, </em>the salient issue is whether the sale at issue takes place inside or outside the United States, which the Court further discussed in <em>Coru,s Staal, </em>noting that \u201cthe focus of the inquiry is on the location of the sale not the role played by the affiliated importer.\u201d <em>See Corus Staal, </em>259 F. Supp. 2d at 1259.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-4\">In this case, the record indicates that ICDAS\u2019s sales through its affiliated importer were concluded in Turkey.... [T]he sales agreement was signed in Turkey by ICDAS personnel, the invoice was issued by an entity in Turkey (i.e., the producer/ exporter) to an entity in the United States (i.e., the U.S. customer), and it was concluded outside the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-5\">Regarding the petitioners\u2019 arguments involving the transfer of title, we disagree that the evidence on the record shows that title passed to the customer inside the United States. We have examined the documents taken at verification and find that none of the contracts for... entries [during the period of review] shows that title passed after entry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Decision Memo at 66-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">The Domestic Producers contend that Commerce erred in classifying sales made through ICDAS\u2019 U.S. affiliate as EP sales. According to the Domestic Producers, those transactions instead should be treated as CEP sales. <em>See generally </em>Domestic Producers Brief, <em>passim', </em>Domestic Producers Reply Brief at 1-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">In their briefs, the parties devote much ink to their competing interpretations of the Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion in <em>AK Steel, </em>and, to a lesser degree, the opinion of this court in <em>Corus Staal. See AK Steel, </em>226 F.3d 1361; <em>Corus Staal BV v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Commerce, </em>27 CIT 388, 259 F. Supp. 2d 1253 (2003) (concerning Final Determination in antidumping investigation). The Domestic Producers maintain that those two opinions require that sales made through ICDAS\u2019 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>affiliate be classified as CEP sales. <em>See </em>Domestic Producers Brief at 8; <em>see also id. </em>at 9-17; Domestic Producers Reply Brief at 1-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">The Domestic Producers initially asserted that <em>AK Steel </em>holds flatly that \u201cany sale in which the contract is between a U.S. affiliate and an nnaffiliated U.S. customer must be classified as CEP,\u201d based solely on the domicile of the seller and without regard to the location of the sale or transaction. <em>See </em>Domestic Producers Brief at 11; <em>see also id. </em>at 8, 12. In their Reply Brief, the Domestic Producers moderated their stance slightly, arguing that \u201c[t]he decision [in <em>AK Steel </em>] appears to support two different, mutually exclusive tests for whether a transaction is CEP or EP\u201d - one test based on the domicile of the party making the sale to the first unaffiliated customer, and one test based on the location of the sale or transaction. <em>See </em>Domestic Producers Reply Brief at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Specifically, the Domestic Producers assert that \u201c[p]ortions of the opinion [in <em>AK Steel ] </em>clearly state that whenever the sale to the first unaffiliated U.S. customer is made by a U.S. selling affiliate, that transaction must be classified as CEP.\u201d <em>See </em>Domestic Producers Reply Brief at 2. To illustrate this point, the Domestic Producers excerpt language from the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion <em>in AK Steel: </em>\u201c[I]f the contract for sale was between a U.S. affiliate of a foreign producer or exporter and an unaffiliated U.S. purchaser, then the sale <em>must </em>be classified as a CEP sale.... Similarly, a sale made by a U.S. affiliate or another party other than the producer or exporter cannot be an EP sale.\u201d <em>AK Steel, </em>226 F.3d at 1374 (quoted in Domestic Producers Reply Brief at 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">At the same time, however, the Domestic Producers candidly concede - as they must - that \u201cother portions of the opinion [in <em>AK Steel </em>] appear to state that a sale by a U.S. affiliate can be classified as EP where title transfers and consideration is [given] outside of the United States.\u201d <em>See </em>Domestic Producers Reply Brief at 2-3. To illustrate that point, the Domestic Producers point to another excerpt from <em>AK Steel: </em>\u201cThe term \u2018outside the United States,\u2019 read in the context of both the CEP and the EP definitions,... applies to the locus of the transaction at issue, not the location of the company.\u201d <em>AK Steel, </em>226 F.3d at 1369 (quoted in Domestic Producers Reply Brief at 2-3).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">Summing up their analysis of <em>AK Steel, </em>the Domestic Producers state: \u201cThus, at different points in the opinion, the Federal Circuit appears to endorse a bright-line rule whereby all sales through a U.S. selling affiliate are CEP; in others, it appears to make the distinction based solely on the location of title transfer.\u201d Domestic Producers Reply Brief at 3. The Domestic Producers conclude - based on both their analysis of the language of the opinion, as well as their analysis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>of the facts and outcome of the case - that AN Steel\u2019s references to \u201cthe location of the sale\u201d were actually intended to refer to \u201cthe domicile of the seller\u201d; and, moreover, that, under <em>AK Steel, </em>it is \u201cthe seller\u2019s domicile, rather than the location of title-transfer\u201d which is \u201cthe defining factor\u201d in an EP/CEP analysis. <em>See </em>Domestic Producers Brief at 13-17; Domestic Producers Reply Brief at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">To be sure, the detailed analysis in the Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion in <em>AK Steel </em>is necessarily dense, and can therefore be challenging to follow at points. It is therefore difficult not to sympathize with the Domestic Producers, as they struggle to distill the implications of AN <em>Steel </em>for this case. And, as the Domestic Producers indicate, some statements <em>in AK Steel </em>appear (at least at first blush) to be somewhat in tension with other statements in the opinion. The Government and ICDAS correctly note, however, that the gravamen of AN <em>Steel </em>is the significance of the location of the sale or transaction - specifically, \u201cwhether the sale or transaction takes place inside or outside the United States.\u201d <em>See AK Steel, </em>226 F.3d at 1369-70 (characterizing location of sale or transaction as a \u201ccritical difference\u201d between EP and CEP sales).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">In AN <em>Steel, </em>the Court of Appeals focused repeatedly and definitively on the importance of the <em>location of a sale or transaction </em>in determining its classification as an EP or CEP sale.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, the Court framed \u201c[t]he question at the root of [the] appeal\u201d in that case as whether a sale can be properly classified as an EP sale <em>\u201cif the sales contract...is executed in the United States.\u201d AK Steel, </em>226 F.3d at 1368 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">AN Steel\u2019s analysis of the language of the statute similarly highlights the significance of the location of the sale or transaction. Reviewing the text of the statute, the Court of Appeals determined that \u201cthe plain meaning of the language enacted by Congress... focuses on <em>where the sale takes place.\u201d AK Steel, </em>226 F.3d at 1369 (emphasis added) (discussing 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a (defining \u201cEP\u201d and \u201cCEP\u201d)).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Underscoring the fact that the location of the sale or transaction is a \u201cdispositive\u201d factor in classifying sales as EP sales or CEP sales, the Court of Appeals continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>The text of the [statutory] definition of CEP states that CEP is the \u201cprice at which the subject merchandise is first sold <em>in the United States.\u201d </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(a) (emphasis added). In contrast, EP is defined as the price at which the merchandise is first sold \u201coutside the United States.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(b). Thus, <em>the location of the sale </em>appears to be critical to the distinction between the two categories.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-4\"><em>AK Steel, </em>226 F.3d at 1369 (second emphasis added).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Echoing its characterization of the location of the sale or transaction as a \u201cdis-positive\u201d factor, the Court expressly identified <em>\u201cwhether the sale or transaction takes place inside or outside the United States\u201d </em>as a \"critical difference\u201d between EP and CEP sales. <em>AK Steel, </em>226 F.3d at 1369-70 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The Court of Appeals\u2019 review of the specific facts of <em>AK Steel </em>continues the drumbeat on the location of the sales or transactions. There, too, the Court of Appeals focused like a laser on the issue, ultimately concluding that the transactions in the case were not EP sales, but CEP sales. <em>See AK Steel, </em>226 F.3d at 1370-72, 1374. Observing that - as a practical matter - \u201cwhether a sale is \u2018outside the United States\u2019 depends, in part, on whether the parties are or are not located in the United States,\u201d the Court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-6\">A transaction, such as those here, in which both parties are located in the United States and <em>the contract is executed in the United States </em>cannot be said to be \u201coutside the United States.\u201d Thus, such a transaction cannot be classified as an EP transaction. Rather, classification as an EP sale requires that one of the parties to the sale be located \u201coutside the United States,\u201d for if both parties to the transaction were in the territory of the United States and <em>the transfer of ownership was executed in the United States, </em>it is not possible for the transaction to be outside the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number><em>AK Steel, </em>226 F.3d at 1370 (emphases added). Emphasizing that \u201cCongress has made a clear distinction between [EP sales and CEP sales] based on <em>the geographic location of the transaction,\u201d </em>the Court of Appeals stated that it would be \u201ccontrary to the plain meaning of the statute\u201d to classify the transactions in <em>AK Steel </em>as EP sales \u201c[w]hen... there are contracts showing that <em>the sales at issue took place in the United States </em>between two entities with United States addresses, one of which was an affiliate of the producer/exporter.\u201d <em>AK Steel, </em>226 F.3d at 1370-71 (emphases added).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">In <em>AK Steel, </em>the Korean producers argued that the statutory term \u201cseller\u201d was ambiguous, and that Commerce should be permitted to interpret it in terms of the U.S. affiliate\u2019s activities. <em>AK Steel, </em>226 F.3d at 1371. The Court of Appeals made short work of that argument, again highlighting the significance of the location of the sale or transaction. The Court of Appeals concluded: \u201cIf Congress had intended the EP versus CEP distinction to be made based on which party set the terms of the deal or on the relative importance of each party\u2019s role, it would not have written the statute to distinguish between the two categories based on <em>the location where the sale was made </em>and the affiliation of the party that made the sale.\u201d <em>AK Steel, </em>226 F.3d at 1372 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Finally, the significance of the location of the sale or transaction is highlighted in the ultimate statement of the holding of <em>AK Steel:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAs\">Stated in terms of the EP definition: if the sales contract is between two entities in the United States, and <em>executed in the United States and title will pass in the United States, </em>it cannot be said to have been a sale \u201coutside the United States\u201d; therefore, the sale <em>cannot </em>be an EP sale.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-6\"><em>AK Steel, </em>226 F.3d at 1374 (initial emphasis added). As illustrated by the excerpts quoted in the discussion above (including notes 9 through 12), <em>AK Steel\u2019s </em>emphasis on the location of a sale or transaction in classifying it as EP or CEP is much greater than the Domestic Producers acknowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>In short, there is no merit to the Domestic Producers\u2019 claim that AN <em>Steel </em>mandates that any sale in which the contract is between two U.S. domiciled entities - i.e., a U.S. affiliate of a foreign producer/exporter and an unaffiliated U.S. customer - must necessarily, by definition, be classified as a CEP sale, without regard to the location of that sale or transaction. Indeed, the Court of Appeals in AN <em>Steel </em>held that a critical inquiry in making an EP/CEP classification is the location of the sale or transaction - in particular, whether the sale or transaction takes place inside or outside the United States. <em>See AK Steel, </em>226 F.3d at 1369; 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(a)-(b) (defining \u201cexport price\u201d in terms of a sale made (or an agreement to sell reached) \u201coutside of the United States,\u201d and defining \u201cconstructed export price\u201d in terms of a sale made (or an agreement to sell reached) \u201cin the United States\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">The Court of Appeals held that, for purposes of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a, the term \u201coutside of the United States\u201d refers to \u201cthe locus of the transaction at issue, not the location of the company.\u201d <em>AK Steel, </em>226 F.3d at 1369. The Court noted that, in most situations, EP sales will involve one party domiciled outside the United States, because sales between two U.S. domiciled parties normally will take place inside the United States. <em>AK Steel, </em>226 F.3d at 1370. Nevertheless, as all parties acknowledge, the Court of Appeals expressly reserved judgment as to whether \u201ca sales contract between two U.S. domiciled entities that is entirely executed outside the United States\u201d would be classified as an EP sale or a CEP sale. <em>See AK Steel, </em>226 F.3d at 1370 n.8 (emphasis added); Domestic Producers Brief at 17 n.ll; ICDAS Response Brief at 33-34; Decision Memo at 63.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, under the AN <em>Steel </em>test, it may be possible for two U.S. entities to conduct an EP sale, <em>provided that the sale is completed outside the United States. </em>In any event, as discussed herein, Commerce determined in this case that all sales in question were between ICDAS (a Turkish producer/exporter) and unaffiliated U.S. purchasers, and that all sales in question were completed outside the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The Domestic Producers\u2019 argument was fully laid to rest by the Court of Appeals in <em>Corus Staal. See Corus Staal BV v. United States, </em>502 F.3d 1370, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (concerning second administrative review of antidumping order covering hot-rolled carbon steel flat products from the Netherlands). The Court of Appeals there underscored its holding in AN <em>Steel, </em>reiterating the significance of the location of a transaction in classifying it as an EP or CEP sale:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number><em>AK Steel </em>does not stand for the proposition that all sales by foreign sellers to unaffiliated U.S. customers should be considered EP transactions. In fact, <em>AK Steel </em>states that transactions... in which <em>the sale </em>made by a foreign producer or exporter <em>occurs in the United States, </em>should be treated as CEP transactions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-4\"><em>Corus Staal, </em>502 F.3d at 1377 (emphases added); <em>see also id. (quoting AK Steel, </em>226 F.3d at 1369: \u201c[T]he location of the sale appears to be critical to the distinction between the two categories.\u201d). It is thus a major overstatement to assert (as the Domestic Producers do) that <em>AK Steel </em>mandates that \u201cwhere the first sale to an unaffiliated party is made by a U.S. selling affiliate of the foreign producer/exporter, the sale must be classified as CEP,\u201d without regard to the location of the transaction. <em>See </em>Domestic Producers Brief at 8.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>As the Government correctly points out, the statute requires that - in determining whether a sale is an EP sale or a CEP sale - the first step in Commerce\u2019s analysis is to identify when \u201cthe subject merchandise is first sold (or agreed to be sold).\u201d <em>See </em>Def. Response Brief at 30-31 (discussing definitions of EP and CEP in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(a)-(b), both of which include quoted phrase). The Government further notes that, in determining where merchandise is \u201cfirst sold (or agreed to be sold),\u201d Commerce must adhere to the plain language definitions of the terms \u201csold\u201d and \u201cagreed to be sold.\u201d <em>See </em>Def. Response Brief at 31. <em>AK Steel </em>defined a \u201csale\u201d in the context of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a to \u201crequire[ ] both a <em>\u2018transfer of ownership </em>to an unrelated party and <em>consideration.\u2019 </em>\u201d <em>AK Steel, </em>226 F.3d at 1371 (citation omitted; emphases added in <em>AK Steel). </em>Similarly, in <em>Corus Staal, </em>the Court of Appeals defined an \u201cagreement to sell\u201d (for purposes of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a) as \u201ca binding commitment that has not yet been consummated by the exchange of goods for consideration, i.e., the \u2018sale\u2019 itself.\u201d <em>Corus Staal, </em>502 F.3d at 1376-77.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus, \u201c[a]s used in the statute, the terms \u2018sale\u2019 and \u2018agreement to sell\u2019... cover cover different types of transactions.\u201d <em>Corus Staal, </em>502 F.3d at 1377. Further, the Court of Appeals has held that \u201c[n] either a sale nor an agreement to sell occurs until there is mutual assent to the material terms [of a deal] (price and quantity).\u201d <em>Corus Staal, </em>502 F.3d at 1376.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">In the case at bar, all activities relevant to sales of ICDAS\u2019 rebar to U.S. customers - including sales negotiations, issuance of invoices, and preparation of documentation to facilitate payment - were handled <em>outside the United States, </em>by ICDAS personnel in Turkey. <em>See </em>Section A Questionnaire Response of ICDAS Celik Enerji Tersane ve Ulasim Sanayi, A.S.

But ICDAS\u2019 U.S. affiliate is merely a \u201cpaper\u201d company that has no employees or business premises in the United States, is not involved in the sales process, never takes possession of subject merchandise, and acts only as importer of record. <em>See </em>Section A Questionnaire Response of ICDAS Celik Eneiji Tersane ve Ulasim Sanayi, A.S.

See </em>Section A Questionnaire Response of ICDAS Celik Enerji Tersane ve Ulasim Sanayi, A.S. (Pub. Doc. No. 67; Conf. Doc. No. 1), Exh. A-9 at 1, 2; ICDAS Sales Verification Report (Conf. Rec. No. 44) at Exh. 11. Under the circumstances, Commerce properly determined to treat ICDAS\u2019 U.S. sales as EP transactions, in accordance with AESieeZ, \u201cbecause the[ ] sales were made pursuant to agreements made between [unaffiliated U.S. customers and] ICDAS personnel <em>in Turkey.\u201d See </em>Decision Memo at 65 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Apart from their arguments disputing the legal significance of the location of the transaction based on their interpretation of <em>AK Steel </em>(addressed above), the Domestic Producers further contend that \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>record lacks the evidence necessary to make any reasonable determination regarding the location of the sales at issue.\u201d Domestic Producers Brief at 17-18; <em>see also id. </em>at 2, 8-10, 17-21, 24; Domestic Producers Reply Brief at 1, 7-8.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Noting that <em>AK Steel </em>defined the term \u201csold\u201d (for purposes of EP/CEP classification) by reference to the transfer of ownership or title, the Domestic Producers challenge the quantum of record evidence concerning the transfer of title in the sales at issue here. Specifically, the Domestic Producers point to the fact that Commerce collected sales trace information concerning two of ICDAS\u2019 sales to unaffiliated U.S. customers during the period of review. The Domestic Producers further note that only one of those sales traces includes information concerning the transfer of title, and assert that it is not enough to support Commerced determination. <em>See </em>Domestic Producers Brief at 18; <em>see also </em>Domestic Producers Reply Brief at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">Contrary to the Domestic Producers\u2019 claims, the record evidence is sufficient to establish the location of the limited number of transactions at issue. As a threshold matter, it is well-established that, in principle, \u201c[i]t is up to Commerce, not the court, to weigh the... evidence that was properly submitted during verification.\u201d <em>See Corns Staal, </em>27 CIT at 394, 259 F. Supp. 2d at 1259. In this case, Commerce \u201cexamined the documents taken at verification and [concluded] that none of the contracts for POR entries shows that title passed after entry.\u201d <em>See </em>Decision Memo at 67. In other words, Commerce determined that - as to each transaction at issue - title transferred outside the United States. <em>See </em>Def. Response Brief at 34-35.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>One sale which was verified by Commerce specified that title passed when payment for the merchandise was received in full - which occurred well before the import entry date. <em>See </em>ICDAS Sales Verification Report (Conf. Doc. No. 44) at Exh. 14. Commerce thus confirmed that title for that sale passed before the goods entered this country - that is, outside the United States. <em>See generally </em>ICDAS Response Brief at 37; Def. Response Brief at 35. In addition, as to all other sales at issue, Commerce determined that all deliveries of ICDAS\u2019 goods were made outside the United States, in accordance with the terms of each of the sales, which were governed by certain specific Incoterms provisions. <em>See </em>Decision Memo at 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">The Domestic Producers challenge ICDAS\u2019 reliance on Incoterms, insisting that \u201cIncoterms are not relevant to transfer of title.\u201d <em>See </em>Domestic Producers Brief at 19-20. But the Domestic Producers\u2019 argument glosses over certain pivotal points.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">As ICDAS readily acknowledges, the relevant Incoterms (including FOB, CFR, and CIF) deal directly with the transfer of risk, rather than transfer of title. <em>See </em>ICDAS Response Brief at 39. However, under generally accepted principles of commercial law (reflected domestically in, <em>inter alia, </em>the Uniform Commercial Code, as well as in international <em>lex mercatoria),</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in the absence of an express agreement between the parties as to when title passes, title to goods transfers when the seller completes performance with respect to the physical delivery of the goods. <em>See </em>ICDAS Response Brief at 39. In each of the transactions here at issue, the goods were delivered outside the United States. Thus, as to each of those transactions, Commerce reasonably concluded that title transferred outside the United States as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">In short, contrary to the Domestic Producers\u2019 assertions, the administrative record in this matter adequately supports Commerce\u2019s determination that each of the transactions at issue occurred outside the United States.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The record before Commerce plainly includes \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>equate\u201d to support the agency\u2019s determination on this point. <em>See Consol.

In the Final Results, Commerce denied ICDAS\u2019 request, stating that ICDAS had failed to meet the requirements of the statute. <em>See </em>Decision Memo at 76. ICDAS here challenges Commerce\u2019s disallowance of the claimed startup adjustment. <em>See </em>ICDAS Brief at 2, 5, 22-32; ICDAS Reply Brief at 5-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">The statute authorizes a startup adjustment only where a producer establishes both that it is \u201cusing new production facilities or producing a new product that requires substantial additional investment,\u201d and that \u201cproduction levels are limited by technical factors associated with the initial phase of commercial production.\u201d <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(f)(l)(C)(ii). In the case at bar, Commerce concluded that ICDAS did not meet its burden as to the second criterion. Specifically, Commerce determined that ICDAS did not demonstrate sufficiently limited production levels for its claimed startup period (December 2003); nor did ICDAS establish that any asserted limitations on production were attributable to \u201ctechnical factors associated with the initial phase of production.\u201d <em>See </em>Decision Memo at 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">ICDAS basically raises two challenges to Commerce\u2019s disallowance of the claimed startup adjustment. First, ICDAS argues that Commerce\u2019s use of a full-month equivalent methodology to compare December 2003 production levels at the Biga facility to those of subsequent months is not in accordance with law, because - according to ICDAS - it relies on \u201ctheoretical\u201d data. <em>See generally </em>ICDAS Brief at 2, 5, 22-29; ICDAS Reply Brief at 5-8. And, second, ICDAS contends that Commerce erred in concluding that ICDAS did not provide sufficient information concerning technical factors limiting production. <em>See generally </em>ICDAS Brief at 5, 22-23, 29-31; ICDAS Reply Brief at 8-10. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>Both arguments are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">1. <em>Commerce\u2019s Determination That Biga\u2019s December 2003 Production Was Not Limited</em></p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The startup adjustment statute does not define what constitutes \u201climited production.\u201d Nor does the statute dictate how Commerce is to measure levels of production.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> However, the statute does delimit the duration of the startup period.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">According to the statute, the startup period ends \u201cat the point at which the level of commercial production that is characteristic of the merchandise, producer, or industry concerned is achieved.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(f)(l)(C)(iii). The statute thus does not extend the startup period up to the date on which the new facility reaches optimum functioning capacity. Indeed, the Statement of Administrative Action accompanying the Uruguay Round Agreements Act expressly provides that \u201c [attainment of peak production levels will not be the standard for identifying the end of the startup period because the startup period may end well before a company achieves optimum capacity utilization.\u201d <em>See </em>Statement of Administrative Action, H.R. Doc. No. 103-316, at 836 (1994), reprinted in 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4040, 4173.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">To be sure, as ICDAS repeatedly emphasizes, the absolute (unadjusted) production figures for the Biga melt shop for December 2003 were relatively low. Indeed, no production at all occurred in the first 10 days of the month, while ICDAS was conducting a series of test rims. Thus, the facility did not begin production until well into the start of the month; and the December 2003 figures reflect only a partial month of production.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Because the December 2003 production figures were based on a partial month, Commerce converted those figures to a full-month equivalent, so that Biga\u2019s production data for December 2003 could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>compared to the full-month production data for subsequent months. <em>See </em>Decision Memo at 80. Specifically, Commerce examined ICDAS\u2019 actual production measured in units processed for the months of December 2003, and January through March 2004. Based on ICDAS\u2019 actual production data, Commerce then calculated a full-month equivalent production figure for December 2003. In addition, Commerce calculated December 2003 production starts using a full-month equivalency, so that the agency would have data on production starts for that month to compare to production starts data for January, February, and March 2004. <em>See </em>Decision Memo at 80.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">With the production data for December 2003 restated as full-month equivalents, Commerce could reasonably compare the Biga melt shop\u2019s production in December 2003 (the claimed startup period) to the facility\u2019s production levels in January, February, and March 2004. Based on its comparison of production data, Commerce concluded that - while Biga\u2019s production in December 2003 clearly was not at the optimal level that ICDAS planned to achieve - the facility\u2019s production in December 2003 in fact was not limited within the meaning of the statute, and that ICDAS therefore was not eligible for a startup adjustment. <em>See </em>Decision Memo at 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">ICDAS charges that Commerce\u2019s use of a full-month equivalent methodology is not in accordance with law, because it \u201cimproperly uses hypothetical production data.\u201d ICDAS Brief at 27; <em>see also id. </em>at 2, 5, 26-28; ICDAS Reply Brief at 5-6, 8. To support its argument, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>ICDAS points to other instances in which Commerce has declined to grant a startup adjustment on the grounds that the production data proffered by producers were \u201ctheoretical\u201d or \u201chypothetical.\u201d <em>See, </em>e.g., ICDAS Brief at 24-25, 27 <em>(citing </em>Issues and Decision Memorandum for the Final Determination in the Antidumping Investigation of Chlorinated Isocyanurates from Spain, 2005 WL 2290648 (May 2, 2005) (\u201cChlorinated Isos from Spain\u201d), at comment 9 (where Commerce denied requested startup adjustment, because respondent\u2019s calculations relied \u201con a theoretical production capacity rather than the level of commercial production as required by the [Statement of Administrative Action]\u201d); Issues and Decision Memorandum for the Final Results of the Administrative Review of Stainless Steel Bar from India, 2003 WL 24153851 (Aug. 4, 2003) (\u201cStainless Steel Bar from India\u201d), at comment 2 (where Commerce rejected respondent\u2019s production limitation analysis because respondent compared \u201cits actual production levels to its theoretical production capacity\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">But there was nothing \u201chypothetical\u201d about the full-month equivalent methodology that Commerce used in the administrative review at issue here - at least not in the sense in which Commerce has previously used that term. True enough, Commerce in the past has rejected purely hypothetical production data, such as data based solely on production capacity, or speculative projections as to future production. <em>See </em>Decision Memo at 81. However, those situations were very different from what Commerce did in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Here, Commerce did not use <em>theoretical </em>production data to project <em>future </em>production levels. Instead, the agency used actual production data to establish a full-month equivalent for a partial month of production in <em>the past. See </em>Def. Response Brief at 19-20 (distinguishing full-month equivalent methodology in this case from situations presented in Chlorinated Isos from Spain and Stainless Steel Bar from India). Contrary to ICDAS\u2019 implication, Chlorinated Isos from Spain and Stainless Steel Bar from India do not stand for the proposition that Commerce is precluded from using actual production data for a partial month of operations to extrapolate a full month equivalent for purposes of comparison with other actual production data for subsequent full months. Those two cases merely reflect Commerce\u2019s policy of rejecting producers\u2019 attempts to qualify for a startup adjustment by using projected or optimal production capacity to establish an artificially-inflated benchmark for commercial production.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">In sum, in analyzing ICDAS\u2019 request for a startup adjustment, Commerce used ICDAS\u2019 <em>actual </em>production data, and adjusted those data to permit an apples-to-apples comparison of partial-month production for December 2003 with full-month production in the three months that followed. Commerce\u2019s full-month equivalent methodol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>ogy thus used ICDAS\u2019 actual production data and reasonably adjusted them to effectuate Congress\u2019 intent - that is, to determine whether Biga\u2019s production in December 2003 was limited. <em>See generally </em>Domestic Producers Response Brief at 20-21.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Nothing about Commerce\u2019s full-month equivalent approach is inconsistent with the language of the startup adjustment statute, which does not specifically define how Commerce is to measure whether, in any given case, production was \u201climited.\u201d Under such circumstances, Commerce is entitled to substantial deference in interpreting the statute. And nothing about the agency\u2019s interpretation here is inherently unreasonable. <em>See generally </em>Domestic Producers Response Brief at 20-21; <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, </em>467 U.S. 837, 843 (1984) (holding that, \u201cif the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to [a] specific issue, the question for the court is whether the agency\u2019s answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute\u201d); <em>Suramerica de Aleaciones Laminadas, C.A. v. United States, </em>966 F.2d 660, 665 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (observing that courts have duty to \u201crespect legitimate policy choices made by the agency in interpreting and applying the statute\u201d). <em>Cf. INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84 (1992) (stating that, where Congress has entrusted agency to administer statute in fact-intensive situations, agency\u2019s conclusion should be reversed only if the record evidence is \u201cso compelling that no reasonable factfinder\u201d could reach the same conclusion). ICDAS\u2019 attack on Commerce\u2019s full-month equivalent methodology must therefore be rejected.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>2. <em>Commerce\u2019s Determination That ICDAS Failed to Prove That Technical Factors Limited Biga\u2019s Production</em></p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">In addition to its challenge to Commerce\u2019s full-month equivalent methodology, ICDAS also disputes Commerce\u2019s conclusion that IC-DAS failed to provide sufficient information to establish that any limited production at Biga was the result of \u201ctechnical factors associated with the initial phase of commercial production.\u201d <em>See </em>ICDAS Brief at 5, 22, 29-32; ICDAS Reply Brief at 8-10. As discussed below, however, ICDAS\u2019 argument is lacking in merit. Accordingly, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that ICDAS had established that Biga\u2019s \u201cproduction levels [were] limited\u201d in December 2003 (the claimed startup period) (which, as discussed in section III.B.l immediately above, it did not), ICDAS nevertheless still would not be entitled to a startup adjustment, because ICDAS failed to meet its burden of proof to establish the cause of any assertedly limited production. <em>See generally </em>Def. Response Brief at 5-6, 9, 14-17; Domestic Producers Response Brief at 3, 17-18, 21-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">In denying the requested startup adjustment, Commerce found that ICDAS failed to respond to the agency\u2019s inquiries concerning technical factors associated with the initial phase of commercial production. Indeed, the record on point consisted of only a single vague statement, with no documentary support. <em>See </em>Decision Memo at 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Section D of Commerce\u2019s antidumping questionnaire explicitly requests that respondents provide'support for any claimed startup adjustments. Thus, in its questionnaire to ICDAS, Commerce expressly asked ICDAS to provide detailed information and documentation to support ICDAS\u2019 claim that Biga\u2019s production for the month <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>of December 2003 was limited by (in the words of the statute) \u201ctechnical factors associated with the initial phase of commercial production.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">Specifically, Commerce\u2019s questionnaire requested that ICDAS:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-5\">8. [E]xplain how the production levels were limited by technical factors associated with the initial phase of commercial production (as part of your analysis, describe the technical factors which limited production, demonstrate how these technical factors restricted the number of units processed by the company, and demonstrate how these technical factors are unique to the startup phase, not a result of chronic or normal production problems).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">The sole information on point that ICDAS placed on the record was the following succinct statement, in the company\u2019s Section D Questionnaire Response:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-7\">Production levels were limited by technical factors associated with the initial phase of commercial production because the company had to 1) develop the production parameters of the new operations; 2) install, adjust, calibrate and test the new equipment; and 3) train new employees to operate the new equipment. Operations typically incur such technical problems because of the newness of the facility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">Section D Questionnaire Response of ICDAS Celik Enerji Tersane ve Ulasim Sanayi, A.S.

Specifically, Commerce took affirmative steps to seek to elicit the requisite detailed information and documentary support concerning the claimed limiting technical factors, issuing a supplemental Section D Questionnaire to ICDAS,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> and inquiring again at ICDAS\u2019 cost verification. ICDAS nevertheless failed to supply any further information. <em>See </em>Decision Memo at 79-80. Commerce ultimately concluded that the record lacked sufficient information to allow the agency to conclude that any asserted limitation on production at the Biga facility in December 2003 was attributable to technical factors unique to startup, rather than \u201cfactors unrelated to startup, such as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>marketing difficulties or chronic production problems.\u201d <em>See </em>Decision Memo at 79-80; Statement of Administrative Action, H.R. Doc. No. 103-316, at 838, <em>reprinted in </em>1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 4174.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">In this action, ICDAS raises two principal objections to Commerce\u2019s conclusion. ICDAS first argues that the relationship between December 2003 production levels at the Biga facility and technical factors associated with the initial phase of commercial production should have been \u201cself-evident\u201d to Commerce, in light of the information that the agency had before it. <em>See </em>ICDAS Brief at 30; <em>see also id. </em>at 5, 22, 29-31; ICDAS Reply Brief at 8. In addition, ICDAS argues that Commerce\u2019s failure to grant the requested startup adjustment amounts to the improper use of \u201cfacts otherwise available\u201d or adverse inference. <em>See </em>ICDAS Brief at 31-32. Neither argument holds water.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">a. <em>ICDAS\u2019 Claim That Limitation Due to Technical Factors Is \u201cSelf-Evident\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Notwithstanding the fact that it bore the burden of proof, and despite Commerce\u2019s requests for further detail and documentation (both through a supplemental questionnaire and at verification), IC-DAS maintains that - other than the existing information on the record - it was not required to provide evidence that any asserted limitations on production at the Biga facility in December 2003 were due to factors unique to startup. ICDAS maintains that those factors and their limiting effects are \u201cself-evident\u201d from the record evidence, and that it thus \u201cprovided sufficient information for Commerce to address the startup issue.\u201d <em>See </em>ICDAS Brief at 30, 31 n.21. ICDAS further emphasizes that Commerce verified the fact that ICDAS conducted test runs at the Biga facility in early December, and that it did not begin actual production until later that month. <em>See </em>ICDAS Brief at 5, 22-23, 25, 30. Finally, ICDAS notes that the Biga facility produced only a limited number of types of billet in December 2003, but produced many more types in the months that followed. <em>See </em>ICDAS Brief at 22-23, 31 n.20.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">As the Domestic Producers observe, however, the information to which ICDAS points was not an adequate basis for a startup adjustment. <em>See generally </em>Domestic Producers Response Brief at 3, 18, 21-26; <em>see also </em>Def. Response Brief at 5-6, 9,14-17, 22. By any measure, the information on which ICDAS relies was not sufficient to demonstrate that technical factors unique to startup - rather than \u201cfactors unrelated to startup, such as marketing difficulties or chronic production problems\u201d - were the cause of assertedly limited production levels at Biga in December 2003, and to \u201cdocument that fact to the Department\u2019s satisfaction.\u201d <em>See </em>Statement of Administrative Action, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>H.R. Doc. No. 103-316, at 838, <em>reprinted in </em>1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 4174; Antidumping Duties; Countervailing Duties: Proposed Rule, 61 Fed. Reg. 7308, 7340 (Feb. 27, 1996) (Preamble).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">The Domestic Producers sum up the state of the record thusly: \u201cThe verified evidence, as identified by ICDAS, is this: Biga Melt was a new facility.... The production equipment was newly installed.... Test runs were conducted prior to production.... [A limited number of] types of billet were produced there in December 2003; [many more] types were produced in succeeding months.... That is all.\u201d <em>See </em>Domestic Producers Response Brief at 23. As discussed below, these basic facts - considered alone, or even in the aggregate - simply do not suffice to allow Commerce to grant the startup adjustment that IC-DAS seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">For example, ICDAS\u2019 first piece of evidence - that the Biga facility was entirely new - is logically relevant only to the first criterion of the startup adjustment standard (i.e., that \u201ca producer [was] using new production facilities\u201d), not to the second criterion (i.e., that \u201cproduction levels [were] limited by technical factors associated with the initial phase of commercial production\u201d), which is the criterion at issue here. Nothing about the newness of the Biga facility, in and of itself, demonstrates that production levels were limited due to technical factors unique to the startup phase. If newness were itself evidence that technical factors necessarily limit production in a facility\u2019s startup phase, the second criterion of Congress\u2019 startup adjustment standard would be entirely superfluous. <em>See generally </em>Domestic Producers Response Brief at 23-24; 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(f) (l)(C)(ii) (two-part standard for startup adjustment).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Similarly, ICDAS\u2019 second piece of evidence - that the equipment at the Biga facility was newly-installed - does not, without more, demonstrate that any asserted limitations on initial production were attributable to technical factors associated with startup. It simply reinforces the fact that the facility itself was new. New equipment alone is not evidence of technical limitations affecting production. <em>See generally </em>Domestic Producers Response Brief at 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">ICDAS\u2019 third piece of evidence - that ICDAS devoted days to testing equipment at the Biga facility prior to beginning production - is also inapposite. This fact too merely demonstrates that the facility was new, and does not necessarily say anything about whether production levels were limited by technical factors unique to startup. <em>See generally </em>Domestic Producers Response Brief at 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">The fourth piece of evidence cited by ICDAS is the disparity between the number of types of billet produced at the Biga facility in December 2003 and the number produced in later months. But this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>evidence is equally meaningless <em>vis-a-vis </em>the existence (or nonexistence) of technical factors unique to the startup phase. There is nothing on the record to show that the relatively low number of types of billet produced at Biga in December 2003 was due to technical factors associated with startup. The record simply shows that additional types of billet were produced later. Indeed, there is no record evidence to indicate that the difference between the types of billet produced in December 2003 and the types produced in later months reflects anything more than a business decision on the part of ICDAS. <em>See </em>Domestic Producers Response Brief at 24; <em>see also id. </em>at 23 n.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">In sum, none of the evidence on which ICDAS relies speaks to whether any asserted limitation on production at Biga in December 2003 was attributable to technical factors unique to startup operations.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The evidence either simply reflects that the Biga facility was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>new (a fact which was known and undisputed, and which is relevant at most to the first criterion of the startup adjustment standard, which is not at issue here), or it is wholly irrelevant. Either way, ICDAS\u2019 evidence does little or nothing to support its claim to a startup adjustment.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">ICDAS failed to provide Commerce with the evidence required to allow the agency to grant ICDAS\u2019 request for a startup adjustment. The statute requires more than mere evidence that a production facility is new. Rather, to justify a startup adjustment, a producer must provide specific, detailed information concerning how, and towhat extent, technical factors associated with the initial phase of commercial operations limited initial production at its new facility. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7' 1677b(f)(l)(C)(ii). ICDAS\u2019argument that the relationship between December 2003 production levels at the Biga facility and technical factors unique to startup is \u201cself-evident\u201d therefore must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">b. <em>ICDAS\u2019 Claim That Commerce Resorted to \u201cFacts Otherwise Available\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">As its final challenge to Commerce\u2019s denial of the requested startup adjustment, ICDAS argues that, even if ICDAS failed to fully respond to Commerce\u2019s requests for information and documentation concerning \u201ctechnical factors associated with the initial phase of commercial production\u201d at the Biga facility, Commerce had no \u201cbasis for resorting to facts available or drawing any adverse inferences.\u201d <em>See generally </em>ICDAS Brief at 31.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> ICDAS f\u00e1ults Commerce\u2019s determination be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>cause it does not include \u201cany analysis under the antidumping law\u2019s provisions on \u2018facts available\u2019\u201d to justify \u201cdiscard [ing]\u201d information provided by ICDAS to support its adjustment request. <em>Id. </em>ICDAS further complains that Commerce \u201cerred by failing to explain why the information that was allegedly withheld was necessary to reach a decision on the startup adjustment issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But ICDAS\u2019 arguments have no basis in either law or fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">ICDAS\u2019 position is apparently based on its belief that it provided sufficient information to Commerce to allow the agency to grant the requested startup adjustment. As discussed above, however, that is simply not the case. Despite Commerce\u2019s repeated prodding, and notwithstanding the fact that ICDAS bore the burden of proof on the issue, ICDAS left the agency with only a very thin record on its request.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">The record evidence - basically, little more than a single statement by ICDAS - was not sufficient to permit Commerce to properly consider ICDAS\u2019 request for a startup adjustment. As Commerce stated, \u201cwithout an explanation of how the claimed technical factors limited production levels, we are not able to determine whether ICDAS\u2019s production levels were limited by technical factors associated with the initial phase of commercial production.\u201d <em>See </em>Decision Memo at 80. But, contrary to ICDAS\u2019 implication, that determination does not reflect Commerce\u2019s invocation of \u201cfacts otherwise available\u201d or adverse inference. Rather, it is simply an explanation that, because ICDAS failed to meet its burden of proof - in accordance with the Statement of Administrative Action and established agency practice - Commerce could not even evaluate ICDAS\u2019 request, and was forced to deny the startup adjustment. <em>See generally </em>Domestic Producers Response Brief at 26-27; Def. Response Brief at 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Like its other challenges to Commerce\u2019s denial of its requested startup adjustment, ICDAS\u2019 claim that Commerce improperly resorted to \u201cfacts otherwise available\u201d or adverse inference is similarly lacking in merit. In light of the record that the agency had before it, Commerce\u2019s action denying the startup adjustment must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>C. <em>Commerce\u2019s Treatment of ICDAS\u2019 Net Foreign Exchange Gain</em></p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">In the course of the administrative review at issue here, Commerce conducted a cost investigation to determine whether ICDAS made sales of subject merchandise at prices below the cost of production. The statute defines cost of production as an amount equal to the sum of \u201cthe cost of materials and of fabrication or other processing... employed in producing the foreign like product,\u201d and includes \u201can amount for selling, general, and administrative expenses based on actual data pertaining to production and sales of the foreign like product.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(b)(3). However, the statute does not specify the method of determining those expenses for purposes of calculating cost of production. <em>See generally </em>Def. Response Brief at 22-23. Commerce has interpreted the statute to include financial expenses in the calculation of cost of production, and treats foreign exchange gains and losses as financial expenses. <em>See, e.g., </em>Silicoman-ganese from Brazil: Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, 68 Fed. Reg. 61,185, 61,187 (Oct. 27, 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">During the period of review in question, ICDAS realized a net foreign exchange gain, as a result of its foreign exchange income on sales, as well as its foreign exchange income on foreign currency bank checking accounts (which, ICDAS emphasizes, were \u201cnecessary for [the company\u2019s] purchases and sales in foreign currencies\u201d). <em>See </em>IC-DAS Brief at 32; <em>see also id. </em>at 6; ICDAS Reply Brief at 10. In accordance with its standard practice, in calculating ICDAS\u2019 cost of production here, Commerce treated the company\u2019s foreign exchange gain within the category of \u201cfinancial expenses,\u201d and included it in the total financial expense ratio calculation in the Final Results. <em>See </em>generally.Decision Memo at 86-88. Although ICDAS\u2019 net foreign exchange gain exceeded its financial expenses, Commerce did not allow any of that gain to offset other expenses included in ICDAS\u2019 cost of production, effectively \u201ccapping\u201d ICDAS\u2019 financial expenses at zero. <em>See </em>ICDAS Brief at 32-33; ICDAS Reply Brief at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">ICDAS asserts that its foreign exchange gains or losses do not result from separate cash management activities, but merely constitute adjustments necessary to ensure that other components of its cost of production are properly stated in a single currency. <em>See generally </em>ICDAS Brief at 6, 32-36; ICDAS Reply Brief at 10, 12-13. ICDAS therefore contests Commerce\u2019s treatment of ICDAS\u2019 net foreign exchange gain as part of \u201cfinancial expenses\u201d in the agency\u2019s calculation of ICDAS\u2019 cost of production. <em>See generally </em>ICDAS Brief at 2, 6, 32-35; ICDAS Reply Brief at 10-13. ICDAS further contends that Commerce erred in capping ICDAS\u2019 net foreign exchange gain so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>as to set ICDAS\u2019 \u201cfinancial expenses\u201d at zero. <em>See generally </em>ICDAS Brief at 2, 6, 35-37; ICDAS Reply Brief at 10-12. According to ICDAS, Commerce should have fully recognized the company\u2019s net foreign exchange gain in the agency\u2019s cost of production calculations. <em>See generally </em>ICDAS Brief at 2, 6, 32-33, 35-37; ICDAS Reply Brief at 10-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">As discussed below, however, Commerce\u2019s treatment of ICDAS\u2019 net foreign exchange gain must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">1. <em>Commerce\u2019s Treatment of ICDAS\u2019 Foreign Exchange Gain Within \u201cFinancial Expenses\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">ICDAS\u2019 threshold argument is that its foreign exchange gains or losses do not result from separate cash management activities, but - instead - constitute an adjustment necessary to ensure that other costs (such as the costs of manufacturing, sales, and general company operations) are properly stated in a single currency. <em>See generally </em>ICDAS Brief at 6, 32-36; ICDAS Reply Brief at 10-13. ICDAS maintains that its foreign exchange gains or losses therefore \u201cshould be fully accounted for\u201d in the cost of production, rather than included in \u201ca discrete category of \u2018financial expenses,\u2019 \u201d which Commerce capped at zero. ICDAS Reply Brief at 11; <em>see also id. </em>at 10-12; ICDAS Brief at 2, 6, 32-33, 35-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">ICDAS explains that its net foreign exchange gain during the period of review had \u201cboth a cost of manufacturing component and a sales-related component.\u201d ICDAS Brief at 33. ICDAS\u2019 manufacturing operations depend upon both raw material inputs and capital assets which are purchased in currencies other than ICDAS\u2019 domestic currency, the Turkish Lira. According to ICDAS, consistent with generally accepted accounting principles, the company\u2019s purchases of foreign raw materials and foreign capital assets are generally booked as accounts payable on the date they are received, using the appropriate foreign exchange rate on that date. However, actual payment generally is not made until some time later. As ICDAS notes, the change in the foreign exchange rate between the two dates results in a foreign exchange gain or loss for the company, related to its manufacturing operations. <em>See generally </em>ICDAS Brief at 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">Like ICDAS\u2019 manufacturing operations, ICDAS\u2019 sales operations also produce foreign exchange gains or losses. When ICDAS makes a sale in foreign currency, the account receivable booked at the time of sale is converted to Turkish Lira on that date. However, the actual amount of Turkish Lira that ICDAS receives depends on the exchange rate when the buyer deposits its payment in foreign currency into ICDAS\u2019 account. The difference between the exchange rate on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>date of sale and the exchange rate on the date of payment results in a foreign exchange gain or loss for ICDAS, as a result of its sales operations. <em>See generally </em>ICDAS Brief at 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">In addition to the foreign exchange gains and losses associated with ICDAS\u2019 manufacturing and sales operations, foreign exchange gains and losses also result from ICDAS\u2019 outstanding loans denominated in foreign currency. ICDAS asserts that such loans \u201crelate to the general operation of the company,\u201d and must be accounted for in Commerce\u2019s cost of production calculations. <em>See generally </em>ICDAS Brief at 33-34. ICDAS explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-5\">[A]s a company conducting business in multiple currencies, IC-DAS constantly faces the currency risk resulting from the mismatch between the currencies in which costs are incurred and revenues are earned. To mitigate this risk directly linked to its production and sale of merchandise, ICDAS... incurfs] some of its debt in foreign currencies. Thus, when the Turkish Lira appreciates, and revenue in Turkish Lira terms declines relative to costs, the foreign currency loans provide a hedge and generate foreign currency gains to offset the foreign currency loss generated by the decline in sales income in Turkish Lira terms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">ICDAS Brief at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">ICDAS argues that foreign exchange gain or loss thus \u201cis not a distinct element of cost.\u201d ICDAS Brief at 34. ICDAS asserts that \u201c[tjhere is no check or account credit received from a financial institution for a foreign exchange gain, and no direct payment is made for a foreign exchange loss. Rather, the exchange rate gain or loss results from a series of accounting entries that are necessary and required by [generally accepted accounting principles] to ensure that all of the <em>other </em>elements of cost and income recorded by the company are properly stated in a single currency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>ICDAS therefore characterizes net exchange rate gain or loss as \u201can overall <em>adjustment </em>necessary to ensure that all other costs for the calculation of ICDAS\u2019 [cost of production] are properly stated in Turkish Lira.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\"><em>As </em>the Government correctly notes, however, ICDAS\u2019 foreign exchange gains and losses are not inherent in its manufacturing and sales operations. Instead, they are the product of <em>cash management decisions </em>made by ICDAS in connection with its operations - cash management decisions which expose the company to those gains and losses. <em>See </em>Def. Response Brief at 9, 24; <em>see generally </em>Decision Memo at 86. In other words, ICDAS\u2019 financing decisions - such as whether to pay for its purchases immediately, or to carry them as accounts payable; whether to make sales on a credit basis (i.e., as accounts receivable), or to require immediate payment; whether to borrow in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>foreign currency, or in its own domestic currency; and whether to enter into foreign currency contracts - are related to, but separate and distinct from, the company\u2019s manufacturing and sales activities. <em>See generally </em>Decision Memo at 86-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">Thus, when ICDAS purchases raw materials or other inputs needed for production using a foreign currency, the company can - at the time of purchase - pay in cash immediately, based on the prevailing exchange rate between the Turkish Lira and the foreign currency. IC-DAS could thereby avoid any exposure to exchange rate gains or losses in its manufacturing operations, if it wished to do so. <em>See generally </em>Def. Response Brief at 24; Decision Memo at 86-87. On the other hand, if ICDAS instead elects to pay for the purchase of the inputs at a later date (i.e., to finance the purchase, or to set it up as an account payable, which is - in effect - buying on credit), the value of the inputs is booked in the equivalent domestic currency (i.e., in Turkish Lira) as of the date of sale, and not as of the date of actual payment. And the change in the foreign exchange rate between the date of purchase and the date of payment creates a foreign exchange gain or loss for the company. Accordingly, it is not the purchase transaction itself that results in a foreign exchange gain or loss, but - rather- ICDAS\u2019 decision to defer payment and to finance the purchase instead. <em>See generally </em>Def. Response Brief at 24-25; Decision Memo at 86-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">The same logic applies with equal force to ICDAS\u2019 export sales transactions denominated in foreign currencies. As Commerce observed in the Final Results, ICDAS could demand immediate payment in such transactions, and would then avoid any exposure to foreign exchange rate gains or losses. On the other hand, if ICDAS instead elects to extend credit to customers in such transactions (i.e., by setting up accounts receivable from customers), the difference between the foreign exchange rate as of the date of sale and as of the date of payment results in a foreign exchange gain or loss for ICDAS. ICDAS\u2019 decision to extend credit and thus to expose itself to foreign currency fluctuations in such transactions is a cash management decision. <em>See generally </em>Decision Memo at 87. Accordingly, it is not the sale transaction itself that results in a foreign exchange gain or loss, but - rather - ICDAS\u2019 decision to extend credit to its customer (rather than requiring immediate payment).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">In its briefs, ICDAS never directly confronts the fundamental logic of Commerce\u2019s position, but instead repeatedly asserts (in essence) that the company\u2019s foreign exchange gains or losses are <em>\u201cintertwined with </em>and <em>inseparable from\u201d </em>its manufacturing, sales, and other operations. <em>See </em>ICDAS Reply Brief at 11; <em>see also id. </em>at 10, 12-13; ICDAS Brief at 6, 35. To the contrary, as Commerce explained in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>Final Results, ICDAS could completely avoid exposure to foreign exchange risks, if it wished to do so, by making different cash management decisions - by, for example, making immediate payment for inputs that it purchases in foreign currencies, and by requiring that its customers make immediate payment in export sales transactions denominated in foreign currencies. <em>See </em>Decision Memo at 86-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">It is of no moment that, as ICDAS pointedly notes, the company is \u201cnot [in] the business of speculating with foreign currencies,\u201d and that the company\u2019s foreign exchange gains or losses associated with its operations \u201creflect the international currency market rate changes - which ICDAS can neither predict nor control.\u201d <em>See </em>ICDAS Reply Brief at 11. Although foreign exchange rates are not within ICDAS\u2019 control, Commerce\u2019s point is that ICDAS <em>can </em>control whether or not to expose itself to the risk of gains or losses in such rates. ICDAS\u2019 affirmative decisions to expose itself to such risks - for example, by delaying payment through the use of credit in purchasing inputs using foreign currencies, and by extending credit to its own customers in export sales transactions in foreign currencies - are cash management decisions related to, but separate and distinct from, its underlying decisions to purchase inputs or to make sales. Commerce therefore treated ICDAS\u2019 net foreign exchange gain within the category of financial expenses, for purposes of its cost of production calculations. It cannot be said that Commerce\u2019s interpretation is an unreasonable interpretation of the statute. <em>See </em>Def. Response Brief at 22-23, 25-26 <em>0citing Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 842-43).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">In short, Commerce reasonably concluded in the Final Results that ICDAS\u2019 net foreign exchange gain was \u201cpart of the company\u2019s overall net financing expense.\u201d <em>See </em>Decision Memo at 87. ICDAS\u2019 arguments to the contrary are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">2. <em>Commerce\u2019s Decision Capping ICDAS\u2019 Financial Expenses at Zero</em></p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">Not only does ICDAS dispute Commerce\u2019s treatment of the company\u2019s foreign exchange gain within the category of \u201cfinancial expenses\u201d for purposes of calculating cost of production, but - in addition - ICDAS challenges Commerce\u2019s decision to cap the company\u2019s financial expenses at zero. <em>See generally </em>ICDAS Brief at 2, 6, 35-37; ICDAS Reply Brief at 10-13. According to ICDAS, Commerce should have fully recognized the company\u2019s net foreign exchange gain, by using all of that gain to offset expenses included in ICDAS\u2019 cost of production. <em>See generally </em>ICDAS Brief at 2, 6, 35-37; ICDAS Reply Brief at 10-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">As Commerce explained in the Final Results, there is typically a cost associated with financing a company\u2019s operations, which is what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>the agency seeks to capture as part of \u201cfinancial expenses.\u201d <em>See </em>Decision Memo at 88. Commerce includes a cost of borrowing, as determined by various factors. If income is generated through those activities, the agency allows that income to be used to offset the cost of financing, up to the total financial expenses incurred. <em>Id. </em>But where - as here - the amount of relevant income exceeds the company\u2019s financial expenses, Commerce recognizes that the company\u2019s financial expenses were zero, and does not include a sum for financial costs in calculating the company\u2019s cost of production. <em>Id. </em>Commerce does not allow financial expenses to be used to offset <em>other </em>expenses included in cost of production. As Commerce observed in the Final Results, \u201cwhile certain types of income can legitimately be used to offset an expense, they can be used to do so only to the extent that there are costs to offset.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It would therefore \u201cbe inappropriate...to reduce other components of the [cost of production] by the net financing income,\u201d as ICDAS urges. <em>Id.', see generally </em>Def. Response Brief at 25- 27; Domestic Producers Response Brief at 29-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">ICDAS argues that Commerce\u2019s actions here run afoul of a new policy first articulated in Mushrooms from India, which concerns the agency\u2019s treatment of foreign exchange gains or losses in calculating cost of production. <em>See </em>ICDAS Brief at 35-36 <em>(citing </em>Certain Preserved Mushrooms from India: Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, 68 Fed. Reg. 11,045, 11,048 (March 7, 2003) (\u201cMushrooms from India\u201d)); ICDAS Reply Brief at 10-12 (same). Prior to Mushrooms from India, Commerce had required respondents to break down their foreign exchange gains and losses into separate components based on the source, and to include only those from certain sources in their reported costs. <em>See generally </em>Domestic Producers Response Brief at 29. But, in Mushrooms from India, Commerce explained that it was changing its practice: \u201cInstead of splitting apart the foreign exchange gains and losses as reported in an entity\u2019s financial statements, [Commerce] will normally include in the interest expense computation <em>all </em>foreign exchange gains and losses.\u201d <em>See </em>Mushrooms from India, 68 Fed. Reg. at 11,048 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">In citing to Mushrooms from India, ICDAS conveys the impression that Commerce\u2019s intent and practice is to fully recognize all foreign exchange gains and losses in calculating a respondent\u2019s cost of production. <em>See </em>ICDAS Brief at 35-36; ICDAS Reply Brief at 10-12. However, as Commerce emphasized in the Final Results, Mushrooms from India did not address a <em>net </em>foreign exchange gain. <em>See </em>Decision Memo at 88. Instead, the case stands for the proposition that Commerce will include in its calculations all elements or components of foreign exchange gain and loss - <em>not </em>that the agency will necessarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>offset a <em>net </em>gain against any and all other elements of cost of production. <em>See generally </em>Domestic Producers Response Brief at 30. Contrary to ICDAS\u2019 claims, nothing in Mushrooms from India mandates that Commerce recognize the entirety of ICDAS\u2019net foreign exchange gain by using all of it to offset expenses included in the company\u2019s cost of production.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">ICDAS also quarrels with Commerce\u2019s reliance on <em>Cinsa </em>to support the agency\u2019s decision in the Final Results to limit the use of ICDAS\u2019 net foreign exchange gain to offsetting financial expenses, rather than recognizing the entirety of that gain and allowing it to offset other expenses included in the company\u2019s cost of production. <em>See </em>ICDAS Brief at 36-37 <em>(citing Cinsa S.A. de C.V. v. United States, </em>21 CIT 341, 351, 966 F. Supp. 1230, 1239-40 (1997)); Decision Memo at 88 (same). The court in <em>Cinsa </em>rejected the plaintiff\u2019s claim that Commerce had erred in allowing an offset of interest <em>income </em>only to the extent of interest <em>expenses. </em>The <em>Cinsa </em>court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-5\">[E]xpenses by their nature cannot produce a negative effect on the [cost of production]. Expenses, as a component of costs, cannot become a profit by the nature of their designation. Cinsa is effectively requesting that Commerce and the Court recognize a negative cost. Based on sound accounting and economic principles, the Court declines to accept a finding of negative costs when calculating [cost of production]. Interest expense, as a component of [cost of production], is a discrete expense account and as such, cannot provide an offset to any other expense accounts. Once the interest expense account is reduced to zero through the offset of interest income, interest expense and interest income [have] no further effect on the calculation of [cost of production].... [0]nce interest expense is reduced to zero, no further inquiry is necessary as Commerce cannot enter a profit into the calculation of [cost of production].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-6\"><em>Cinsa, </em>21 CIT at 351, 966 F. Supp. at 1239-40. So too, in the case at bar, Commerce reasoned - by analogy to <em>Cinsa </em>- that \u201cfinancial expenses, as a component of [cost of production], are a discrete expense account and as such, cannot provide an offset to any other expense accounts.\u201d Decision Memo at 88; <em>see generally </em>Def. Response Brief at 26-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">ICDAS argues that <em>Cinsa </em>is irrelevant here because, according to ICDAS, foreign exchange gains or losses are not a subset of financial expenses. <em>See </em>ICDAS Brief at 36-37. As discussed in section III.C.l above, however, Commerce properly concluded that ICDAS\u2019 foreign exchange gains here were the product of its cash management deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>sions, and thus properly treated ICDAS\u2019 net foreign exchange gain as part of the company\u2019s overall net financing expense for purposes of Commerce\u2019s cost of production calculations. <em>See </em>Decision Memo at 87; <em>see generally </em>Def. Response Brief at 27. ICDAS\u2019 attempt to distinguish <em>Cinsa </em>is therefore futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">In sum, Commerce properly decided to include ICDAS\u2019 net foreign exchange gain in the financial expense ratio calculation, and to limit the recognition of that gain to offset only ICDAS\u2019 financial expenses (effectively capping those expenses at zero). The agency\u2019s determinations to that effect were consistent with agency practice, and were both supported by substantial evidence and otherwise in accordance with law. ICDAS\u2019 arguments to the contrary must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">D. <em>Commerce\u2019s Decision on Remand to Use Invoice Date As Date of Sale</em></p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">ICDAS strenuously objects to Commerce\u2019s determination on remand that, for purposes of the agency\u2019s antidumping analysis, the appropriate date of sale for ICDAS\u2019 U.S. sales is the date of invoice. <em>See generally </em>ICDAS Response Brief at 1-3, 5-30; ICDAS Supp. Reply Brief, <em>passim. </em>In particular, ICDAS protests Commerce\u2019s use of the same date of sale - invoice date - for both ICDAS\u2019 U.S. and home market sales, asserting that the ways that the two types of sales are negotiated, orders are finalized, and merchandise is produced \u201cdiffer markedly.\u201d <em>See </em>ICDAS Supp. Reply Brief at 1-2 <em>(quoting </em>Circular Welded Non-Alloy Steel Pipe from the Republic of Korea; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, 63 Fed. Reg. 32,833, 32,835-36 (June 16, 1998) (\u201cPipe from Korea\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">ICDAS contends that, with one exception, the contract date - rather than the invoice date - best reflects the date on which ICDAS and its U.S. buyers reached a meeting of the minds on the material terms of sale, and should be used as the date of sale for purposes of Commerce\u2019s analysis. <em>See </em>ICDAS Response Brief at 1, 3, 30; ICDAS Supp. Reply Brief at 13; <em>see also </em>Remand Results at 2, 13-14. As to that one exception, involving a price increase in a single contract, ICDAS asserts that the proper date of sale is invoice date (in effect, the date of contract amendment). <em>See </em>ICDAS Response Brief at 3, 20-21, 30; ICDAS Supp. Reply Brief at 1, 5 n.3, 13; <em>see also </em>Remand Results at 2, 13-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">The antidumping statute on its face does not specify the manner in which Commerce is to determine the date of sale. However, by enacting the Uruguay Rounds Agreements Act, Congress \u201cincorporated the trade agreements adopted by the World Trade Organization at the Uruguay Round negotiations into United States law.\u201d <em>Allied Tube and Conduit Corp. v. United States, </em>24 CIT 1357, 1367-68, 127 F. Supp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>2d 207, 216 (2000) <em>(Allied Tube I). </em>One such WTO agreement expressly provides that \u201c[n]ormally, the date of sale would be the date of contract, purchase order, order confirmation or invoice, <em>whichever establishes the material terms of sale.\u201d See </em>Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994, Art. 2.4.1 n.8 (emphasis added). Further, the Statement of Administrative Action accompanying the Uruguay Round Agreements Act expressly defines date of sale as the \u201cdate when the material terms of sale are established.\u201d <em>See </em>Statement of Administrative Action, H.R. Doc. No. 103-316, at 810, <em>reprinted in </em>1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 4153. Through the Uruguay Round Agreements Act and the Statement of Administrative Action, Congress thus \u201cexpressed its intent that, for antidumping purposes, the date of sale be <em>flexible </em>so as to accurately reflect the true date on which the material elements of sale were established.\u201d <em>Allied Tube I, </em>24 CIT at 1370, 127 F. Supp. 2d at 219 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">Consonant with Congress\u2019 intent as manifested in the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, Commerce promulgated a regulation on date of sale, which provides that the date of sale is invoice date, except where another date better reflects the date on which the material terms of sale were established:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-5\">In identifying the date of sale of the subject merchandise or foreign like product, the Secretary normally will use the date of invoice, as recorded in the exporter or producer\u2019s records kept in the ordinary course of business. However, the Secretary may use a date other than the date of invoice if the Secretary is satisfied that a different date <em>better reflects the date on which the exporter or producer establishes the material terms of sale.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.401(i) (emphasis added). In the Preamble to its date of sale regulation, Commerce further explained that the focus of an agency date of sale analysis is to determine when the contracting parties reached a \u201cmeeting of the minds\u201d on the material terms of sale:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-7\">If the Department is presented with satisfactory evidence that the material terms of sale are finally established on a date other than the date of invoice, the Department will use that alternative date as the date of sale. For example, in situations involving large custom-made merchandise in which the parties engage in formal negotiation and contracting procedures, the Department usually will use a date other than the date of invoice. However, the Department emphasizes that in these situations, the terms of sale must be firmly established and not merely proposed. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>preliminary agreement on terms, even if reduced to writing, in an industry where renegotiation is common does not provide any reliable indication that <em>the terms are truly \u201cestablished\u201d in the minds of the buyer and seller. </em>This holds even if, for a particular sale, the terms were not renegotiated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">Antidumping Duties; Countervailing Duties: Final Rule, 62 Fed. Reg. 27,296, 27,349 (May 19, 1997) (Preamble) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">ICDAS acknowledges that Commerce\u2019s regulations afford the agency discretion in determining the date of sale to be used in its antidumping margin calculations. But, according to ICDAS, Commerce abused that discretion in the Remand Results here - both by using a date of sale methodology that is inconsistent with Congressional intent and the governing regulation, as well as established agency practice, and by making factual findings that are not supported by substantial evidence in the record. <em>See </em>ICDAS Response Brief at 2-3, 17 n.12; ICDAS Supp. Reply Brief at 1-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">ICDAS explains that, during the administrative review at issue, it used different bases to report the dates of sales for its home market sales and its U.S. sales, because those sales were made pursuant to two distinct sales processes. ICDAS made tens of thousands of home market sales during the relevant period, most of which were relatively small and were filled out of ICDAS\u2019 existing inventory. ICDAS did not negotiate and sign formal written contracts with its customers in its home market, and, instead, did business by phone or through written confirmation. For home market sales, ICDAS reported the earlier of the date or invoice or the date of shipment as the date of sale for use in Commerce\u2019s margin calculations. <em>See generally </em>ICDAS Response Brief at 5 (and authorities cited there).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">In contrast, ICDAS had far, far fewer U.S. sales, but each of those sales was larger in volume by orders of magnitude. Merchandise that ICDAS sold to the U.S. market was generally manufactured to order, was sold in inches (rather than millimeters), and was subject to other special requirements not applicable to ICDAS\u2019 home sales. In light of the long lead time required to produce, pack, and ship such large special orders, U.S. sales were made pursuant to a deliberate and formal negotiation process, and formal written contracts were executed by the parties. As ICDAS explains, the formal written contract afforded protection to both parties, memorializing their meeting of the minds on the quantity and specifications of the merchandise to be supplied, the unit price, the shipment date, and other material terms of their deal. The U.S. buyer thus was assured of the supply of merchandise needed to fill orders from its customers. And ICDAS was assured that it had a customer for the specified quantity of its U.S.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>customized merchandise before it began production of that merchandise. For purposes of Commerce\u2019s antidumping analysis, ICDAS reported the contract date as the date of sale for its U.S. sales, on the theory that the contract date better reflected the date on which the material terms of those sales were established. <em>See generally </em>ICDAS Response Brief at 5-7 (and authorities cited there).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">In the course of the verification process, Commerce confirmed that ICDAS\u2019 \u201cexport sales process differs from the domestic sales process in that: 1) orders are always in written form; 2) a contract is signed after confirmation of the order; 3) merchandise is sold on a theoretical-weight basis; and 4) merchandise is always produced to order.\u201d <em>See </em>ICDAS Sales Verification Report (Conf. Doc. No. 44) at 4. In its Preliminary Results, Commerce nevertheless used invoice date as the date of sale for ICDAS\u2019 U.S. sales. <em>See </em>Preliminary Results, 70 Fed. Reg. at 23,992. In the Final Results, however, Commerce reversed its position on the date of sale issue. Concluding that the material terms of ICDAS\u2019 U.S. sales were established on the date of contract, Commerce used contract date as the date of sale in its Final Results, and calculated a <em>de minimis </em>dumping margin of 0.16% for ICDAS. <em>See </em>Decision Memo at 29; Final Results, 70 Fed. Reg. at 67,666-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Several days after the Final Results were published, the Domestic Producers filed a ministerial error letter disputing Commerce\u2019s ruling on the date of sale issue, pointing to a price change as to one of ICDAS\u2019 U.S. contracts. Soon thereafter, the Domestic Producers filed suit, challenging, <em>inter alia, </em>Commerce\u2019s use of contract date as the date of sale for ICDAS\u2019 U.S. sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Commerce\u2019s request for a voluntary remand on the date of sale issue was granted. <em>See generally </em>ICDAS Response Brief at 10 (and authorities cited there); Remand Results at 2-3. On remand, Commerce reversed course once again, finding that invoice date - rather than contract date - should be used as the date of sale for ICDAS\u2019 U.S. sales. In its Remand Results, Commerce stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-7\">[W]e find that the price change, while limited to a single contract, related to a significant percentage of ICDAS\u2019s U.S. entries during the [period of review]. Under these circumstances, we determine that the contract date does not represent the date on which the parties had a real \u201cmeeting of the minds\u201d because the material terms of sale not only could be, but were altered after the date in the ordinary course of business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">Remand Results at 20. Using invoice date as the date of sale for ICDAS\u2019 U.S. sales, Commerce recalculated ICDAS\u2019 dumping margin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>to be 1.63% - a figure which exceeds the <em>de minimis </em>threshold, rendering ICDAS ineligible for revocation of the antidumping order. <em>See </em>Remand Results at 2-3, 5, 24-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">ICDAS charges that the Remand Results \u201ccontravene [ ] the anti-dumping statute and Commerce\u2019s regulations by using a rigid date of sale methodology that relies entirely on a single price change and the volume of sales affected by that price change to reach the conclusion that invoice date is the date of sale for all of ICDAS\u2019 U.S. sales.\u201d ICDAS Response Brief at 2. ICDAS argues that, \u201c[a]lthough the [Remand Results] purport! ] to establish the date on which the parties had a \u2018real meeting of the minds,\u2019 [the Remand Results] fail to employ an appropriate test for ascertaining whether the contracting parties reached a binding agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>According to ICDAS, the Remand Results \u201cdo[ ] not examine the parties\u2019 expectations about what was to be purchased, how much would be purchased, and how long it would take to produce.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, ICDAS asserts, the Remand Results fail to \u201cconsider whether the subsequent course of conduct between the parties reveals that the parties understood that they were bound by the terms of contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">ICDAS requests that the date of sale issue be remanded to Commerce once again, \u201cwith specific instructions that Commerce ascertain the point at which ICDAS and its U.S. customers had a meeting of the minds by considering the nature of the U.S. sales process and the course of conduct between the parties.\u201d <em>See </em>ICDAS Response Brief at 3. ICDAS predicts that \u201c[b]ased upon such an analysis, Commerce should find that the date of sale generally is the contract date,\u201d and that \u201cconsistent with Commerce\u2019s past decisions, the agency should treat the sole price change that occurred as an amendment to the contract, and use amendment date as date of sale only for that particular transaction.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">As set forth more fully below, Commerce\u2019s determination on remand to use invoice date as the date of sale for all of ICDAS\u2019 U.S. sales is not supported by substantial evidence. Nor is that determination otherwise in accordance with law. Accordingly, the issue must be remanded to Commerce once again, for its reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">1. <em>Whether the Remand Results Are In Accordance With Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">As ICDAS notes, under Commerce\u2019s approach in the Remand Results here, even a single change to a material term in a single transaction - without regard to the nature of the change or the circumstances surrounding it - may require an across-the-board use of invoice date as the date of sale for all sales to all customers during the period of review. As ICDAS observes, such an approach is fundamentally at odds with the antidumping statute and regulations, as well as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>Commerce\u2019s past practice, because it involves nothing more than a superficial, black-and-white, all-or-nothing determination whether there has been any change in any material term in any contract at issue, rather than a reasoned, case-specific, fact-intensive analysis as to when the parties had a meeting of the minds on the material terms of sale, which is what the law requires. <em>See generally </em>ICDAS Response Brief at 16-17; <em>see also </em>Remand Results at 20 (noting that appropriate date of sale is \u201cthe date on which the parties had a real \u2018meeting of the minds\u2019 \u201d)<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">The Government seeks to dismiss ICDAS\u2019 challenge to the Remand Results out of hand, boldly asserting that Commerce\u2019s determination must be sustained because the agency has \u201cabsolute\u201d discretion in determining date of sale. <em>See </em>Def. Supp. Response Brief at 8.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Appar-ently relying on the phrasing of Commerce\u2019s date of sale regulation (which provides for use of a date other than invoice date <em>\u201cif the Secretary is satisfied\u201d </em>that use of the alternative date is more appropriate), and on a single sentence in <em>Hevensa, </em>the Government maintains that \u201calthough Commerce may exercise its <em>discretion </em>to use a different time than the invoice date as the date of sale, <em>because this is a discretionary act, it is not required to do so.\u201d See generally </em>Def. Supp. Response Brief at 7-8 (emphases added) <em>(citing </em>19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.401(i) (emphasis added); <em>Hornos Electricos de Venezuela, S.A. v. United States, </em>27 CIT 1522, 1536, 285 F. Supp. 2d 1353, 1367 (2003) (Hevensa)); <em>see also </em>Domestic Producers Reply Brief at 9 <em>(quoting Hevensa, </em>27 CIT at 1536, 285 F. Supp. 2d at 1366-67, for proposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>that, even if material terms of sale are not subject to change, \u201cdiscretion... means that [Commerce] may use a date of sale other than the invoice date, but is not required to do so\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">The Government\u2019s position on Commerce\u2019s authority is plainly far too expansive. As a threshold matter, there is <em>no </em>area in which any government agency has \u201cabsolute,\u201d unfettered discretion. <em>See, e.g., Beardmore v. Dep\u2019t of Agriculture, </em>761 F.2d 677, 679 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (holding that \u201can agency\u2019s discretion is not unlimited\u201d). Certainly no court in any international trade case (including <em>Hevensa) </em>has held that Commerce has \u201cabsolute,\u201d unbridled discretion to apply invoice date as the date of sale across-the-board, with no regard for the record evidence in a case. Notwithstanding the Government\u2019s implications, there is nothing in <em>Hevensa </em>to suggest that Commerce is free to arbitrarily choose to use as the date of sale some date other than the date when the material terms of sale were established. In other words, if a particular date is demonstrated to be the date when the material terms of sale were established, Commerce has no discretion to simply ignore that date and choose to use some other date as the date of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Similarly, contrary to the Domestic Producers\u2019 claims, neither Commerce\u2019s date of sale regulation nor the Preamble to the agency\u2019s antidumping regulations expresses a \u201cstrong preference\u201d for use of invoice date as a respondent\u2019s date of sale. <em>See </em>Domestic Producers Reply Brief at 9 (asserting that agency regulations \u201cexpress a strong preference\u201d for invoice date, and also discussing Preamble to regulations). In fact, neither Congress nor the agency in its regulations expresses any \u201cpreference\u201d at all on the matter - \u201cstrong\u201d or otherwise.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Rather than the \u201cstrong preference\u201d claimed by the Domestic Producers, Commerce\u2019s date of sale regulation and the Preamble to the agency\u2019s antidumping regulations establish only a \u201crebuttable presumption\u201d - and, indeed, one that has been successfully rebutted in numerous cases in the past, as illustrated in the discussion below. <em>See, e.g., Colakoglu Metalurji A.S. v. United States, </em>29 CIT 1238, 1240, 394 F. Supp. 2d 1379, 1380 (2005) (indicating that a \u201cplain reading\u201d of date of sale regulation indicates that it establishes only a \u201crebuttable presumption\u201d); Remand Results at 3 (noting that date of sale regulation \u201cprovide [s] for a rebuttable presumption\u201d). Thus, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>the Preamble to Commerce\u2019s date of sale regulation explains, where the agency \u201cis presented with satisfactory evidence that the material terms of sale are... established on a date other than the date of invoice, the Department <em>will use </em>that alternative date as the date of sale.\u201d <em>See </em>Antidumping Duties; Countervailing Duties: Final Rule, 62 Fed. Reg. at 27,349 (Preamble) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">Equally unfounded is the Domestic Producers\u2019 assertion (also reflected in the Remand Results) that judicial precedent restricts Commerce\u2019s use of a date of sale other than invoice date to \u201cunusual\u201d situations. <em>See </em>Domestic Producers Reply Brief at 9 <em>(citing Thai Pineapple Canning Indus. Carp., Ltd. v. United States, </em>24 CIT 107, 109 (2000), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>273 F.3d 1077 (Fed. Cir. 2001)); Remand Results at 19.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> As even the Government acknowledges, the Preamble to the agency\u2019s date of sale regulation expressly states that where - as here - a case \u201cinvolves] large custom-made merchandise,\u201d and where - as here - \u201cthe parties engage in formal negotiation and contracting procedures,\u201d Commerce \u201cusually will use a date other than the date of invoice\u201d as the date of sale. <em>See </em>Def. Supp. Response Brief at 7 <em>(quoting </em>Antidumping Duties; Countervailing Duties: Final Rule, 62 Fed. Reg. at 27,349 (Preamble)). And, again, as noted above and discussed below, Commerce has used a date other than invoice date as the date of sale in numerous cases in the past.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>The Domestic Producers further contend that - pursuant to Commerce\u2019s assertedly \u201cconsistent practice\u201d and judicial precedent - a foreign producer seeking to rebut the regulatory presumption that the invoice date is the date of sale must satisfy two criteria: \u201c1) produc[e] sufficient evidence,\u2019 <em>i.e., </em>establish a complete record that includes all relevant sales documents for all reported sales; and 2) satisfy the Secretary that the material terms were established at a date other than invoice date.\u201d <em>See </em>Domestic Producers Reply Brief at 10 <em>(quoting Allied Tube and Conduit Corp. v. United States, </em>25 CIT 23, 25, 132 F. Supp. 2d 1087, 1090 (2001) <em>(Allied Tube II); citing Hevensa, </em>27 CIT at 1537, 285 F. Supp. 2d at 1366-67). But the Domestic Producers\u2019 formulation of what is required to rebut the regulatory presumption misstates the existing state of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">The Domestic Producers cite no authority for their assertion that Commerce is required to use invoice date as the date of sale in a case unless the record in that case \u201cincludes <em>all </em>relevant sales documents for <em>all </em>reported sales.\u201d <em>See </em>Domestic Producers Reply Brief at 10 (emphasis added). Nor does it appear that the Domestic Producers can cite any such authority; independent research discloses no precedent to that effect. ICDAS, of course, bears the burden of proof on the date of sale issue; and where, as here, the applicable standard is whether \u201cthe Secretary is satisfied,\u201d a determination as to the sufficiency of proof ordinarily \u201clies primarily within Commerce\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>See </em>19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.401(i); <em>Koyo Seiko Co., Ltd. v. United States, </em>551 F.3d 1286, 1292 (Fed. Cir. 2008). Nevertheless, like all other agencies, Commerce is generally prohibited from \u201ctreat[ing] similar situations in dissimilar ways.\u201d <em>See Burinskas v. Nat\u2019l Labor Relations Bd., </em>357 F.2d 822, 827 (D.C. Cir. 1966) <em>(cited in Nakornthai Strip Mill Public Co., Ltd. v. United States, </em>32 CIT_,_, 587 F. Supp. 2d 1303, 1307 (2008)). And a review of various cases in which Commerce has used a date of sale other than invoice date suggests that a number (if not all) of them involved administrative records that did not meet the Domestic Producers\u2019 asserted criterion. Indeed, in the Final Results in <em>this </em>case, Commerce was satisfied with the existing record as a basis for its determination to use contract date as the date of sale.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>Like their first criterion (discussed immediately above), the Domestic Producers\u2019 second criterion similarly overstates the evidence required to rebut the regulatory presumption concerning date of sale. According to the Domestic Producers, the second criterion - which requires a demonstration that \"\u2018the material terms were established at a date other than invoice date\u201d - is \u201ctwo-fold\u201d: \u201ca party must a) demonstrate that there were no actual changes to the material terms between the proposed date and the invoice date; and b) demonstrate that, in the absence of actual changes, the material terms were also not <em>subject to change.\" See </em>Domestic Producers Reply Brief at 10 <em>(citing Allied Tube II, </em>25 CIT at 25, 132 F. Supp. 2d at 1090).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">The Domestic Producers\u2019 second criterion basically amounts to a claim that the regulatory presumption of invoice date can be overcome only if a foreign producer establishes that there were <em>no changes whatsoever </em>to <em>any </em>material term of <em>any </em>contract at issue (and, moreover, that there was <em>no possibility </em>of any such change). That position, however, is patently incorrect. As Commerce itself candidly conceded in the Remand Results here, \u201ca single change in price does not automatically disqualify contract date from selection as the proper date of sale.\u201d <em>See </em>Remand Results at 20.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> And, in fact, Commerce hasused a date other than invoice date as the date of sale in numerous cases in the past, notwithstanding changes in price or other material contract terms. <em>See, e.g., </em>Pipe from Korea, 63 Fed. Reg. at 32,835-36; Issues and Decision Memorandum for the Antidumping Duty Investigation of Sulfanilic Acid from Portugal; Final Determination, 2002 WL 31493754 (Sept. 18, 2002) (\u201cSulfanilic Acid from Portugal\u201d), at comment 1; Issues and Decision Memorandum for the Final Results of the Administrative Review of the Antidumping Duty Order on Low Enriched Uranium from France (2003-2004), 2005 WL 2305751 (Sept. 14, 2005) (\u201cUranium from France\u201d), at comment 11; Issues and Decision Memorandum for the Final Results of the Fourth Administrative Review of Steel Concrete Reinforcing Bars from Latvia, 2006 WL 3702620 (Dec. 13, 2006) (\u201cRebar from Latvia\u201d), at comment 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">As ICDAS puts it, the \u201ckey element to consider\u201d in determining date of sale is which date best reflects the point at which the parties had a meeting of the minds on the material terms of sale - not whether there is evidence of even a single change in a single material term of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>a single contract. <em>See </em>ICDAS Response Brief at 13 <em>(quoting </em>Sulfanilic Acid from Portugal, 2002 WL 31493754, at comment 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">Although Commerce\u2019s date of sale regulation reflects a presumption that the date of invoice will be the date of sale, the same regulation specifically provides for Commerce\u2019s use of a different date where that other date \u201cbetter reflects the date on which the exporter or producer establishes the material terms of sale.\u201d <em>See </em>19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.401(i). Accordingly, although Commerce \u201cnormally\u201d presumes that invoice date is the date of sale, the invoice date in fact is merely the starting point of Commerce\u2019s analysis. It is by no means intended to \u201cforeclose[ ] the possibility that another date could be chosen as the date of sale.\u201d <em>Allied Tube I, </em>24 CIT at 1371, 127 F. Supp.2d at 219; see <em>also Colakoglu, </em>29 CIT at 1240, 394 F. Supp. 2d at 1380 (explaining that date of sale regulation merely establishes \u201crebuttable presumption\u201d favoring invoice date).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Commerce itself has labeled as \u201cuntenable\u201d the \u201cblanket use [of invoice date] as the date of sale in an antidumping analysis\u201d where \u201cthe invoice date does not reasonably approximate the date on which the material terms of the sale were [established].\u201d <em>See </em>Pipe from Korea, 63 Fed. Reg. at 32,835-36. And Commerce itself has recognized that its regulations do not tie the agency\u2019s hands, but instead afford Commerce the \u201cflexibility\u201d needed to determine, and to use in its analysis as the date of sale, that date which best reflects the date on which the parties reached a meeting of the minds on the material terms of sale. <em>See </em>Issues and Decision Memorandum for the 1997-1998 Administrative Review of Circular Welded Non-Alloy Steel Pipe from Mexico: Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, 2000 WL 777746 (June 15, 2000) (\u201cPipe from Mexico\u201d), at Hylsa comment 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Flexibility in Commerce\u2019s date of sale analyses is more than a mere regulatory preference; it rises to the level of a statutory mandate. <em>Allied Tube I, </em>24 CIT at 1367-69, 127 F. Supp. 2d at 216-17. As discussed above, in enacting the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, Congress made clear - both through the Statement of Administrative Action and through its incorporation into U.S. law of the date of sale provision in the Agreement on the Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade 1994 - that the date of sale is to be the date on which \u201cthe material terms of sale\u201d are established. <em>See Allied Tube I, </em>24 CIT at 1367-68, 127 F. Supp. 2d at 216-17 (explaining, <em>inter alia, </em>that both the WTO trade agreement and Congress\u2019 interpretation of the agreement in the Statement of Administrative Action unambiguously provide that \u201cthe date of sale is to be the date on which the material terms of sale are established\u201d). In other words, rather than endorsing a mechanistic methodology con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>clusively establishing invoice date as the date of sale whenever there is even a single change in a material term of a single contract, Congress instead \u201cexpressed its intent that, for antidumping purposes, the date of sale be flexible so as to accurately reflect the true date on which the material elements of sale were established.\u201d <em>See Allied Tube I, </em>24 CIT at 1370, 127 F. Supp. 2d at 219.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">Indeed, flexibility in Commerce\u2019s date of sale analysis is a natural corollary of Commerce\u2019s overarching obligation to determine dumping margins as accurately as possible. <em>See, e.g., NTN Bearing Corp. v. United States, </em>74 F.3d 1204, 1208 (Fed. Cir. 1995); <em>Koyo Seiko Co. v. United States, </em>36 F.3d 1565, 1573 (Fed. Cir. 1994); <em>Allied Tube I, </em>24 CIT at 1370-71, 127 F.

Reg. at 32,835 (explaining that, \u201c[i]n granting this flexibility, the [date of sale] regulations anticipate the possibility of inappropriate comparisons via the strict use of invoice date as the date of sale\u201d). Commerce therefore has a \u201cwell-established and long-standing practice\u201d of looking beyond the invoice date to the parties\u2019 actual course of conduct, as well as the parties\u2019 expectations concerning the transaction, to determine whether an earlier date \u2014 such as the contract date - represents the point at which the parties reached a meeting of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>minds on the material terms of sale. <em>See </em>Sulfanilic Acid from Portugal, 2002 WL 31493754, at comment l.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">Commerce\u2019s date of sale analysis in the Remand Results here cannot be squared with the relatively long line of cases in which Commerce has determined that proof that material contract terms could (or even did) change nevertheless does not automatically warrant use of invoice date as the date of sale.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> That line of cases illustrates that a change in a material contract term, while relevant, does not end Commerce\u2019s date of sale analysis.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Commerce is still required to undertake a factual analysis of the expectations and conduct of the contracting parties, to ascertain when they reached a true meeting of the minds on the material terms of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">In Pipe from Korea, for example, the foreign respondents argued that Commerce should use invoice date as the date of sale for their U.S. sales, because \u201cthe possibility for change [of the material terms of sale] exists and sometimes does occur.\u201d <em>See </em>Pipe from Korea, 63 Fed. Reg. at 32,835. Notwithstanding the fact that material terms of sale not only <em>could be, </em>but in fact <em>were, </em>changed, Commerce nonetheless did not use invoice date as the date of sale in that case. Id.,63 Fed. Reg. at 32,836. Instead, Commerce analyzed the facts surrounding the change in contract terms in the context of the parties\u2019 expectations, focusing particularly on critical differences in the respondent\u2019s sales processes for U.S. and home market sales:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>In this case, the sales processes for US and home market sales differ markedly. Sales in the home market are typically out of inventory with the purchase order/contract, invoice and shipment dates all occurring within a relatively short period of time. In contrast, US sales are usually conducted on a made-to-order basis (CEP sales out of inventory being an exception). The material terms of sale in the US are set on the contract date and any subsequent changes are usually immaterial in nature or, <em>if material, rarely occur.... </em>As can be seen from the foregoing, \u201cinvoice\u201d dates in both markets, while the same in name, are materially quite different.... Notwithstanding the respondents\u2019 comment that the terms of sale are subject to change and that, therefore, the final terms are not known until the date of invoice, we find that, in this case, there is no information on the record indicating that the material terms of sale change frequently enough on US sales <em>so as to give both buyers and sellers any expectation that the final terms will differ from those agreed to in the contract.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">Pipe from Korea, 63 Fed. Reg. at 32,836 (emphases added). Based on its analysis, Commerce determined in Pipe from Korea that the contract date was the proper date of sale, reasoning that - due to the sales process used for the \u201cmade-to-order\u201d merchandise, as well as the low frequency of changes in the case - the parties to the sales at issue could not have expected that the material terms of their deals were not fixed as of the date of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The record here indicates that - like the respondent in Pipe from Korea - ICDAS too has markedly different sales processes for its U.S. and home market sales.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Similarly, given the extraordinarily low frequency of change in the instant case - a single price increase, in a single contract, over the course of a full year - it is not at all clear that either ICDAS or its buyers could have had any reasonable expecta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>tion that the material terms of sale for the made-to-order rebar that ICDAS sold to the U.S. would vary in any respect from those specified in the parties\u2019 contracts<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> (just as Commerce found that the parties in Pipe from Korea could not have expected that they would not be bound by the terms of their contracts).<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-3\">Like the underlying facts of Pipe from Korea, the facts of Sulfanilic Acid from Portugal also closely parallel the facts of the case at bar in certain key respects. Commerce\u2019s decision in that case further illustrates the importance of \u201clookfing] to the course of conduct between the parties in evaluating whether a written document represents a binding agreement.\u201d <em>See </em>Sulfanilic Acid from Portugal, 2002 WL 31493754, at comment 1 <em>(citing </em>Polyvinyl Alcohol from Taiwan (final determination)).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">In Sulfanilic Acid from Portugal, the original contract was amended <em>twice </em>to increase the price. However, rather than mechanistically applying the invoice date as the date of sale, Commerce there re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>viewed the parties\u2019 course of conduct to ascertain the parties\u2019 expectations concerning the contract. Commerce found that, despite the material \u201cmodifications to the original sales contract,\u201d \u201cthe parties acted in a manner consistent with a \u2018meeting of the minds\u2019 to be bound by the terms of the original contract.\u201d <em>See </em>Sulfanilic Acid from Portugal, 2002 WL 31493754, at comment 1. To account for the modification, Commerce treated the price changes as amendments to the original contract, and treated the dates of the contract amendments as the dates of sale in its antidumping analysis. <em>Id. </em>Nowhere has Commerce explained why such an approach would be inappropriate in this case.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">In short, Commerce here has failed to justify its use of the same date of sale for both ICDAS\u2019 home market sales and its U.S. sales, given that the sales and production processes used for the two markets \u201cdiffer markedly.\u201d <em>See </em>Pipe from Korea, 63 Fed. Reg. at 32,835-36. Nor has Commerce adequately explained why a single price increase as to a single contract warrants the blanket application of invoice date as the date of sale for <em>all </em>of ICDAS\u2019 U.S. sales to all of its customers. Cases such as Pipe from Korea suggest that, notwithstanding the price increase, Commerce should have used contract date as the date of sale for <em>all </em>of ICDAS\u2019 U.S. sales, including those under the contract affected by the price change. Alternatively, Commerce conceivably might have followed its approach in Sulfanilic Acid from Portugal (and other similar cases), and treated ICDAS\u2019 price change as an amendment to the original contract.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Here, Commerce has failed even to consider, much less explain, how ICDAS\u2019 eleventh-hour efforts to negotiate a modest price increase as to a single contract - <em>after </em>ICDAS had substantially performed its contractual obligations - could have upset the expectations of ICDAS and its U.S. buyers that the material terms of ICDAS\u2019 U.S. sales were established with the execution of their legally-binding contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Although the Remand Results pay lip service to determining \u201cthe date on which the material terms of sale (i.e., price and quantity) [were] established\u201d (that is, to ascertaining \u201cthe date on which the parties had a real \u2018meeting of the minds\u2019\u201d), that was clearly not the object of the analysis that Commerce conducted on remand. <em>See </em>Remand Results at 18, 20. Instead, as the Remand Results themselves state, Commerce confined its analysis on remand to the much narrower question \u201cwhether ICDAS\u2019s material terms of sale changed after the contract date.\u201d <em>See </em>Remand Results at 21; <em>see also id. </em>(stating that \u201cthe issue at hand is... whether the material terms of sale changed\u201d). To be sure, evidence that \u201cmaterial terms of sale changed after the contract date\u201d is relevant to determining \u201cthe date on which the parties had a real \u2018meeting of the minds\u2019 \u201d (that is, to ascertaining \u201cthe date on which the material terms of sale (i.e., price and quantity) [were] established\u201d). But Commerce\u2019s date of sale analysis cannot begin and end with a simple, cut-and-dried, \u201cyes/no\u201d determination as to whether there was any change to any material term of any contract at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">In sum, a second remand is necessary here, to permit Commerce to revise its date of sale analysis for ICDAS\u2019 U.S. sales. Under both settled law and agency practice, that analysis does not, and should not, hinge on a single change in price or quantity, or the volume of sales affected by that change, with no regard for any other relevant facts. <em>See </em>Pipe from Mexico, 2000 WL 777746, at Hylsa comment 1 (noting, in principle, that the fact \u201cthat the material terms of sale can change up to the time of invoice is not dispositive\u201d). Even when there is evidence of change in a material term, Commerce still must consider whether - as evidenced by their understanding of the sales process, as well as their course of conduct - the parties had the expectation that the material terms of sale were fixed on the date of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">On remand, Commerce shall focus its date of sale analysis on \u201cthe date on which the parties had a real \u2018meeting of the minds,\u201d\u2019 to ascertain \u201cthe date on which the material terms of sale (i.e., price and quantity) [were] established.\u201d <em>See </em>Remand Results at 18, 20. In its analysis, Commerce shall consider, <em>inter alia, </em>the differences between the sales and production processes for ICDAS\u2019 U.S. sales compared to its home market sales, the parties\u2019 understanding of the sales process, the parties\u2019 course of conduct, and the practical effect (if any) of the single price increase on parties\u2019 expectations as to the legally binding nature of their contracts, as well as all other relevant facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>2. <em>Whether the Remand Results Are Supported by Substantial Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">For the reasons outlined immediately above, Commerce\u2019s Remand Results are not in accordance with law. But ICDAS contends that the Remand Results are further flawed because they are not supported by substantial evidence in the record. <em>See generally </em>ICDAS Response Brief at 2-3, 21-30; ICDAS Supp. Reply Brief at 1-2, 6-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">On remand, ICDAS filed detailed comments, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that the nature of ICDAS\u2019 U.S. sales process and the course of conduct between the parties compel the conclusion that the contract date is the date on which the parties reached a meeting of the minds on the material terms of sale. <em>See generally </em>ICDAS Remand Comments (Remand Pub. Doc. No. 4). However, in the Remand Results, Commerce essentially ignored the substance of ICDAS\u2019 comments, on the theory that the existence of a single increase in price obviated the need to consider the comments as well as the underlying record evidence that ICDAS cited. <em>See, e.g., </em>Remand Results at 21 (stating that \u201c[t]he relevant issue at hand is whether ICDAS\u2019s material terms of sale changed after the contract date\u201d); <em>id. </em>(asserting that \u201cthe issue at hand is... whether the material terms of sale changed\u201d). Apart from emphasizing that single price change, the Remand Results are largely limited to Commerce\u2019s (generally unsuccessful) efforts to distinguish the cases that ICDAS cites. <em>See </em>Remand Results at 22-24.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> The Remand Results reflect virtually no effort on the part of Commerce to grapple with the significant body of evidence cited by ICDAS in support of its position.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>As noted above, evidence of a price change is unquestionably relevant to determining the date on which contracting parties had a \u201cmeeting of the minds,\u201d establishing the material terms of sale. But, as a matter of law, discerning whether or not there was such a change does not conclude Commerce\u2019s date of sale inquiry. Moreover, any evaluation of the record evidence supporting Commerce\u2019s conclusion on date of sale must necessarily \u201ctake into account whatever in the record fairly detracts from [the] weight of that evidence,\u201d including \u201ccontradictory evidence or evidence from which conflicting inferences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>could be drawn.\u201d <em>Suramerica, </em>44 F.3d at 985 <em>(quoting Universal Camera, </em>340 U.S. at 487-88).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">Because Commerce failed to properly consider ICDAS\u2019 remand comments and the voluminous evidence on which those comments relied, Commerce\u2019s remand determination to use invoice date as the date of sale for both ICDAS\u2019 U.S. sales and its home market sales cannot be sustained on the strength of the existing record. As discussed in greater detail below, Commerce failed to give appropriate consideration to certain critical ways in which the two sales processes \u201cdiffer markedly.\u201d <em>See </em>Pipe from Korea, 63 Fed. Reg. at 32,836.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">a. <em>The Use of Formal Negotiation and Contracting Procedures</em></p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">As ICDAS correctly notes, the use of formal negotiation and contracting procedures is conduct that bears directly on the expectations of the parties to a sale. ICDAS underscores the critical differences between the process used to negotiate and finalize ICDAS\u2019 U.S. sales and its process for handling its home market sales. <em>See generally </em>ICDAS Response Brief at 5-9, 23-25; ICDAS Supp. Reply Brief at 7-9.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">The evidence indicates that ICDAS and its home market buyers did not expect the terms of a sale to become final until the invoice was issued, because home market sales were made through an informal negotiation process. Home market sales were negotiated by phone or fax over a very short period of time; the merchandise was generally shipped out of inventory within one day of order confirmation; and, because there were no formal written contracts between ICDAS and its domestic buyers, the invoice \u201crepresent[ed] the first document generated chronologically in the sales process that reflects the actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>price and quantity of a sale.\u201d <em>See </em>ICDAS Sales Verification Report (Conf. Doc. No. 44) at 4. Under such circumstances, Commerce\u2019s use of invoice date as the date of sale for ICDAS\u2019 home market sales was entirely proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">But the record evidence' shows that ICDAS\u2019 U.S. sales involved a markedly different process. <em>See </em>ICDAS Sales Verification Report (Conf. Doc. No. 44) at 4. That evidence casts a long shadow over Commerce\u2019s use of invoice date as the date of sale for ICDAS\u2019 U.S. sales, and suggests strongly that the proper date of sale for ICDAS\u2019 U.S. sales is contract date (or, in the case of the price increase, the date of invoice, or contract amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Specifically, the record evidence on ICDAS\u2019 U.S. sales process establishes that - following an initial, informal exchange of information - the buyer would submit a formal order, \u201calways in written form.\u201d <em>See </em>ICDAS Sales Verification Report (Conf. Doc. No. 44) at 4. Thereafter, ICDAS would make a formal written offer. <em>Id. </em>The parties would then come to a preliminary agreement on price, quantity, and shipping terms. Id.; <em>see also </em>Issues and Decision Memorandum for the Final Results of the Antidumping Duty Administrative Review: Certain Welded Carbon Steel Pipe and Tube from Turkey, 2005 WL 3417291 (Dec. 12, 2005), at comment 1 (finding date of e-mail order confirmations to be appropriate date of sale, because negotiations on material terms of sale occurred prior to written confirmation).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Significantly, the evidence demonstrates that ICDAS and its U.S. buyer always went beyond their preliminary agreement, to enter into a formal written contract, signed by both parties. <em>See </em>ICDAS Sales Verification Report (Conf. Doc. No. 44) at 4. That contract memorialized the parties\u2019 meeting of the minds on all essential terms of the contract, and more - including the quantity and dimensions of the rebar to be supplied, the price, the shipment date, the packing requirements, the method of payment, the mode of shipment, and the risk of damage or loss. In short, the record evidence cited by ICDAS indicates strongly that the material terms of its U.S. sales were indeed \u201cfirmly established and not merely proposed\u201d in the contracts between ICDAS and its buyers. <em>See </em>Antidumping Duties; Countervailing Duties: Final Rule, 62 Fed. Reg. at 27,349 (Preamble). Neither the Remand Results nor the briefs filed with the court by the Government and the Domestic Producers cites any evidence or authority even hinting that the language of the formal written contracts between ICDAS and its U.S. buyers was anything other than clear, unambiguous, and legally binding.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Because Commerce failed to properly consider the record evidence indicating that the formal written contracts between ICDAS and its U.S. customers documented the parties\u2019genuine meeting of the minds on all material terms of sale as of the date of contract, Commerce\u2019s determination on remand to use invoice date as the date of sale is not supported by substantial evidence. <em>See </em>Antidumping Duties; Countervailing Duties: Final Rule, 62 Fed. Reg. at 27,349 (Preamble) (explaining that \u201cin situations involving large custom-made merchandise in which the parties engage in <em>formal negotiation and contracting procedures, </em>the Department usually will use a date other than the date of invoice\u201d as the date of sale) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">b. <em>The Lead Time Required to Produce Made-to-Order Merchandise</em></p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Compounding its failure to properly consider the record evidence on the differences between the sales process used in ICDAS\u2019 home market sales and its process in U.S. sales (and, in particular, the evidence on ICDAS\u2019 consistent use of formal written contracts for its U.S. sales), Commerce similarly failed to properly consider the record evidence on the nature of the merchandise that ICDAS sold in the U.S. market and the process required to produce that merchandise, as well as the impact of those factors on the expectations of the contracting parties. <em>See generally </em>ICDAS Response Brief at 5-9, 25-27; ICDAS Supp. Reply Brief at 9-12. For example, as ICDAS correctly observes, when merchandise must be made-to-order, a seller is generally unwilling to incur costs and begin production unless and until the material terms of sale have been established. The situation is very different for sales made out of inventory.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The undisputed evidence indicates that the average quantity per invoice for ICDAS\u2019 U.S. sales was exponentially greater than that for the average home market sale. Moreover, the average lead time needed to complete those massive U.S. orders was orders of magni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>tude longer than for home market sales. <em>See </em>ICDAS Response Brief at 6-8, 25-26; ICDAS Supp. Reply Brief at 9.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> The record thus sup-portsICDAS\u2019 assertion that - in sharp contrast to ICDAS\u2019 home mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>ket sales - the parties in ICDAS\u2019U.S. sales transactions required that the material terms of sale be fixed on the date of contract, because they understood that they were contracting for massive shipments of made-to-order rebar that would require significant time and expense to produce. <em>See </em>Pipe from Korea, 63 Fed. Reg. at 32,836 (using invoice date as the date of sale for home market sales typically filled from inventory, while using contract date as the date of sale for U.S. sales \u201cusually conducted on a made-to-order basis\u201d); Rebar from Latvia, 2006 WL 3702620, at comment 2 (find that lead time of one week to one month was significant aspect of respondent\u2019s sales process).<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>Pointing to the record evidence, ICDAS explains that both ICDAS and its U.S. customers required the certainty early in the process that only a formal, written, legally-binding contract could provide, because they knew that the rebar had to be, <em>inter </em>alia, manufactured-to-order and rolled in inches (rather than millimeters); tested; marked differently than rebar sold in the home market; and packed for export. <em>See generally </em>ICDAS Response Brief at 27-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">The record evidence supports ICDAS\u2019 assertion that certainty was vital to ICDAS\u2019 U.S. buyers, who depended on ICDAS to supply the contracted-for rebar that they required to meet the needs of their own customers. To fill their orders on time, ICDAS\u2019 U.S. buyers expected ICDAS to begin production with sufficient lead time to produce, pack, and ship the contracted-for rebar in conformance with the specific terms of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Certainty was equally critical to ICDAS, because - as the record evidence indicates - ICDAS lacked the ability to stock in advance the thousands of metric tons of specific sizes of rebar sold to the U.S. market during the period of review. To fill U.S. sales, ICDAS therefore had to incur the cost of production for contracts with values in the millions of dollars. ICDAS relied on the enforceability of its contracts, because it was keenly aware that - if a U.S. buyer sought to renege after the contracted-for rebar had been produced - it would be commercially infeasible for ICDAS either to resell in the home market rebar that had been specifically produced to U.S. dimensions or to warehouse such massive quantities of merchandise for future U.S. sales. <em>See </em>Issues and Decision Memorandum for the Final Results of the Antidumping Duty Administrative Review of Certain Hot-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products from Thailand, 2004 WL 3524375 (April 13, 2004), at comment 1 (finding contract date the appropriate date for date of sale, where merchandise for U.S. customers was manufactured-to-order). As the record evidence establishes - for these sound business reasons - ICDAS\u2019 standard practice has been to begin production for a U.S. sale only <em>after </em>ICDAS has in hand a formal, written, signed contract. <em>See </em>ICDAS Sales Verification Report (Conf. Doc. No. 44) at 4.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>The record evidence cited by ICDAS and summarized above strongly supports ICDAS\u2019 assertion that - as to its U.S. transactions - the material terms of sale were firmly established as of the date of contract. Factors such as the made-to-order nature of the merchandise for U.S. sales (particularly combined with ICDAS\u2019 inability to stock significant quantities of that merchandise in inventory), and the lead time required to produce that merchandise, lend credence to ICDAS\u2019 case. <em>See </em>Antidumping Duties; Countervailing Duties: Final Rule, 62 Fed. Reg. at 27,349 (Preamble) (explaining that \u201cin situations involving <em>large custom-made merchandise </em>in which the parties engage in <em>formal negotiation and contracting procedures, </em>the Department usually will use a date other than the date of invoice\u201d as the date of sale) (emphases added); Rebar from Latvia, 2006 WL 3702620, at comment 2 (using contract date or contract amendment date as date of sale, at least in part due to lead time of one week to one month). The Remand Results say relatively little about ICDAS\u2019 evidence on this point; and what the Remand Results do say does little to diminish the force of ICDAS\u2019 argument, and even less to support Commerce\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">Because Commerce failed to properly consider the record evidence concerning how - as a practical matter - the lead time required to produce made-to-order rebar affected the contracting parties\u2019 expectations as to when the terms of sale became final, Commerce\u2019s determination on remand to use invoice date as the date of sale for ICDAS\u2019 U.S. sales is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">c. <em>The Contracting Parties\u2019 Course of Conduct and the Price Increase</em></p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Evidence of the course of conduct between ICDAS and its U.S. customers further buttresses ICDAS\u2019 assertion that the parties understood that they were bound by the terms of their contracts, which memorialized their agreement on material terms of sale. But, once <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>again, the Remand Results gave the evidence short shrift. <em>See generally </em>ICDAS Response Brief at 28-30; ICDAS Supp. Reply Brief at 11-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\">ICDAS points to the sales traces of ICDAS\u2019 U.S. sales that were selected by Commerce for verification as evidence that the terms of sale were firmly established on the date of contract. <em>See </em>ICDAS Response Brief at 28. As ICDAS notes, the sales traces demonstrate that ICDAS took all necessary steps to honor the terms of its contracts, incurring significant costs. Specifically, ICDAS produced the contracted-for rebar, tested the rebar, trucked the tens of thousands of tons of the merchandise to the port, paid brokerage and handling fees, made arrangements for marine insurance and a ship to transport the merchandise to the United States, and took all actions necessary to comply with applicable Turkish customs and loading requirements. As ICDAS succinctly observes: \u201cThis is <em>not </em>the behavior of a producer that believes it is free to change or breach its contracts.\u201d <em>See </em>ICDAS Response Brief at 28 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">ICDAS emphasizes that its course of conduct during the sale in which there was a price increase was consistent with its conduct during its other sales, and demonstrates that both ICDAS and the U.S. customer understood that the terms of their original contract were firm and binding, notwithstanding ICDAS\u2019 subsequent successful efforts to negotiate a modest price increase. <em>See </em>ICDAS Response Brief at 28-29 <em>(citing </em>Issues and Decision Memorandum for the Final Determination in the Antidumping Duty Investigation of Certain Large Diameter Carbon and Alloy Seamless Standard, Line and Pressure Pipe from Mexico - April 1, 1998, through March 31, 1999, 2000 WL 959479 (June 26, 2000), at comment 2 (using date of sales acknowledgment as date of sale, even though producer admitted possibility of change)).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">As ICDAS notes, the facts of the sale in question largely parallel those of every other U.S. sale that ICDAS made during the period of review. <em>See </em>ICDAS Response Brief at 28-29. The record evidence establishes that ICDAS entered into a formal, written, legally-binding contract with its customer, establishing the material terms of the sale. Pursuant to the contract, ICDAS was required to produce the rebar to the agreed-upon specifications; inspect and test the physical and chemical composition of the rebar; color code each lot; pack the rebar for quick discharge at the specified U.S. port, in accordance with U.S. customs and other regulatory requirements; transport the rebar to the Turkish port; and load the rebar aboard a vessel for transport, in accordance with Turkish customs requirements. <em>See </em>ICDAS Sales Verification Report (Conf. Doc. No. 44), Exh. 14 at contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>The record further indicates that - after incurring the full (and tremendous) cost of production - ICDAS began to transport the thousands of metric tons of rebar specified in the contract, from the rolling mill to the Turkish port. The inland freight process lasted a week, and involved dozens of trips. Finally, inland transport was completed, and marine bills of lading were issued, indicating that the ocean carrier had taken control of the merchandise for loading and transport. Only then - <em>after </em>ICDAS had released the merchandise to the carrier - was an invoice issued reflecting an increase in price. <em>See </em>ICDAS Sales Verification Report (Conf. Doc. No. 44), Exh. 14 at domestic inland freight documentation.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">The fairly compelling evidence documenting ICDAS\u2019 course of conduct (described above) leaves little room to suggest that ICDAS \u201cperceived any flexibility in the terms of the contract.\u201d <em>See </em>Issues and Decision Memorandum for the Final Determination of the Antidump-ing Duty Investigation of Polyethylene Retail Carrier Bags from Thailand, 2004 WL 3524397 (June 18, 2004) (\u201cPolyethylene Retail Carrier Bags from Thailand\u201d), at comment 2. Indeed, ICDAS argues persuasively that - quite to the contrary - having produced the rebar to order, hauled it to the Turkish port, and tendered it for loading and transport, it is abundantly clear that ICDAS believed that the contract terms were firm and binding, without regard to its attempt to negotiate a modest increase in price after it had rendered substantial performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">ICDAS thus maintains that the record evidence reflects that, at all times, it \u201cacted in a manner consistent with a \u2018meeting of the minds\u2019 to be bound by the terms of the original contract\u201d <em>(see </em>Sulfanilic Acid from Portugal, 2002 WL 31493754, at comment 1), because it sought a price increase only <em>after </em>it had honored its contractual obligations. Moreover, as ICDAS is quick to note, there appears to be a paucity of evidence to support the notion that ICDAS would - or could - have breached the contract in the event that its U.S. customer had rebuffed its attempts to negotiate a slightly higher price.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>Section III.D.l above concludes that Commerce\u2019s remand determination on date of sale is not in accordance with law, and that the issue therefore must therefore be remanded yet again to the agency, for further consideration.

As a result, ICDAS notes, the <em>POR average cost </em>that Commerce used in its calculations - which is largely driven by \u201cskyrocketing scrap prices in the fourth quarter of the POR\u201d - is both significantly <em>higher </em>than ICDAS\u2019 <em>quarterly average costs </em>during the first and second quarters of the POR, and also <em>lower </em>than ICDAS\u2019 <em>quarterly average costs </em>in the second half of the POR. ICDAS Brief at 4, 8-9,11-12; ICDAS Reply Brief at 2-4. Because Commerce used the POR average cost in its home market \u201csales below cost\u201d analysis in the Final Results, the agency excluded many of ICDAS\u2019 first and second quarter home market sales from its analysis as <em>below </em>cost - even though those sales actually were <em>above </em>ICDAS\u2019 quarterly average costs. ICDAS Brief at 4, 8-9, 11-12; ICDAS Reply Brief at 3. ICDAS asserts that Commerce thus artificially \u201cinflated\u201d the benchmark \u201cnormal value\u201d to which ICDAS\u2019 U.S. sales prices were compared, producing \u201csignificant distortions\u201d in the agency\u2019s analysis. ICDAS Brief at 4-5, 11-12; ICDAS Reply Brief at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">ICDAS further explains that, because Commerce used the date of entry to determine the universe of sales in this administrative review (see section III.F, <em>infra), </em>all of ICDAS\u2019 U.S. sales used in Commerce\u2019s antidumping analysis fall within the first and second quarters of the POR - which is when the POR average cost is significantly higher than ICDAS\u2019 quarterly average costs. ICDAS Brief at 4, 9, 11-12; ICDAS Reply Brief at 4. As noted above, the high POR average cost is attributable to \u201cskyrocketing scrap prices in the fourth quarter of the POR\u201d - when, as ICDAS notes, \u201cthere were no U.S. sales used in Commerce\u2019s dumping analysis.\u201d ICDAS Brief at 1, 4, 8-9, 11-12; ICDAS Reply Brief at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">In the Final Results, Commerce stated that it found no reason to \u201cdeviate from its normal practice of using POR annual average costs,\u201d which - the agency asserts - \u201cevents] out swings in the production cost experienced by the respondent over short periods of time.\u201d Decision Memo at 10; <em>see also </em>Domestic Producers Response Brief at 4-5.

ICDAS concludes that Commerce\u2019s use of the POR average cost in this case not only \u201cdoes not \u2018reasonably reflect the cost of production for sales\u2019 made throughout the POR,\u201d it actually \u201cskews the cost.\u201d ICDAS Brief at 13. In particular, ICDAS charges that Commerce\u2019s use of the POR average cost (rather than ICDAS\u2019 quarterly average costs) is both \u201cinconsistent with case precedent and Commerce\u2019s past decisions,\u201d and \u201cnot supported by substantial evidence.\u201d ICDAS Brief at 9-10, 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">According to ICDAS, \u201c[t]he touchstone for application of multiple averaging periods is whether the use of full POR cost results in \u2018fair comparisons.\u2019\u201d ICDAS Brief at 10 <em>(citing </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a); Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994, Art. 2.4 (requiring that \u201c[a] fair comparison shall be made between the export price and the normal value\u201d)).

Contrary to Commerce\u2019s assertions, however, the test that the agency actually applied in the Final Results in fact is <em>not </em>the test applied in Brass Sheet and Strip from the Netherlands Final.

Reg. at 748. In contrast, Commerce here stated that it was analyzing \u201c[1] the significance of the change in the COM [i.e., the total cost of manufacturing], [2] whether the change in [the cost of scrap] occurred consistently and significantly throughout the POR, and [3] whether the direct material inputs causing the cost fluctuation can be directly tied to the related sales transactions.\u201d <em>See </em>Decision Memo at 11. Based on its analysis of those three criteria, Commerce declined to use quarterly average costs, and instead adhered to its \u201cnormal practice using POR weighted-average costs for the foreign like product in the overall weighted-average dumping margin\u201d for ICDAS. <em>See </em>Decision Memo at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Commerce\u2019s second criterion in this case is the same as the third criterion in Brass Sheet and Strip from the Netherlands Final.

In contrast, Commerce here took a \u201cquite different\u201d approach. <em>See </em>ICDAS Brief at 20. In this review, Commerce calculated the difference between the weighted-average quarterly costs (for each of the first and second quarters of the POR) and the annual average cost, and then divided by the annual average cost. <em>See </em>ICDAS Brief at 20. ICDAS charges that Commerce\u2019s \u201cstatistical manipulation\u201d has the effect of \u201cdepress-ting] the magnitude of the resulting percentage.\u201d <em>See </em>ICDAS Brief at 20. According to ICDAS, \u201cCommerce\u2019s sleight of hand enabled it to calculate a difference in this case that \u2018ranged from approximately five to 10 percent\u2019 - which Commerce then inappropriately claims are percentages found not to be significant in Certain Pasta from Italy (which used Commerce\u2019s prior approach).\u201d <em>See </em>ICDAS Brief at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The Domestic Producers seek to defend Commerce\u2019s determination on this second criterion, asserting that the increases in the price of scrap that ICDAS experienced were neither consistent nor significant over the course of the POR. <em>See </em>Domestic Producers Response Brief at 6-7, 9-12, 15. According to the Domestic Producers, \u201cscrap prices both fell and rose at different times over the period of review.\u201d <em>See </em>Domestic Producers Response Brief at 7. As ICDAS notes, however, the Domestic Producers\u2019 argument focuses largely on changes in <em>monthly </em>scrap costs; and \u201cICDAS has not requested the use of monthly costs.\u201d ICDAS Reply Brief at 3 (emphasis added); <em>compare </em>Domestic Producers Response Brief at 10 (analyzing scrap costs \u201con a monthly, rather than quarterly basis\u201d), 11 (emphasizing results of examination of \u201cmonthly data\u201d). And, while the Domestic Producers endorse Commerce\u2019s cost comparison calculations in an effort to demonstrate that increases in the cost of scrap were not significant, the Domestic Producers do not dispute ICDAS\u2019 claim that Commerce\u2019s comparison in this case differed from the agency\u2019s approach in prior cases. Nor do the Domestic Producers make any attempt to rebut ICDAS\u2019claim that Commerce, in effect, manipulated the analysis. <em>See </em>ICDAS Reply Brief at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">The third, and final, criterion that Commerce analyzed was \u201cwhether the direct material inputs causing the cost fluctuation can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>be directly tied to the related sales transactions.\u201d <em>See </em>Decision Memo at 11. In its Decision Memo, Commerce emphasized that, in Brass Sheet and Strip from the Netherlands Final, the price of the raw material inputs was a direct pass-through item. <em>See </em>Decision Memo at 12. In other words, as a service to its customers, the respondent in that case purchased the input metals on the customers\u2019 behalf and then billed the customers for the cost of the metals, the terms of which were set forth on the finished brass sales invoice. <em>See </em>Decision Memo at 12. According to the Decision Memo, the price of the raw material inputs there thus \u201ccould be directly tied to each related sales transaction.\u201d <em>See </em>Decision Memo at 12. In contrast, in this case, Commerce determined that ICDAS\u2019 sales transactions could not be \u201cdirectly tied to a particular shorter period\u2019s cost.\u201d <em>See </em>Decision Memo at 12. Commerce stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-4\">Without a direct link between the input raw material costs and the directly related sales transactions, as was the case in Brass Sheet and Strip from the Netherlands Final, there is no certainty that in adopting [ICDAS\u2019] quarterly cost approach, sales occurring in a given quarter are directly the result of the recorded raw material costs for the same quarter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Decision Memo at 12. Commerce therefore concluded that \u201cdeviating from [the agency\u2019s] normal practice in an attempt to make a more accurate comparison of sales prices and costs [might] well result in a comparison that is less accurate due to the many factors that influence a fair comparison of production and sales.\u201d <em>See </em>Decision Memo at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">ICDAS acknowledges that \u201c[t]he fact that there is a pass-through item may serve as one of the reasons supporting the use of shorter cost periods to achieve \u2018fair comparisons.\u2019 \u201d ICDAS Brief at 16. But, as noted above, ICDAS vigorously disputes that a \u201cpass-through item\u201d is \u201ca separate prerequisite to the use of shorter cost periods.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As ICDAS observes, Commerce has used multiple, shorter cost-averaging periods in other cases where there was no evidence that the identified primary input was a pass-through item. <em>See </em>ICDAS Brief at 16; Issues and Decision Memorandum for Certain Pasta from Italy, 2000 WL 1880666, at comment 18 (analyzing request for use of monthly average costs, without making finding as to whether semolina - the single primary input for pasta - was a pass-through item, or even mentioning any pass-through requirement); SRAMs from Taiwan, 63 Fed.

ICDAS acknowledges that \u201cit is not possible in every case to have an item-by-item match between sales and costs,\u201d but maintains that this fact \u201cshould not automatically lead to the conclusion that only POR costs can be used.\u201d <em>See </em>ICDAS Brief at 21. ICDAS argues that \u201c[i]t would be impossible to match each pound of pasta produced with each pound of semolina input in Certain Pasta from Italy or to match each piece of rebar with each piece of scrap in this case.\u201d <em>See </em>ICDAS Brief at 21. According to ICDAS, its evidence demonstrating that the changes in home market sales prices closely track changes in the cost of scrap is \u201ca more than sufficient showing...to satisfy Commerce\u2019s [assertedly new] test.\u201d <em>See </em>ICDAS Brief at 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The Domestic Producers argue that \u201cICDAS\u2019 submitted evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate that its scrap purchases were incorporated into merchandise sold within the same quarter.\u201d Domestic Producers Response Brief at 7; <em>see also id. </em>at 6-7,13-15. Specifically, the Domestic Producers contend that ICDAS\u2019 inventory management practices suggest that ICDAS did not incorporate purchased scrap into rebar which was sold in the same quarter. <em>See </em>Domestic Producers Response Brief at 14-15. But ICDAS brushes off such talk as mere \u201cspeculation,\u201d and maintains that the Domestic Producers say nothing that \u201cundercut [s] the record evidence that ICDAS\u2019 quarterly average home market sales prices closely tracked scrap costs.\u201d <em>See </em>ICDAS Reply Brief at 4. Indeed, according to ICDAS, the Domestic Producers\u2019 argument \u201chighlights the big problem here: Commerce has used high scrap costs incurred <em>at a later date </em>in its cost comparison <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>with rebar sales that occurred <em>months earlier </em>- when ICDAS could not possibly have anticipated that it would have such high scrap costs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphases added).<footnotemark>73</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">Finally, the Domestic Producers argue that the use of multiple cost-averaging periods \u201cis especially inappropriate to the steel industry.\u201d Domestic Producers Response Brief at 15; <em>see also id. </em>at 7, 13-17. The Domestic Producers assert that \u201cthe fluctuations of which ICDAS complains are normal in the steel market.\u201d <em>See </em>Domestic Producers Response Brief at 7. The Domestic Producers pointedly note that other respondents in the review at issue \u201cexperienced the same fluctuations in scrap costs, but nevertheless felt no need to ask [Commerce] for use of multiple cost-averaging periods.\u201d <em>See </em>Domestic Producers Response Brief at 7.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> The Domestic Producers state that they know of no case where Commerce has deviated from the practice of single POR-wide cost-averaging due to changes in scrap costs, and they caution that deviating from that practice for ICDAS here would require Commerce to calculate the cost of production on a quarterly basis for all other respondents in this review as well, and - indeed - would have potentially wide-ranging implications for all current and future steel cases \u201cwhere the fluctuation of scrap costs exceeds some indeterminate... threshold.\u201d <em>See </em>Domestic Producers Response Brief at 7, 15-16; <em>see generally </em>Decision Memo at 8-10 (summarizing Domestic Producers\u2019 arguments as to consequences for other steel cases, as well as other respondents in this case).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">ICDAS summarily rejects the Domestic Producers\u2019 \u201cChicken Little\u201d predictions. ICDAS maintains that \u201c[w]here, as here, Commerce\u2019s test for using multiple cost periods has been met, then Commerce must use multiple cost periods.\u201d ICDAS Reply Brief at 4. ICDAS emphasizes that a quarterly cost approach is needed to properly analyze ICDAS\u2019 sales, \u201cnot only because of the mismatch between sales and costs, but also because <em>all </em>of ICDAS\u2019 U.S. sales used in Commerce\u2019s dumping analysis fall within the first and second quar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>ters of the POR when the POR average cost was significantly higher than the respective quarterly average costs.\u201d ICDAS Reply Brief at 4. ICDAS makes the fair point that \u201c[tjhe fact that some other respondents...did not provide (and Commerce did not request) quarterly cost data and did not request use of quarterly costs, is not the fault of ICDAS,\u201d and should not properly affect the outcome on this issue. ICDAS Reply Brief at 4-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">As to the Domestic Producers\u2019 claims about the broader implications of ICDAS\u2019 request, ICDAS states that it is \u201ctelling\u201d that the Domestic Producers cited no authority for their assertion that using quarterly costs for ICDAS \u201cwould... effectively establish! ] a new methodology for the steel industry.\u201d <em>See </em>ICDAS Reply Brief at 5 <em>0quoting </em>Domestic Producers Response Brief at 16). ICDAS further asserts that the Domestic Producers have failed to \u201cprovide [ ] a single example of a steel case that shares similar characteristics with this rebar case - i.e., a single primary input (such as scrap) that experiences a significant and consistent change in price - that would warrant the use of multiple cost averaging periods.\u201d <em>See </em>ICDAS Reply Brief at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Even more fundamentally, ICDAS correctly observes that Commerce did not rely on the Domestic Producers\u2019 argument as a basis for the agency\u2019s decision not to use quarterly average costs in this case. <em>See </em>ICDAS Reply Brief at 5. Accordingly, just as Commerce\u2019s determination cannot be sustained based on the Domestic Producers\u2019 claim that scrap does not qualify as a \u201csingle primary input,\u201d so too Commerce\u2019s determination cannot be sustained on the basis of the Domestic Producers\u2019 claims that wide-ranging implications would as-sertedly flow from the use of ICDAS\u2019 quarterly costs here. <em>See Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 156, 168 \u2014 69 (1962) (ruling that an agency\u2019s decision may only \u201cbe upheld, if at all, on the same basis articulated...by the agency itself\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">In its brief, the Government completely side-steps the merits of the issue. Instead, the Government seeks a voluntary remand, invoking <em>SKF, </em>which recognizes the right of an agency to \u201crequest a remand, without confessing error, to reconsider its previous position.\u201d Def. Response Brief at 12 <em>(quoting SKF USA, Inc. v. United States, </em>254 F.3d 1022, 1027-28 (Fed. Cir. 2001)); <em>see also id. </em>at 1-2, 8,11- 12. The Government concedes that \u201cCommerce\u2019s Final Results do not adequately address ICDAS\u2019s arguments,\u201d and that a \u201cmore in-depth analysis is required due to the technical nature of ICDAS\u2019s arguments and the cost methodology which Commerce employed in this determination.\u201d Def. Response Brief at 11. The Government requests a remand to \u201callow Commerce to provide a thorough explanation concerning the complexities of the issue and its effect upon ICDAS\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>cost of production.\u201d Def. Response Brief at 11-12. Moreover, notwithstanding their brief (arguing at length that ICDAS\u2019 request for use of quarterly costs should be rejected on the merits, and that the agency\u2019s use of POR average costs should be sustained), the Domestic Producers advised in the course of oral argument that they do not oppose the agency\u2019s request for a voluntary remand on this issue. <em>See </em>Domestic Producers Response Brief at 2-17, 40; Transcript of Oral Argument (\u201cTr.\u201d) at 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">ICDAS takes a radically different stance. While ICDAS agrees that Commerce\u2019s use of ICDAS\u2019 quarterly average costs <em>versus </em>the POR average cost must be remanded to the agency, ICDAS argues that the Court should first \u201creach [ ] a decision on the merits and enter [ ] an order with instructions that, on remand, Commerce must use quarterly costs in its antidumping analysis for ICDAS.\u201d ICDAS Reply Brief at 5; <em>see also id. </em>at 1-2; ICDAS Brief at 5.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Under <em>SKF, </em>an agency is generally entitled to a voluntary remand to reconsider its position, \u201cif the agency\u2019s concern is substantial and legitimate.\u201d <em>See SKF, </em>254 F.3d at 1028-29. But ICDAS questions the legitimacy of Commerce\u2019s concern here. ICDAS argues, in essence, that the parties have been down this road before, that Commerce is simply seeking a \u201cdo over,\u201d and that the agency is not entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>repeated bites at the same apple.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> ICDAS raises the spectre of an agency with a result in search of a rationale.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">ICDAS is, quite understandably, frustrated with the position in which it finds itself. But the Government must be presumed to have acted in good faith. Certainly ICDAS has pointed to no evidence to substantiate any suggestion of prejudgment on the part of Commerce. <em>See generally Habas Sinai ve Tibbi Gazlar Istihsal Endustrisi A.S. v. United States, </em>31 CIT_,_, 2007 WL 3378201 at * 4-5 (2007) (and cases cited there). Moreover, although ICDAS is - perhaps with good reason - skeptical of the outcome of the voluntary remand that Commerce seeks, the Government has given the Court its express assurances that the agency plans to use the remand proceeding to take a fresh look at the issue. <em>See </em>Tr. at 48-49 (denying that resultsof remand are \u201cpredetermined,\u201d emphasizing that Commerce \u201ccould change its mind\u201d on remand, advising that Commerce has assured counsel for the Government \u201cthat this is not a result oriented remand request,\u201d and stating that the agency has not \u201calready made up its mind\u201d). And this is not a case in which it can be said that a remand to the agency would be futile. <em>See generally Nippon Steel Corp. v. United States, 458 </em>F.3d 1345 (Fed. <em>Cir. 2006).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">A court must tread lightly in administrative cases, taking care not to infringe on an agency\u2019s mandate and discretion by re-weighing facts and substituting its judgment for that of the agency. As the Government notes, that is particularly true where, as here, \u201cthe issue is based on a \u2018factual determination\u2019 which requires agency expertise.\u201d <em>See </em>Def. Response Brief at 12. The Court of Appeals has underscored that Commerce is the \u201cmaster\u201d of the antidumping law, and that \u201c[f] actual determinations supporting anti-dumping margins are best left to the agency\u2019s expertise.\u201d <em>See F.lli De Ceceo di Filippo Fara S. Martino, S.p.A., </em>216 F.3d 1027,1032 (Fed. Cir. 2000); <em>Micron Tech., Inc. v. United States, </em>117 F.3d 1386, 1394 (Fed. Cir. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">The Government\u2019s request for a voluntary remand is therefore granted. On remand, the Commerce Department shall consider anew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>the use of ICDAS\u2019 quarterly average costs <em>versus </em>the POR average cost in calculating ICDAS\u2019 cost of production.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> In addition, Commerce shall clarify the test that it is applying for the use of multiple cost-averaging periods, fully articulate the rationale for its redeter-mination on the issue, and recalculate ICDAS\u2019 dumping margin, if appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">F. <em>Commerce\u2019s Use of Date of Entry to Define the Universe of Sales</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">ICDAS\u2019 final challenge to the Final Results contests Commerce\u2019s decision to use the date of entry - rather than the date of sale - to define the \u201cuniverse of sales\u201d subject to the administrative review at issue here. <em>See generally </em>Decision Memo at 20-25 (analyzing \u201cUniverse of Sales\u201d issue); ICDAS Brief at 6, 37-40; ICDAS Reply Brief at 13-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">In all six prior reviews up to the administrative review here, Commerce consistently had defined the universe of sales by using the date of sale. <em>See </em>Decision Memo at 22; ICDAS Brief at 2, 6, 37, 39- 40; ICDAS Reply Brief at 13, 15; Def. Response Brief at 28; Domestic Producers Response Brief at 34. Indeed, even in this administrative review, Commerce used the date of sale to define the universe of sales in its Preliminary Results. <em>See </em>ICDAS Brief at 6; ICDAS Reply Brief at 13. As ICDAS puts it, only in the Final Results did Commerce \u201cabruptly decide[ ] to reverse its decision in the Preliminary Results, and to apply a new universe of sales methodology based on date of entry.\u201d ICDAS Brief at 37.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> ICDAS pointedly notes that \u201cCommerce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>decided to make this change even though Commerce recognized that it... could make the difference between revocation of the [antidump-ing] order as to ICDAS and an above-tie <em>minimis </em>margin.\u201d ICDAS Brief at 37 <em>(citing </em>Decision Memo at 20); see <em>also id. </em>at 40; ICDAS Reply Brief at 14-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">ICDAS candidly acknowledges that \u201cCommerce has discretion to reconsider the methodologies it uses in its antidumping analysis.\u201d ICDAS Brief at 37. But, as ICDAS emphasizes, that discretion \u201cis not unbounded.\u201d <em>See </em>ICDAS Brief at 37 (citation omitted). In particular, ICDAS asserts that an agency\u2019s discretion is limited \u201cwhere a respondent has detrimentally relied on an old methodology used in previous reviews.\u201d ICDAS Brief at 37 <em>(quoting Anshan Iron &amp; Steel Co. v. United States, </em>27 CIT 1234, 1241-42 (2003)). In addition, as ICDAS notes, an agency must \u201cexplain the basis for its change.\u201d ICDAS Brief at 37-38 <em>(quoting Anshan Iron, </em>27 CIT at 1242); <em>see also id. </em>at 38 n.24 (same). Invoking <em>Shikoku, </em>ICDAS asserts that Commerce violated both of these limitations on its discretion in this case. <em>See </em>ICDAS Brief at 38-40 <em>(citing Shikoku Chems. Corp. v.

ICDAS asserts that its expectation \u201caffected the manner in which [it] has dealt with this case.\u201d ICDAS Brief at 39. As an example, ICDAS states that, in requesting revocation of the antidumping order, it submitted a certification that it believed that its dumping margin for the review would be zero or <em>de minimis. </em>ICDAS Brief at 39. ICDAS explains that it submitted that certification \u201con the assumption that Commerce would continue to use the same methodologies that it had used for many years, including the universe of sales methodology.\u201d ICDAS Brief at 39-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Apart from its assertions of reliance, ICDAS further argues that Commerce here \u201cfailed to offer a reasoned explanation for its change <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>in methodology.\u201d ICDAS Brief at 39; see <em>also id. </em>at 2, 6, 39-40; ICDAS Reply Brief at 13-14. ICDAS contends that Commerce identified no legal authority requiring it to make the change. <em>See </em>ICDAS Brief at 39. Moreover, according to ICDAS, Commerce failed to identify any new facts which would warrant the change. <em>Id. </em>Although the Domestic Producers go to some lengths to seek to defend Commerce\u2019s treatment of the universe of sales issue in the Final Results, the Government itself readily concedes that the Final Results failed to adequately explain the reasons for Commerce\u2019s change in methodology. <em>Compare </em>Domestic Producers Response Brief at 4, 34-40 (asserting that Commerce \u201cclearly and completely explained its reason for changing its methodology\u201d) <em>with </em>Def.

ICDAS too opposes the Government\u2019s request for a voluntary remand - albeit for a very different reason. ICDAS maintains that the requested remand is not required under <em>SKF, </em>\u201cbecause the Government does not state that it wishes to \u2018reconsider\u2019 its position, only that it wishes to <em>further explain and justify it.\u201d See </em>ICDAS Reply Brief at 14 <em>(quoting SKF, </em>254 F.3d at 1029).

Quoting <em>Shikoku, </em>ICDAS maintains that \u2018\u201c[i]t is simply too late to mandate another three years of administrative reviews because of a last minute \u201cimprovement\u201d in Commerce\u2019s methodology,\u2019 \u201d and that - accordingly - the proper course is to \u201cremand this issue to Commerce with instructions to use date of sale to define the universe of sales.\u201d <em>See </em>ICDAS Reply Brief at 15 <em>(quoting Shikoku, </em>16 CIT at 387-88, 795 F.

Further, as with the issue of ICDAS\u2019 request for the use of its quarterly average costs (rather than the POR average cost), the Government has given the Court its express assurances that the agency plans to use the remand proceeding to take a fresh look at the issue. <em>See </em>Tr. at 48-49 (disavowing any notion that remand results have been \u201cpredetermined,\u201d and stating that Commerce has assured Government counsel that request for remand \u201cis not... result oriented\u201d).

On remand, the Commerce Department shall consider anew Commerce\u2019s use of the date of sale versus the date of entry to define ICDAS\u2019 universe of sales for the administrative review here at issue, weighing all appropriate factors (including past agency practice). In addition, Commerce shall fully articulate the rationale for its rede-termination on the issue, and recalculate ICDAS\u2019 dumping margin, if appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">IV. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">For all the reasons set forth above, the Domestic Producers\u2019 Motion for Judgment on the Agency Record challenging Commerce\u2019s decision to treat sales made through ICDAS\u2019 U.S. affiliate as EP sales must be denied. ICDAS\u2019 Motion for Judgment on the Agency Record similarly must be denied as to ICDAS\u2019 claims that Commerce improperly denied ICDAS\u2019 request for a startup adjustment, and that Commerce erred in its treatment of ICDAS\u2019 foreign exchange gains as well as in its decision to cap ICDAS\u2019 total financial expenses at zero. On the other hand, ICDAS\u2019 Motion for Judgment on the Agency Record is granted as to ICDAS\u2019 challenges to Commerce\u2019s use of invoice date (rather than contract date) as the date of sale for ICDAS\u2019 U.S. sales, Commerce\u2019s use of the POR average cost of manufacturing (rather than ICDAS\u2019 quarterly costs) in the agency\u2019s \u201csales below cost\u201d analysis, and Commerce\u2019s use of the date of entry (rather than the date of sale) to define ICDAS\u2019 universe of sales; and this matter is remanded to the Department of Commerce for further action not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">A separate order will enter accordingly.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b230-7\"> Export Price (\u201cEP\u201d) and Constructed Export Price (\u201cCEP\u201d) refer to Commerce\u2019s two methods for calculating prices for merchandise imported into the United States. Commerce compares those prices to normal values to determine whether merchandise has been dumped in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">Both EP and CEP are calculated using the price at which the subject merchandise is first sold to a U.S. buyer not affiliated with the foreign producer or exporter. Generally, a U.S. sale is treated as an EP sale when the first sale to an unaffiliated U.S. buyer occurs <em>before </em>the goods are imported into the United States. In turn, a U.S. sale generally is calculated as a CEP sale when the first sale to an unaffiliated U.S. buyer occurs after importation. <em>See generally AK Steel Corp. v. United States, </em>226 F.3d 1361, 1367 \u2014 74 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (analyzing 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(a)-(b) (2000), and distinction between EP and CEP sales).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">Thus, in general, \u201cEP treatment is limited to transactions that occur between a seller outside the United States and an [unaffiliated] buyer inside the United States, before the date of importation.\u201d <em>Corus Staal BV v. United States, </em>502 F.3d 1370, 1377 (Fed.

And, for reasons summarized in section III.A below, the classification of U.S. sales as CEP sales (rather than EP sales) is more likely to result in a determination that merchandise has been dumped in the United States. <em>See Corus Staal, </em>502 F.3d at 1376.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b232-8\"> All citations to federal statutes are to the 2000 edition of the United States Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b233-7\"> <em>See </em>19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.106 (2003) (providing that a <em>de minimis </em>dumping margin is one below 0.5%).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">All citations to federal regulations are to the 2003 edition of the Code of Federal Regulations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b233-9\"> <em>See </em>Certain Steel Concrete Reinforcing Bars from Turkey; Amended Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, 66 Fed.

Noting the relationship between the two considerations, for example, the Court of Appeals stated that \u201c[l]imiting affiliate sales to CEP flows logically from <em>the geographical restriction of the EP definition </em>[to sales or transactions that take place \u2018outside the United States\u2019].\u201d <em>AK Steel, </em>226 F.3d at 1370-71 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">As noted above, the Court then reiterated that \u201c[i <em>]he location of the sale\u201d </em>is a \u201ccritical\u201d factor in distinguishing between EP and CEP sales, and concluded that it would be\u201ccontrary to the plain meaning of the statute\u201d to classify the transactions in <em>AK Steel </em>as EP sales \u201c[w]hen... there are contracts showing that <em>the sales at issue took place in the United States </em>between two entities with United States addresses, one of which was an affiliate of the producer/exporter.\u201d <em>AK Steel, </em>226 F.3d at 1371 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b243-6\"> The Court of Appeals\u2019reservation of judgment on this point, alone, suffices to refute the Domestic Producers\u2019 claim that <em>AK Steel </em>established a bright line rule that any sale in which the contract is between a U.S. affiliate and an unaffiliated U.S. customer is - by definition - a CEP sale.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b244-5\"> The Domestic Producers contend that the facts and outcomes of <em>AK Steel </em>and <em>Corus Staal </em>buttress the Domestic Producers\u2019 interpretation of those cases. <em>See generally </em>Domestic Producers Brief at 8-10, 13-17, 24 (discussing AK <em>Steel </em>and Court of International Trade\u2019s opinion in <em>Corus Staal); </em>Domestic Producers Reply Brief at 1-6 (same). The Domestic Producers concede that the language of the opinions \u201cemphasize[s] the \u2018location of the sale.\u2019 \u201d <em>See </em>Domestic Producers Brief at 14. But, according to the Domestic Producers, \u201ca review of the courts\u2019 actions demonstrates that the courts intended this phrasing to reflect the place of the seller\u2019s domicile.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In particular, the Domestic Producers state that \u201cneither Court analyzed...the location of title transfer (which would appear to be required by the Federal Circuit\u2019s definition of \u2018sale\u2019 as the transfer of ownership).\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Domestic Producers\u2019 arguments again are wide of the mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">As the Government pointedly observes, the Court of Appeals in <em>AK Steel </em>could have chosen whatever verbiage it wished: \u201cIf the Federal Circuit had intended the phrasing to reflect the seller\u2019s domicile, it would have stated location of affiliate, or domicile of affiliate, not location of the sale.\u201d <em>See </em>Def. Response Brief at 33-34. Further, as the Government notes, <em>AK Steel </em>not only used the term \u201clocation of the sale,\u201d it specifically defined it - as the place of \u201cthe transfer of ownership or title.\u201d <em>See </em>Def. Response Brief at 34 <em>{quoting AK Steel, </em>226 F.3d at 1371). The fact of that express definition makes it crystal clear that the Court of Appeals meant what it said, and said what it meant, in referring to the \u201clocation of the sale\u201d; and, contrary to the Domestic Producers\u2019 claims, the Court of Appeals did not mean \u201cthe place of the seller\u2019s domicile.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Moreover, contrary to the Domestic Producers\u2019 claims, both <em>AK Steel </em>and <em>Corus Staal </em>specifically took note of the location of the transactions at issue in those cases. In <em>AK Steel, </em>the Court of Appeals noted that there were \u201ccontracts showing that <em>the sales at issue took place in the United States.\u201d AK Steel, </em>226 F.3d at 1371 (emphasis added); <em>see also id., </em>226 F.3d at 1368 (noting that issue on appeal is \u201cwhether a sale to a U.S. purchaser can be properly classified as a sale by the producer/exporter, and thus an EP sale, even if <em>the sales contract </em>is between the U.S. purchaser and a U.S. affiliate of the producer/exporter and <em>is executed in the United States\u201d) </em>(emphasis added); <em>id. </em>at 1370 (explaining that \u201c[a] transaction, such as those here, in which both parties are located in the United States and <em>the contract is executed in the United States </em>cannot be said to be \u2018outside the United States\u2019 \u201d). <em>See generally </em>Def.

Similarly, in <em>Corus Staal, </em>this court expressly took note of evidence indicating that \u201cthe terms of... sale were agreed upon prior to the shipment of the merchandise,\u201d and that \u201cthe sale was made by the producer \u2018outside of the United States,\u2019 \u201d supporting Commerce\u2019s determination \u201cthat there was a transfer of ownership in the Netherlands.\u201d <em>Corus Staal, </em>27 CIT at 393, 259 F.

Response Brief at 34.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b245-5\"> As such, it appears that, because - like a \u201csale\u201d - an <em>\u201cagreement to sell\u201d </em>between a producer/exporter and an unaffiliated purchaser in the United States (or an unaffiliated purchaser for export to the United States) which is reached before importation is within the scope of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(a), a transaction may be classified as EP even if ownership does not transfer and consideration is not paid until a later date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b245-6\"> The Domestic Producers seek to analogize the facts of this case to the facts of <em>AK Steel, </em>arguing that the same result should obtain. According to the Domestic Producers; the sales here at issue - like those at issue in <em>AK Steel - </em>were so-called \u201c\u2018back-to-back\u2019 sales.\u201d <em>See AK Steel, </em>226 F.3d at 1365 (noting \u201cback-to-back\u201d nature of subject sales). The Domestic Producers further assert that the Court of International Trade\u2019s opinion in <em>Corus Staal </em>established a \u201cbright-line\u201d rule classifying all \u201cback-to-back\u201d sales as CEP sales. <em>See generally </em>Domestic Producers Brief at 11-17; Domestic Producers Reply Brief at 3-7. The Domestic Producers\u2019 arguments are lacking in merit. <em>See generally </em>Def. Response Brief at 32-33; ICDAS Response Brief at 35-36.</p>\n<p id=\"AGM\">Contrary to the Domestic Producers\u2019 assertions, there are critical differences between the facts of <em>AK Steel </em>and those of this case. Thus, for example, the \u201cback-to-back\u201d sales in <em>AK Steel </em>involved a Korean producer which sold steel to an affiliated Korean exporter, which in turn sold it to a U.S. affiliate, who then made sales to unaffiliated U.S. purchasers. <em>See AK Steel, </em>226 F.3d at 1365. Those \u201cback-to-back\u201d sales - which involved a chain of actions taken both outside and inside the United States - are clearly distinguishable from the transac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>tions at issue here, which were completed entirely outside the United States. <em>See generally </em>Def. Response Brief at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Further, notwithstanding the Domestic Producers\u2019 claims to the contrary, the Court of International Trade\u2019s opinion in <em>Corus Staal </em>did not establish a bright line rule governing \u201cback-to-back\u201d sales, without regard to where they occur. The Domestic Producers read the court\u2019s language out of context, and omit reference to the court\u2019s discussion of <em>AK </em>Steel\u2019s emphasis on the significance of \u201cthe location of the sale.\u201d <em>See </em>Def. Response Brief at 32-33 (discussing <em>Corus Staal, </em>27 CIT at 392-93, 259 F. Supp. 2d at 1258-59). Moreover, as the Domestic Producers themselves concede, the transactions at issue in <em>Corus Staal </em>were not \u201cback-to-back\u201d sales. <em>See </em>Domestic Producers Brief at 16 n.10; Domestic Producers Reply Brief at 4. Accordingly, even if the Court of International Trade had articulated the bright line rule that the Domestic Producers assert, the court\u2019s language presumably would have been <em>dicta. </em>Even more to the point, there is certainly nothing in the Court of Appeals\u2019 opinions in either <em>AK Steel </em>or <em>Corus Staal </em>establishing any such <em>per se </em>rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b246-6\"> As ICDAS points out, Commerce\u2019s classification of the sales at issue here as EP sales is consistent with agency practice in other cases, recognizing that - under <em>AK Steel </em>- the critical difference between EP and CEP sales is \u201cwhether the sale or transaction takes place inside or outside the United States.\u201d <em>See generally </em>ICDAS Response Brief at 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">Thus, for example, in Canned Pineapple Fruit from Thailand, Commerce treated transactions as EP sales, where the foreign company\u2019s U.S. affiliate handled customs clearances, issued invoices, and received payment from U.S. customers, but was \u201cnot involved in the sales process, never [took] possession or inventory of subject merchandise, [had] no physical presence in the United States, and act[ed] as an importer of record only,\u201d because Commerce found that the sales in question took place outside the United States. <em>See </em>Issues and Decision Memorandum for the Final Results of the Antidumping Duty Administrative Review: Canned Pineapple Fruit from Thailand, 2001WL 1241130 (Oct. 9, 2001) (\u201cCanned Pineapple Fruit from Thailand\u201d), at comment 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">In the instant case, Commerce properly classified ICDAS\u2019 sales through its U.S. affiliate as EP sales - as the agency has done since the 2001-2002 review - because, like the sales in Canned Pineapple Fruit from Thailand, all sales here in question were made outside the United States. Similarly, ICDAS\u2019 U.S. affiliate, like the U.S. affiliate in Canned Pineapple Fruit from Thailand, is a mere \u201cpaper company\u201d with no employees and no physical premises in the United States, and no role in the sales process, and serves only as an importer of record. The Domestic Producers point to no evidence concerning ICDAS\u2019 \u201cpaper company\u201d U.S. affiliate which undercuts Commerce\u2019s determination that the sales here at issue all occurred outside the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">Further, Commerce\u2019s classification of transactions as EP sales was sustained in <em>Corus Staal, </em>even though the U.S. affiliate there accepted payment for transmissions to the foreign producer, and had an active role in certain administrative and sales functions. <em>See Corus Staal, </em>27 CIT at 393 \u2014 94, 259 F. Supp. 2d at 1259. Thus, the acceptance of payment by a U.S. affiliate (like ICDAS\u2019 U.S. affiliate here) does not suffice to preclude classification of transactions as EP sales, where - as here - the transactions in question occur outside the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>United States. <em>See generally </em>ICDAS Response Brief at 38 n.28; <em>see also </em>Issues and Decision Memorandum for the Final Results of the Ninth Administrative Review of Certain Corrosion-Resistant Carbon Steel Flat Products from Canada for Dofasco, Inc. and Sorevco, Inc.

As <em>AK Steel </em>explains, Commerce distinguishes between EP and CEP sales in order to \u201cprevent foreign producers from competing unfairly in the United States market by inflating the U.S. Price [sic ] with amounts spent by [a] U.S. affiliate on marketing and selling the products in the United States.\u201d <em>AK Steel, </em>226 F.3d at 1367.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">In this case, the terms of the sales, including price, were set outside the United States. As a \"paper compan/\u2019 with no employees, inventory, or premises, ICDAS\u2019 U.S. affiliate had no selling or marketing functions, and incurred no costs beyond those normally associated with serving as importer of record.

For this reason, the Administration intends that Commerce determine the duration of the startup period on a case-by-case basis.\u201d Antidumping Duties; Countervailing Duties: Proposed Rule, 61 Fed. Reg. 7308, 7340 (Feb. 27, 1996) (Preamble) <em>(quoting </em>Statement of Administrative Action).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b252-6\"> Thus, for example, Commerce began with actual monthly data on production starts at the Biga facility, for December 2003, as well as January, February, and March 2004, which ICDAS provided to the agency in its Questionnaire Responses. <em>See </em>Decision Memo at 80. According to ICDAS, the Biga facility operated for only 21 days in December 2003. Commerce therefore took the December 2003 production starts data supplied by ICDAS and divided that figure by 21, to derive an actual daily average. Commerce then multiplied that actual daily average by 31 days, to arrive at a full month figure for production starts in December 2003, for comparison to production starts data for the first three months of 2004. <em>See </em>Decision Memo at 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">Clearly, comparing partial month production data to full month production data in the startup cost adjustment analysis would distort that analysis. For example, comparing production start data for a 21-day period (December 2003) to production start data for a 31-day period (January 2004) - without adjusting for the 10-day difference - would not be an apples-to-apples comparison, and would yield skewed results. All other things being equal, production starts during the 21-day period obviously would be lower than production starts during the 31-day period. If Commerce were limited to comparing partial month data to full-month data, any respondent company with a new facility could greatly enhance its chances of being granted a startup cost adjustment simply by delaying the start of production till late in the first month of operation, since that would help ensure that the first (partial) month\u2019s production levels would be lower than those of subsequent full months of production.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">When Commerce evaluates whether a respondent is entitled to a startup adjustment, it is critical that Commerce have production data that are reasonably comparable. The full-month equivalency methodology employed by Commerce here is a reasonable means to help ensure fair comparisons.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b254-5\"> Although its point is not entirely clear, ICDAS also objects to Commerce\u2019s full-month equivalent methodology on the grounds that it \u201ccreates a mismatch between the cost of production data and production starts data.\u201d <em>See </em>ICDAS Brief at 28. According to ICDAS, Commerce\u2019s methodology \u201ccreated phantom production starts for the first ten days of December with <em>no </em>associated production costs at all.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As the Government explained, however, production costs play no role in determining whether a startup adjustment is granted. The focus of Commerce\u2019s startup adjustment analysis is solely on levels of production. <em>See </em>Def. Response Brief at 21. Accordingly, any asserted \u201cmismatch\u201d did not prejudice ICDAS\u2019 request.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Similarly, ICDAS points to \u201cthe extremely high costs that ICDAS incurred [in December 2003] relative to subsequent months,\u201d and asserts that the purpose of the startup adjustment statute is \u201cto take into account that a firm may experience unusually high costs when it is \u2018starting up\u2019.,.new production facilities.\u201d <em>See </em>ICDAS Brief at 26 <em>(quoting </em>Statement of Administrative Action, H.R. Doc. No. 103-316, at 835, <em>reprinted </em>in 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 4172); <em>see also </em>ICDAS Reply Brief at 10 (same). Whatever may be the <em>underlying purpose </em>of the statute, the fact nevertheless remains that the <em>language </em>of the statute on its face authorizes Commerce to grant a startup adjustment only where a producer establishes that \u201cproduction levels [were] limited by technical factors associated with the initial phase of commercial production.\u201d <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(f)(l)(C)(ii). This ICDAS failed to do.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b254-7\"> ICDAS further asserts that, even under Commerce\u2019s assertedly \u201cflawed\u201d full-month equivalent methodology, the December 2003 production levels for the Biga facility were \u201csignificantly limited.\u201d In support of its position, ICDAS compares full-month equivalent data on production starts for December 2003 to data on production starts for the first three months of 2004. With those data in mind, ICDAS emphasizes that \u201cCommerce has found in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>a variety of antidumping contexts that differences greater than 20% to 25% are \u2018significant.\u2019\u201d <em>See generally </em>ICDAS Brief at 29 &amp; n.18.</p>\n<p id=\"ALr\">However, as the Government observes, it is not enough for ICDAS to prove a difference (even a significant difference) between production starts in December 2003 and those in subsequent months. The issue is whether, in December 2003, Biga achieved \u201ca level of commercial production that is characteristic of the merchandise.\u201d <em>See </em>Antidumping Duties; Countervailing Duties: Final Rule, 62 Fed. Reg. 27,296, 27,364 (May 19,1997) (Preamble). Comparing production starts data for December 2003 to production starts data for subsequent months is essentially meaningless if; for example, production levels in those subsequent months were optimal. <em>See </em>Statement of Administrative Action, H.R.

As the Government bluntly puts it, \u201cICDAS does not provide any basis to conclude that just because the [December 2003] production levels were not optimal, they should still be considered startup levels.\u201d <em>See generally </em>Def.

In addition, to receive a startup adjustment, companies will be required to explain their production situation and identify those technical difficulties associated with startup that resulted in the underutilization of facilities. <em>This is consistent with the general rule in antidumping practice that a party seeking an adjustment has the burden of establishing entitlement to that adjustment as both a legal and factual matter.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Statement of Administrative Action, H.R.

However, all ICDAS points to is the Federal Register notice in the SRAMs proceeding. ICDAS provided no information from the underlying administrative record to indicate the nature or quantum of evidence submitted to Commerce by the producer there to substantiate the causal link between the listed factors and the limited production it experienced in its initial phase of operations - in other words, the evidence to substantiate its claim that technical factors unique to startup were to blame for limited production in its initial phase of operations. There is thus no basis to conclude that Commerce granted the startup adjustment in SRAMs from Taiwan on the strength of an evidentiary record as thin as the record here.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">Moreover, it would seem to be a near-universal truth that new facilities everywhere must \u201cdevelop the production parameters of...new operations; 2) install, adjust, calibrate and test...new equipment; and 3) train new employees to operate the new equipment\u201d <em>(quoting </em>ICDAS\u2019 Section D Questionnaire Response).

In fact, in just the five-month period following Commerce\u2019s issuance of its Decision Memo in this case, Commerce issued at least seven determinations in which the agency did not use invoice date as the date of sale. <em>Compare </em>Domestic Producers Reply Brief at 9 <em>with </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>ICDAS Response Brief at 13 n.9 <em>(citing </em>Commerce determinations using \u201ccontract date,\u201d \u201cfinal contract date,\u201d \u201cdate of final amendment to contract addendum,\u201d \u201cemail confirmation date,\u201d and \u201corder acknowledgment date\u201d as date of sale).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b278-8\"> Further, as ICDAS observes, neither the Remand Results nor the Government\u2019s brief cited insufficient documentation as grounds for using invoice date as the date of sale. <em>See </em>ICDAS Supp. Reply Brief at 7 n.4; <em>see also id. </em>(indicating that it is neither \u201clegally required\u201d nor \u201cpractically feasible\u201d for a foreign producer \u201cto submit complete sales traces for every transaction that may be included in Commerce\u2019s universe of sales\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">Indeed, in a companion case to this one, Commerce recently expressly rejected the exact same argument that the Domestic Producers raise here. <em>See Habas </em>Remand Results at 41-42, 46-47 (dismissing domestic producers\u2019 argument that a respondent advocating use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>contract date as the date of sale for its U.S. sales is required to supply <em>all </em>U.S. sales documentation).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b279-7\"> <em>See also USEC Inc. v.

Unlike the scenarios of concern, ICDAS here sought a <em>price increase; </em>it did not offer a <em>price decrease. </em>Nor was there any attempt to import a greater quantity of rebar than specified in the parties\u2019 contract. In other words, the change in this case is not the sort of change that concerned Congress as it considered the effect on the date of sale of a change to a material contract term. <em>See </em>Remand Results at 7-8, 21; Transcript of Oral Argument (\u201cTr.\u201d) at 87.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"42\">\n<p id=\"b281-7\"> <em>Commerce </em>(in the Remand Results) and the Government (in its brief) seek to dismiss Pipes and Tubes from Thailand as irrelevant to this case, emphasizing that Pipes and Tubes from Thailand involved changes to contractually-specified quantities (rather than price), and that the changes there were within contractual tolerances. <em>See </em>Remand Results at 22; Def.

Instead, ICDAS cited the[ ] determinations to illustrate the general propositions \u2018that evidence of change, while relevant, does not end the date of sale analysis\u2019 and that \u2018when confronted with evidence of isolated change, Commerce must conduct a factual analysis of the contracting parties\u2019 expectations and conduct to understand when they had a true meeting of the minds.\u2019 \u201d ICDAS Supp. Reply Brief at 6; <em>see also </em>ICDAS Response Brief at 19 n.14 (discussing Polyethylene Retail Carrier Bags from Thailand). The Government\u2019s arguments do nothing to diminish in any way ICDAS\u2019 point that Commerce\u2019s date of sale analyses in other cases involving changes to material contract terms did not begin and end with the fact of the change.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"46\">\n<p id=\"b283-6\"> As ICDAS points out, both this case and Pipe from Korea are very different from <em>Hevensa. See </em>ICDAS Response Brief at 19 n.15 <em>(discussing Hevensa, </em>27 CIT 1522, 285 F. Supp. 2d 1353). Unlike the respondent in <em>Hevensa, </em>both ICDAS and the Korean respondent have distinctly different home market and U.S. sales processes. Although the respondent in Hevensa reported contract date as the date of sale for both its U.S. and home market sales, the respondent failed to identify any aspect of either sales process to justify use of contract date as the date of sale. <em>See Hevensa, </em>27 CIT at 1535-37, 285 F. Supp. 2d at 1366-67. In contrast, ICDAS\u2019U.S. sales process differs markedly from its home market sales process. In contrast to typical home market sales, ICDAS\u2019 U.S. sales involve formally-negotiated contracts to establish the material terms of sale on the date of the contract, because rebar sold for the U.S. market is produced, marked, packaged, and shipped differently than rebar sold in the home market. Accordingly, for ICDAS - as for the respondent in Pipe from Korea - \u201c \u2018invoice\u2019 dates in both [the U.S. and the home] markets, while the same in name, are materially quite different\u201d for purposes of Commerce\u2019s date of sale analysis. <em>See </em>Pipe from Korea, 63 Fed. Reg. at 32,836.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"47\">\n<p id=\"b284-5\"> Thus, for example, it appears from the record that ICDAS\u2019 sales prices (like other critical sales terms) are proprietary information. Under the circumstances, it is not clear how as a practical matter - the expectations of other parties to other contracts could have been affected in any way by a price change of which they were unaware. Other aspects of Commerce\u2019s reasoning on this point are equally unclear.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"48\">\n<p id=\"b284-6\"> In the Remand Results, Commerce attempts to distinguish Pipe from Korea from the instant case on the grounds that \u201cthe percentage of ICDAS\u2019s U.S. entries that had changes in material terms of sale [was] significant.\u201d <em>See </em>Remand Results at 22. But - as a matter of pure logic - Commerce\u2019s statement, without more, is insufficient to justify treating the two cases differently. It is entirely unclear how (particularly given the facts of this case) the portion or <em>\u201cpercentage </em>of ICDAS\u2019s U.S. entries\u201d affected by the price change is relevant to parties\u2019 expectations concerning the binding nature of their contracts. <em>See also </em>ICDAS Response Brief at 19 (characterizing Commerce\u2019s attempt to distinguish Pipe from Korea from the case at bar as \"without merit,\u201d emphasizing that \u201cthe focus in Pipe from Korea is on the nature of the sales process and the frequency of change, not on the volume of entries that are affected by a single change\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Commerce, the Government, and the Domestic Producers take pains to underscore the percentage of ICDAS\u2019 U.S. sales affected by the price increase. <em>See </em>Remand Results at 4,17, 19-20; Def. Supp. Response Brief at 2, 4,11-12; Domestic Producers Reply Brief at 11-13. Indeed, Commerce attached tremendous (seemingly determinative) weight to that fact in the Remand Results:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-8\">We agree with ICDAS that a single change in price does not automatically disqualify contract date from selection as the proper date of sale. In this case, however, we find thatthe price change, while limited to a single contract, related to a significant percentage of ICDAS\u2019s U.S. entries during the [Period of Review], Under these circumstances, wedetermine that the contract date does not represent the date on which the parties had a real \u201cmeeting of the minds\u201d....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">Remand Results at 20. As discussed above, however, neither Commerce, nor the Government, nor the Domestic Producers has proffered a rational explanation of the significance of the portion or percentage of ICDAS\u2019 sales affected by the price increase vis-a-vis parties\u2019 expectations concerning the binding nature of their contracts (or any other factor central to Commerce\u2019s date of sale determination).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">Finally, to the extent (if any) that the percentage of ICDAS\u2019 U.S. sales affected by the price change may be relevant to determining date of sale, it is worth noting that the figure is highly dependent on the universe of sales used in Commerce\u2019s analysis - another issue which is hotly contested in this action. <em>See </em>ICDAS Response Brief at 12 n.8; section III.F, <em>infra </em>(discussing issue of universe of sales).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"49\">\n<p id=\"b285-6\"> Somewhat perversely, Commerce and the Government seek to use the fact of the contract amendments in Sulfanilic Acid from Portugal as a basis for distinguishing that case from this one. Quoting Commerce\u2019s Remand Results, the Government argues that \u201cICDAS did not amend the contract at issue, \u201cbut rather merely issued sales invoices reflecting different material terms of sale (i.e., price).\u2019 \u201d <em>See </em>Def. Supp. Response Brief at 9-10 <em>(quoting </em>Remand Results at 23). However, \u201c[m]ore than enumeration of factual differences between cases is required; [Commerce and the Government] must explain their relevance.\u201d <em>Burinskas, </em>357 F.2d at 827 n.5. Neither Commerce nor the Government has explained the significance of the fact that the price change here was reflected in an invoice, rather than a formal contract amendment. Nor is it obvious why that difference would distinguish the expectations of the parties in the two cases. In both this case and Sulfanilic Acid from Portugal, the contract term which was changed was price; but - while there was only one price increase here - in Sulfanilic Acid, the price was changed twice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"50\">\n<p id=\"b285-7\"> <em>See also, e.g., </em>Uranium from France, 2005 WL 2305751, at comment 11 (using contract date \u201cexcept for one instance where the terms of sale were revised, making the date of the amended contract the appropriate date of sale\u201d for that one instance); Rebar from Latvia, 2006 WL 3702620, at comment 2 (using date of final contract amendment as date of sale).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"51\">\n<p id=\"b287-6\"> The Remand Results misconstrue one specific aspect of ICDAS\u2019 remand comments. In the Remand Results, Commerce states that ICDAS contends that there is a \u201cthree-factor test\u201d governing date of sale analyses. In fact, ICDAS never made any such claim. <em>Compare </em>Remand Results at 23 <em>and </em>ICDAS Remand Comments (Remand Pub. Doc. No. 4) at 9-11. In its remand comments, ICDAS simply pointed out that Commerce\u2019s past determinations identify a number of indicia that the agency has cited to support its use of contract date as the appropriate date of sale for purposes of antidumping analyses. <em>Id. </em>In its briefs filed with the court, ICDAS continues to assert that three such indicia - use of formal contracting procedures, made-to-order merchandise, and lag time - are present in this case. See, <em>e.g., </em>ICDAS Response Brief at 21-23, 23-25 (discussing use of formal contracting procedures), 25-27 (discussing lead time and made-to-order nature of merchandise); ICDAS Supp. Reply Brief at 7-9 (discussing use of formal contracting procedures), 9-12 (discussing lead time and made-to-order nature of merchandise).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"52\">\n<p id=\"b287-7\"> Commerce and the Domestic Producers have argued that the interests of administrative consistency counsel use of invoice date as the date of sale here. <em>See </em>Remand Results at 15 &amp; n.4, 20; Domestic Producers Reply Brief at 8, 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">In the Remand Results, for example, Commerce asserted that its \u201cpreference is to select a date of sale methodology and apply it consistently across all segments of a proceeding, unless there is evidence of changes in selling practices between segments.\u201d Remand Results at 20. However, administrative consistency has been roundly rejected as a rationale sufficient to justify Commerce\u2019s continued adherence to any particular date of sale methodology. <em>See SeAH Steel, </em>25 CIT at 137 (noting that such logic \u201cwould obviate the need for any date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>of sale analysis in all reviews beyond the first administrative review,\u201d and holding, <em>inter alia, </em>that Commerce \u201cunder the guise of\u2018administrative consistency,\u2019may not... abdicate its statutory duty to ensure that normal value is calculated \u2018at a time reasonably corresponding to the time of the sale used to determine the export price or constructed export price\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted); <em>see also </em>Pipes and Tubes from Thailand, 65 ITADOC 60910, at comment 1 (using a date of sale different than that used by Commerce in previous administrative review, notwithstanding lack of change in respondent\u2019s sales practices). The \u201cadministrative consistency\u201d argument advanced by Commerce and the Domestic Producers thus has no basis in the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The factual foundation for the \u201cadministrative consistency\u201d argument is just as weak. In their brief, the Domestic Producers sought to make much of the fact that Commerce \u201cha[d] found that invoice date [was] the appropriate date of sale for every respondent in every [administrative] review of this [antidumping] order.\u201d <em>See </em>Domestic Producers Reply Brief at 8; <em>see also id. </em>at 14 (emphasizing \u201cthe consistent use of invoice date in every other review of this order\u201d). But Commerce has since reversed itself, and has revised its analysis for the administrative review for 2002-2003 to use \u201corder date\u201d (contract date) - rather than invoice date - as the date of sale for U.S. sales by another Turkish rebar producer, Colakoglu. <em>See Colakoglu Metalurji A.S. v. United States, </em>30 CIT 281, 281-82 (2006). It is thus no longer true that Commerce has consistently used invoice date as the date of sale for every respondent in every administrative review of the antidumping duty order in question. Moreover, the date of sale issue is being litigated by a third Turkish rebar producer, Habas, in a companion case challenging Commerce\u2019s determination in the 2003-2004 administrative review - the administrative review at issue here. Although Commerce initially used invoice date as the date of sale in that case, the issue was remanded to the agency for further consideration. In the remand results, Commerce concluded that contract date was the appropriate date of sale for Habas\u2019 U.S. sales, and recalculated Habas\u2019 dumping margin accordingly. <em>See Habas Sinai ve Tibbi Gazlar Istihsal Endustrisi A.S. v. United States, </em>31 CIT_,_, 2007 WL 3378201 at * 5-8 (2007); <em>Habas </em>Remand Results at 19-22, 45-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Commerce, the Government, and the Domestic Producers seek to make a second, somewhat related point that similarly misses the mark. Both in the Remand Results and in their briefs filed in this matter, Commerce, the Government, and the Domestic Producers highlight the fact that - during the verification process - ICDAS representatives did not pressCommerce to use contract date as the date of sale for the company\u2019s U.S. sales. Commerce, the Government, and the Domestic Producers seem to intimate that the position of the company representatives at verification constitutes potent evidence in support ofCommerce\u2019s determination in the Remand Results. <em>See </em>Remand Results at 17, 20; Def. Supp. Response Brief at 12; Domestic Producers Reply Brief at 8, 14r-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">As ICDAS notes however, the company was not represented by counsel at verification; and, moreover, the pivotal significance of the date of sale issue became clear only after Commerce changed its universe of sales methodology. <em>See </em>ICDAS Response Brief at 6 n.3, 9 nn.5 &amp; 6. More to the point, however, Commerce generally accords relatively little weight to respondent companies\u2019 views in the agency\u2019s date of sale determination, focusing (properly) on what the evidence shows instead. <em>See, e.g., </em>Pipe from Korea, 63 Fed. Reg. at 32,834-36 (using contract date as date of sale, despite respondent\u2019s assertions that invoice date was appropriate); <em>see generally </em>ICDAS Response Brief at 9 n.5, 22 n.16. Indeed, in the Final Results in this case, Commerce had no hesitation in finding that contract date was the proper date of sale, notwithstanding the ICDAS representatives\u2019 position at verification. If the company representatives\u2019 position gave Commerce no pause at the Final Results stage, there is no apparent reason why their position should carry any significant weight now.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"53\">\n<p id=\"b289-8\"> The Domestic Producers reject out of hand ICDAS\u2019 arguments concerning its use of a formal contracting process, as well as its arguments based on the fact that the merchandise it sells in the U.S. market is manufactured-to-order. According to the Domestic Producers,those factors \u201ccan only justify a deviation from the presumption in favor of invoice date if [it has already been demonstrated] that the material terms of sale are in fact definitively established as of the contract date\u201d (which, the Domestic Producers maintain, \u201cis clearly not the case here\u201d). <em>See </em>Domestic Producers Reply Brief at 14; <em>see also </em>Remand Results at 17-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">However, the Domestic Producers cite no authority to support their summary dismissal of ICDAS\u2019 evidence. Nor does the Domestic Producers\u2019 position have any sound foundation in reason. In other words, contrary to the Domestic Producers\u2019 implication, the fact that merchandise must be manufactured-to-order and the fact that a buyer and a seller enter into a formal, written contract logically would seem to constitute evidence bearing directly on the question of when the parties had a meeting of the minds on the material terms of sale (which is central to determining date of sale). Indeed, ICDAS\u2019 position finds strong support in the Preamble to Commerce\u2019s date of sale regulation, which expressly states that \u201cin situations involving <em>large custom-made merchandise </em>in which the parties engage in <em>formal negotiation and contracting procedures, the Department usually will use a date other than the date of invoice\" as the date of sale. See </em>Antidumping Duties; Countervailing Duties: Final Rule, 62 Fed. Reg. at 27,349 (Preamble) (emphases added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"54\">\n<p id=\"b290-7\"> The Preamble to Commerce\u2019s date of sale regulation recognizes that the type of formal negotiation and contracting process used in ICDAS\u2019 U.S. sales is not the norm:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>The Department...has found that <em>in most industries, </em>the negotiation of a sale can be a complex process in which the <em>details often are not committed to writing.

Reg. at 27,349 (Preamble) (emphases added). The evidence cited by ICDAS suggests that - unlike the typical case referenced in the provision quoted above - Commerce here has (in the words of the Preamble) a \u201cfirm basis\u201d for determining when ICDAS and its U.S. customers had a meeting of the minds on the material terms of sale. <em>Id. </em>Each step of the negotiation process was documented in writing; and, as to each and every sale, the process culminated in a formal written contract detailing the specific terms of that sale. No party has pointed to either evidence or legal authority to suggest that ICDAS\u2019 written contracts were not legally binding instruments but instead mere \u201cpreliminary agreements] on terms,\u201d where \u201crenegotiation [was] common.\u201d <em>See </em>Antidumping Duties; Countervailing Duties: Final Rule, 62 Fed. Reg. at 27,349 (Preamble).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"55\">\n<p id=\"b292-4\"> The lead time required to produce large, custom-made merchandise often results - as it did here - in significant \u201clag time\u201d between the contract date and invoice date. As ICDAS points out, Commerce has acknowledged lag time as a factor warranting departure from the use of invoice date as the date of sale in a number of other cases, including Pipe from Korea and Extruded Rubber Thread from Malaysia. <em>See </em>Remand Results at 13 <em>(citing </em>Pipe from Korea, 63 Fed.

Highlighting the significance of the lag time issue, ICDAS notes that Commerce itself explained in its original questionnaire: \u201cBecause the Department attempts to compare sales made at <em>the same time, </em>establishing the date of sale is an important part of the dumping analysis.\u201d <em>Id. (quoting </em>Commerce Questionnaire (Pub. Doc. No. 11) at 1-5). Commerce must accurately determine the date on which sales are finalized, because factors such as inflation, changing input prices, and market fluctuations can cause significant distortions in the antidumping analysis. <em>See, e.g., Colakoglu, </em>29 CIT at 1240,394 F. Supp. 2d at 1381. ICDAS asserts that Commerce\u2019s blanket use of invoice date in the Remand Results here prevents the requisite accurate comparisons, because Commerce is \u201ceffectively... comparing home market sales in any given month to US sales whose material terms were set\u201d in an entirely different month, under different market conditions. <em>See </em>ICDAS Response Brief at 26 n.18 <em>(quoting </em>Pipe from Korea, 63 Fed. Reg. at 32,836); ICDAS Supp. Reply Brief at 10. According to ICDAS, \u201c[t]he significant distortion caused by this inaccurate comparison is reflected in Commerce\u2019s recalculation of ICDAS\u2019 dumping margin from <em>de minimis </em>to 1.63 percent.\u201d ICDAS Response Brief at 26 n.18; <em>see also </em>ICDAS Supp. Reply Brief at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Commerce, the Government, and the Domestic Producers all have sought to downplay the issue of lag time here. The Domestic Producers\u2019 brief is silent on the subject. But, on remand, the Domestic Producers tried to distinguish Pipe from Korea from the case at bar on the grounds that the lag time in Pipe from Korea was greater than it is here; and the Government makes the same argument in its brief. <em>See </em>Remand Results at 18; Def. Supp. Response Brief at 9. As discussed above, however, the lag time between contract date and invoice date in this case makes the difference between a <em>de minimis </em>dumping margin (with revocation of the antidumping order as to ICDAS) and a dumping margin of 1.63% (which precludes revocation). The lag time issue here thus cannot be so readily dismissed. <em>Cf. </em>19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.224(g) (recognizing that ministerial error is \u201csignificant\u201d when correction of error would make \u201ca difference between a weighted-average dumping margin.. .of zero (or <em>de minimis) </em>and a weighted-average dumping margin...of greater than <em>de minimis\u201d). </em>Moreover, Commerce has recognized lag time as a factor warranting departure from the use of invoice date as the date of sale in other cases where the lag time was well short of that in Pipe from Korea.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Commerce\u2019s efforts to distinguish Extruded Rubber Thread from Malaysia are no more successful. In the Remand Results, Commerce asserted that ICDAS\u2019 reliance on that case is \u201cmisplaced,\u201d because the case \u201cmerely illustrates the Department\u2019s policy of using the date of shipment as the date of sale where shipment occurs prior to invoicing.\u201d <em>See </em>Remand Results at 24. This is specious. As ICDAS correctly notes, in Extruded Rubber Thread from Malaysia, Commerce used the bill of lading date - rather than invoice date - as the date of sale where merchandise was shipped directly from Malaysia to U.S. customers. Commerce specifically cited the \u201clong lag time between the date of shipment to the customer and the date of invoice\u201d as the factor rebutting the regulatory presumption of invoice date. <em>See </em>ICDAS Response Brief at 26 n.18; Extruded Rubber Thread from Malaysia, 64 Fed. Reg. at 12,968. Because contract date was not at issue in that case, and because the foreign producer relinquished control over the merchandise at the time of shipment, the bill of lading date (rather than invoice date) reflected the date when the material terms of sale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>were established. <em>Cf. Mittal Steel Point Lisas Ltd. v. United States, </em>548 F.3d 1375, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (noting that \u201conce goods have been shipped from a foreign port, the material terms of sale have been set, as the seller may not then sell those goods to another customer\u201d). Extruded Rubber Thread from Malaysia thus stands for the proposition for which ICDAS cites it: Commerce has recognized \u201clag time\u201d as a factor which may rebut the regulatory presumption favoring invoice date as the date of sale.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"56\">\n<p id=\"b293-5\"> In this sense, the case at bar is comparable to other cases dealing with large, custom-made merchandise. <em>See generally </em>ICDAS Response Brief at 26 n.19 <em>(citing </em>Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Mechanical Transfer Presses from Japan, 55 Fed. Reg. 335, 341 (Jan. 4, 1990); Notice of Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Large Newspaper Printing Presses and Components Thereof, Whether Assembled or Unassembled, from Japan, 61 Fed. Reg. 38,139, 38,159 (July 23, 1996)). As those cases illustrate, consistent with the agency\u2019s explanation in the Preamble to the date of sale regulation, Commerce generally has found that - when dealing with physically large, expensive merchandise that is made-to-order - it is appropriate to use the contract date as the date of sale, because the parties in such cases typically \u201cengage in formal negotiation and contracting procedures.\u201d <em>See </em>Antidumping Duties; Countervailing Duties: Final Rule, 62 Fed. Reg. at 27,349 (Preamble). The great expense involved in the production of such merchandise, in addition to the relative absence of an open market for merchandise that is (at least to some degree) customized, requires that parties commit themselves to sales at an early date, in contrast to the common practice in sales from inventory. <em>See, e.g., </em>Issues and Decision Memorandum for the Antidumping Duty Administrative Reviews on Large Newspaper Printing Presses and Components Thereof, Whether Assembled or Unassembled, from Germany - September 1, 1998, Through August 31, 1999, 2001 WL 193869 (Feb. 26, 2001), at comment 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">In the Remand Results, Commerce attempted to distinguish the cases on which ICDAS relies; but Commerce\u2019s efforts are largely futile. Contrary to Commerce\u2019s assertions, it is of no moment here that, in the cases cited by ICDAS, there were no changes in quantity or price outside contractual tolerances. <em>See </em>Remand Results at 22. The cases nevertheless stand for the proposition for which ICDAS has cited them: Consonant with the rationale set forth in the Preamble to its date of sale regulation, \u201cin situations involving large custom-made merchandise in which the parties engage in formal negotiation and contracting procedures,\u201d Commerce generally uses a date other than invoice date as the date of sale. <em>See </em>Antidumping Duties; Countervailing Duties: Final Rule, 62 Fed. Reg. at 27,349 (Preamble). Commerce\u2019s observation that the newspaper printing presses in the cases that ICDAS cites were \u201chighly customized\u201d and thus \u201ccould not be resold to alternative purchasers\u201d is similarly unavailing. <em>See </em>Remand Results at 23. Again, even assuming the truth of Commerce\u2019s observations, they do nothing to detract from the fact that the cases cited by ICDAS still stand for the proposition for which ICDAS has cited them. Moreover, as discussed elsewhere herein, Commerce greatly overstates ICDAS\u2019 ability to sell in the home market merchandise that has been custom-produced and rolled in inches in conformance with U.S. standards. The Domestic Producers\u2019 argument has no greater merit. <em>Compare </em>Remand Results at 21-22; Def. Supp. Response Brief at 13 <em>with </em>n.53, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">ICDAS candidly acknowledges that rebar may not be as structurally complex as the industrial presses at issue in the cases that it cites on this point. <em>See </em>ICDAS Response Brief at 26 n.19. But no party has explained the relevance of the intricacy or complexity of the merchandise to the issue at hand. In any event, the cases that ICDAS cites are analogous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>to ICDAS\u2019 U.S. sales here, because - like the sales of the industrial presses at issue in those cases - ICDAS\u2019 U.S. sales here required formal contracts that covered the sale of tens of thousands of tons of merchandise custom-manufactured to U.S. specifications, which was worth millions of dollars and which required substantial lead time to produce.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"57\">\n<p id=\"b294-7\"> In the Remand Results, Commerce found that rebar produced pursuant to a contract with a U.S. buyer could be sold in ICDAS\u2019 home market if the contract with the U.S. buyer fell through. <em>See </em>Remand Results at 21-22. To the contrary, as Commerce correctly found at verification, rebar sold in the U.S. market is made-to-order. <em>See </em>ICDAS Sales Verification Report (Conf. Doc. No. 44) at 4. Moreover, although rebar sold in the U.S. market and that sold in the home market may have equivalent <em>strength </em>specifications, the <em>dimensions </em>vary. Specifically, rebar for the U.S. market is rolled in inches; in contrast, rebar for the home market is rolled in millimeters.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>ICDAS\u2019 home market sales database indicates that, during the period of review, there was only a single sale of U.S.-sized rebar; and that sale was for a relatively modest quantity. That single, insignificant sale cannot constitute substantial evidence that ICDAS could have sold in its home market - in anything remotely resembling the normal course of business - the thousands of tons of U.S.-sized rebar that it sold in the U.S. market during the period of review. <em>See generally </em>ICDAS Response Brief at 27 n.20; ICDAS Supp. Reply Brief at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">The Government\u2019s argument on this point amounts to little more than a bald, unsupported assertion that the fact that Commerce found that the rebar ICDAS sold in the United States was made-to-order \u201cdoes not preclude its resale.\u201d <em>See </em>Def. Supp. Response Brief at 13. The Domestic Producers steer clear of the topic entirely; and their silence speaks volumes. In short, the record evidence strongly supports ICDAS\u2019 claim that - contrary to Commerce\u2019s conclusion in the Remand Results - \u201c[t]here is simply no meaningful home market demand for U.S.-sized rebar.\u201d <em>See generally </em>ICDAS Response Brief at 27; <em>see also </em>ICDAS Supp. Reply Brief at 11-12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"58\">\n<p id=\"b297-6\"> The record evidence indicates that the price increase occurred sometime between the issuance of the letter of credit and the issuance of the invoice. <em>See </em>ICDAS Sales Verification Report (Conf.

But, given the facts of this case (as documented by record evidence), it strains credulity to contend that ICDAS would have breached a legally-binding contract of the magnitude at issue, where it had already rendered substantial performance, for a comparatively modest increase in sales revenue. <em>See </em>ICDAS Sales Verification Report (Conf. Doc. No. 44), Exh. 14 at contract &amp; credit notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Because ICDAS was - as a practical matter - unable to inventory or resell in the home market large quantities of rebar which were rolled to non-metric dimensions, ICDAS would have been stuck at the Turkish port with (quite literally) thousands of tons of rebar, if it had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>breached the contract. In fact, as the record reflects, there would be no demand for the non-metric rebar until ICDAS\u2019 next U.S. sale, which occurred months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Neither Commerce, nor the Government, nor the Domestic Producers has pointed to any concrete evidence to refute the basic facts recited above, which ICDAS has supported with ample citations to the record. Indeed, as discussed above, the other parties have gone to great lengths to emphasize the volume of rebar which was subject to the price increase, in their attempts to distinguish this case from other cases where Commerce has used contract date as the date of sale notwithstanding changes to material contract terms. <em>See </em>n.48, <em>supra. </em>As noted there, however, no party has yet explained how the volume of rebar subject to the price increase is relevant to parties\u2019 expectations concerning the binding nature of their contracts. <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, by emphasizing the volume of rebar subject to the price increase, Commerce, the Government, and the Domestic Producers effectively (albeit unintentionally) bolster ICDAS\u2019 argument here. The record evidence suggests that, given the volume of U.S.-sized rebar at issue, there is simply no way - as a practical matter - that ICDAS could have re-sold that merchandise in ICDAS\u2019 home market. As a practical matter, ICDAS thus had little choice but to fulfill its obligations under the contract, whether or not it was successful in its efforts to negotiate a price increase.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"60\">\n<p id=\"b299-8\"> More specifically, ICDAS explains that \u201cscrap is the single primary input in billet, and billet is the single primary input for rebar production.\u201d <em>See </em>ICDAS Brief at 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"61\">\n<p id=\"b302-5\"> In SRAMs from Taiwan, Commerce determined that the use of quarterly averages for prices and costs resulted in a more accurate comparison than annual averages, in light of the significant decrease in the price of SRAMs throughout the period of investigation. <em>See </em>SRAMs from Taiwan, 63 Fed.

The parties to this case were accorded the opportunity to comment on that subsequent authority. <em>See </em>Letter from ICDAS to Court (Dec. 1, 2008); Defendant\u2019s Response to Notice of Subsequent Authority (Dec. 1, 2008); Letter from Domestic Producers to Court (Dec. 1, 2008); <em>see also </em>Letter from Domestic Producers to Court (Feb. 2, 2009) (transmitting <em>United States v.

Remand will give Commerce itself the opportunity to consider the implications for this case \u2014 if any - of any asserted recent change in agency methodology, and will allow the agency to consider the views of ICDAS and the Domestic Producers on the matter, if appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"79\">\n<p id=\"b316-11\"> The Domestic Producers bristle at any suggestion that using the date of entry to define the universe of sales constitutes a new methodology. <em>See generally </em>Domestic Producers Response Brief at 4, 34-40. Indeed, the Domestic Producers assert not only that the use of the date of entry is standard agency practice, but also that the statute requires it (at least where the date of entry is known). <em>See </em>Domestic Producers Response Brief at 4, 35-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>Contrary to the Domestic Producers\u2019 claims, however, Commerce maintains that - as ICDAS argues - the agency has the discretion to define the universe of sales using \u201cas appropriate, entries, exports, or sales.\u201d <em>See </em>Decision Memo at 22 (discussing 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675(a)(2)(A) and 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.213(e)); ICDAS Reply Brief at 13 n.10. As Commerce explained in promulgating its regulation on the issue, \u201cneither the [statute] nor the AD Agreement specifies whether sales or entries are to be reviewed.\u201d <em>See </em>Antidumping Duties; Countervailing Duties: Final Rule, 62 Fed. Reg. at 27,314 (Preamble).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">ICDAS further argues that defining the universe of sales using the date of sale (rather than the date of entry) has been sustained by the courts. <em>See </em>ICDAS Reply Brief at 13 n.10 <em>(citing FAG Kugelfischer Georg Schafer KGAA v. United States, </em>19 CIT 1177, 1180-81, <em>aff\u2019d, </em>86 F.3d 1179 (Fed. Cir. 1996)). In its Final Results, however, Commerce sought to distinguish <em>FAG Kugelfischer, </em>on which ICDAS relies. <em>See </em>Decision Memo at 24 (stating, <em>inter alia, </em>that <em>\u201cFAG Kugelfischer </em>addressed the appropriateness of using sales versus entry data in the context of a sampling situation, unlike the use of actual sales and entry data here\u201d); see <em>also </em>Domestic Producers Response Brief at 39. Moreover, the Final Results stated that - although Commerce retains the discretion to define the universe of sales using \u201centries, exports, or sales\u201d - the agency does not believe that those three bases are \u201cequally preferable,\u201d and that Commerce\u2019s usual practice is to use date of entry. See Decision Memo at 22; see also <em>id. </em>at 24 (explaining that \u201cit remains within [Commerce\u2019s] discretion, and is, in fact, [Commerce\u2019s] preference and practice to restrict the universe to entries when the facts permit\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"80\">\n<p id=\"b317-7\"> ICDAS relies on <em>Shikoku </em>for the proposition that Commerce is not permitted to make \u201cminor but disruptive changes in methodology where a respondent demonstrates its specific reliance on the old methodology used in multiple preceding reviews.\u201d ICDAS Brief at 38 <em>(citing Shikoku, </em>16 CIT 382, 795 F. Supp. 417). Specifically, the <em>Shikoku </em>court found that Commerce \u201c[had] abused its discretion in adopting a slightly improved allocation methodology in the face of years of acceptance of the prior approach.\u201d <em>Shikoku, </em>16 CIT at 387, 795 F. Supp. at 420-21. The court noted that Commerce had failed to identify any new or important facts that would justify the new methodology, and had failed to explain how the new methodology \u201cwould reveal significant and heretofore undiscovered dumping.\u201d <em>Shikoku, </em>16 CIT at 387, 795 F. Supp. at 421. Although the new methodology at issue there would have been more accurate, its use would have resulted in a dumping margin slightly above <em>de minimis, </em>and thus would have denied the respondent the opportunity to have the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>antidumping order against it revoked after years of having zero or <em>de minimis </em>dumping margins. The court therefore held that Commerce\u2019s obligation \u201cto administer the antidump-ing laws fairljf\u2019 precluded the agency \u201cfrom changing its methodology at this late stage.\u201d <em>Shikoku, </em>16 CIT at 388, 795 F. Supp. at 421. The court emphasized that \u201c[a]t some point, Commerce must be bound by its prior actions so that parties have a chance to purge themselves of antidumping liabilities.\u201d <em>Shikoku, </em>16 CIT at 387, 795 F. Supp. at 421. <em>See generally </em>ICDAS Brief at 38-40 (discussing <em>Shikoku)', </em>ICDAS Reply Brief at 15 (same). <em>But see </em>Domestic Producers Response Brief at 36-37, 39-40 (seeking to distinguish <em>Shikoku </em>from the case at bar).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"81\">\n<p id=\"b318-8\"> As a threshold matter, the Domestic Producers highlight the fact that ICDAS did not advance its reliance argument at the agency level. The Domestic Producers therefore contend that the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies bars ICDAS from making the argument here. <em>See generally </em>Domestic Producers Response Brief at 34-36 &amp; n.13. ICDAS maintains that, because Commerce used the date of sale to define ICDAS\u2019 universe of sales in the Preliminary Results, \u201cICDAS could only challenge the use of entry date to define the universe of sales <em>after </em>Commerce published the Final Results.\u201d <em>See </em>ICDAS Reply Brief at 13 n.10. It is far from clear whether ICDAS reasonably could have been expected to make its reliance argument in the rebuttal brief that it filed with Commerce. But, in any event, the Domestic Producers did not press their exhaustion claim at oral argument. <em>See Corus Staal, </em>502 F.3d at 1381 (and cases cited there) (noting that \u201capplying exhaustion principles in trade cases is subject to the discretion of the judge of the Court of International Trade\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"82\">\n<p id=\"b319-6\"> <em>See, e.g., </em>Dr. at 14 (arguing that Commerce \u201ccannot simply ask for a do over anytime it wishes,\u201d and surmising that agency\u2019s request for voluntary remand is \u201can effort to make an end run around the prohibition on <em>post hoc </em>rationalizations\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
