Mem. at Comment 1; HFHTs, Finished or Unfinished, With or Without Handles, From the PRC, 72 Fed. Reg. 10,492 (Dep\u2019t of Commerce Mar. 8, 2007) (\u201cPrelim. Results\u201d). The PRC-wide rates assigned by Commerce were: 139.31 percent for bars/wedges, 45.42 percent for hammers/sledges, and 189.37 percent for axes/adzes.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">The court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(c) and 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(a)(2)(B)(iii) (2006). For the following reasons, the court sustains Commerce\u2019s Final Results in part and remands the rate for hammers/sledges to Commerce for further findings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">When reviewing Commerce\u2019s final antidumping determinations, the court \u201cshall hold unlawful any determination, finding, or conclusion found...to be unsupported by substantial evidence on the record, or otherwise not in accordance with law....\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(bXl)(B)(i) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b833-10\">I. PRC-Wide Rate</p>\n<p id=\"b833-11\">A. Legal Framework</p>\n<p id=\"b833-12\">When conducting an investigation or review of an NME country, Commerce employs a presumption of state control. <em>See Coal, for the Pres. of Am. Brake Drum &amp; Rotor Aftermarket Mfrs. v. United States, </em>23 CIT 88, 100, 44 F. Supp. 2d 229, 242 (1999). To rebut this presumption and thus qualify for a separate rate, an exporter must \u201caffirmatively demonstrate its entitlement to a separate, company-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>specific margin....\u201d <em>Sigma Corp. v. United States, </em>117 F.3d 1401, 1405 (Fed. Cir. 1997) <em>(\u201cSigma\u201d) </em>(citation and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">To establish that a firm is sufficiently independent from government control to be entitled to a separate rate, the Department requires respondents to demonstrate the absence of both <em>de jure </em>and <em>de facto </em>government control over export activities. <em>See Peer Bearing Co.-Changshan v. United States, </em>32 CIT_,_, 587 F. Supp. 2d 1319, 1324 (2008) <em>(\u201cPeer Bearing\u201d); see also Sparklers from the PRC, </em>56 Fed. Reg. 20,588, 20,589 (Dep\u2019t of Commerce May 6, 1991) (final determination of sales at less than fair value).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-7\">Absence of <em>de jure </em>government control can be demonstrated by reference to legislation and other governmental measures that decentralize control. Absence of <em>de facto </em>government control can be established by evidence that each exporter sets its prices independently of the government and of other exporters, and that each exporter keeps the proceeds of its sales.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b834-8\"><em>Sigma, </em>117 F.3d at 1405 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-9\">When a company fails to rebut the presumption of state control, Commerce employs that presumption and applies the PRC-wide rate to its products. <em>See Id. </em>at 1405.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-10\">B. Application of PRC-Wide Rate to SMC</p>\n<p id=\"b834-11\">In the Final Results, Commerce stated that SMC failed to \u201csupply the Department with all the information and documentation necessary for it to demonstrate that it is eligible for separate rates.\u201d Issues &amp; Dec. Mem. at Comment 1. Moreover, it found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-12\">[d] espite being given several opportunities, SMC failed to provide complete or consistent responses to our questions, rendering it impossible to adequately determine whether or not SMC\u2019s business operations are free from de jure or de facto government control. We are unable to definitively determine who owns SMC, who controls SMC, and the nature of SMC\u2019s relationship with the national, provincial, and local governments.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b834-13\">Issues &amp; Dec. Mem. at Comment 1. Accordingly, Commerce concluded that plaintiff failed to rebut the presumption of government control and failed to establish its eligibility for a rate separate from the PRC-wide rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>By its motion, plaintiff contends that Commerce wrongfully applied the PRC-wide rates to its sales of bars/wedges, hammers/ sledges and axes/adzes because it demonstrated absence of government control and qualified for separate rates. Pl.\u2019s Mem. 12-16. Plaintiff makes several arguments to support its position. Specifically, the company states that the PRC Foreign Trade Law, PRC Whole People Law, its business license and its export license demonstrate <em>de jure </em>independence from state control. Pl.\u2019s Mem. 13-14. Moreover, plaintiff asserts that it demonstrated <em>de facto </em>independence, particularly by producing proof that the Shandong Foreign Trade Economic Committee had no role in its export activities and that the Committee has never provided any capital to plaintiff. Pl.\u2019s Mem. 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">In response, Commerce first argues that it was unable to determine who owned or controlled plaintiff based on plaintiff\u2019s responses to a series of questionnaires. Def.\u2019s Resp. 15. Commerce states that, in its original questionnaire, it asked plaintiff to \u201cdescribe and explain\u201d who owned the company, including the \u201cfull name and address of the individual(s), corporation(s), or entities that own your company.\u201d SMC\u2019s Resp. to Commerce\u2019s Section A Questionnaire dated May 11, 2006 (\u201cOriginal Section A Resp.\u201d) 8. Plaintiff responded, \u201cSMC is owned by its shareholders [,]\u201d but failed to include the full name or address of any of these \u201cshareholders.\u201d Original Section A Resp. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">Dissatisfied with plaintiff\u2019s response, Commerce then issued its first supplemental questionnaire. <em>See </em>SMC\u2019s Resp. to Commerce\u2019s Supp. Sections A, C, and D Questionnaires dated May 23, 2006 (\u201cFirst Supp. Resp.\u201d) 3-4. The first supplemental questionnaire asked whether any other person or party had ever owned plaintiff, whether plaintiff traded publicly, how many shareholders plaintiff had, who held more than 1.99 percent of plaintiff\u2019s shares, and asked for a description of the classes of plaintiff\u2019s shares together with a \u201cdetailed text explanation of the ownership of SMC.\u201d First Supp. Resp. 3-4. Plaintiff responded to the first supplemental questionnaire by stating that it was \u201call-people owned, which means each member of SMC is responsible for his or her gain and loss. SMC is not a limited liability company. To the extent that shareholders refer to the employees at SMC; SMC currently has [a certain number of] employee \u2018shareholders.\u2019 \u201d First Supp. Resp. 4. Plaintiff also stated that it was independent from the central and provincial governments, a \u201cprivate enterprise,\u201d \u201cnot publicly traded,\u201d and that it did \u201cnot have classes of shares.\u201d First Supp. Resp. 3-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">Commerce remained unsatisfied with plaintiff\u2019s questionnaire responses and issued a second supplemental questionnaire. In this second supplemental questionnaire, Commerce asked plaintiff whether \u201call-people owned\u201d meant that \u201cSMC [was] owned by all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>people of the [PRC]SMC\u2019s Resp. to Commerce\u2019s Supp. Sections A, C, and D Questionnaires dated Jan. 22, 2007 (\u201cSecond Supp. Resp.\u201d) 1. Plaintiff responded that \u201cstate-owned\u201d and \u201call people-owned\u201d had \u201cthe same meaning and [were] interchangeable.\u201d Second Supp. Resp. 1. With its response to the second supplemental questionnaire, plaintiff also included a letter from the Shandong Province Foreign Economic Trade Cooperation Bureau (\u201cSPFETCB\u201d) \u201ccertifying the ownership status of SMC.\u201d Second Supp. Resp. 1. The letter states, \u201cShandong Machinery Import &amp; Export Group Corp. is [an] all-people owned enterprise, the description shown on its business license is state-owned enterprise, all-people owned and state-owned enterprises are the same in term[s] of character.\u201d Second Supp. Resp. at Ex. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">In the second supplemental questionnaire, Commerce also asked plaintiff to \u201c[p]rovide a detailed text explanation of the difference between the terms \u2018all-people owned\u2019 and \u2018whole people owned,\u2019 as cited in\u201d plaintiff\u2019s response to the first supplemental questionnaire. Second Supp. Resp. 1. Plaintiff responded by referencing Article 6 of the PRC Constitution and stating that \u201call-people owned\u201d meant \u201ccollective ownership by the working people.\u201d Second Supp. Resp. 1.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac5A\">According to Article 6 of the Constitution Law of the PRC, \u201cthe basis of the socialist economic system of the PRC is the socialist public ownership of the means of production, namely, ownership by the whole people and collective ownership by the working people.\u201d The terms \u201cstate-owned\u201d enterprise, \u201call people-owned\u201d enterprise, and \u201cwhole people-owned\u201d enterprise have the same meaning and are interchangeable. In order to clarify SMC\u2019s ownership status as an all people-owned enterprise, Shandong Province Foreign Economic Trade Cooperation Bureau has provided an official letter certifying the ownership status of SMC.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Second Supp. Resp. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">In addition, in the second supplemental questionnaire, Commerce asked plaintiff to explain material on certain websites that suggested SMC might be a \u201cnationalized business,\u201d \u201cstate-owned business\u201d or \u201cstate-owned enterprise.\u201d Second Supp. Resp. 2, 4-5. Rather than explaining the website material, plaintiff responded by referencing Article 6 of the PRC Constitution and the SPFETCB letter. Second Supp. Resp. 2, 4-5. Additionally, in the second supplemental questionnaire, Commerce asked plaintiff to explain the word \u201cprivate\u201d in its first supplemental questionnaire response that it was an \u2018\u201call-people owned\u2019 private enterprise.\u201d Second Supp. Resp. 3. Plaintiff responded, \u201cSMC regrets the use of the word \u2018private\u2019 in its prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>response and hereby retracts the use of this word. SMC merely meant to convey that SMC is non-p\u00fcblic.\u201d Second Supp. Resp. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Further, in the second supplemental questionnaire, Commerce again asked plaintiff to \u201c[l]ist and provide the address of any and every entity or person who holds more than 1.99 percent of the shares of SMC.\u201d Second Supp. Resp. 3. In its response, plaintiff referred to \u201cShandong Foreign Trade Economic Committee.\u201d Second Supp. Resp. 4.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Plaintiff attempted to qualify its response by stating that the Committee \u201cmerely provides a supervisory function to SMC.\u201d Second Supp. Resp. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">As the foregoing demonstrates, plaintiff failed to rebut the presumption of <em>de jure </em>government control, i.e., it has not demonstrated that it is not owned or controlled by the PRC. Indeed, rather than demonstrating the absence of state control, plaintiffs answers suggest that the company was, in fact, under state control. This being the case, because both <em>de jure </em>and <em>de facto </em>independence must be shown in order to qualify for a separate rate, the court need not address plaintiffs claims of <em>de facto </em>independence from governmental control. <em>See Peer Bearing, </em>32 CIT at 587 F. Supp. 2d at 1324.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">Because SMC has failed to rebut the presumption that it is controlled by the Chinese government it is not entitled to a separate rate. <em>See Shandong Huarong Gen. Group Corp. v. United States, </em>27 CIT 1568, 1591, Slip Op. 03-135 at 37 (2003) (not reported in the Federal Supplement). As a result, Commerce may apply the PRC-wide rate to that company\u2019s exports. <em>Id. </em>at 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">II. Selection of PRC-Wide Rates for Bars/Wedges, Hammers/ Sledges, and Axes/Adzes</p>\n<p id=\"b837-9\">A. Legal Framework</p>\n<p id=\"b837-10\">In seeking a PRC-wide rate based on AFA, the Department may use information derived from the petition, a final determination in the investigation, any prior administrative review, or any other information placed on the record. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(b); Statement of Admin. Action accompanying the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, H.R. Rep. 103-316 at 870, reprinted in 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4040,4199 (stating that secondary information is \u201cinformation derived from the petition that gave rise to the investigation or review, the final determination concerning the subject merchandise, or any previous review under [19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675] concerning the subject merchandise\u201d). Where, as here, Commerce relies on secondary information such as calculated rates from previous reviews, rather than information ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>tained in the course of a current investigation or review, the Department must \u201cto the extent practicable, corroborate that information from independent sources that are reasonably at [its] disposal.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(c); <em>see </em>19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.308(d). To corroborate secondary information, Commerce must \u201cexamine whether the secondary information to be used has probative value.\u201d <em>See </em>19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.308(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">Probative value means that the rate must be both a) reliable and b) relevant. <em>See Ferro Union, Inc. v. United States, </em>23 CIT 178, 202, 44 F. Supp. 2d 1310, 1333 (1999) <em>(\u201cFerro Union\u201d). </em>Commerce must do more than assume \u201cany prior calculated margin for the industry is reliable and <em>relevant.\u201dId. </em>at 204, 44 F. Supp. 2d at 1334. Indeed, \u201c[i]n order to comply with the statute and the [Statement of Administrative Action]\u2019s statement that corroborated information is probative information, Commerce must assure itself that the margin it applies is relevant, and not outdated, or lacking a rational relationship to [the <em>respondent].\u201dId. </em>at 205, 44 F. Supp. 2d at 1335.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Importantly, in the NME situation, there is no requirement that the rate based on AFA relate specifically to the individual company. <em>See Peer Bearing Co., </em>32 CIT at_, 587 F. Supp. 2d at 1327. Rather, \u201cthe rate must be corroborated according to its reliability and relevance to the countrywide entity as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at_, 587 F. Supp. 2d at 1327 (citation omitted). Thus, the rates Commerce selects in this case must be reliable and relevant to the PRC-wide entity,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> not specifically to SMC.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-10\">B. Corroboration of Secondary Information</p>\n<p id=\"b838-11\">Commerce argues that the secondary information it used is reliable and relevant such that it has probative value. It states: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>Issues &amp; Dec. Mem. at Comment 3. Plaintiff challenges the reliability and relevance of the rates. Pl.\u2019s Mem. 23. Specifically, plaintiff argues that the Department \u201cdid not utilize any measure to verify independently the reliability of the Bars/Wedges or Hammers/Sledges rates\u201d and that the \u201cDepartment failed to verify and corroborate the calculated PRC-wide and AFA rate\u201d applied to axes/adzes. Pl.\u2019s Mem. 31.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-12\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>[T]o corroborate secondary information, the Department will, to the extent practicable, examine the reliability and relevance of the information used. However, unlike other types of information... there are no independent sources for calculated dumping margins. The only sources for calculated margins are administrative determinations. These rates are applied to the PRC-wide entity, i.e., only to companies not eligible for a separate rate with regard to the individual class or kind of merchandise. No information has been presented in the current review that calls into question the reliability of the information used for these AFA rates. Thus, the Department continues to find that the information is reliable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>The court finds that substantial evidence supports the conclusion that two of the selected AFA rates, i.e., 139.31 percent for bars/ wedges and 189.37 percent for axes/adzes, were properly corroborated as being reliable and, because of the application of AFA, are relevant to the PRC as a whole. As an initial matter, the court finds reasonable the Department\u2019s decision to base the PRC-wide rates on AFA. Each of the four respondents were found to have been subject to an AFA rate and nothing has been placed on the record to indicate that the country-wide entity would not similarly be found to be subject to AFA. <em>See </em>AFA and Corroboration Memo, for Company Rates dated Feb. 28, 2007 (\u201cAFA and Corroboration Memo.\u201d) at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">With respect to the rates themselves, when faced with determining a country-wide rate based on what it calls \u201ctotal AFA,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Commerce faces a difficult task. Unlike rates that are calculated using responses to questionnaires, Commerce cannot calculate an AFA rate for the PRC as a whole, because there are no questionnaire responses from the PRC itself on which to rely. What the record does contain is the questionnaire responses from SMC and the other respondents in this review. However, because Commerce found all of the respondents to be subject to the application of total AFA, the responses themselves were deemed non-probative. Indeed, for Commerce, the only value of the responses is to confirm that this country-wide rate should be based on AFA. It is worth noting that the decision to apply AFA to the country-wide entity has not been contested by any party. Thus, the decision to apply an AFA rate to the PRC as a whole is reasonable and is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">To determine an AFA rate, Commerce turned to its often used methodology of choosing the highest rate from the original investigation or from prior reviews. <em>See </em>AFA and Corroboration Memo.; <em>Shanghai Taoen Int\u2019l Trading Co. v. United States, </em>29 CIT 189, 360 F. Supp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>2d 1339 (2005) (upholding the AFA rate as application of the highest available dumping margin from a different respondent in a prior administrative review); <em>Kompass Food Trading Int\u2019l v. United States, </em>24 CIT 678, 683 Slip Op. 00-90 (2000) (not reported in the Federal Supplement) (affirming the Department\u2019s use of the highest available dumping margin from a different, fully cooperative respondent in the less than fair value investigation).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">For bars/wedges, Commerce assigned the 139.31 percent rate as the PRC-wide margin. Def.\u2019s Mem. 28; Issues &amp; Dec. Mem. at Comment 3. This is the rate calculated using verified information provided by Tianjin Machinery Import &amp; Export Corporation, another respondent, in the eighth administrative review of the bars/wedges order. <em>See </em>HFHTs, Finished or Unfinished, With or Without Handles, From the PRC, 71 Fed. Reg. 54,269 at Comment 2 (Dep\u2019t of Commerce Sept. 14, 2006) (final results). Commerce recently found this AFA and PRC-wide rate to be sufficiently corroborated for use in the fourteenth administrative review. Def.\u2019s Mem. 28; Issues &amp; Dec. Mem. at Comment 3; HFHTs, Finished or Unfinished, With or Without Handles, From the PRC, 71 Fed. Reg. 54,269 at Comment 2 (Dep\u2019t of Commerce Sept. 14, 2006) (final results).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">For axes/adzes, Commerce used the calculated 189.37 percent rate for Shandong Huarong Machinery Co., Ltd., based on its verified sales and production data from the fourteenth administrative review. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Mem. 28; Issues &amp; Dec. Mem. at Comment 2; HFHTs, Finished or Unfinished, With or Without Handles, From the PRC, 71 Fed. Reg. 54,269 at Comment 9 (Dep\u2019t of Commerce Sept. 14, 2006) (final results). Commerce then applied this rate as AFA for the PRC-wide entity here. <em>See </em>HFHTs, Finished or Unfinished, With or Without Handles, From the PRC, 71 Fed. Reg. 54,269 at Comment 9 (Dep\u2019t of Commerce Sept. 14, 2006) (final results).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">As noted, Commerce is required to corroborate secondary information \u201cto the extent practicable.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(c). Here, because the 139.31 percent rate for bars/wedges and the 189.37 percent rate for axes/adzes: (1) are from earlier reviews of the same categories of merchandise; (2) are based on verified information taken from similar companies; (3) have not been found either unsupported by substantial evidence nor contrary to law by any court; and (4) with the exception of plaintiff\u2019s subsidization argument, have not been challenged by any record evidence,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Commerce has satisfied its corroboration re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>quirement. The court thus upholds Commerce\u2019s determination that the 139.31 percent rate for bars/wedges and 189.37 percent rate for axes/adzes are reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">In addition to its contentions as to the reliability and relevance of the assigned rates, plaintiff insists that the MUTT\u00ae scraper should be excluded from the calculated PRC-wide and AFA rate for axes/ adzes. Pl.\u2019s Mem. 30-31. That is, \u201c[i]n effect, the... calculated rate [from the fourteenth review] for Axes/Adzes is based solely on the MUTT\u00ae scraper submitted to the Department for a scope review.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Mem. 30. Plaintiff contends that there is \u201ccompelling evidence\u201d that the manufacturing process used in creating the MUTT\u00ae scraper should preclude it from inclusion in the scope of the HFHTs category. Pl.\u2019s Mem. 30. According to plaintiff, if the MUTT\u00ae scraper sales were eliminated from consideration, then Commerce would be required to find a lower rate for axes/adzes. However, as plaintiff also acknowledges, this Court has previously held that the MUTT is, in fact, subject to the terms of the axes/adzes order. Pl.\u2019s Mem. 30; <em>see Tianjin Mach. Imp. &amp; Exp. Corp. v. United States, </em>31 CIT_,_, Slip Op. 07-131 at 17 n.4 (Aug. 28, 2007) (not reported in the Federal Supplement) <em>{\u201cTianjin\u201d). </em>That being the case, there is no reason to exclude a rate based on MUTT\u00ae exports.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">With respect to hammers/sledges, the court reaches a different conclusion. For this merchandise Commerce used the 45.42 percent rate calculated as the best information available (\u201cBIA\u201d)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> rate during a 1991 less than fair value (\u201cLTFV\u201d) investigation of the China National Machinery Import &amp; Export Corporation. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Mem. 28; Issues &amp; Dec. Mem. at Comment 3; HFHTs, Finished or Unfinished, With or Without Handles, From the PRC, 56 Fed. Reg. 241 (Dep\u2019t of Commerce Jan. 3,1991) (final results). Commerce most recently used this rate as the AFA and PRC-wide rate during the fourteenth administrative review. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Mem. 28; Issues &amp; Dec. Mem. at Comment 3; HFHTs, Finished or Unfinished, With or Without Handles, From the PRC, 71 Fed. Reg. 54,269 (Dep\u2019t of Commerce Sept. 14, 2006) (final results).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-9\">The rate, however, was not corroborated. Rather, the rate, based on BIA, was calculated in the 1991 LTFV investigation of the China <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>National Machinery Import &amp; Export Corporation. <em>See </em>HFHTs, Finished or Unfinished, With or Without Handles, From the PRC, 56 Fed. Reg. 241 (Dep\u2019t of Commerce Jan. 3, 1991) (final results) (\u201cBecause we have rejected CMC\u2019s questionnaire response and are using best information available for our determinations, we did not verify CMC\u2019s questionnaire response.\u201d). Rather than using verified information, the Department used information submitted by the petitioner. Specifically, Commerce calculated an average of the margins contained in the petition for each class or kind of merchandise, as adjusted for calculation errors in the petition. <em>See Id. </em>at Comment 4; HFHTs, Finished or Unfinished, With or Without Handles, From the PRC, 55 Fed. Reg. 42,420 (Dep\u2019t of Commerce Oct. 19,1990) (preliminary determination). Therefore, Commerce took no steps to corroborate the information during the LTFV investigation. That being the case, Commerce failed to comply with the corroboration requirement found in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(c) and 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.308(d). Consequently, the 45.42 percent rate is not reliable, and the court directs Commerce, on remand, to assign a different rate to hammers/sledges that has been \u201ccorroborated according to its reliability and relevance to the country-wide entity as a whole.\u201d <em>Peer Bearing, </em>31 CIT at_, 587 F. Supp. 2d at 1327 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">C. The Bars/Wedges Rate Is Not Punitive</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">Plaintiff also contends that the 139.31 percent rate for bars/wedges is punitive. Pl.\u2019s Mem. 27. In making its case, plaintiff argues that this Court invalidated the 139.31 percent rate for bars and wedges as punitive and aberrational in <em>Shandong Huarong Gen. Corp. v. United States, </em>29 CIT 1227, Slip Op. 05-129 (2005) (not published in the Federal Supplement) <em>(\u201cHuarong IIP\u2019). </em>In fact, in <em>Huarong III, </em>this Court remanded Commerce\u2019s use of the rate not because the rate was unreliable or irrelevant to the PRC-wide entity, but because the rate lacked specific reliability and relevance to the individual companies that were parties to that case. <em>Huarong III, </em>29 CIT at 1332, Slip Op. 05-129 at 12. The <em>Huarong III </em>plaintiffs qualified for separate rates. <em>Huarong III, </em>29 CIT at 1228, Slip Op. 05-129 at 3. Here, SMC failed to qualify for a separate rate and Commerce has no obligation to corroborate the rate as to SMC itself. <em>See Peer Bearing, </em>31 CIT at_, 587 F. Supp. 2d at 1327. Thus, <em>Huarong III </em>does not support plaintiff\u2019s contention. Moreover, plaintiff cites to no evidence on the record relating to what a calculated rate for the PRC-wide entity might be. As such, plaintiff has made no convincing argument that the assigned rate is punitive.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>D. There Is No Evidence of Subsidization in the AFA/PRC-Wide Rates</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">Lastly, plaintiff contends that the Department must recalculate the margins from prior segments of these proceedings in order to corroborate the AFA/PRC-wide rates. Specifically, plaintiff contends that \u201c[t]he Department previously determined Indian export data cannot be used for surrogate values because of Indian subsidies and that South Korea, Thailand, and Indonesia maintain broadly available, non-industry specific export subsidies that may benefit all exporters to all export markets.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Mem. 23-24 (citation omitted). Accordingly, plaintiff argues, the Department must exclude: \u201c1) any Indian imports of steel from the United Kingdom, Belgium, Canada, or Germany in calculating the AFA/PRC-wide rate for Hammers/ Sledges and 2) the Indian imports of steel from the United Kingdom, Belgium, and Germany in calculating the AFA/PRC-wide rate for Axes/Adzes.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Mem. 24. In addition, plaintiff argues that the Department must also exclude United States data because the United States subsidizes exports. Pl.\u2019s Mem. 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">Despite plaintiff\u2019s contentions that the AFA/PRC-wide rates applied to sales of bars/wedges and hammers/sledges are distorted by subsidization, its claim must be rejected for two reasons: first, because it is well settled that the \u201crecord for judicial review should ordinarily not contain material from separate investigations, including records of separate administrative reviews arising out of the same antidumping duty order, as is the case here,\u201d <em>(Sanyo Elec. Co. v. United States, </em>23 CIT 355, 361, 86 F. Supp. 2d 1232, 1239 (1999) (citations and quotation omitted));and second, because this Court has continually rejected this argument where, as here, plaintiffs have \u201cprovided no evidence to support their assertion\u201d that \u201cthe surrogate value Commerce employed was distorted by subsidies.\u201d <em>See Tianjin, </em>31 CIT at_, Slip Op. 07-131 at 40 (\u201cWhile plaintiffs insist that the surrogate value Commerce employed was distorted by subsidies, they have provided no evidence to support their assertion. Thus, the court cannot credit plaintiffs\u2019 subsidy objection.\u201d). Accordingly, plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that the objected to values were subsidized must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b843-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the court sustains Commerce\u2019s final determination in part and remands for further findings, consistent with this opinion, with respect to the calculated 45.42 percent rate for hammers/sledges.
