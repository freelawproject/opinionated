(\u201cKYD\u201d) challenges two decisions made by Commerce during the course of the challenged review. First, KYD contends that Commerce erred when it selected King Pac Industrial Co., Ltd. (\u201cKing Pac\u201d) as a mandatory respondent. Second, KYD contends that Commerce erred when it assigned, based on the application of adverse facts available,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a 122.88% assessment rate for importations by KYD, a domestic entity, from King Pac, an unrelated foreign producer of the subject merchandise.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">This court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(c). Because Commerce\u2019s decisions are supported by substantial evidence and otherwise in accordance with law, Commerce\u2019s determination in <em>Polyethylene Retail Carrier Bags from Thailand: Final Results of Antidump-ing Duty Administrative Review and Partial Rescission of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, </em>72 Fed. Reg. 64,580 (November 16, 2007) <em>{\u201cFinal </em>Results\u201d) is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">Commerce entered an antidumping duty order on certain polyethylene retail carrier bags from Thailand in 2004. <em>Antidumping Duty Order: Polyethylene Retail Carrier Bags from Thailand, </em>69 Fed. Reg. 48,204 (August 9, 2004) (\u201cAD Order\u201d). In 2006, Commerce published notice of the opportunity to request an administrative review of the AD Order for the period of review beginning August 1, 2005 and ending July 31, 2006. <em>Antidumping or Countervailing Duty Order, Finding or Suspended Investigation; Opportunity to Request Administrative Review, </em>71 Fed. Reg. 43,441, 43,442 (August 1, 2006). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>response to this notice, domestic interested parties, and Defendant-Intervenors in the instant action, the Polyethylene Retail Carrier Bag Committee, Hilex Poly Co., LLC, and Superbag Corporation (collectively, \u201cDefendant-Intervenors\u201d), requested administrative review of 17 producers and/or exporters of polyethylene retail carrier bags from Thailand. Letter from Stephen A. Jones, King &amp; Spalding LLP, to Hon. Carlos Gutierrez, Secretary of Commerce, U.S. Department of Commerce (August 31, 2006), Public Record (\u201cP.R.\u201d) 3, Defendant\u2019s Public Appendix, Tab 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">In September 2006, Commerce undertook the administrative review for all 17 companies for which a review was requested. <em>Initiation of Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Administrative Reviews, </em>71 Fed. Reg. 57,465, 57,466 (September 29, 2006). Commerce requested that these companies provide information regarding the quantity and value of their sales to the United States during the applicable period of review. Memorandum from Laurie Parkhill, Office Director, to Thomas Schauer, Senior Import Trade Compliance Analyst, U.S. Department of Commerce, AD/CVD Operations, Office 5, Re: Polyethylene Retail Carrier Bags from Thailand - Respondent Selection (November 9, 2006), Confidential Record (\u201cC.R.\u201d) 11, Defendant\u2019s Confidential Appendix, Tab 1 <em>(\u201cRespondent Selection Memo\u201d) </em>at 1. After receiving responses from all 17 companies, Commerce determined that it did not have sufficient resources to complete an administrative review for each of the companies for which a review was requested. <em>Id. </em>at 1-3. Thereafter, Commerce selected as mandatory respondents the four companies that it determined represented the greatest possible export volume. <em>Id. </em>at 4-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">King Pac was among the four mandatory respondents selected. <em>Id. </em>Commerce then sent an antidumping duty questionnaire to King Pac.

Simoes, Esq., Hunton &amp; Williams (November 9, 2006), P.R. 31, Defendant\u2019s Public Appendix, Tab 5. Six weeks later, Commerce advised King Pac by letter that it had not received a response and offered to extend the deadline for submission of the requested information. Letter from Laurie Parkhill, Office Director, AD/CVD Enforcement, U.S. Department of Commerce, to Pattida Julasaksrisakul, King Pac Industrial Co., Ltd. (December 21,2006), P.R. 46, Defendant\u2019s Public Appendix, Tab 6. In July 2007, Commerce placed in the Administrative Record for the challenged review a memorandum to the file incorporating two documents: (1) a memorandum dated January 16, 2004, explaining Commerce\u2019s determination to assign an 122.88% adverse facts available <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>(\u201cAFA\u201d) rate to Zippac Co., Ltd. (\u201cZippac\u201d) in the initial investigation<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>; and (2) a memorandum dated August 31, 2006, explaining its decision to assign that same AFA rate to King Pac in the first administrative review of the AD Order.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Memorandum from Hermes Pinilla, International Trade Compliance Analyst, AD/CVD Operations, Office 5, U.S. Department of Commerce, to The File, and attachments thereto (July 2, 2007), C.R. 48, Defendant\u2019s Confidential Appendix, Tab 2, P.R. 98, Defendant\u2019s Public Appendix, Tab 7 (collectively, <em>\u201cAFA Memo\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Subsequently, Commerce published the preliminary results of this second administrative review. <em>Polyethylene Retail Carrier Bags from Thailand: Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review and Intent to Rescind in Part, </em>72 Fed. Reg. 37,718 (July 11, 2007) <em>(\u201cPreliminary Results\u201d). </em>In the <em>Preliminary Results, </em>Commerce stated that it would assign an AFA rate to King Pac because it never responded to the antidumping questionnaire. <em>Id. </em>at 37,720. Commerce selected the rate of 122.88% which had been assigned to Zippac in the initial investigation and to King Pac after the first administrative review. <em>Id. </em>Commerce determined that the AFA rate remained both reliable and relevant. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">KYD filed a case brief challenging Commerce\u2019s selection of King Pac as a mandatory respondent as well as Commerce\u2019s corroboration, and ultimate imposition, of the AFA rate. Case Brief of KYD, Inc. before the U.S. Department of Commerce, Case No. A-549-821, Administrative Review of Polyethylene Retail Carrier Bags from Thailand for the period August 1, 2005 to July 31, 2006 (August 10, 2007), C.R. 49, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>Defendant\u2019s Confidential Appendix, Tab 3, P.R. 110, Defendant\u2019s Public Appendix, Tab 9 (\u201cKYD Administrative Case Brief\u2019). Commerce rejected KYD\u2019s arguments. <em>See </em>Memorandum from Stephen J. Claeys, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, to David M. Spooner, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Re: Issues and Decision Memorandum for the Antidumping Duty Administrative Review of Polyethylene Retail Carrier Bags from Thailand for the Period of Review August 1, 2005, through July 31, 2006 (November 8, 2007), P.R. 122, Defendant\u2019s Public Appendix, Tab 11 <em>{\u201cFinal Decision Memo\u201d) </em>cmt. 1, at 2~4 (selection of mandatory respondents), and cmt. 2, at 3-7 (imposition of AFA rate). King Pac was assigned a final AFA rate of 122.88%. <em>Final Results, </em>72 Fed. Reg. at 64,581.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">The court must uphold a determination by Commerce resulting from an administrative review of an antidumping duty order unless it is \u201cunsupported by substantial evidence on the record, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(l)(B)(i); <em>Carpenter Tech. Corp. v. United States, </em>510 F.3d 1370, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">The substantial evidence test \u201crequires only that there be evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Cleo Inc. v. United States, </em>501 F.3d 1291, 1296 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (citing <em>Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 477, 71 S. Ct. 456, 95 L. Ed. 456 (1951)). While the court must consider contradictory evidence, \u201cthe substantial evidence test does not require that there be an absence of evidence detracting from the agency\u2019s conclusion, nor is there an absence of substantial evidence simply because the reviewing court would have reached a different conclusion based on the same record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Universal Camera Corp., </em>340 U.S. at 487-88); <em>see also Am. Silicon Techs, v. United States, </em>261 F.3d 1371, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <em>U.S. Steel Group v. United States, </em>96 F.3d 1352, 1357 (Fed. Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">To determine whether Commerce\u2019s interpretation and application of the antidumping statute at issue \u201cis in accordance with the law,\u201d the court must conduct the two-step analysis articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 842-43, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1984). Under the first step of the <em>Chevron </em>analysis, the court must ascertain \u201cwhether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue. If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\u201d <em>Wheatland Tube Co. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number><em>United, States, </em>495 F.3d 1355, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (citing <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 842-43).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-3\">The court reaches the second step of the <em>Chevron </em>analysis only \u201cif the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843). Under this second step, the court must evaluate whether Commerce\u2019s interpretation \u201cis based on a permissible construction of the statute.\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843. The agency\u2019s construction need not be the only reasonable interpretation or even the most reasonable interpretation. <em>Zenith Radio Corp. v. United States, </em>437 U.S. 443, 450, 98 S. Ct. 2441, 57 L. Ed. 2d 337 (1978). The court must defer to Commerce\u2019s reasonable interpretation of a statute even if it might have adopted another interpretation if the question had first arisen in a judicial proceeding. <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">KYD challenges Commerce\u2019s selection of King Pac as a mandatory respondent and Commerce\u2019s selection and application of the 122.88% AFA rate to King Pac\u2019s entries of the subject merchandise.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> These determinations are upheld. Commerce\u2019s selection of King Pac as a mandatory respondent in the challenged review is in accordance with the methodology outlined in the relevant statute, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f \u2014 1. Commerce\u2019s corroboration, and ultimate imposition, of the AFA rate is both in accordance with law and supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">\n<em>Commerce\u2019s Selection Of Mandatory Respondents Is In Accordance With Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">KYD contends that Commerce\u2019s selection of mandatory respondents should have been limited, in the first instance, to those \u201cforeign manufacturers that both requested a review and were the subject of a request for review by the domestic industry.\u201d <em>See </em>Motion for Judgment on the Agency Record Submitted Pursuant to Rule 56.2 of the. Rules of the U.S. Court of International Trade (\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Motion\u201d) at 34. Moreover, KYD contends that because King Pac\u2019s dumping mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>gin was previously calculated on the basis of adverse facts available, \u201cif Commerce did not elect to go with the [four] respondents for which there was a consensus about review, Commerce should have selected the respondent with the [fifth] largest volume...if [it] deemed that the volume of sales without King Pa[c] would be insufficient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 36. This proposal would require Commerce to adopt a \u201ccrude quantity and value test\u201d to assess whether the entity for which there was \u201cconsensus\u201d about review was \u201ccomparable in size\u201d to the entity for which there was no such \u201cconsensus.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 36-37. KYD does not cite to any authority in support of either its proposed \u201cconsensus\u201d methodology or its \u201ccrude quantity and value test\u201d for mandatory respondent selection. <em>See id. </em>at 34-37. Neither of KYD\u2019s proposals is consistent with the methodology contemplated by the relevant statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">Pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f-l(c), Commerce must calculate an individual margin for each known producer and exporter unless \u201cit is not practicable\u201d to do so \u201cbecause of the large number of exporters or producers involved in the investigation or review.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f \u2014 1(c)(1)\u2014(2); <em>see </em>Statement of Administrative Action accompanying the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, H.R. Doc. No. 103-316 (\u201cSAA\u201d)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> at 872 (1994), <em>reprinted in </em>1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4040, 4200. If it is not practicable to calculate individual dumping margins for each producer and/or exporter, Commerce is authorized by statute to limit its examination to either a \u201cstatistically valid\u201d sample of exporters/ producers or to those \u201cexporters and producers accounting for the largest volume of the subject merchandise from the exporting country that can be reasonably examined.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f-l(c)(2)(A)-(B); SAA at 872, 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 4200-01.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Here, Commerce determined that it had sufficient resources to review only four companies. <em>Respondent Selection Memo </em>at 3. Commerce then selected as mandatory respondents the four largest exporters/producers of polyethylene retail carrier bags from Thailand, which collectively accounted for more than 90 percent of total imports of the subject merchandise. <em>Id. </em>at 4. King Pac was one of the four entities selected, as it was among the four largest producers. <em>Final Decision Memo </em>cmt. 1, at 3. Commerce\u2019s methodology for selecting mandatory respondents was entirely in accordance with the methodology prescribed by the statute. It is irrelevant that King Pac <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>did not request a review of itself. It is also irrelevant that Commerce applied adverse facts available when calculating King Pac\u2019s dumping margin in the previous administrative review.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">\n<em>Commerce\u2019s Selection And Imposition Of The AFA Rate Is Supported By Substantial Evidence and In Accordance With Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">KYD argues that the AFA rate selected by Commerce is inappropriate for three reasons. First, KYD argues that the AFA rate was not corroborated properly. To that end, KYD asserts that the AFA rate was neither corroborated by an independent source, as required by statute, Plaintiff\u2019s Motion at 12-17, nor shown to be reliable and relevant, <em>id. </em>at 17-22. Second, KYD argues that the AFA rate is \u201c[ujnduly [pjunitive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23 (emphasis omitted), 23-30. Third, KYD argues that because it is an \u201cinnocent importer,\u201d it should receive a different assessment rate for its imports of King Pac merchandise than the AFA rate assigned to King Pac. <em>Id. </em>at 30, 30-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">Commerce Corroborated The AFA Rate With Independent Information And Properly Determined That It Was Both Reliable And Relevant</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">KYD\u2019s arguments regarding the propriety of Commerce\u2019s corroboration are predicated on the fact that the AFA rate selected was derived from the petition. Plaintiff\u2019s Motion at 12, 17. Information derived from the petition is characterized as \u201csecondary information.\u201d SAA at 870, 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 4199. When Commerce uses secondary information, it \u201cshall, to the extent practicable, corroborate that information from independent sources that are reasonably at [its] disposal.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(c). In order to corroborate secondary information, Commerce must find that \u201cthe secondary information to be used has probative value.\u201d SAA at 870, 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 4199. Commerce evaluates whether secondary information has probative value by assessing its reliability and relevance. <em>Mittal Steel Galati S.A. v. United States, </em>491 F. Supp. 2d 1273, 1278 (CIT 2007) (citing <em>Ball Bearings and Parts Thereof from France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Singapore, and the United Kingdom: Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Reviews, </em>70 Fed. Reg. 54,711, 54,712-13 (September 16, 2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">KYD contends that Commerce should not have used the petition rate to establish the AFA rate because it was \u201ccorroborated with the same information in the petition which formed the basis for the allegation in the petition.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s Motion at 15. According to KYD, such an interpretation \u201crender [s] the corroboration provisions of the statute a nullity,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 15, and does not comport with the definition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>of \u201cindependent sources\u201d provided in the SAA, <em>id. </em>at 15-16 (quoting SAA at 870, 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 4199). KYD characterizes the information used by Commerce to corroborate the petition rate as \u201cmore akin to the \u2018unverified allegation\u2019 discussed in the SAA as an exemplar of information which is not reliable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16 (quoting SAA at 870, 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 4199).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">Commerce \u201ccorroborated the petition rate with import statistics, a price quotation for various sizes of polyethylene retail carrier bags... commonly produced in Thailand, and affidavits from company officials from different Thai producers of the like product.\u201d <em>Final Decision Memo </em>cmt. 2, at 5. Both the SAA and the applicable regulation specifically provide that independent sources used to corroborate secondary information <em>may include </em>published price lists, official import statistics, customs data, and information obtained from interested parties during a particular investigation. SAA at 870, 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 4199; 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.308(d). Commerce correctly concluded that \u201c[t]he fact that these source documents were included in the petition does not disqualify them as independent sources.\u201d <em>Final Decision Memo </em>cmt. 2, at 5; <em>see Universal Polybag Co. v. United States, </em>577 F. Supp. 2d 1284, 1300 (CIT 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">KYD also argues that the petition rate was not corroborated by a showing of reliability and relevance. Plaintiff\u2019s Motion at 17-22. The reliability of an AFA rate is assessed by determining whether the rate was reliable when first used. <em>See Tianjin Mach. Imp. &amp; Exp. Corp. v. United States, </em>Slip Op. 07-131, 2007 Ct. Int\u2019l Trade LEXIS 137, at *44 (August 28, 2007). The relevance of an AFA rate is measured against \u201cpast practices in the industry in question.\u201d <em>D&amp;L Supply Co. v. United States, </em>113 F.3d 1220, 1223-24 (Fed. Cir. 1997); <em>Shanghai Taoen Int\u2019l Trading Co. v. United States, </em>29 CIT 189, 197, 360 F. Supp. 2d 1339, 1346 (2008). Commerce has, however, corroborated the AFA rate by showing that it is both reliable and relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">With respect to reliability, KYD contends that \u201cCommerce should have re-examined the petition data and compared the prices and values with those that were verified in the original investigation to determine if the petition rate had been discredited.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s Motion at 19. According to KYD, because the petition rate is \u201c43 times higher than the final \u2018all others\u2019 rate [in the initial investigation]...it has been discredited...and therefore is not a reliable source for the purpose of AFA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">The petition rate has not been discredited. To the contrary, it has been affirmed by this court in the previous administrative review of the AD Order, specifically with respect to the imposition of an AFA rate to entries made by King Pac. <em>See Universal Polybag, </em>577 F. Supp. 2d at 1300. Moreover, as discussed above, this court has reaffirmed its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>holding in <em>Universal Polybag </em>that the petition rate was corroborated by independent sources. These findings demonstrate the reliability of the petition rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">With respect to relevance, KYD argues that, contrary to Commerce\u2019s stated position that no information has been presented in this review that calls into question the relevance of the petition rate, \u201cthe large gap between the petition rate (122.88%) and the dumping margin (0.80%-5.6%) calculated by Commerce for all the cooperative respondents in all segments of this proceeding does, by itself, call into question\u201d its relevance. Plaintiff\u2019s Motion at 20 (citing <em>Final Decision Memo </em>cmt. 2, at 6). According to KYD, \u201c[t]he sole corroboration for relevance performed by Commerce was an attempt to bootstrap on the prior review by citing to the memo analyzing the reasonableness of the AFA rate in that review, but without providing any analysis of the reasonableness of the AFA rate in this review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20-21 (citing <em>Final Decision Memo </em>cmt. 2, at 6). KYD asserts that because \u201cnot a single margin found for any entity in this review was within 40% of the AFA rate... Commerce cannot use the petition rate as the AFA rate for King Pa[c] in this review, as it has not been corroborated, and in fact cannot be corroborated, for relevance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Contrary to KYD\u2019s assertion, the AFA rate has been corroborated for relevance. That same rate was applied to King Pac in the first administrative review of the AD Order. <em>Polyethylene Retail Carrier Bags from Thailand: Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, </em>72 Fed. Reg. 1,982,1,983 (January 17,2007). Commerce\u2019s application of that rate was affirmed by this court in Universal Polybag, 577 F. Supp. 2d at 1300-01. The court found that Commerce\u2019s application of \u201cthe highest prior rate assigned to a company in the King Pac group... [was] appropriate because the company upon which the rate is based, Zippac, is closely related to King Pac, and because it is within the discretion of Commerce to resort to the highest prior rate in the assumption that it is an accurate reflection of the current margins.\u201d Id. at 1300 (citing <em>Rhone Poulenc, Inc. v. United States, </em>899 F.2d 1185, 1190 (Fed. Cir. 1990), and <em>Shanghai Taoen, </em>29 CIT at 197).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">KYD\u2019s assertion that \u201c[w]hile the AFA rate may have been \u2018reasonable\u2019 in [the] prior review, it does not necessarily follow that it is \u2018reasonable\u2019 in this review,\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s Motion at 21, contradicts judicial pronouncements endorsing Commerce\u2019s selection of the highest prior margin when a respondent does not cooperate. The Federal Circuit has recognized that \u201c[i]n cases in which the respondent fails to provide Commerce with the most recent pricing data, it is within Commerce\u2019s discretion to presume that the highest prior margin reflects the current margins.\u201d <em>Ta Chen Stainless Steel Pipe, Inc. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number><em>United States, </em>298 F.3d 1330, 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2002); <em>see also Rhone Poulenc, </em>899 F.2d at 1190 (finding that the presumption in favor of the highest prior rate \u201creflects a common sense inference that the highest prior margin is the most probative evidence of current margins because, if it were not so, the importer, knowing of the rule, would have provided <em>current </em>information showing the margin to be less\u201d); <em>Shanghai Taoen, </em>29 CIT at 197. Indeed, the Federal Circuit has recognized that the purpose of using the highest prior rate is, in part, to \u201cproduce [ ] an antidumping duty rate that bears some relationship to past practices in the industry in question.\u201d <em>D &amp; L Supply, </em>113 F.3d at 1223.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">Commerce appropriately determined, within that framework, that the AFA rate remains relevant in this review. Commerce determined, in the prelimary investigation, that the source documents \u201creflected commercial practices\u201d in the polyethlyene retail carrier bag industry and that, therefore, they were relevant to those mandatory respondents that did not participate in the investigation. <em>Preliminary Results, </em>72 Fed. Reg. at 37,720 (citing <em>Notice of Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Polyethylene Retail Carrier Bags from Thailand, </em>69 Fed. Reg. 34,122, 34,123-24 (June 18, 2004) (\u201cLTFV Investigation\u201d)). Commerce thereafter determined that the AFA rate remains relevant to King Pac because it was not contested by any interested party in the initial LTFV Investigation and has not been judicially discredited. <em>Final Decision Memo </em>cmt. 2, at 6. In addition, Commerce noted that \u201cKing Pac elected not to cooperate at all in this review, providing no information to refute the relevance of the [AFA] rate\u201d selected. <em>Id. </em>Based on these determinations, it was reasonable for Commerce to \u201cconclude that King Pac has not altered its past pricing practices and that its previous rate is reflective of its current pricing practices and, therefore, has relevance in this administrative review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>cmt. 2, at 7; <em>see Shanghai Taoen, </em>29 CIT at 198-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The AFA Rate Is Not Unduly Punitive In Nature</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">KYD asserts that Commerce should not have used the petition rate as the AFA rate because it does not reflect an estimate of King Pac\u2019s dumping margin and is therefore \u201c[u]nduly [p]unitive\u201d in nature. Plaintiff\u2019s Motion at 23 (emphasis omitted). According to KYD, \u201cif an AFA rate is selected, such rate must reasonably reflect the rate that would have applied had the party cooperated with a <em>reasonable </em>additional amount to deter non-compliance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Shandong Huarong Gen. Group Corp. v. United States, </em>Slip Op. 07-4, 2007 Ct. Int\u2019l Trade LEXIS 3 (January 9, 2007)). Moreover, according to KYD, the AFA rate applied \u201cshould reasonably reflect a company\u2019s dumping <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>activity during the <em>period of review </em>and not simply represent dumping of the subject merchandise by some unrelated entity over an amorphous period of time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>PAM, S.p.A, v. United States, </em>495 F. Supp. 2d 1360 (CIT 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">With respect to the first prong of the <em>Shandong </em>test, whether the starting point for the AFA rate selected was the rate that would have applied had the party cooperated, KYD asserts that the all-others rate of .95% calculated for those respondents not selected for review is \u201ca perfect substitute\u201d for the rate that would have been applied if King Pac had cooperated. Plaintiff\u2019s Motion at 24. There is no basis for this assertion, as King Pac was in a different position than those respondents not selected for review. King Pac refused to cooperate in this review despite the fact that Commerce had applied an AFA rate of 122.88% in the first administrative review. <em>See Preliminary Results, </em>72 Fed. Reg. at 37,720. Thus, it was reasonable for Commerce to infer that King Pac\u2019s actual dumping margin would not have been less than 122.88% because, if that were the case, King Pac \u201cwould have produced current information showing the margin to be less.\u201d <em>Rhone Poulenc, </em>899 F.2d at 1190. Moreover, Commerce correctly stated that applying the all-others rate to King Pac \u201cwould allow King Pac to benefit significantly from its failure to cooperate in the instant review, contrary to [statutory] intent...as described in the SAA.\u201d <em>Final Decision Memo </em>cmt. 2, at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">With respect to the second prong of the <em>Shandong </em>test, whether the amount by which the \u201cstarting point\u201d rate is augmented to deter non-compliance is reasonable, KYD asserts that \u201cany rate based on AFA... should...be a low multiple (two, maybe three times) of the rate assigned to the non-selected respondents.\u201d Plaintiffs Motion at 29. In addition to citing the multiple of 1.3 to 2.5 applied in <em>Shandong, id. </em>at 26, KYD cites the 1:1 ratio for punitive damages established in Exxon Shipping Co. v. Baker, 128 S. Ct. 2605, 171 L. Ed. 2d 570 (2008), for this proposition, Plaintiff\u2019s Motion at 28. Those cases are inapposite. <em>In Shandong, </em>the plaintiffs had received their own calculated rates in previous reviews and the challenged AFA rate selected was higher than the plaintiffs\u2019 previous rates. <em>Shandong, </em>2007 Ct. Int\u2019l Trade LEXIS 3, at *16-17. In any event, this court has already determined that Shandong does not provide a numerical limit and that Commerce \u201cis unfettered by absolute numerical limitations\u201d when selecting an AFA rate. <em>Universal, Polybag, </em>577 F. Supp. 2d at 1301. This court has also previously determined that Exxon is not relevant in this context. <em>See PAM, S.p.A. v. United States, </em>Slip Op. 08-94, 2008 Ct. Int\u2019l Trade LEXIS 91 (September 9, 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>3</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">KYD Is Not Entitled To An Assessment Rate For Its Entries Of King Pac Merchandise That Is Different From The Margin Assigned To King Pac</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">KYD argues that \u201c[a]n increase of duties resulting from a deposit rate of 2.80% to a liquidation rate [of] 122.88%\u201d on an \u201cinnocent U.S. importer\u201d is \u201cinherently penal in nature.\u201d Plaintiffs Motion at 31. According to KYD, because it is \u201cclear that no finding has been made that KYD has not cooperated...no adverse inference should be drawn to KYD based on the misconduct of [King Pac,] an unrelated third party.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Plaintiffs Reply at 4. In support of this proposition, KYD cites to both the statutory language authorizing the imposition of adverse inferences, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(b), and to the regulation governing the calculation of assessment rates, 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.212(b). Id. at 4-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Neither of these citations support KYD\u2019s proposition. KYD is correct that 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(b) provides Commerce with the discretion to apply adverse inferences against an interested party if it \u201cfinds that [the] party has failed to cooperate by not acting to the best of its ability,\u201d and that 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.212(b) qualifies its instructions for the calculation of assessment rates with the word \u201cnormally.\u201d However, KYD overlooks the fact that importers are responsible to pay the antidumping duties to which they are subject, including any increases over the deposit made upon entry for estimated antidumping duties. See 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673g(b)(4); 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675(a)(2)(C); 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 141.1(b)(1). Moreover, the discretion afforded by the regulation in calculating the assessment rate is just that, discretion. KYD has not demonstrated that the regulation is unreasonable, nor that \u201cthe \u2018normal\u2019 method for calculating [the assessment rate] is inapplicable\u201d here.
