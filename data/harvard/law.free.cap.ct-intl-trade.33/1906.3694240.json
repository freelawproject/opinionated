This statement of intent cdmports with the Department\u2019s normal practice but did not preclude any party from submitting comments on the respondent selection methodology following initiation. While the Department acknowledges that sampling has been used in rare cases to select respondents, the sampling methodology is the exception to the Department\u2019s normal practice. In addition, selecting respondents using the sampling methodology requires intensive data collection and comments from all parties which would not support an expeditious process of selecting respondents in this administrative review.

Prior to the <em>Preliminary Results, </em>Ad Hoc objected to both the <em>Initiation Notice </em>intent to select by volume, <em>May 22, 2007 Letter, June 13, 2007 Letter, </em>and the selection of four respondents, <em>July 30, 2007 Letter, August 10, 2007 Letter. </em>Ad Hoc now contends that Commerce failed to adequately explain these aspects of the respondent selection process. Ad Hoc\u2019s Motion at 16, 20. However, Pakfood is correct that \u201cto allow Commerce the opportunity to clarify any ambiguity in its explanation of its decision-making process, Ad Hoc should have raised this issue in its brief before the agency and argued its position then.\u201d Pakfood\u2019s Opposition at 15. Given the regulatory requirement that \u201call arguments\u201d be set forth in the case brief, Commerce could reasonably have concluded that Ad Hoc was no longer pursuing its respondent selection challenge. <em>See </em>19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.309(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1941-5\">The failure to include an \u201cargument in a case brief is a failure to exhaust administrative remedies with respect to that argument because it \u2018deprives [Commerce] of an opportunity to consider the matter, make its ruling, and state the reasons for its action.\u2019\u201d <em>Ad Hoc Shrimp Trade Action Comm. v.

Commerce is required to reduce \u201cthe price used to establish\u201d EP and CEP by \u201cthe amount\u201d of any \u201cexpenses . . . which are incident to bringing the subject merchandise from the original place of shipment in the exporting country to the place of delivery in the United States.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c)(2)(A). Although the statute does not address warehousing expenses, its legislative history explains that the reduction is to \u201caccount for: . . . transportation and other expenses, including warehousing expenses.\u201d Uruguay Round Agreements Act Statement of Administrative Action, H.R.

Commerce gave the following explanation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1943-8\">Inventory carrying costs are not actual expenses borne by the respondent, but rather they are imputed financing costs associated with holding inventory for a period prior to its sale. By their nature, financing expenses are not associated with the movement of merchandise, and thus the regulations do not direct the Department to treat them as movement expenses. In contrast, the regulations explicitly instruct the Department to treat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1922\">*1922</page-number>warehousing expenses incurred after the merchandise leaves the factory as movement expenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1944-4\"><em>Decision Memo., </em>cmt. 2 at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b1944-5\">Ad Hoc next claimed that for certain CEP sales, \u201ctitle passes to the unaffiliated customer at the warehouse location.\u201d Ad Hoc Case Brief at 3. Commerce did not consider this to be relevant because the expenses at issue were \u201cassociated with storing subject merchandise prior to sale.\u201d <em>Decision Memo, </em>cmt. 2 at 9. Lastly, Ad Hoc relied upon the respondents having characterized inventory maintenance expenses as selling expenses \u201cin their sales activity charts.\u201d Ad Hoc Case Brief at 3. Commerce explained that this position was \u201cmisplaced\u201d given the limited function of the sales activity chart and distinguished inventory maintenance from physical warehousing.

United States, </em>337 F.3d 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2003). There, the Federal Circuit explained that \u201c[t]he statute has two distinct parts respectively addressing two distinct circumstances under which Commerce has received less than the full and complete facts needed to make a determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1381. The \u201cfacts available\u201d part focuses on the \u201crespondent\u2019s failure to provide information. The reason for the failure is of no moment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis removed). By contrast, the AFA part focuses on the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1945-13\">respondent\u2019s failure to cooperate to the best of its ability, not its failure to provide requested information.... To conclude that an importer has not cooperated to the best of its ability and to draw an adverse inference under section 1677e(b), Commerce need only make two showings. First, it must make an objective showing that a reasonable and responsible importer would have known that the requested information was required to be kept and maintained under the applicable statutes, rules, and regulations. Second, Commerce must then make a subjective showing that the respondent under investigation not only has failed to promptly produce the requested information, but further that the failure to fully respond is the result of the respondent\u2019s lack of cooperation in either: (a) failing to keep and maintain all required record, or (b) failing to put forth its maximum efforts to investigate and obtain the requested information from its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1924\">*1924</page-number>records. An adverse inference may not be drawn merely from a failure to respond, but only under circumstances in which it is reasonable for Commerce to expect that more forthcoming responses should have been made; <em>i.e., </em>under circumstances in which it is reasonable to conclude that less than full cooperation has been shown. While intentional conduct, such as deliberate concealment or inaccurate reporting, surely evinces a failure to cooperate, the statute does not contain an intent element. \u201cInadequate inquiries\u201d may suffice. The statutory trigger for Commerce\u2019s consideration of an adverse inference is simply a failure to cooperate to the best of respondent\u2019s ability, regardless of motivation or intent.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1946-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 1382-83 (citation omitted) (emphasis removed).</p>\n<p id=\"b1946-5\">Commerce is by statute afforded discretion in applying facts available and AFA. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(a), (b).

Specifically, Thai Union\u2019s sales ledger incorrectly recorded the customer\u2019s name . . . , which in turn resulted in failure by the computer program to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1925\">*1925</page-number>select these transactions for the sales data file.\u201d Thai Union Case Brief at 52.

Moreover, Thai Union proffered a reasonable explanation as to why it had not reported these transactions (i.e., a computer error related to the miscoding of the customer name), and it was able to substantiate this explanation to our satisfaction at verification. Further, based on extensive testing procedures performed at verification, we are confident that Thai Union identified the complete universe of unreported transactions that fell under this scenario.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1947-4\">Therefore, we have reversed our preliminary decision to apply AFAto Thai Union\u2019s unreported EP sales because: 1) Thai Union voluntarily disclosed the unreported sales to the Department very early on at verification; 2) we find Thai Union\u2019s explanation regarding why it did not report these U.S. sales to be plausible; 3) these sales constitute a very small quantity of the total reported U.S. sales; and 4) the Department satisfied itself that it obtained the full universe of these transactions at verification.

To support its position, Ad Hoc cites the initiation notices of previous reviews of antidumping duty orders on warmwater shrimp that announced Commerce\u2019s intent to select respondents either through sampling or the largest by volume. <em>Id. </em>at 13-14 (citations omitted). Ad Hoc further explains that \u201cfrom April 2006 to April 2007, Commerce initiated at least 110 antidumping administrative reviews unrelated to the shrimp antidumping orders\u201d and did not announce an intent to select respondents based on volume in any of them. <em>Id. </em>at 14 (citations omitted). However, Pakfood is correct that more likely \u201cCommerce meant only that its practice of\u2018selecting respondents with the largest volume\u2019 comported with the Department\u2019s normal practice, which is patently true.\u201d Pakfood\u2019s Opposition at 14 (emphasis removed). Commerce was not required to explain this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1918\">*1918</page-number>statement since, <em>inter alia, </em>Ad Hoc did not seek clarification in its case brief. <em>See infra </em>Section IV.A.2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1940-11\"> Requests for review were withdrawn for six of the 142 companies for which review was initially sought. <em>Respondent Selection Memo </em>at 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1940-12\"> Ad Hoc emphasizes that: Commerce selected twice as many respondents as in similar reviews while basing its methodology on a reduction of staff, Ad Hoc\u2019s Motion at 17-18 (citing <em>Respondent Selection Memo </em>at 4), 20-21; and despite the increase, \u201cthe majority of the subject merchandise . . . was not subject to the proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 18-19 (citations omitted). However, Commerce here properly acted within its discretion to allocate resources by selecting four respondents. <em>See Torrington, </em>68 F.3d at 1351. Moreover, because Ad Hoc did not raise the issue in its case brief, Commerce was not required to clarify its selection of four respondents. <em>See infra </em>Section IV.A.2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1941-6\"> This court recognizes limited exceptions to the requirement that litigants must have exhausted their administrative remedies. <em>See Budd Co., Wheel &amp; Brake Div. v.

Reply Brief of Plaintiff Ad Hoc (\u201cAd Hoc\u2019s Reply\u201d) at 2-4. Therefore, Pakfood\u2019s argument concerning the inapplicability of the futility exception to the exhaustion doctrine need not be considered. <em>See </em>Pakfood\u2019s Opposition at 15-16.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1942-7\"> In addition to the exhaustion doctrine, parties present other bases to preclude consideration of Ad Hoc\u2019s challenge to the statement of intent to select respondents. <em>See </em>The Rubicon Group\u2019s Opposition at 1 (\u201cAn intention does not constitute a final agency action, and thus is not fit for judicial review.\u201d), 4 (\u201cThis argument should be rejected for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under USCIT R. 12(b)(5).\u201d); Pakfood\u2019s Opposition at 8 (\u201cAd Hoc\u2019s complaint was never ripe for review\u201d). Although these arguments need not be addressed because Ad Hoc failed to exhaust its administrative remedies, Pakfood is correct that it is \u201cinappropriate for Ad Hoc to challenge that initial announcement now when Commerce already made a separate, final, superceding respondent selection methodology decision, which Ad Hoc has chosen not to challenge.\u201d Pakfood\u2019s Opposition at 10 (emphasis removed).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1942-8\"> Ad Hoc calls the selection of four respondents \u201ctroubling\u201d for facilitating the participation of Thai I-Mei.
