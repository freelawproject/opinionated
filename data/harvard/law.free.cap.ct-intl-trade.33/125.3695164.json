Plaintiff, a domestic producer of glycine, challenges the final determination of the U.S. International Trade Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) in the antidumping investigations of glycine from India, Japan, and Korea. <em>See Glycine From India, </em>USITC Pub. No. 3997, Inv.

USP grade glycine, which is used as a sweetener/taste enhancer or buffering agent primarily in pet food, animal feed, and antiperspirants, <em>id., </em>accounted for [\u00b6] ]] of reported U.S. shipments of subject imports from India, Japan, and Korea from 2005 through June 2007, <em>Glycine from India, Japan, and Korea, </em>Inv. Nos. 731-TA-1111-1113, at IV-10, Table IV-3 (ITC Dec. 2007) (final staff report to the Commission) (confidential version), available at App. in Supp. of Mem. of Law in Supp. of Rule 56.2 Req. for J. Upon the Agency R. (\u201cGEO\u2019s App.\u201d) Tab 3 <em>(\u201cConfidential Staff Report\u201d). </em>Pharmaceutical grade glycine is sold at a price <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>premium over USP grade glycine. <em>Final Japan &amp; Korea Determination </em>at 3-4. Technical grade glycine, which is used in industrial applications, is sold at a price discount to USP grade glycine. <em>Id. </em>Typically, glycine is sold as a commodity grade product, and domestic and imported glycine of the same grade are interchangeable. <em>Id. </em>at 9. The only domestic producers of glycine are GEO and Chattem Chemicals, Inc. (\u201cChattem\u201d). Id. at 3. GEO is the larger of the two.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">In March 2007, GEO filed a petition for the imposition of antidump-ing duties on glycine imports from India, Japan, and Korea. <em>Id. </em>at 3. After an investigation, the U.S. Department of Commerce determined that glycine imports from India, Japan, and Korea were being sold at less than fair value. <em>Notice of Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Glycine from India, </em>73 Fed. Reg. 16640, 16640 (Dep\u2019t Commerce Mar. 28, 2008); <em>Notice of Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value and Affirmative Final Determination of Critical Circumstances: Glycine from Japan, </em>72 Fed.

Reg. 67275, 67275 (Dep\u2019t Commerce Nov. 28, 2007). In January 2008, however, the Commission issued a final negative determination regarding glycine from Japan and Korea. <em>Glycine from Japan and Korea, </em>73 Fed. Reg. 3484, 3484 (ITC Jan. 18, 2008) (final determination). In May 2008, the Commission issued a final negative determination regarding glycine from India. <em>Glycine from India, </em>73 Fed. Reg. 26413, 26413 (ITC May 9, 2008) (final determination). The Commission determined that the domestic glycine industry was not materially injured by reason of imports from India, Japan, and Korea because although the volume of subject imports increased significantly, the imports did not significantly undersell, depress, or suppress prices for domestic glycine and did not have a significant adverse impact on the domestic industry. <em>Final Japan &amp; Korea Determination </em>at 17-22.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Commission found that the domestic industry\u2019s performance declined because purchasers decided to diversify suppliers after GEO and its predecessor experienced supply problems. <em>Id. </em>at 18, 21-22. The Commission further determined that the domestic glycine industry was not threatened with material injury by reason of the subject imports. <em>Id. </em>at 26. GEO challenges the negative determinations, claiming that the Commission\u2019s price, impact, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>threat of material injury determinations were not supported by substantial evidence and that the Commission applied the wrong causation standard. (GEO\u2019s Mem. of Law in Supp. of Rule 56.2 Req. for J. Upon the Agency R. (\u201cGEO\u2019s Br.\u201d) 6-39.)</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(c). The court must uphold a final determination by the Commission unless it is \u201cunsupported by substantial evidence on the record, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(l)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">I. Negative Material Injury Determination</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">GEO argues that the Commission\u2019s conclusion that the domestic glycine industry was not materially injured by reason of imports was unsupported by substantial evidence. (GEO\u2019s Br. 1-2.) In making a material injury determination, the Commission must consider: (1) the volume of subject imports, (2) the effect of subject imports on prices in the United States for domestic like products, and (3) \u201cthe impact of [subject] imports...on domestic like products, but only in the context of production operations within the United States.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(7)(B)(i). Here, the Commission found that the volume of subject imports increased significantly, but the domestic industry was not injured by reason of imports because the imports did not have a significant effect on prices of domestic glycine in the United States and did not have a significant adverse impact on the domestic industry. <em>Final Japan &amp; Korea Determination </em>at 17-22. GEO challenges the Commission\u2019s findings regarding the effect of the imports on domestic glycine prices, the impact of the imports, and causation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (GEO\u2019s Br. 7-31.) GEO\u2019s challenges fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">A. The effect of the imports on prices</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-10\">In evaluating the effect of imports ... on prices, the Commission shall consider whether\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-11\">(I) there has been significant price underselling by the imported merchandise as compared with the price of domestic like products of the United States, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-12\">(II) the effect of imports...otherwise depresses prices to a significant degree or prevents price increases...to a significant degree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(7)(C)(ii). The Commission determined that \u201c[s]ubject imports undersold the domestic like product in 35 of 42 comparisons,\u201d but found \u201cthis underselling not to be particularly significant\u201d because the price comparisons included data from Chattem, which did not attempt to compete with subject imports on price, and because the increase in subject imports was attributable to the domestic industry\u2019s inability to satisfy domestic demand reliably. <em>Final Japan &amp; Korea Determination </em>at 18. The Commission found that subject imports did not depress domestic glycine prices because prices increased overall during the period of investigation (\u201cPOI\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 19. The Commission found that subject imports did not suppress domestic glycine prices because the \u201c[u]nit cost of goods sold (\u201cCOGS\u201d) fluctuated over the [POI], and ended only somewhat higher in 2006 than in 2004,\u201d and the ratio of COGS to net sales decreased between 2004 and 2006, indicating that the domestic industry was not faced with a significant cost-price squeeze. <em>Id. </em>GEO challenges these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">\n<em>1. Chattem data</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">GEO argues that the Commission improperly discounted data showing that subject imports undersold Chattem\u2019s products. (GEO\u2019s Br. 12-16.) The Commission found that \u201csubject imports undersold Chattem by significant margins in every available quarterly comparison,\u201d but did not find the underselling significant because \u201cChattem concentrates on pharmaceutical grade glycine and, to the extent it sold glycine in competition with subject imports..., it did not attempt to compete on price.\u201d <em>Final Japan &amp; Korea Determination </em>at 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The Commission must \u201cexamine the domestic producers, as a whole, of the like product.\u201d <em>Timken Co. v. United States, </em>913 F. Supp. 580, 586 (CIT 1996). Here, the Commission analyzed the pricing data from both domestic glycine producers. <em>See Final Japan &amp; Korea Determination </em>at 17-18. Because GEO accounted for a larger proportion of domestic glycine production, <em>id. </em>at 6, the Commission\u2019s decision not to rely heavily on data indicating underselling of Chattem\u2019s products was reasonable, <em>cf. Tropicana Prods., Inc. v. United States, </em>484 F. Supp. 2d 1330, 1341-42 (CIT 2007) (holding that the Commission\u2019s decision to rely more heavily on data from domestic orange processors than from growers was reasonable). Additionally, Chat-tem primarily produces pharmaceutical grade glycine, <em>Final Japan &amp; Korea Determination </em>at 18, whereas few or none of the subject imports consisted of pharmaceutical grade glycine from 2004 through June 2007, <em>Confidential Staff Report </em>at IV-10, Table IV-3. Chattem ships only domestic USP grade and technical grade glycine to \u201cend users willing to pay higher unit values than are available for similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>product through imports\u201d or GEO. <em>Glycine from Japan and Korea, </em>Inv. Nos. 731-TA-1112-1113, at III \u2014 4 (ITC Dec. 2007) (final staff report to the Commission), <em>available at </em>http://hotdocs.usitc.gov/docs/ pubs/701_731/pub3980.pdf <em>(\u201cStaff Report\u201d). </em>Therefore, the Commission\u2019s decision to discount the underselling of Chattem because Chat-tem does not attempt to compete with subject imports on price was reasonable. <em>See Timken, </em>913 F. Supp. at 590 (holding that evidence of underselling is less significant where the domestic product has a price premium).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">\n<em>2. Importance of reliable supply</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">GEO also challenges the Commission\u2019s finding that underselling was not significant because U.S. purchasers sought subject imports to diversify their sources of supply after GEO and its predecessor, Hampshire Chemical Corporation, a subsidiary of DOW Chemicals, Inc. (\u201cHampshire/DOW\u201d),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> experienced supply problems. (GEO\u2019s Br. 18-23.) GEO argues that pervasive underselling prompted the increases in imports because glycine is a fungible commodity and purchasers also reported supply problems with imports.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Even in a commodity market, however, domestic supply problems may be significantly more responsible for increases in imports than underselling. <em>See Tropicana, </em>484 F. Supp. 2d at 1343-47. Here, U.S. purchasers reported significant supply problems from GEO and indicated that they increasingly purchased imports to diversify their sources and ensure a reliable supply.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Six purchasers reported allocations or delayed deliveries by GEO or Hampshire/DOW, and two purchasers reported that GEO or Hampshire/DOW broke supply con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>tracts. <em>Staff Report </em>at II \u2014 2 to -3. Because of GEO\u2019s supply problems, four purchasers had to slow or shut down production, and at least three purchasers had to buy imported glycine at higher prices. <em>Id. </em>at II-2. Additionally, U.S. glycine purchasers reported that reliability of supply was more important than lowest price.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at II-9, Table II-3. Although four purchasers reported allocations or delayed deliveries by foreign suppliers, and three purchasers reported that foreign suppliers broke contracts, <em>id. </em>at II-2 to -3, such evidence of foreign supply problems does not undermine the Commission\u2019s finding that U.S. purchasers attempted to diversity their sources of supply. Thus, while one could debate the relative importance of the sources of harm, substantial evidence supported the Commission\u2019s final conclusion that purchasers increased their imports because of GEO\u2019s unreliable supply, rather than underselling.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">\n<em>3. Data showing increased domestic prices</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">GEO contends that the Commission misleadingly used average unit values (\u201cAUVs\u201d) to determine that domestic glycine prices increased during the POI because AUVs are not appropriate where products of different grades have different prices. (GEO\u2019s Br. 16-18.) GEO further contends that the Commission should have relied on prices of USP grade glycine, which is more competitive with imports. <em>(Id.) </em>AUV data may not be reliable where prices are \u201cstrongly influenced by a few orders of particular grade or size.\u201d <em>Allegheny Ludlum Corp. v. United States, </em>287 F.3d 1365, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2002). There is no evidence, however, that a few aberrant orders significantly affected the AUVs, and here the Commission relied on both AUVs and the weighted-average prices of USP grade glycine to determine that domestic glycine prices increased overall.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See Final Japan &amp; Korea </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number><em>Determination </em>at 19 &amp; n.114 (citing <em>Confidential Staff Report </em>at Table C-l (AUV data); <em>id. </em>at Table V-2 (weighted-average product pricing data)). Accordingly, substantial evidence supported the Commission\u2019s finding that subject imports did not depress domestic glycine prices.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">\n<em>4. The negative price suppression determination</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">GEO argues that subject imports suppressed glycine prices because the ratio of COGS to net sales was poor, indicating that the domestic industry experienced a cost-price squeeze. (GEO\u2019s Br. 23.) GEO argues that the Commission\u2019s analysis did not account for the domestic producers\u2019 operating losses during the POI, the significant decrease in depreciation costs after Hampshire/DOW stopped depreciating its assets in 2005, or the impact of sharply rising demand in 2005. <em>(Id. </em>at 24-26.) These arguments are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">When the COGS \u201cexceeds price, the producer is unable to sell the product for more than what it costs to produce the product; if the producer is unable to raise prices, the industry finds itself in...a cost-price squeeze.\u201d <em>Nippon Steel Corp. v. United States, </em>458 F.3d 1345, 1354 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2006). The Commission found that unit COGS fluctuated between 2004 and interim 2007 and that the ratio of COGS to net sales decreased between 2004 and interim 2007.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Final Japan &amp; Korea Determination </em>at 19. The Commission \u201cthus [found] no consistent evidence that the industry is faced with a significant cost/price squeeze, and thus no consistent evidence [of] significant price suppression.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Although the record provides some evidence of a modest cost-price squeeze, the Commission could conclude that the price suppression caused by subject imports was not significant. \u201cSuch a determination does not mean that price... suppression was nonexistent; rather, the... suppressive effects of subject imports did not rise to an actionable level under the antidumping statute.\u201d <em>Nitrogen Solutions Fair Trade Comm. v. United States, </em>358 F. Supp. 2d 1314, 1326 (CIT 2005). The domestic industry faced operating losses during the POI, but those losses decreased overall.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Final Japan &amp; Korea Determination </em>at 21. Additionally, although the Commission\u2019s <em>Final Determination </em>did not mention that COGS decreased in 2005 partly because Hampshire/DOW stopped depreciating its assets in anticipation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>the transfer of its facility to GEO, <em>see id. </em>at 33 (Commissioners Williamson &amp; Pinkert, dissenting), the Commission calculated COGS based on the information provided by GEO, which could have estimated its own depreciation costs after acquiring the Hampshire/ DOW facility in November 2005.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Finally, GEO\u2019s argument that sharply rising demand in 2005 reduced costs by allowing more efficient production and higher capacity utilization (GEO\u2019s Br. 26 &amp; n.96) is consistent with the Commission\u2019s conclusion that the industry did not face a significant cost-price squeeze.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">B. The impact of the imports</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">GEO challenges the Commission\u2019s impact analysis, arguing that the Commission ignored evidence that imports caused lost sales and lost revenues for the domestic glycine industry. (GEO\u2019s Br. 27-28.) In examining the impact of subject imports on the domestic industry, the Commission must \u201cevaluate all relevant economic factors which have a bearing on the state of the industry in the United States,\u201d including lost sales and revenues.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(7)(C)(iii). Here, the Commission determined that subject imports did not cause GEO\u2019s problems, which were \u201cmostly self-inflicted,\u201d and that subject imports did not cause the lost sales and revenues that GEO alleged, \u201cas [\u00b6] ]]</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">of the allegations were confirmed.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Confidential Final Japan &amp; Korea Determination </em>at 34 n.140 (internal quotations and citation omitted). Substantial evidence therefore supported the Commission\u2019s determination that subject imports did not cause lost sales and lost revenue. In any event, \u201clost sales alone do not mandate an affirmative finding of injury; rather the Commission must determine whether lost sales, together with other factors, indicate a causal nexus between the imports at less than fair value and material injury to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>domestic industry.\u201d <em>Maverick Tube Corp. v. United States, </em>687 F. Supp. 1569, 1575 (CIT 1988). Because lost sales and other factors did not indicate such a causal nexus, <em>see Final Japan &amp; Korea Determination </em>at 22 &amp; n.140, the Commission\u2019s overall impact determination was substantially supported.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">C. Causation</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">GEO contends that the Commission applied the wrong causation standard. (GEO\u2019s Br. 29-30.) GEO asserts that because there are multiple potential causes of injury, the Commission should have analyzed whether the subject imports contributed to the U.S. industry\u2019s material injury in a legally significant way. (Id.) Contrary to GEO\u2019s assertion, the Commission applied the correct standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">The Commission must determine whether a domestic injury has suffered material injury \u201cby reason of\u2019 the subject imports. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673d(b)(l). The Commission must examine other possible causes of the injury, and the evidence must show \u201cthat the subject imports are causing the injury, not simply contributing to the injury in a tangential or minimal way.\u201d <em>Taiwan Semiconductors Indus. Ass\u2019n v. ITC, </em>266 F.3d 1339, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The subject imports, however, may only be a substantial factor and \u201cneed not be the sole or principal cause of injury.\u201d <em>Nippon Steel Corp. v. ITC, </em>345 F.3d 1379, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Here, the Commission concluded that \u201cthe subject imports are not contributing significantly to the domestic industry\u2019s poor financial condition\u201d and that \u201cthe record does not demonstrate the requisite causal nexus between the subject imports and the condition of the domestic industry.\u201d <em>Final Japan &amp; Korea Determination </em>at 22. After examining other possible causes of the domestic industry\u2019s condition, particularly GEO\u2019s supply problems, the Commission decided that the subject imports were not a substantial factor contributing to the domestic industry\u2019s condition. <em>Id. </em>at 21-22. The Commission did not reach a negative injury determination based on a finding that imports were a significant cause among other causes. It simply found that imports were not a significant cause. Such a causation analysis is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>II. Negative Threat of Material Injury Determination</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Finally, GEO challenges the Commission\u2019s determination that the domestic industry was not threatened with material injury by reason of subject imports. (GEO\u2019s Br. 31-39.) GEO claims that the Commission drew improper adverse inferences against the domestic industry when foreign producers did not submit complete data regarding such economic factors as their capacity, unused production capacity, and anticipated future exports, contrary to the Commission\u2019s usual practice of drawing adverse inferences against nonresponsive producers. <em>(Id. </em>at 32-33.) GEO further claims that substantial evidence did not support the Commission\u2019s conclusion that there would be only \u201csome\u201d increase in subject imports based on the. Commission\u2019s estimate of foreign producers\u2019 excess capacity.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>at 34- 39.) These claims also fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">In determining whether subject imports threaten the domestic industry with material injury, the Commission must consider relevant economic factors, including \u201cany existing unused production capacity or imminent, substantial increase in production capacity in the exporting country indicating the likelihood of substantially increased imports of the subject merchandise into the United States.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> 19 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(7)(F)(i)(II). Here, the Commission found that \u201cthe total exports to the United States projected by the Indian and Japanese producers combined will not exceed their combined volume of exports in 2006\u201d but concluded that \u201csome increase in the volume of subject imports...is likely\u201d because the Indian and Japanese industries have substantial unused capacity and are increasingly export-oriented. <em>Final Japan &amp; Korea Determination </em>at 24-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">The Commission did not draw any adverse inferences; the Commission merely made projections from the information available. Based on information from the responding Japanese producer andexport-ers,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> the Commission estimated the Japanese firms\u2019 capacities, expected future capacities, and anticipated future exports.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>See Confidential Staff Report </em>at VII-8, Table VII-4. Although the Commission never received any responses to Korean producer questionnaires, the Commission reasonably concluded \u201cbased on the available evidence\u201d that Korea Bio-Gen Co. Ltd., the principal Korean producer, has the capacity to export at least [\u00b6] ]] million pounds \u201cand likely also</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">has some unused capacity.\u201d <em>Confidential Final Japan &amp; Korea Determination </em>at 37 n.147. GEO concedes that Indian producers provided complete data.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> (GEO\u2019s Br. 32.) The Commission rejected the foreign producers\u2019 projections that imports would decrease. <em>See Final Japan &amp; Korea Determination </em>at 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">GEO\u2019s assertion that the Commission usually draws adverse inferences against non-responsive parties is incorrect. The Commission is not required to draw an adverse inference against a party who \u201chas failed to cooperate by not acting to the best of its ability to comply with a request for information,\u201d although it may do so. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(b).

No. 731-TA-1010, at n.96 (June 2003), <em>available at </em>2003 WL 21494593 (\u201cWhile the Commission has the discretion to take hdverse inferences against all of the non-responding Chinese producers, we have frequently stated that the ability to take adverse inferences does not relieve the Commission of its obligation to consider the record evidence as a whole in making its determination and to draw reasonable inferences from all the record evidence.\u201d). Unlike the Department of Commerce, which often draws adverse inferences against particular non-cooperative companies when calculating dumping margins, <em>see, e.g., Notice of Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value and Affirmative Final Determination of Critical Circumstances: Glycine from Japan, </em>72 Fed. Reg. at 67272; <em>Notice of Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Glycine from the Republic of Korea, </em>72 Fed.
