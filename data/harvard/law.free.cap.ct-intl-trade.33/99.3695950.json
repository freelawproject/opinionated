(\u201cGallant\u201d) appears before the court on its Motion for Judgment Upon the Agency Record pursuant to USCIT Rule 56.2, challenging an aspect of the United States Department of Commerce\u2019s (\u201cCommerce\u201d or \u201cDepartment\u201d) findings in <em>Certain Frozen Warmwater Shrimp from Thailand: Final Results and Final Partial Rescission of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, </em>72 Fed. Reg. 52,065 (September 12, 2007) <em>{\u201cFinal Results\u201d). </em>This court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(c). Because Commerce\u2019s determination was supported by substantial evidence and in accordance with law, it is sustained and judgment is entered for the Defendant United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-16\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b121-17\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b121-18\">In April 2006, Commerce initiated the administrative review of the antidumping duty order on certain frozen warmwater shrimp.from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>Thailand for 145 companies. <em>Notice of Initiation of Administrative Reviews of the Antidumping Duty Orders on Certain Frozen Warm-water Shrimp from Brazil, Ecuador, India and Thailand, </em>71 Fed. Reg. 17,819 (April 7, 2006). The period of review was August 4, 2004 to January 31, 2006. <em>Id. </em>Commerce asked Gallant, and all other companies for which a review was requested, to submit a quantity and value (\u201cQ&amp;V\u201d) questionnaire, available on Commerce\u2019s website, on or before April 28, 2006. <em>Id. </em>at 17, 829. Thirty-two companies including Gallant did not timely respond. <em>Certain Frozen Warmwater Shrimp From Thailand: Preliminary Results and Partial Rescission of Anti-Dumping Duty Administrative Review, </em>72 Fed. Reg. 10,669, 10,673 (March 9, 2007) <em>(\u201cPreliminary Results\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">Commerce provided the unresponsive comp\u00e1nies with a second opportunity in May 2006. <em>Id. </em>Commerce informed them in correspondence that a \u201cfailure to respond to this questionnaire may result in the Department\u2019s deeming your company uncooperative in this proceeding. In such case, the Department may assign your company an antidumping duty margin using adverse inferences in accordance with\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(b). Letter from Shawn Thompson, Program Manager, Office 2, AD/CVD Operations, U.S. Department of Commerce, to Representatives of Non-Cooperating Companies (\u201cTo Whom it May Concern\u201d), Re: 2004-2006 Administrative Review of the Anti-dumping Duty Order on Certain Frozen Warmwater Shrimp from Thailand (May 11, 2006), Public Record (\u201cP.R.\u201d) 144. Six companies including Gallant did not timely respond to this subsequent request. <em>Preliminary Results, </em>72 Fed. Reg. at 10,673.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">On March 9, 2007, Commerce found that the unresponsive companies \u201cwithheld requested information and significantly impeded the proceeding.\u201d <em>Preliminary Results, </em>72 Fed. Reg. at 10,673. Commerce preliminarily determined that these companies, including Gallant, \u201cdid not act to the best of their abilities... because they failed to respond to the Department\u2019s requests for information. Therefore, an adverse inference is warranted in selecting from the facts otherwise available with respect to the companies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(b), Commerce selected an adverse facts available (\u201cAFA\u201d) an-tidumping margin for the unresponsive companies. <em>Id. </em>The Department \u201cpreliminarily assigned a rate of 57.64 percent, which is the highest rate alleged in the petition, as adjusted at the initiation of the less-than-fair value (LTFV) investigation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Commerce set forth its rationale for selecting the petition margin to be the AFA rate in the <em>Preliminary Results. </em>Because this rate relied upon secondary evidence, it had to be reasonably corroborated. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(c). Commerce explained its corroboration as having compared the petition margin to the transaction-specific margins <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>calculated for the three mandatory respondent companies: Good Luck Product Co., Ltd. (\u201cGood Luck Product\u201d), Thai I-Mei Frozen Foods Co., Ltd. (\u201cThai I-Mei\u201d), and Pakfood Public Company Limited and its affiliated subsidiaries (collectively \u201cPakfood\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Preliminary Results, </em>72 Fed. Reg. at 10,669-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">Commerce preliminarily found the 57.64 percent petition rate to be \u201creliable and relevant because the petition rate fell within the range of individual transaction margins calculated for the mandatory respondents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10,673. Commerce explained that both Good Luck Product and Pakfood had multiple transactions with margins higher than the petition rate, although Commerce did exclude one Thai I-Mei margin higher than 57.64 percent for being aberrational. Memorandum from Brianne Riker, Analyst, Office 2, AD/CVD Operations, U.S. Department of Commerce, to The File through Shawn Thompson, Program Manager, Office 2, AD/CVD Operations, Re: Corroboration of Adverse Facts Available for the Preliminary Results in the 2004-2006 Administrative Review of Certain Frozen Warmwater Shrimp from Thailand (February 28, 2007), P.R. 475, Confidential Record (\u201cC.R.\u201d) 134 (\u201cPreliminary AFA Corroboration Memo.\u201d), at 1. The Department further found that the 57.64 percent petition margin was \u201csufficiently adverse so as to induce cooperation\u201d and stated an inability \u201cto find any information that would discredit the selected AFA rate.\u201d <em>Preliminary Results, </em>72 Fed. Reg. at 10,673-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">On March 27, 2007, Gallant submitted a completed Q&amp;V questionnaire to Commerce. <em>Final Results, </em>72 Fed. Reg. at 52,066. Commerce rejected this questionnaire as untimely pursuant to 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.302 and returned it to Gallant on April 2, 2007. <em>Id.; </em>Letter from James Maeder, Director, Office 2, Office of AD/CVD Operations, U.S. Department of Commerce, to Robert Gosselink, Trade Pacific PLLC, Re: Antidumping Duty Administrative Review on Certain Frozen Warmwater Shrimp from Thailand (April 2, 2007), P.R. 495. Gallant thereafter requested that Commerce not apply the petition margin as the AFA rate. <em>See </em>Gallant Ocean (Thailand) Co., Ltd. Corroboration Case Brief (April 16, 2007), at 1-2, C.R. 143. Gallant contended that Commerce erred in its preliminary formulation by: employing transaction specific margins that were aberrational, reviewing sales from the mandatory respondent companies that did not corroborate the 57.64 percent AFA rate, and selecting sales for comparison that were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>atypical. <em>Id. </em>at 2-4. According to Gallant, the sales that Commerce used did not represent normal transactions of Good Luck Product, Thai I-Mei and Pakfood because of their product type, sale quantities, or costs. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b124-3\">On September 12, 2007, Commerce published its final determination formally assigning the 57.64 percent AFA rate to Gallant and the other non-cooperating companies. <em>Final Results, </em>72 Fed. Reg. at 52,068. Commerce reiterated its preliminary findings that: Gallant had not acted to the best of its ability, an adverse inference was warranted in selecting facts otherwise available, 57.64 percent was the highest margin alleged in the petition as adjusted, and the AFA rate was sufficiently adverse to induce cooperation. <em>Id. </em>In addition to its initial efforts to corroborate the 57.64 percent petition rate, Commerce undertook additional corroboration in support of the <em>Final Results. Id. </em>at 52,068; Memorandum from Stephen J. Claeys, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, to David M. Spooner, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Re: Issues and Decision Memorandum for the Antidumping Duty Administrative Review on Certain Frozen Warmwater Shrimp from Thailand - August 2004, through January 31, 2006 (September 5, 2007), P.R. 532 <em>{\u201cFinal Decision Memo.\u201d) </em>cmt. 2, at 8-9, n.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Prior to formalizing the 57.64 percent AFA rate, Commerce concluded that the petition margin was sufficiently corroborated. <em>Id. </em>cmt. 2, at 8. Commerce stated that the \u201cmargin falls within the range of transaction-specific margins calculated for the mandatory respondents\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 6; Memorandum from Brianne Riker, Analyst, Office 2, AD/CVD Operations, U.S. Department of Commerce, to The File through Shawn Thompson, Program Manager, Office 2, AD/CVD Operations, Re: Final Results of the 2004-2006 Review of Certain Frozen Warmwater Shrimp from Thailand: Corroboration Analysis (September 5, 2007), C.R. 152, P.R. 535 (\u201cFinal Corroboration Analysis\u201d), at 1. The Department determined that the volumes of the transactions it examined were neither atypical nor had an aberrational effect on the margin calculations. <em>Id. </em>at 2. Commerce explained that that the AFA rate was based on both representative transactions and official United States import statistics. <em>Final Decision Memo, </em>cmt, 2 at 8-9. Dissatisfied with the 57.64 percent AFA rate, Gallant timely initiated the present challenge to that aspect of the <em>Final Results.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">This court will uphold an administrative antidumping determination unless it is \u201cunsupported by substantial evidence on the record, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d <em>SKF United States v. INA Walzlager Schaeffler KG, </em>180 F.3d 1370, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (quoting 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(l)(B)(i)). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Aimcor, Ala. Silicon, Inc. v. United States, </em>154 F.3d 1375, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (quoting <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. United States, </em>750 F.2d 927, 933 (Fed. Cir. 1984)). \u201cThe possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Consolo v. Fed. Mar. Comm\u2019n, </em>383 U.S. 607, 620, 86 S. Ct. 1018, 16 L. Ed. 2d 131 (1966). In determining the existence of substantial evidence, a reviewing court must consider \u201cthe record as a whole, including evidence that supports as well as evidence that \u2018fairly detracts from the substantiality of the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Huaiyin Foreign Trade Corp. (30) v. United States, </em>322 F.3d 1369, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (quoting <em>Atl. Sugar, Ltd. v. United States, </em>744 F.2d 1556, 1562 (Fed. Cir. 1984)). While the court must consider contradictory evidence, \u201cthe substantial evidence test does not require that there be an absence of evidence detracting from the agency\u2019s conclusion, nor is there an absence of substantial evidence simply because the reviewing court would have reached a different conclusion based on the same record.\u201d <em>Cleo Inc. v. United States, </em>501 F.3d 1291, 1296 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (citing <em>Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 487-88, 71 S. Ct. 456, 95 L. Ed. 456 (1951)).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">When evaluating Commerce\u2019s statutory interpretation the court uses a two step analysis, first examining whether Congress has \u201cdirectly spoken to the precise question at issue.\u201d <em>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 842, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1984). If this is the case, courts then must \u201cgive effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 842-43; <em>see Household Credit Servs. v. Pfennig, </em>541 U.S. 232, 239, 124 S. Ct. 1741, 158 L. Ed. 2d 450 (2004). If instead Congress has left a \u201cgap\u201d for Commerce to fill, the agency\u2019s regulation is \u201cgiven controlling weight unless [it is] arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute.\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843-44. Additionally, in matters of statutory construction this court will show \u201cgreat deference to the interpretation given the statute by the officers or agency charged with its administration.\u201d <em>Udall v. Tallman, </em>380 U.S. 1, 16, 85 S. Ct. 792, 13 L. Ed. 2d 616 (1965). The agency\u2019s construction need not be the only reasonable one or even the same result this court would have reached had the question arisen in the first instance in a judicial proceeding. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Unemployment Comp. Comm\u2019n of Alaska v. Aragon, </em>329 U.S. 143, 153, 67 S. Ct. 245, 91 L. Ed. 136 (1946)). It is not the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>duty to \u201cweigh the wisdom of, or to resolve any struggle between, competing views of the policy interest, but rather to respect legitimate policy choices made by the agency in interpreting and applying the statute.\u201d <em>Suramericana de Aleaciones Laminadas, C.A. v. United States, </em>966 F.2d 660, 665 (Fed. Cir. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">\n<em>Overview Of The AFA Statute</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">Commerce is entitled to make adverse inferences in its antidump-ing duty investigation when it determines that an interested party has \u201cfailed to cooperate by not acting to the best of its ability to comply with a request for information.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(b). The AFA rate may be generated using information from: \u201c(1) the petition, (2) a final determination in the investigation..., (3) any previous review..., or (4) any other information placed on the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Department selects a proxy rate that represents a \u201creasonably accurate estimate of the respondent\u2019s actual rate, albeit with some built-in increase intended as a deterrent to non-compliance.\u201d <em>F. Lii De Cecco Di Filippo Fara S. Martino S.p.A. v. Borden, Inc., </em>216 F.3d 1027, 1032 (Fed. Cir. 2000) <em>(\u201cDe Ceceo\u201d). </em>Commerce is afforded extraordinary but not unlimited deference in formulating this AFA rate, as the Federal Circuit explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-9\">In the case of uncooperative respondents, the discretion granted by the statute appears to be particularly great.... [T]his court has repeatedly held that Commerce\u2019s special expertise makes it the \u201cmaster\u201d of the anti-dumping law, entitling its decisions to great deference from the courts. Thus, factual determinations supporting anti-dumping margins are best left to the agency\u2019s expertise.... Commerce is in the best position, based on its expert knowledge of the market and the individual respondent, to select adverse facts that will create the proper deterrent to noncooperation with its investigations and assure a reasonable margin. Commerce\u2019s discretion in these matters, however, is not unbounded.... [T]he purpose of section 1677e(b) is to provide respondents with an incentive to cooperate, not to impose punitive, aberrational, or uncorroborated margins.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 1032 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">In formulating an AFA rate using secondary information, Commerce must, \u201cto the extent practicable, corroborate that information from independent sources that are reasonably at [its] disposal.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(c). \u201cThe statute does not prescribe any methodology <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>for corroborating secondary information.\u201d <em>Mittal Steel Galati S.A. v. United States, </em>491 F. Supp. 2d 1273, 1278 (CIT 2007). Legislative history and implementing regulations provide that such information is to have \u201cprobative value.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1275 (citing Uruguay Round Agreements Act Statement of Administrative Action, H.R.

No. 103-316, at 870 (1994), <em>reprinted in </em>1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4040, 4199 (\u201cSAA\u201d)); 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.308(d). \u201cCommerce assesses the probative value of secondary information by examining the reliability and relevance of the information to be used.\u201d <em>Mittal Steel, </em>491 F.

Commerce may in its corroboration examine: \u201cpublished price lists, official import statistics and customs data, and information obtained from parties during the instant investigation or review.\u201d SAA at 870,1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 4199; 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.308(d). \u201cCommerce\u2019s determination of [AFA] rates must be legal, reasonable, and supported by evidence, but is unfettered by absolute numerical limitations.\u201d <em>Universal Polybag Co., Ltd. v.

As it explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-7\">Gallant Ocean does not dispute that it should have responded to the Commerce Department\u2019s request for Q&amp;V data and that it is appropriate for Gallant Ocean\u2019s rate to be based on adverse facts available. The record shows, however, that in the <em>Final Results, </em>the transaction-specific margins for the mandatory respondents that Commerce attempted to use to corroborate the petition were aberrational, punitively high, and did not reflect the margins of the mandatory respondents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Gallant Ocean\u2019s Motion for Judgment Upon the Agency Record (\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Motion\u201d) at 5. \u201cBy failing to adequately corroborate\u201d the 57.64 percent AFA rate, Gallant contends that \u201cCommerce ignored the judicial mandate that the AFA rate have a rational relationship to commercial practices in the particular industry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7. Gallant argues that \u201cCommerce focused its analysis on whether information showed that the AFA margin it selected had been discredited rather than sufficiently questioning whether the sales used for corroboration purposes were \u2018normal,\u2019 representative sales.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15 (emphasis removed). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>Defendant counters that the 57.64 percent AFA rate is supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">\n<em>The AFA Rate Is Supported By Substantial Evidence And Is In Accordance With Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">Commerce Acted In Accordance With Law</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">Commerce lawfully assigned an AFA rate to Gallant.

Moreover, it is simply not relevant. Gallant concedes that it failed to timely submit the requested information, Plaintiff\u2019s Motion at 5, thereby triggering the application of an AFA rate pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(a)(2)(A), (b).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Once Commerce properly determines that a respondent is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>uncooperative, it need not factor the circumstances in formulating an AFArate. <em>See Heveafil Sdn.

[Tjhere is no established formula requiring less adverse margins when respondents have been partially cooperative.\u201d). Similarly, Gallant\u2019s position that \u201cit had absolutely nothing to gain from its own lack of cooperation\u201d, Plaintiff\u2019s Reply at 14,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> is both unsupported in the record and irrelevant in the formulation of an AFA rate for a non-cooperating respondent.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The 57.64 Percent AFA Rate Is Supported by Substantial Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Commerce formulated the AFArate by selecting the highest margin alleged in the petition, as adjusted. <em>Preliminary Results, </em>72 Fed.

Gallant alleges that Commerce improperly selected the 57.64 percent petition margin based upon an absence of information to discredit the rate. Plaintiff\u2019s Motion at 15. The Department acknowledges initially taking this approach. <em>Preliminary Results, </em>72 Fed. Reg. at 10,674; <em>Final Decision Memo. </em>cmt. 2, at 8. Commerce may begin its AFArate selection by ascertaining whether the petition margin is discredited, provided that the rate is ultimately supported by substantial evidence. This starting point is appropriate where Commerce has incomplete information due to non-compliance. <em>See Shanghai Taoen Int'l Trading Co., Ltd. v. United States, </em>29 CIT 189, 199, 360 F.

Plaintiff\u2019s Reply at 10-13 (citing <em>Ta Chen Stainless Steel Pipe, Inc. v. United States, </em>24 CIT 841, 846 (2000)). The court does not agree that <em>Ta Chen </em>is distinguishable on this basis and instead finds the precedent applicable to AFA rate corroboration using actual sales data, irrespective of whether those transactions involve the plaintiff or secondary information under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(c). <em>See Ta Chen, </em>298 F.3d at 1339-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">Commerce sufficiently corroborated the 57.64 percent AFA rate. The statute qualifies the obligation as \u201cto the extent practical\u201d, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7' 1677e(c); \u201cthe corroboration requirement itself is not mandatory when not feasible.\u201d <em>NSK, </em>28 CIT at 1561-62. After comparing the rate to industry statistics, Commerce concluded that the petition margin \u201cwas not based on a unique or unusual set of circumstances that would render it unrepresentative of the experience of a typical shrimp importer from Thailand.\u201d <em>Final Decision Memo. </em>cmt. 2 at 8. Commerce thereby \u201cassure [d] itself that the margin it applie[d] is relevant, and not outdated, or lacking a rational relationship to\u201d Gallant. <em>Ferro Union, Inc. v.

The AFA rate was therefore not selected solely and impermissibly for punitive purposes as Gallant alleges. <em>See </em>Plaintiff\u2019s Motion at 7. \u201cWhile Commerce may have chosen the... rate with <em>an </em>eye toward deterrence, Commerce acts within its discretion so long as the rate chosen has a relationship to the actual sales information available.\u201d <em>Ta Chen, </em>298 F.3d at 1340.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Gallant contends that Commerce erred in failing to corroborate the AFA rate \u201cwith representative margins of the mandatory respondents.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s Motion at 13. Gallant emphasizes that the nineteen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>transaction-specific margins used comprise only [\u00b6] a very small percentage ]] of all sales reported by Good Luck Product, Thai I-Mei<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and Pakfood for the review period. <em>Id. </em>at 12. Gallant argues that because this fraction does not \u201crepresent a significant portion of the transactions that occurred during the period of review,\u201d the sales within range of the petition rate should be disregarded as \u201chigh-margin transactions [that] are the exception rather than the rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10-11 (quoting <em>PAM, S.p.A. v. United States, </em>495 F. Supp. 2d 1360, 1371-72 (CIT 2007) (citations omitted) (emphasis removed)). However, this court recently sustained an AFA margin based upon actual sales of cooperating respondents being \u201cin a range above and near the AFA rate chosen,\u201d notwithstanding an argument that the \u201clow number\u201d of these transactions constituted \u201cevidence of its unreliability.\u201d <em>Universal Polybag, </em>577 F.

The Department concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-5\">Good Luck Product and Pakfood reported multiple U.S. sales transactions with volumes in the same range or smaller than the transactions used in the corroboration analysis.... Therefore, we do not find that the quantities in question are unusually smaller or atypical.

Gallant claims that they [\u00b6] are priced differently ]] and therefore should not be used for AFA rate corroboration purposes. <em>Id. </em>Commerce initially excluded [\u00b6] Product A ]] based on the absence of a reasonable methodology to include such sales, but expressed an expectation to reexamine the issue. <em>Notice of Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value and Negative Final Determination of Critical Circumstances: Certain Frozen and Canned Warmwater Shrimp From Thailand, </em>69 Fed. Reg. 76,918 (December 23, 2004), attached Issues and Decision Memorandum for the Antidumping Duty Investigation of Certain Frozen and Canned Warmwater Shrimp from Thailand cmt. 4. Commerce subsequently stated that it would use Pakfood\u2019s sales of [\u00b6] Product A ]] for comparison purposes, <em>(Preliminary Results,12 </em>Fed. Reg. at 10,674), despite the merchandise not being identical.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Inclusion of Pakfood\u2019s sales of [\u00b6] Product A]] does not detract from the substantial evidence supporting the 57.64 percent AFA rate. Commerce addressed this concern by referencing the absence of evidence to indicate such sales being under-representative and emphasizing that it \u201cdid not rely solely on margins calculated for Pakfood,\u201d but those of the other mandatory respondents that Gallant did not allege were of \u201cunusual merchandise\u201d. <em>Final Decision Memo. </em>cmt. 2 at 9. Gallant concedes that [\u00b6] Product A is included within the scope of the order ]]. Plaintiff\u2019s Motion at 16. More compelling, however, is Commerce\u2019s specific matching in advance of the <em>Final Results, </em>of the merchandise types. <em>Preliminary Results, </em>72 Fed. Reg. at 10,674.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Commerce does not need to replicate the precise business activities of a non-cooperating respondent in formulating the AFA rate. <em>See Nat\u2019l Candle Ass\u2019n v. United States, </em>29 CIT 365, 372, 366 F. Supp. 2d 1318 (2005) (Commerce not required \u201cto apply product-specific margins\u201d); <em>Reiner Brach GMBH &amp; Co. KG v.

Therefore, Commerce did not err in corroborating the AFA rate with either the Pakfood margins involving [\u00b6] Product A ]] or the one other Pakfood transaction and two Good Luck Product sales that consisted of [\u00b6] Product B ]]. As with [\u00b6] Product A ]], the antidumping order scope encompasses [\u00b6] Product B ]]. <em>Preliminary Results, </em>72 Fed. Reg. at 10,671-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Gallant acknowledges that Commerce responded to some of the concerns raised during the administrative process. Plaintiff\u2019s Motion at 6. Gallant contends that the Department improperly ignored a specific challenge to four Pakfood transactions of shrimp sold in one-pound bags. <em>Id. </em>at 17; Plaintiff\u2019s Reply at 9. Gallant believes that these four sales had unusually high normal values, as it claims to be demonstrated by them having the highest total costs of any of Pak-food\u2019s products sold during the period of review. <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, Commerce analyzed every Pakfood transaction and found each to be sufficiently representative in advance of the <em>Final Results. </em>Final Corroboration Analysis at 2, and Attachments 1, 3. Even if the one-pound bag sales are not used for corroboration, the fifteen remaining margins comprise substantial evidence supporting the 57.64 percent AFA rate in accordance with <em>Ta Chen. </em>For these reasons, despite Commerce\u2019s failure to directly address Gallant\u2019s one-pound bag argument, the selection of the petition margin as the AFA rate is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Gallant attempts to discredit the 57.64 percent AFA rate with reliance on the 4.31 percent rate that Commerce calculated for the cooperating selected respondents. Plaintiff\u2019s Motion at 21-22 (citing <em>Final Results, </em>72 Fed. Reg. at 52,069). However, the margin ultimately applied to the cooperating respondents does not cast doubt upon an AFA rate that is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Universal Polybag, </em>577 F. Supp. 2d at 1298-1301 (rejecting argument based on a \u201clarge gap between the petition rate and the dumping margin calculated by Commerce for any cooperative respondents\u201d (citation omitted)). Moreover, the Federal Circuit upheld an AFA rate where the corroborative data reflects actual sales as opposed to the rate ultimately imposed for cooperating respondents. <em>See Ta Chen, </em>298 F.3d at 1340.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Gallant also attempts to support its position with reference to the overall dumping margins for the mandatory respondents ranging between 2.58 and 10.75 percent. Plaintiff\u2019s Motion at 10-11 (citing <em>Final Results, </em>72 Fed. Reg. at 52,069). Gallant claims that, \u201cWherefore, it is apparent that any transaction margins higher than (or slightly lower) than 57.64 percent are aberrant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10-11. However, as Defendant observes, necessarily \u201cthere will be sales above <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>and below the average.\u201d Defendant\u2019s Opposition at 12. Furthermore, Gallant\u2019s position would give companies having transactions above the range of the mandatory respondents a disincentive to cooperate with Commerce so that they can obtain the benefit of a lower margin.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">Gallant proposes alternate approaches that it believes Commerce should have employed in formulating the AFA rate. Gallant suggests that Commerce articulate both the criteria for determining why margins are excluded and its application to each transaction-specific margin in the corroboration analysis.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Plaintiff\u2019s Motion at 20. Gallant details methodologies it believes to be appropriate. <em>See id. </em>at 20-22 (the highest margin within a band that represents at least ten percent of the margins);<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Plaintiff\u2019s Reply at 5-6 (the highest margin within one standard deviation of the mean). However, because of Gallant\u2019s \u201cnoncooperation,\u201d it \u201ccannot pick and choose which rate it feels would be more appropriate in the circumstance.\u201d <em>NSK, </em>28 CIT at 1562.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Gallant hindered Commerce\u2019s antidumping investigation by failing to timely submit the Q&amp;V questionnaire and was warned about the consequences of non-compliance. \u201cUltimately, respondents have the responsibility of creating an adequate record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1558. AFA \u201ccases operate in a world of less-than-perfect information.\u201d <em>PAM, S.p.A. v. United States, </em>577 F.

Commerce need not speculate as to the actual rate had the respondent cooperated. <em>See </em>SAA at 870, 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 4199.
