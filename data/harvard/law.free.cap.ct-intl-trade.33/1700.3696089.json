Specifically, Plaintiffs contest the Commission\u2019s treatment of the relevant domestic industry; its decision to include the entire class of subject imports within its threat analysis; its determination regarding the likelihood of increase in German LWTP imports; its likely price effect determination; and its determination with respect to the vulnerability of the domestic industry. After describing the Commission\u2019s determinations and reasoning and explaining the relevant standard of review, the court will discuss each challenge in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1724-4\">\n<em>B. Commission Determinations and Reasoning</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1724-5\">LWTP is paper with a thermal active coating which, when used in printers containing thermal print heads, reacts to heat to form images on paper. <em>Comm\u2019n Views </em>at 5. This type of paper \u201cis typically (but not exclusively) used in point-of-sale applications such as ATM receipts, credit card receipts, gas pump receipts, and retail store receipts.\u201d <em>Commerce Final Determination, </em>73 Fed. Reg. at 57,327. Commerce\u2019s definition of the scope of imported merchandise under investigation included both \u201cjumbo\u201d rolls, a semi finished version of the product, and \u201cslit\u201d rolls, the end-use product. <em>See Commerce Final Determination, </em>73 Fed. Reg. at 57,327 n.5; <em>Comm\u2019n Views </em>at 5. Producers of jumbo rolls are referred to as \u201ccoaters,\u201d whereas producers who subsequently convert the jumbo rolls into slit rolls are referred to as \u201cconverters.\u201d <em>See Comm\u2019n Views </em>at 5-8. Koehler and Plaintiff-Intervenors are coaters who accounted for all imports of LWTP from Germany subject to the investigation at issue in this case. <em>Id. </em>at 3. Appleton is one of the two domestic coaters of LWTP. <em>Id. </em>at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b1724-6\">Most LWTP is sold in the United States in basis weights of either 48 grams per square meter (\u201c48 gram\u201d) or 55 grams per square meter (\u201c55 gram\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 16. During the POI, the Commission found that domestic coaters\u2019 shipments of 55 gram LWTP far exceeded their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1703\">*1703</page-number>shipments of 48 gram LWTP, <em>id.; </em>in fact, \u201cdomestic industry did not produce comparable 48 gram jumbo rolls for the vast majority of the period of investigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30. Appleton introduced a 48 gram product in 2007, which became available in the fall of that year. <em>Id. </em>At the same time, the quantity of shipments to the United States of 55 gram LWTP from Germany declined during the POI, while the quantity of shipments of 48 gram LWTP increased. <em>Id. </em>at 16-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b1725-4\">The Commission determined that subject imports of 55 gram LWTP from Germany generally oversold the domestic like product, <em>see id. </em>at 32, while subject imports of 48 gram LWTP from Germany generally undersold the domestic like product. <em>See id.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Nevertheless, the Commission found that sales of 48 gram LWTP from Germany \u201ccould not have taken significant sales or revenues from domestically produced 48 gram jumbo rolls throughout 2007, because Appleton did not offer such products during much of the year and [the other domestic coater] did not offer a competitive [] product.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b1725-5\">Although the Commission determined that \u201c[ojverall domestic industry financial performance declined from 2005 to 2007,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 35, it did not \u201cattribute the declines in 2007 financial performance to the increased quantities of subject imports from Germany, 0 because the subject imports from Germany increased at a time of rising demand, did not capture significant additional market share, and did not have significant adverse price effects.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted). The Commission found that \u201cthe increase in subject imports from Germany involved [48 gram jumbo rolls, which were] types of products not consistently offered by the domestic industry, although by interim 2008 the domestic industry was increasingly selling 48 gram jumbo rolls.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30-31 (footnote omitted). Accordingly, the Commission \u201cconclude[d] that the subject imports from Germany did not have a significant adverse impact on the domestic industry as a whole during the [POI].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 36 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1725-6\">Nevertheless, the Commission determined that a threat of material injury did exist to the domestic industry by reason of the subject LWTP imports from Germany. <em>Comm\u2019n Final Determination, </em>73 Fed. Reg. at 70,367; <em>but see Comm\u2019n Views </em>at 36 n.236 (noting that \u201cChairman Aranoff, Vice Chairman Pearson, and Commissioner Okun have made negative determinations on Germany and do not join the [threat of material injury portion] of this opinion\u201d (citation omitted)). Specifically, the Commission found that \u201ca continuation of the gradual increase in subject import volumes from Germany that oc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1704\">*1704</page-number>curred during the [POI] is likely in the imminent future,\u201d <em>Comm\u2019n Views </em>at 36, noting that \u201c[wjhile the German producers did not add any new LWTP production facilities during this period, they were able to increase capacity through a combination of achieving greater efficiencies and using capacity previously devoted to producing other products to produce LWTP instead,\u201d <em>id. </em>(citations omitted), and that \u201c[t]he record contains no indication that the German producers cannot continue to increase capacity through such means in the imminent future.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1726-4\">Further, the Commission found that \u201c[a]s the German producers\u2019 capacity and shipments increased during the [POI], their exports to the United States increased roughly commensurately,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 37, and that this was \u201clikely to continue in the imminent future,\u201d id., because \u201c[t]he United States was a significant export market for the German producers during the [POI], and the German producers project[ed] it [would] remain so in the imminent future.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). The Commission noted that Koehler planned to open a new coating facility in the United States that would not become operational until 2010, and that this \u201cprovide[d] a further incentive for Koehler, [a significant<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] exporter of subject merchandise from Germany, to continue to increase its presence in the U.S. market in the imminent future while its projected U.S. facility is being planned and constructed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and footnote omitted).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1726-5\">Finally, the Commission determined that these \u201cincreased subject imports from Germany that are likely in the imminent future will have greater price effects than those observed during the [POI].\u201d <em>Id. </em>It noted that \u201cseveral considerations indicate that imports entering in the imminent future will be heavily concentrated in the 48 gram product,\u201d <em>id.,</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and that, due to Appleton\u2019s recent construction of a new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1705\">*1705</page-number>facility<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and introduction of its own 48 gram product, \u201c48 gram jumbo rolls will increasingly be the focus of competition between [the like domestic product and the subject imports from Germany].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 38. Accordingly, the Commission concluded that \u201cthe [sales data for] German 48 gram jumbo rolls observed during the [POI] [<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>] will have far greater significance in the imminent future.\u201d <em>Id.; see also id. </em>(\u201cBecause the record contains no evidence that the [trend] observed during the [POI] with respect to [48 gram LWTP] is likely to change, we conclude that it will likely continue in the imminent future.\u201d) (footnote omitted). So too the Commission found the domestic industry \u201cvulnerable to the effects of additional subject imports,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 3.9, because of the \u201cconsistently unprofitable financial performance of the domestic industry during the [POI].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1727-4\">In determining the relevant domestic industry, in addition to jumbo roll coaters, the Commission also included converters within the scope of that domestic industry. <em>Id. </em>at 8. The Commission received questionnaire responses from twenty domestic converters, estimated to account for 62.1 percent of domestic LWTP conversion activities during the relevant period. <em>Id. </em>at 15. The Commission noted that while both of the two domestic coaters supported the petition for the imposition of an antidumping duty order, twelve out of twenty converters opposed the imposition of duties, and only three of these twenty supported the petition with respect to Germany. <em>Id. </em>at 39 n.261. The Commission explained, however, that \u201c[t]his is not especially surprising, insofar as the subject producers supply, and do not compete with, the U.S. converters,\u201d <em>id., </em>and that, \u201c[i]n any event, the positions of domestic producers in support or opposition to the petition doO not override [the Commission\u2019s] review of the trade, pricing, financial data, and other information in the record indicating whether the domestic industry is materially injured or threatened with material injury by reason of the subject imports.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Certain Orange Juice from Brazil, </em>USITC Pub. 3930, Inv. No. 731-TA-1089 (Final) (Remand) (June 2007) at 14).</p>\n<p id=\"b1727-5\">Standard Of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b1727-6\">Where, as here, an action is brought under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(a)(2) seeking review of a final determination of the Commission under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673d, \u201c[t]he court shall hold unlawful any determination, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1706\">*1706</page-number>finding, or conclusion found ... to be unsupported by substantial evidence on the record, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(l)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b1728-4\">The substantial evidence standard of review \u201ccan be translated roughly to mean \u2018is [the determination] unreasonable?\u201d\u2019 <em>Nippon Steel Corp. v.

The agency\u2019s decision must be supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole, <em>see generally Gerald Metals, Inc. v. United States, </em>132 F.3d 716 (Fed.

Thus, where only one reasonable conclusion can be drawn from the record, a determination contrary to that conclusion cannot be supported by substantial evidence. <em>Gerald Metals, </em>132 F.3d at 720-723. On the other hand, the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not render the agency\u2019s determination unreasonable, <em>Consolo v. Fed. Maritime Comm\u2019n, </em>383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966), and where \u201c[substantial evidence exists on both sides of the issue [,] . . . the statutory substantial evidence standard compels deference to the [agency].\u201d <em>Nippon Steel, </em>458 F.3d at 1354.</p>\n<p id=\"b1728-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1728-6\">\n<em>A.

Contrary to Plaintiffs\u2019 assertions, the Commission did not focus exclusively on the effect of future German imports of 48 gram LWTP on Appleton, but rather consistently discussed its conclusions as to the effect of such importation on the industry as a whole. <em>See Comm\u2019n Views </em>at 38 (\u201c[T]he increased lower-priced imports of 48 gram jumbo rolls from Germany that are likely in the imminent future . . . will begin to have significant price effects on domestically produced 55 gram jumbo rolls.\u201d); <em>id. </em>(\u201c[A]s 48 gram products become more important in the U.S. market, the low prices German producers offer on their 48 gram products will restrict the ability of domestic producers to adjust prices on 55 gram products commensurately with costs.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 39<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (\u201cIn light of the consistently unprofitable financial performance of the domestic industry during the [POI], we find the industry to be vulnerable to the effects of additional subject imports.\u201d (footnote omitted)); <em>see also id. </em>35 (\u201cOverall domestic industry financial performance declined from 2005 to 2007.

Plaintiffs further argue that, because the Commission did not exclude any converter from consideration under the statute\u2019s related party provision,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the Commission cannot \u201cignore or reject the fact that German imports have either no effect or a positive effect on a large segment of the domestic industry.\u201d (Pis.\u2019 Reply 8-9 &amp; n.4 (listing evidence in the record in support of its claim that \u201cconverters depend on German jumbo rolls of 48-gram as a vital input\u201d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1730-5\">There is, however, no statutory requirement that the Commission give dispositive weight to industry opposition to the petition in making its threat of material injury determination. <em>See generally </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1677(7)(B) &amp; (F).

Cir. 1989).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1733-4\">As the court will explain below, however, because a reasonable reading of the record on this issue supports the Commission\u2019s factual conclusions, and because the legal framework within which those factual conclusions have been made is sufficiently clear and established, the court need not resolve any potential tension between the parties\u2019 competing legal positions on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1733-5\">First, the Commission is presumed to have considered all of the evidence before it. <em>See Gonzales v. West, </em>218 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (\u201c[AJbsent specific evidence indicating otherwise, all evidence contained in the record at the time of the [agency]\u2019s determination . . . must be presumed to have been reviewed by [the agency], and no further proof of such review is needed.\u201d (citations omitted)); <em>Suramerica, </em>17 CIT at 164, 818 F. Supp. at 365 (quoting <em>Rhone Poulenc, S.A. v United States, </em>8 CIT 47, 55, 592 F. Supp. 1318, 1326 (1984)). The Commission\u2019s decision not to give more weight to the Plaintiffs\u2019 particular piece of evidence, in light of Commerce\u2019s finding of dumping for the class of Plaintiffs\u2019 merchandise, was not unreasonable on the record here. <em>Accord Algoma Steel, </em>865 F.2d at 242 (\u201c[I]t is not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law for the ITC to refuse to consider a computer printout showing the breakdown of [specific] sales during a six-month period between LTFV and [more than fair value] sales [\u2018MTFV\u2019].\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1733-6\">The <em>Algoma Steel </em>court also opined that \u201c[t]his is not to say that a similar printout might not justify consideration if the raw data were supported by reasons specific to the particular case, why sales at MTFV were not relevant to the injury determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But Plaintiff makes no demonstration of reasons specific to this case why the alleged MTFV sales are not relevant here. To the contrary. Here the agency concluded, as noted above, that Plaintiff\u2019s \u201clower-priced imports of 48 gram jumbo rolls . . . will begin to have significant price effects on domestically produced 55 gram jumbo rolls.\u201d <em>Comm\u2019n Views </em>at 38. Plaintiff does not challenge this conclusion. Thus, contrary to Plaintiff\u2019s claim, the 48 gram jumbo rolls are directly relevant to the ITC\u2019s finding of a threat of material injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1733-7\">Second, the problem with Plaintiffs\u2019 legal argument is that the statute requires that the Commission\u2019s threat of material injury determination must be based on a finding that the threat to relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1712\">*1712</page-number>domestic industry is by reason of imports <em>\u201cof the subject merchandise.\u201d </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(7)(F)(i) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The statute defines \u201csubject merchandise\u201d as \u201cthe class or kind of merchandise that is within the scope of an investigation 0 . ...\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(25). \u201cThe ITC may not modify the class or kind of imported merchandise examined by Commerce.\u201d <em>USEC Inc. v. United States, </em>34 F. App\u2019x 725, 730 (Fed. Cir. 2002); <em>see also Algoma Steel Corp. v. United States, </em>12 CIT 518, 522, 688 F. Supp. 639, 644 (1988) (\u201cIn applying [the anti-dumping] statute, ITC does not look behind [Commerce]\u2019s determination, but accepts [Commerce]\u2019s determination as to which merchandise is in the class of merchandise sold at LTFV.\u201d), <em>aff\u2019d </em>865 F.2d 240 (Fed.

For purposes of this section, a \u201cdetermination\u201d of Commerce under section 1673d(a)(l) is the final determination published in the Federal Register. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1673d(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1734-5\">In this case, the Department of Commerce, exercising its authority under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673d(a)(l), \u201cdetermined that imports of [LWTP] from Germany are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at [LFTV].\u201d <em>Commerce Final Determination, </em>73 Fed. Reg. at 57,326. Commerce did not differentiate among the various products included within the scope of the subject merchandise \u2014 LWTP \u2014 and published a single weighted-average dumping margin for the entire class. <em>Id. </em>at 57,327-28. Indeed, the Department specifically stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1735-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1713\">*1713</page-number>As [Commerce\u2019s] final determination is affirmative and in accordance with section 735(b)(2) of the Act [19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673d(b)(2)], the ITC will determine ... whether the domestic industry in the United States is..! threatened with material injury, by reason of imports or sales (or the likelihood of sales) for <em>importation of the subject merchandise. </em>If the ITC determines that such injury does exist, the Department will issue an antidumping duty order directing [United States Customs and Border Protection] to assess antidumping duties <em>on all imports of the subject merchandise </em>....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1735-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 57,328 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1735-5\">Accordingly, contrary to Plaintiffs\u2019 assertions, the Commission properly included all merchandise within the class of merchandise determined by Commerce to have been sold at LTFV within the scope of its threat of material injury determination. <em>Accord Algoma Steel, </em>12 CIT at 522, 688 F. Supp. at 644.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1735-6\">Plaintiffs place significant weight upon the evidence that they claim shows that some particular subset of sales were found by Commerce not to have been dumped. However, as Defendant points out, if Commerce\u2019s final weighted-average dumping margin for the entire class of subject merchandise may be too high for some set of sales, it is conversely too low for others.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> <em>Accord Algoma Steel, </em>865 F.2d at 241 (\u201cCommerce, determining that sales at LTFV have occurred, normally . . . states a \u2018dumping margin\u2019 which is a weighted average adjusting appropriately for the MTFV sales.\u201d). Moreover, Plaintiffs\u2019 argument seeks to isolate one alleged component of the data from Commerce\u2019s record, ignoring the other factors that contribute to Commerce\u2019s affirmative dumping determination with respect to the entire class of subject imports.</p>\n<p id=\"b1736-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1714\">*1714</page-number>The thrust of Plaintiffs\u2019 argument appears to be that Koehler\u2019s 48 gram product should have been excluded from Commerce\u2019s dumping determination, but if Plaintiffs believed that the assessed 6.5% dumping margin failed to accurately reflect their pricing practices, or that 48 gram LWTP should have been excluded from the scope of subject merchandise, this is a matter that should have been taken up in a challenge of that determination under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(a)(2)(B)(i). Plaintiffs have failed to do so,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and the Commission did not err in considering within the scope of its threat of material injury determination the entire class of subject merchandise for which Commerce published an affirmative dumping determination.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1736-4\">\n<em>C. Likelihood of Increase in German LWTP Imports</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1736-5\">\n<em>1. Determination of Likely Further Product-Shifting</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1736-6\">Plaintiffs next argue that the Commission relied on conclusions based on mere conjecture or supposition in making its determination that German producers are likely to increase imports to the United States in the immediate future. (Pis.\u2019 Mem. 26-31; Pis.\u2019 Reply 18-23.) Plaintiffs argue that the Commission\u2019s extrapolation of trends observed during the POI \u2014 when German producers \u201cwere able to increase capacity through a combination of achieving greater efficiencies and using capacity previously devoted to producing other products to produce LWTP instead,\u201d <em>Comm\u2019n Views </em>at 36 \u2014 was not supported by substantial evidence. Plaintiffs contend that \u201c[t]he German producers\u2019 inability to prove the negative [i.e., that trends observed during the POI would not continue] . . . does not constitute substantial evidence on the record.\u201d (Pis.\u2019 Mem. 27.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1737-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1715\">*1715</page-number>Contrary to Plaintiffs\u2019 assertions, however, the Commission properly considered the potential for product-shifting as part of its determination with respect to the likelihood of increased subject imports, <em>see </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(7)(F)(i)(VT) (listing \u201cthe potential for product-shifting\u201d among factors that the Commission is required to consider in its threat of material injury analysis), and properly employed a \u2018trend\u2019 analysis to extrapolate to the near future trends observed during the POI. <em>See Asociacion de Productores de Salmon y Trucha de Chile AG v. U.S. Int\u2019l Trade Comm\u2019n, </em>26 CIT 29, 38, 180 F. Supp. 2d 1360, 1370 (2002) (\u201cThe Court of International Trade has previously approved such a \u2018trend\u2019 analysis as reasonable.\u201d (citing <em>Bando Chemical Industries, Ltd. v.

The record as a whole demonstrates that product-shifting in fact occurred to a significant degree during the POI, <em>Comm\u2019n Views </em>at 36, whereas, as the Commission pointed out, \u201c[t]he record contains no indication that the German producers cannot continue to increase capacity through such means in the imminent future.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1737-4\">Again, \u201c[b]ecause of th[eir] expertise, Commissioners are the fact-finders in the material injury determination: \u2018It is the Commission\u2019s task to evaluate the evidence it collects during its investigation.\u2019\u201d <em>Nippon Steel, </em>458 F.3d at 1350 (quoting <em>U.S. Steel Group v. United States, </em>96 F.3d 1352, 1357 (Fed. Cir. 1996)). On the record before the court, the Commission\u2019s projections based on product-shifting trends observed during the POI are reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1737-5\">\n<em>2. Effect of Appleton\u2019s New West Carrollton Facility</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1737-6\">Plaintiffs also contend that the Commission\u2019s determination of a likely increase in German subject imports \u201cis further contradicted by substantial evidence on the record showing that product entering the market from Appleton\u2019s new West Carrollton facility will result in increased U.S. shipments and decreased German shipments.\u201d (Pis.\u2019 Mem. 27.) Plaintiffs argue that the Commission \u201cimplicitly con-elude[d], without any basis, that German producers would continue an endless upward trajectory in exports to the United States in the face of not only a projected slowdown in U.S. demand, but also a [significant] increase in Appleton\u2019s coating capacity.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>30.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1737-7\">Again, the Commission is presumed to have considered all of the evidence before it. <em>Gonzales, </em>218 F.3d at 1381; <em>Suramerica, </em>17 CIT at 164, 818 F. Supp. at 365. Further, as reflected in the Commission\u2019s extensive discussion of Appleton\u2019s new West Carrollton facility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1716\">*1716</page-number>throughout its opinion, as well as the crucial role played by this factor in supporting the Commission\u2019s affirmative threat of injury determination, notwithstanding its negative present injury determination, <em>see Comm\u2019n Views </em>at 38-39, it is clear that the Commission considered the effect of this new facility in reaching its conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1738-3\">As noted above, unless the presence of this evidence in the record creates a situation where only one reasonable conclusion can be drawn, <em>see Gerald Metals, </em>132 F.3d at 720, the fact that Plaintiffs can interpret the evidence in a way contrary to the interpretation reached by the Commission does not make the Commission\u2019s determination unsupported by substantial evidence. <em>See Consolo, </em>383 U.S. at 620; <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. United States, </em>750 F.2d 927, 936 (Fed. Cir. 1984). Here, a reasonable reading of the record permits the conclusion that the product-shifting trends experienced during the POI were likely to continue in the near future and that these trends would not be negated by Appleton\u2019s increased capacity at West Car-rollton, because the new facility\u2019s effect on domestic production would be moderated.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The record also evidences that demand would continue to grow. <em>See Comm\u2019n Views </em>at 14-15. Accordingly, the record does not point to only one reasonable conclusion, and it is once more not the province of this court to re-weigh the evidence that the Commission alone is, in its expertise, entrusted to consider and weigh. <em>See Nippon Steel, </em>458 F.3d at 1350.</p>\n<p id=\"b1738-4\">\n<em>3. Effect of Koehler\u2019s Plan to Open a New U.S. Facility in 2010</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1738-5\">Finally, Plaintiffs contend in this regard that the Commission\u2019s conclusion that Koehler\u2019s plans to open a new coating facility in the United States in 2010 provide an added incentive for Koehler to increase its presence in the U.S. market in the interim (i.e., imminent future) is also based on conjecture. (Pis.\u2019 Mem. 30.) Plaintiffs argue that the Commission \u201cprovide [s] not a shred of support in the record for this assumption, and indeed it is contradicted by Koehler\u2019s own business plans, and rendered highly implausible by the massive increase in capacity that came online in August 2008 from Appleton\u2019s West Carrollton facility.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>30-31.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1738-6\">Defendant responds that the Commission\u2019s decision not to rely on Koehler\u2019s own business plans was within the Commission\u2019s discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1717\">*1717</page-number>tion. (Def.\u2019s Mem. 30.)<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> In supporting its decision to disregard Plaintiffs\u2019 projections, Defendant points to what it perceived as internal inconsistencies within Koehler\u2019s business plan.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Further, Defendant notes that \u201cKoehler\u2019s business plan attributed likely export declines in part to a consideration whose importance a Koehler official down played in sworn testimony [before the Commission]\u201d <em>(id. </em>32), and that this \u201calso provided a basis for [the] Commission\u2019s decision not to give weight to the projected declines.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Thus, Defendant argues that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1739-4\">the Commission reasonably concluded that Koehler would not voluntarily retreat from the U.S. market during the year it was building its new facility, thereby surrendering market share to Appleton. To the contrary, the Commission\u2019s conclusion that Koehler\u2019s projected U.S. facility provided it with an incentive to increase its presence in the U.S. market was entirely consistent with the thrust of the Koehler business plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1739-5\"><em>(Id. </em>31.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1739-6\">Defendant-Intervenor further argues that \u201cthe incentive to build customer relationships and product acceptance in advance of constructing a production facility is a reasonable presumption.\u201d (Def.-Intervenor\u2019s Mem. 27 (quoting <em>Nippon Steel Corp. v. United States, </em>19 CIT 450, 480 (1995) (\u201cOnce purchasers have an established supply relationship, the established supplier has an advantage, and the competing supplier is forced to beat the import price, probably by a substantial margin.\u201d)).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1739-7\">With respect to this issue, Plaintiffs again essentially ask the court to re-weigh the evidence before the Commission, which the court must again decline to do. As noted above, the Commission reasonably concluded, based on the record before it that, in light of trends experienced during the POI, subject German imports are likely to continue to increase in the immediate future. Because it is not unrea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1718\">*1718</page-number>sonable for the Commission to have concluded \u201cthat Koehler would not voluntarily retreat from the U.S. market during the year it was building its new facility\u201d (Def.\u2019s Mem. 31), the court cannot agree that Plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of the effect of Koehler\u2019s plans to open a new U.S. facility is the only reasonable interpretation. <em>See Gerald Metals, </em>132 F.3d at 720. Accordingly, the court cannot agree that the Commission\u2019s determination is unsupported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1740-4\">\n<em>D. Likely Price Effects Determination</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1740-5\">The Commission generally defends its determination of likely price effects as based on two unchallenged findings. First, the Commission determined that the 48 gram product, as opposed to the 55 gram product, \u201cwould be the focus of competition between the domestic like product and the subject imports in the imminent future\u201d (Def.\u2019s Mem. 33); <em>see also Comm\u2019n Views </em>at 38, and, second, that \u201cthe subject imports from Germany [tended to undersell] the domestically produced 48 gram product during the [POI].\u201d (Def.\u2019s Mem. 33.)<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Defendant explains that \u201c[t]he Commission consequently concluded that the [price differential] observed for the 48 gram product during the [POI] was likely to continue in the imminent future, and that it would impede the domestic industry\u2019s attempts to gain or maintain sales of that product.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1740-6\">Plaintiffs maintain that the Commission should have instead concluded that, regardless of any price effects from increased subject imports from Germany, Appleton would lower its prices, as purportedly evidenced by (1) Appleton\u2019s business plan, and (2) basic laws of supply and demand. The court will consider each of these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1740-7\">\n<em>1. Likelihood of Lower Domestic Prices Based on Appleton\u2019s Business Plan</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1740-8\">Plaintiffs first argue that the Commission\u2019s finding of likely price effects is unsupported by substantial evidence by asserting that the Commission unreasonably failed to conclude from the record that Appleton\u2019s new West Carrollton facility was intended to allow Appleton to cut its prices on 48 gram LWTP, thereby preempting any price effects from cheaper German products. (See Pis.\u2019 Mem. 31-33.) Specifically, Plaintiffs contend that Appleton\u2019s business plan, \u201cthe only contemporaneous documentation provided regarding the [West Car-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1719\">*1719</page-number>rollton] investment decision (i.e., that was not prepared in the context of the investigation)\u201d (Pis.5 Mem. 32) supports the conclusion that Appleton intended to cut prices once the new facility was up and running.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1741-4\">Defendant contests Plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of Appleton\u2019s business plan,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> and argues that the Commission\u2019s alternative reading of this plan \u201cwas consistent with the public testimony of Appleton\u2019s Chief Executive Officer that Appleton\u2019s decision to invest in its West Car-rollton\u2019s facilities was based on the pricing and demand conditions that existed when the investment decision was made in 2006, and that subsequent pricing declines imperiled that investment.\u201d (Def.\u2019s Mem. 35 (citing Transcript of Open Session of Comm\u2019n Hr\u2019g held on Oct. 2, 2008 (Revised and Corrected Copy), Admin. R. Pub. Doc. 258, at 58-60).) Finally, Defendant asserts that Plaintiffs \u201cpointO to nothing in the record indicating that Appleton was making any profit from LWTP production at its [n]ew [West] Carrollton facility, much less that its production was so profitable that it would have an incentive to cut prices.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 35-36 (emphasis omitted)).<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1741-5\">The Defendant is correct. There is nothing manifestly unreasonable about the Commission\u2019s reading of Appleton\u2019s business plan and its reliance on testimony from Appleton\u2019s Chief Executive Officer. The Commission\u2019s reasoning with respect to its likely price effects determination \u2014 that, unlike the situation during the POI, the 48 gram product rather than the 55 gram product will be the focus of competition between subject German imports and domestic producers, and that, given trends seen during the POI, the 48 gram product from Germany will likely undersell domestically produced 48 gram product, <em>see Comm\u2019n Views </em>at 32, 37-39 \u2014 is also not unreasonable on the evidence before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1742-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1720\">*1720</page-number>\n<em>2. Likelihood of Lower Domestic Prices Based on Increased Domestic Supply</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1742-4\">In support of their challenge to the Commission\u2019s finding of likely price effects, Plaintiffs further argue that basic economic principles of supply and demand also support a conclusion from the record that Appleton would cut prices after opening its new facility. (Pls.\u2019s Mem. 33-36.) Plaintiffs note that the Commission acknowledged Appleton\u2019s projection that its new facility \u201cwill increase its capacity of the subject product\u201d <em>(id. </em>31 (quoting <em>Comm\u2019n Final Staff Report (Conf.) </em>at III-4)) and argue that \u201cbusinesses simply do not spend $125 million to increase capacity by [a significant] percentage] without using it\u201d <em>(id. </em>34), and that the resulting increase in quantity of the 48 gram product to be supplied to the market once Appleton\u2019s new facility is fully operational will naturally lower the market equilibrium price, provided demand remains relatively unchanged. <em>(Id. </em>34-35.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1742-5\">The record, however, does not require the conclusion that an increase in domestic supply will negate the effect of German underselling. Rather, available domestic supply is just one factor in the Commission\u2019s analysis, and it must be weighed against the undisputed evidence of underselling by the German producers. In addition, as mentioned above, the record demonstrates that Appleton\u2019s lack of profitability will militate against price cuts. Contrary to Plaintiffs\u2019 contention, therefore, basic principles of supply and demand do not make the Commission\u2019s likely price effects determination unreasonable, and the court concludes that this determination is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Nippon Steel, </em>458 F.3d at 1351.</p>\n<p id=\"b1742-6\">\n<em>E. Vulnerability of Domestic Industry</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1742-7\">Finally, Plaintiffs argue that the Commission\u2019s conclusion that the domestic industry is vulnerable to the likely impact of additional subject imports \u2014 based on the Commission\u2019s finding regarding \u201cthe consistently unprofitable financial performance of the domestic industry during the [POI]\u201d (Pis.\u2019 Mem. 36 (quoting <em>Comm\u2019n Views </em>at 39)) \u2014 is also unsupported by sufficient evidence. Plaintiffs once more in effect request the court to re-weigh the evidence that the Commission alone is authorized and entrusted to gather, consider, and weigh in coming to its threat of injury determination. <em>(See id. </em>36-38.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1742-8\">As evidenced by the citations supplied in its Views, the Commission\u2019s finding that \u201c[o]verall domestic industry financial performance declined [during the POI]\u201d is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Comm\u2019n Views </em>at 26. <em>(See also </em>Def.\u2019s Mem. 37-38 (\u201cAn examination of the combined operations of all U.S. coaters and converters of LWTP demonstrates [that] . . .

Accordingly, the Commission\u2019s finding that \u201c[i]n light of the consistently unprofitable financial performance of the domestic industry during the [POI], . . . the industry [is] vulnerable to the effects of additional subject imports,\u201d <em>Comm\u2019n Views </em>at 39 (footnote omitted), is also supported by substantial evidence, particularly as the record does not indicate that trends observed during the POI are likely to change in the immediate future.</p>\n<p id=\"b1743-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1743-5\">For all of the foregoing reasons, the Commission\u2019s final determination that a domestic industry is threatened with material injury by reason of LWTP imports from Germany is supported by substantial evidence. Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion for Judgment on the Agency Record is therefore DENIED, and the Commission\u2019s determination is AFFIRMED in all respects. Judgment will issue for the Defendants.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1722-15\"> <em>The views </em>of the Commission are contained in <em>Certain Lightweight Thermal Paper from China and Germany, </em>Views of the Commission, USITC Pub. 4043, Inv.
