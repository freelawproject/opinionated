Plaintiffs Ad Hoc Shrimp Trade Action Committee (\u201cAd Hoc\u201d), an association of domestic producers and processors of warmwater shrimp, and Thai I-Mei Frozen Foods Co., Ltd. (\u201cThai I-Mei\u201d), an exporter of warmwater shrimp, challenge certain decisions made by Commerce during the course of the administrative review. Ad Hoc contests: (1) Commerce\u2019s decision not to apply 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(d) to Thai I-Mei\u2019s normal value calculations, (2) Commerce\u2019s calculation of Thai I-Mei\u2019s constructed export price (\u201cCEP\u201d) profit, (3) Commerce\u2019s classification of Good Luck Product Co. Ltd.\u2019s (\u201cGood Luck\u201d) defective merchandise as an \u201cindirect selling expense,\u201d and (4) Commerce\u2019s decision not to apply adverse facts available when calculating the dumping margin for Fortune Frozen Foods (\u201cFortune\u201d). Thai I-Mei contests: (1) Commerce\u2019s choice of its constructed value (\u201cCV\u201d) methodology as it pertains to the general and administrative (\u201cG&amp;A\u201d) expense component, (2) Commerce\u2019s calculation of Thai I-Mei\u2019s G&amp;A and interest expenses ratios, (3) Commerce\u2019s denial of Thai I-Mei\u2019s CEP offset, and (4) Commerce\u2019s calculation of Thai I-Mei\u2019s assessment rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">This court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(c). Because the challenged decisions are supported by substantial evidence and otherwise in accordance with law, Commerce\u2019s determination in <em>Certain Frozen Warmwater Shrimp from Thailand: Final Results and Final Partial Rescission of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, </em>72 Fed. Reg. 52,065 (September 12, 2007) (\u201cFinal Results\u201d) is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">On April 7, 2006, Commerce initiated the first administrative review of an antidumping duty order covering certain frozen warmwa-ter shrimp from Thailand. <em>Notice of Initiation of Administrative Reviews of the Antidumping Duty Orders on Certain Frozen Warmwater Shrimp from Brazil, Ecuador, India and Thailand, </em>71 Fed. Reg. 17,819 (April 7, 2006). The period of review was from August 4, 2004 to January 31, 2006. <em>Id. </em>Commerce selected as mandatory respondents the three largest Thai exporters of frozen warmwater shrimp in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>the respondent selection poll: Good Luck, Thai I-Mei, and Pakfood Public Co., Ltd, (\u201cPakfood\u201d). Memorandum from Irene D. Tzafolias, Acting Director, Office AD/CVD Operations, to Stephen J. Claeys, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Re: <em>Antidumping Duty Administrative Review of Certain Frozen Warmwater Shrimp from Thailand: Selection of Respondents </em>(July 11, 2006), Public Record (\u201cP.R.\u201d) 239, at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">On March 9, 2007, Commerce published its preliminary results in the Federal Register. <em>See Certain Frozen Warmwater Shrimp from Thailand: Preliminary Results and Partial Rescission of Antidump-ing Duty Administrative Review, </em>72 Fed. Reg. 10,669 (March 9, 2007) (\u201cPreliminary Results\u201d). Thereafter, on September 12, 2007, Commerce issued the final results of this review. <em>Final Results, </em>72 Fed. Reg. 52,065. For the three selected respondents, Commerce found the following dumping margins: 10.75% for Good Luck, 2.58% for Thai I-Mei, and 4.29% for Pakfood. <em>Id. </em>at 52,069. For the fifteen respondents subject to the review who were not selected for examination, Commerce calculated a dumping margin of 4.31%, <em>id.; </em>this rate was based on the weighted average of the margins calculated for the three selected respondents, <em>id. </em>at n.5. Commerce also applied an adverse facts available (\u201cAFA\u201d) margin of 57.64% to six respondents who did not cooperate with Commerce\u2019s requests for information. <em>Id. </em>On October 12,2007, Ad Hoc filed this action under court number 07-00378. On January 4, 2008, Thai I-Mei was admitted as a Defendant-Intervenor in <em>Ad Hoc Shrimp Trade Action Committee v. United States, </em>Court Number 07-00378.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thereafter, on January 11, 2008, the court entered an order consolidating Ad <em>Hoc Shrimp Trade Action Committee v. United States, </em>Court Number 07-00378, and <em>Thai I-Mei Frozen Foods Co., Ltd. v. United States, </em>Court Number 07-00381, under consolidated Court Number 07-00378.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">The court must uphold a determination by Commerce resulting from an administrative review of an antidumping duty order unless it is \u201cunsupported by substantial evidence on the record, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(l)(B)(i); <em>Carpenter Tech. Corp. v. United States, </em>510 F.3d 1370, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">The substantial evidence test \u201crequires only that there be evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Cleo Inc. v. United States, </em>501 F.3d 1291, 1296 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (citing <em>Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 477, 71 S. Ct. 456, 95 L. Ed. 456 (1951)). Even if it is possible to draw two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence contained in the record, this does not render Commerce\u2019s findings unsupported by substantial evidence. <em>Consolo v. Fed. Mar. Comm\u2019n, </em>383 U.S. 607, 620, 86 S. Ct. 1018, 16 L. Ed. 2d 131 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">While the court must consider contradictory evidence, \u201cthe substantial evidence test does not require that there be an absence of evidence detracting from the agency\u2019s conclusion, nor is there an absence of substantial evidence simply because the reviewing court would have reached a different conclusion based on the same record. <em>Cleo, </em>501 F.3d at 1296 (citing <em>Universal Camera, </em>340 U.S. at 487-88); <em>see also Am. Silicon Techs, v. United States, </em>261 F.3d 1371, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <em>U.S. Steel Group v. United States, </em>96 F.3d 1352, 1357 (Fed. Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">To determine whether Commerce\u2019s interpretation and application of the antidumping statute at issue \u201cis in accordance with the law,\u201d the court must conduct the two-step analysis articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 842-43, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1984). <em>See Pesquera Mares Australes Ltda. v. United States, </em>266 F.3d 1372, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (\u201c[S]tatutory interpretations articulated by Commerce during its antidumping proceedings are entitled to judicial deference under <em>Chevron\u201d). </em>Under the first step of the <em>Chevron </em>analysis, the court must ascertain \u201cwhether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue. If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\u201d <em>Wheatland Tube Co. v. United States, </em>495 F.3d 1355, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (citing <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 842-43).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">The court reaches the second step of the <em>Chevron </em>analysis only \u201cif the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number><em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843). Under this second step, the court must evaluate whether Commerce\u2019s interpretation \u201cis based on a permissible construction of the statute.\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843 n.11. The agency\u2019s construction need not be the only reasonable interpretation or even the most reasonable interpretation. <em>Zenith Radio Corp. v. United States, </em>437 U.S. 443, 450, 98 S. Ct. 2441, 57 L. Ed. 2d 337 (1978). The court must defer to Commerce\u2019s reasonable interpretation of a statute even if it might have adopted another interpretation if the question had first arisen in a judicial proceeding. <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">\n<em>Legal Framework Of Antidumping</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">Goods imported into the United States are subject to an antidump-ing duty if Commerce determines that foreign merchandise is being sold in the United States at \u201cless than its fair value.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673; <em>Ad Hoc Shrimp Trade Action Comm. v. United States, </em>515 F.3d 1372, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2008). The amount of the antidumping duty reflects the amount by which the home-market price of the foreign like product (the \u201cnormal value\u201d) exceeds the price charged in the United States (the \u201cexport price\u201d). 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)(l)(A)-(B). The U.S. price is calculated in one of two ways, as either the export price or the constructed export price, depending on the relationship between the producer or exporter and the U.S. purchaser. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(a)-(b); <em>Ta Chen Stainless Steel Pipe, Ltd., v. United States, </em>28 CIT 627, 630, 342 F. Supp. 2d 1191, 1194 (2004). The difference between the normal value and the export price or constructed export price is referred to as the \u201cdumping margin.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(35)(A). After an antidumping duty order is issued, the amount of the anti-dumping duty may be revised in subsequent administrative reviews. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">In a subsequent administrative review, Commerce recalculates the normal value (or constructed value) and the export price (or constructed export price) to establish an updated dumping margin. 19 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1675(a)(2)(A)(i)-(ii). Because the sale prices used to determine normal value and the U.S. price (whether calculated on the basis of export price or constructed export price) occur at different points in the chain of commerce and under different circumstances, certain adjustments are made in an to attempt to make them comparable. <em>Ta Chen, </em>28 CIT at 630. Thus, the objective of making adjustments to account for such costs as packing expenses, duties, taxes, and shipping costs is to ensure \u201capples to apples\u201d price comparisons. <em>Id. See Thai I-Mei Frozen Foods Co., Ltd. v. United States, </em>477 F. Supp. 2d 1332, 1357 (CIT 2007). (\u201cIn implementing the anti-dumping statute, Commerce is to calculate antidumping margins as accurately as possible. To ensure compliance with this purpose, Commerce is directed to make case-by-case determinations and consider data unique to the particular case before it...\u201d) (citations omitted). When the U.S. price is calculated as the \u201cconstructed export price,\u201d certain additional adjustments are made to account for selling expenses in the United States. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(d)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-3\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">\n<em>Ad Hoc Has Not Overcome Commerce\u2019s Determination</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Ad Hoc challenges four aspects of Commerce\u2019s determination. Each of the challenged aspects of the determination are upheld. First, Ad Hoc argues that Commerce failed to apply to Thai I-Mei the special rule for calculation of normal value for goods produced by multinational corporations, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(d) (\u201cMNC Provision\u201d). Commerce permissibly elected not to apply the MNC Provision to calculate the normal value of Thai I-Mei\u2019s goods because some of Thai I-Mei\u2019s affiliates are located in nonmarket economy countries. Second, Ad Hoc claims that because of its general position at the administrative level regarding Commerce\u2019s alleged violation of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(f)(2)(c), it is entitled to judicial review. Yet, prior to filing its Motion for Judgment Upon the Agency Record, Ad Hoc never argued that Commerce violated that specific section, either directly or by implication, and, thus, failed to exhaust its administrative remedies. Third, Ad Hoc claims that expenses related to defective products sold by Good Luck in the United States should be categorized as direct selling expenses because they bear a direct relationship to the particular sale. However, Good Luck eliminated the defective products from the \u201cquantity sold\u201d category analysis and Commerce accordingly categorized the expenses as \u201cindirect selling expenses.\u201d Fourth, Ad Hoc argues that Commerce used unfettered discretion when it did not apply adverse facts available to calculate Fortune\u2019s dumping margin. In making that decision, however, Commerce acted within the legal limits of its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>1</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">Commerce\u2019s Decision Not To Apply The MNC Provision To Thai I-Mei Is In Accordance With Law</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Ad Hoc argues that all three elements of the MNC Provision apply to Thai I-Mei and that Commerce\u2019s failure to apply the MNC Provision to Thai I-Mei is \u201cpremised upon an unsustainable reading of the statute.\u201d Memorandum of Law in Support of Plaintiff Ad Hoc Shrimp Trade Action Committee\u2019s Rule 56.2 Motion for Judgment Upon the Agency Record (\u201cAd Hoc\u2019s Motion\u201d) at 6. Ad Hoc claims that Thai I-Mei fulfills all three of the MNC Provision\u2019s statutory criteria and, accordingly, that the MNC Provision should be applied to Thai I-Mei. <em>Id. </em>at 6-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">a</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">\n<em>Thai I-Mei Does Not Meet the Second Element of the MNC Provision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">Ad Hoc claims that Thai I-Mei satisfied all three criteria of the MNC Provision. <em>Id. </em>at 6-7. The three elements of the MNC Provision are: (1) the company (Ad Hoc) that exported merchandise to the United States also owns and controls producers of similar merchandise in other countries (here, the People\u2019s Republic of China (\u201cPRC\u201d) and Vietnam); (2) 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)(l)(C) applies<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>; and (3) the normal value of the foreign like product produced outside the exporting country is higher than the normal value of the foreign like product produced in the facilities located in the exporting country, here, Thailand.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At issue is whether the second element of the MNC Provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>(whether 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)(l)(c) applies to Thai I-Mei) has been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Ad Hoc argues that element two of the MNC Provision has been met because Thai I-Mei\u2019s home market sales during the POR constituted less than five percent of its U.S. sales, and thus, Thai I-Mei did not have a viable home market. Ad Hoc\u2019s Motion at 7-8. Ad Hoc argues that because Thai I-Mei did not have a viable home market, its normal value was replaced by constructed value, and that Commerce cannot use constructed value as normal value unless 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)(l)(c) applies. <em>Id. </em>at 8 (citing 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)(4)). Correspondingly, Ad Hoc argues that \u201cit is clear\u201d that Thai I-Mei met element two of the MNC Provision. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Thai I-Mei had neither a viable home market during the review nor any viable third country markets<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and, as a result, its normal value was based on constructed value under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)(4).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> How<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>ever, Commerce correctly concluded that element two of the MNC Provision could not be applied to Thai I-Mei because normal value was not based upon actual sales. <em>See </em>Memorandum from Stephen J. Claeys, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, to David M. Spooner, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Re: Issues and Decision Memorandum for the Antidumping Duty Administrative Review on Certain Frozen Warmwater Shrimp from Thailand-August 4, 2004, through January 31, 2006 (September 5, 2007), P.R. 532 <em>(\u201cFinal Decision Memo\u201d) </em>cmt. 10, at 38. Thai I-Mei\u2019s normal value was not based upon actual sales because the sales from PRC and Vietnam cannot form a proper basis for comparison as they are nonmarket economies. <em>Georgetown Steel Corp. v. United States, </em>801 F.2d 1308, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 1986) <em>(quoting </em>S. Rep. No. 93-1298, at 174 (1974), <em>reprinted in </em>1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 7186, 7311) (\u201c[I]n state-controlled-economy countries . . . the supply and demand forces do not operate to produce prices, either in the home market or in third countries, which can be relied upon for comparison.\u201d)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because PRC and Vietnam were Thai I-Mei\u2019s affiliates and third country markets in the administrative review, their normal values were derived from surrogate values under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(c) and not from actual sales of the foreign like product. Accordingly, when there are nonmarket economies, Commerce calculates normal value using the factors of production methodology. <em>See e.g., Antidumping Methodologies: Market Economy Inputs, Expected Non-Market Economy Wages, Duty Drawback; and Requests for Comments, </em>71 Fed. Reg. 61,716 (October 19, 2006); <em>See Final Decision Memo </em>cmt. 10, at 37. (\u201cIn [nonmarket economy] cases, [Commerce] disregards home market prices and the respondent\u2019s cost of production and calculates [normal value] on the reported factors of production.\u201d). When Commerce uses the factors of production methodology to calculate normal value, the MNC Provision does not apply because element two (whether 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)(l)(C) applies) has not been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">Ad Hoc made this same argument in the parallel review involving shrimp from China in which Commerce concluded that the MNC Provision does not apply because the second element, (that 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)(l)(c) applies) is not satisfied when the exporting country is a nonmarket economy country. <em>See Certain Frozen Warmwater Shrimp from the People\u2019s Republic of China: Notice of Final Results and Rescission in Part, of2004 /2006 Antidumping Duty Administra</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number><em>tive and New Shipper Reviews, </em>72 Fed. Reg. 52,049 (September 12, 2007), and accompanying Issues and Decision Memorandum at cmt. 12. Ad Hoc\u2019s argument here, taken in context with <em>Certain Frozen Warmwater Shrimp from China, </em>suggests that the MNC Provision should apply when a nonmarket economy country is a non-exporting country, but should not apply when a nonmarket economy is an exporting country. It would be anomalous to interpret the MNC Provision as defining the term \u201cmultinational corporation\u201d to include situations where there is a nonmarket economy in the non-exporting country but not in the exporting country because the normal value for Thai I-Mei\u2019s affiliates in the non-exporting country is not based on sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-3\">If the MNC Provision were applied in the manner Ad Hoc advocates, Commerce would be obligated to use the sales prices of Thai I-Mei\u2019s affiliates even though they operate in nonmarket economy countries, as the basis for normal value; this would result in the use of a nonmarket economy country company\u2019s actual sales values as the basis for normal value. <em>See </em>MNC Provision. Ad Hoc\u2019s suggested interpretation of the MNC Provision would contradict the entire premise of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(c)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>, which provides for the use of surrogate values to determine normal value for nonmarket economy respondents. Lastly, Ad Hoc\u2019s interpretation would contradict the recognized concept that nonmarket economy sales prices cannot be used as a basis for normal value because of the likely price distortion. <em>See e.g. ICC Industries, Inc. v. United States, </em>812 F.2d 694, 697 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (\u201cHome market prices and costs are meaningless as a source of \u2018fair value\u2019 in [nonmarket economy] countries in view of the level of intervention by the government in setting relative prices.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">Because of the possibility of price distortion coming from the non-market economy affiliate countries, and Ad Hoc\u2019s failure to prove that element two of the MNC Provision applies to Thai I-Mei, Commerce correctly declined to apply the MNC Provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>b</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">\n<em>Commerce\u2019s Interpretation of the MNC Provision Is Reasonable</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">In addition to arguing that Thai I-Mei satisfies all three elements of the MNC Provision, Ad Hoc claims that Commerce\u2019s interpretation of the MNC Provision is \u201cseriously flawed.\u201d Ad Hoc\u2019s Motion at 9. Ad Hoc argues that Commerce\u2019s interpretation of the legislative history \u201cis inconsistent with the express language\u201d of the MNC Provision. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Because the MNC Provision is silent with respect to its application in the nonmarket economy context, Commerce\u2019s construction of the provision is evaluated for its reasonableness. <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 844. Commerce\u2019s interpretation and application of the MNC Provision with respect to Thai I-Mei is reasonable in light of the statutory language and the legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">The MNC Provision says that when all three elements described are satisfied, Commerce determines normal value by reference to the normal value at which the foreign like product is \u201csold\u201d from facilities outside the exporting country. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(d). The word \u201csold\u201d in the statute indicates Congress intended Commerce to examine sale prices in the non-exporting country to determine normal value. In a nonmarket economy, Commerce does not consider sales prices because they are unreliable. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(18)(A) (noting that \u201csales of merchandise in [a nonmarket economy] country do not reflect the fair value of the merchandise\u201d). The MNC Provision also instructs Commerce to determine the normal value of the foreign like product in the exporting country by reference to the normal value at which it is sold from the non-exporting country, as adjusted under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a). <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(d). Terms such as \u201csold,\u201d \u201ccost of production,\u201d and \u201cprice\u201d used in the MNC Provision regarding calculation of normal value in the non-exporting country show Congressional intent that the MNC Provision not apply when the non-exporting country is a nonmarket economy because these terms are not applicable to nonmarket economies.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">The legislative history of the MNC Provision shows Congress was primarily concerned with situations where the home market was not viable and yet a respondent\u2019s low priced exports to the United States market were supported by higher priced sales of its affiliate in a third country market. S. Rep. No. 93-1298, at 174, 1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 7311. Before the enactment of the MNC Provision in 1974, there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>no means to counteract such discriminatory pricing, <em>i.e. </em>the setting of high prices in one foreign country to support low-priced exports to the United States from another country. <em>See id. </em>The MNC Provision allows use of the affiliate\u2019s normal value in the non-exporting country <em>(i.e., </em>the company with \u201chigh-priced\u201d home market sales) to compare to the United States price.of the affiliate in the exporting country. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(d); S. Rep. No. 93-1298 at 174, 1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 7311. This legislative concern does not appear to encompass respondents from nonmarket economies because the MNC Provision was designed to address discriminatory pricing behavior by the multinational corporation, it was not meant to apply when one affiliate within the multinational corporation is located in a nonmarket economy. <em>See </em>S. Rep. No. 93-1298 1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 7311-13. Accordingly, Commerce sought to address pricing practices of multinational corporations through the use of normal value of other countries not in the proceeding. Nonmarket affiliate countries do not set home market prices in the way a market economy would, nor in the way Congress envisioned because their prices are subject to state government control, and as a result were not intended by Congress to be included in the MNC Provision. <em>See </em>id.; <em>See also Georgetown Steel Corp. v. United States, </em>801 F.2d at 1316.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">Commerce declined to treat Thai I-Mei as an MNC because the non-exporting country was a nonmarket economy. The MNC Provision was intended to provide a remedy for discriminatory pricing by a multinational corporation which sells products of a plant in one foreign county at low prices to the United States, while the same company or its subsidiary in another foreign country subsidizes those low-priced sales with high-priced sales of the same product to customers in its own market. S.Rep. No. 93-1298 at 174, 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 7311; <em>see also Kerr-McGee Chem. Corp. v. United States, </em>14 CIT 422, 424 (1990).

Ad Hoc says that it is not arguing about whether Commerce should take the profit information of Thai I-Mei\u2019s affiliated importer, Ocean Duke, into account when calculating Thai I-Mei\u2019s CEP profit amount; rather it claims it is \u201csimply explaining that Commerce should not use Thai I-Mei\u2019s POR financial statements given that Thai I-Mei\u2019s relationship with Ocean Duke renders Thai I-Mei\u2019s financial statement incomplete.\u201d Id. at 5-6 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">The exhaustion doctrine requires \"that no one is entitled to judicial relief for a supposed or threatened injury until the prescribed administrative remedy has been exhausted.\u201d <em>Consol.

Failure to raise a specific argument in a case brief is a failure to exhaust administrative remedies with respect to that argument because it \u201cdeprives [Commerce] of an opportunity to consider the matter, make its ruling, and state the reasons for its action.\u201d <em>Unemployment Comp.

Ad Hoc\u2019s Reply at 9-10. However, in <em>Agro Dutch, </em>the expenses were indirect because they were canceled and excluded from dumping analysis. <em>See Agro Dutch, </em>30 CIT at 324. As in that case, Good Luck identified and cancelled the defective merchandise at issue and excluded it from the \u201cquantity sold\u201d figure, Good Luck Verification at 14, effectively making the expenses from the defective merchandise not directly related to any sale and excluded from the dumping analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Ad Hoc overemphasizes the \u201cdirect relationship\u201d component of the definition of direct selling expenses by repeatedly stating that the expenses related to Good Luck\u2019s defective products were clearly identifiable as part of a sale. <em>See </em>Ad Hoc\u2019s Motion at 19-20. This argument ignores the fact that indirect expenses can be reasonably attributed to the sale and do not have to be completely unrelated. <em>See </em>SAA at 824, 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 4164 (\u201cSuch [indirect selling] expenses would be incurred by the seller regardless of whether the particular sales in question are made, but reasonably may be attributed (at least in part) to such sales\u201d). That the rejected merchandise was part of a shipment that included acceptable merchandise does not prohibit it from being considered an indirect selling expense because such expenses \u201creasonably may be attributed to such sales.\u201d <em>See id. </em>The rejected merchandise was not sold and was excluded from the dumping analysis, just as in <em>Agro Dutch. </em>Whether the entire shipment or only a portion is rejected is irrelevant because in the underlying sale the amount of the defective merchandise is excluded from the dumping analysis (specifically the \u201cquantity sold\u201d figure). Thus, the expenses do not \u201cresult from\u201d or \u201cbear a direct relationship to\u201d a particular sale, as is described in the applicable regulation and the SAA. 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.410(c); see SAA at 824, 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 4164.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">4</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">It Was Within Commerce\u2019s Discretion Not To Apply \u201cAdverse Facts Available\u201d When Calculating Fortune\u2019s Dumping Margin</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">Ad Hoc claims that Commerce erred when it declined to apply AFA to Fortune because Fortune failed to meet multiple deadlines and Commerce allegedly asked Fortune for information at improper times.

Each of the challenged aspects of the determination is upheld. First, Thai I-Mei argues that Commerce\u2019s decision to use Thai I-Mei\u2019s own G&amp;A and interest expense information while using other respondents\u2019 financial information to create Thai I-Mei\u2019s CV is not in accordance with law. Commerce permissibly interpreted 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(b)(ii) when it used Thai I-Mei\u2019s own G&amp;A and interest expense data while using other respondents\u2019 data for the other components of Thai I-Mei\u2019s CV calculation. Second, Thai I-Mei argues that cost of manufacture (\u201cCOM\u201d) should be used instead of cost of goods sold (\u201cCOGS\u201d) as the denominator in Thai I-Mei\u2019s G&amp;A and interest expense ratios because COM is a more accurate figure. However, use of COGS instead of COM to calculate Thai I-Mei\u2019s G&amp;A and interest expense ratios is an accepted agency practice. Third, Thai I-Mei claims it should qualify for a CEP offset, yet, Thai I-Mei has not met the necessary burden of proof because it did not prove that its normal value was established at a more advanced level of trade than the constructed export price level. Fourth, Thai I-Mei argues that Commerce should have used the entered value of Thai I-Mei\u2019s entries during the period of review instead of the entered value of its sales during the period of review as the denominator in its antidumping duty assessment rate. Commerce\u2019s use of the entered value of sales as the denominator was consistent with agency regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">Commerce\u2019s Methodology For Calculating Thai I-Mei\u2019s Constructed Value Is In Accordance With Law</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">Thai I-Mei argues that Commerce failed to correctly calculate its constructed value because it did not choose to apply in its entirety one of the methodologies listed in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(e)(2)(B).

Thai I-Mei additionally claims that Commerce\u2019s interpretation of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(e)(2)(B)(ii) is inconsistent with both the plain language of the statute and Commerce\u2019s past practice. <em>Id. </em>at 9. Thai I-Mei states that Commerce erred when it used Thai I-Mei\u2019s own G&amp;A and interest expenses and Pakfood and Good Luck\u2019s data for the rest of the Thai I-Mei CV components. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">If there is no viable third country market from which to derive a price, and there is no third country in which sales of a foreign like product exist to form an adequate basis for comparison against sales of the allegedly dumped merchandise, Commerce uses \u201cconstructed value\u201d to calculate normal value. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)(4); <em>See Koyo Seiko Co. v. United States, </em>551 F. 3d 1286, 1289 (Fed. Cir. 2008). Constructed value becomes the proxy for normal value in .these instances and is a determination of the foreign like product price. <em>Id. </em>CV is normally calculated as the sum of: (1) a company\u2019s cost of manufacture, 19 U.S.C \u00a7 1677b(e)(l); (2) selling and G&amp;A expenses (collectively cost of production) plus an amount for profit, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(e)(2)(A); and (3) the cost of packaging. U.S.C. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(e)(3). With respect to the second component of the CV calculation, if actual information is not available to calculate selling expenses, G&amp;A expenses, and profit, Commerce is directed by statute to employ one of the three methodologies described in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">There are three alternative methodologies used to create CV if actual data are not available with respect to the expenses described in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(e)(2)(A). These are: (i) actual amounts incurred and realized by the producer being investigated for selling and G&amp;A expenses and profit in connection with foreign market sales of the general same category of products, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(e)(2)(B)(i); (ii) the weighted average of actual amounts incurred and realized for selling and G&amp;A expenses and profit by other producers being investigated in connection with foreign market sales in the ordinary course of trade of a foreign like product, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(e)(2)(B)(ii); or (iii) any other reasonable method to calculate selling and G&amp;A expenses and profit, provided that the amount for profit does not exceed the profit normally realized by other companies for foreign market sales of the same general category of products, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(e)(2)(B)(iii). <em>See also </em>SAA at 840, 1994 U.S.S.C.A.N at 4176. While 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(e)(2)(B) allows alternative methodologies to derive constructed value, there is no priority of the approaches and no one methodology has to be applied in full by Commerce. <em>See Gulf States Tube Div. of Quanex Corp. v.
