Plaintiffs, domestic producers of certain off-the-road (\u201cOTR\u201d) tires, contest the Department of Commerce\u2019s (\u201cCommerce\u201d) exclusion of defendant-intervenor Xuzhou Xugong Ty-res Co., Ltd. (\u201cXugong\u201d), a Chinese producer of OTR tires, from the scope of a final antidumping (\u201cAD\u201d) determination. <em>See Certain New Pneumatic Off-The-RoacL-Tires from the People\u2019s Republic of China: Final Affirmative Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value and Partial Affirmative Determination of Critical Circumstances, </em>73 Fed. Reg. 40,485 (Dep\u2019t Commerce July 15, 2008) <em>CFinal Determination\u201d). </em>Bridgestone and Titan contest Commerce\u2019s determination that fifteen of the raw material inputs Xugong used in producing the tires were indirect materials. Titan also contests Commerce\u2019s refusal to include the amount of value-added tax (\u201cVAT\u201d) that Xugong paid in acquiring inputs to produce the tires, but was not refunded by the Chinese government, in Xugong\u2019s normal value calculation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Xugong opposes the motions, Commerce opposes Titan\u2019s motion as to the unrefunded VAT but seeks a remand to reconsider and explain its decision as to the fifteen inputs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For the following reasons, Bridgestone\u2019s motion will be granted in part and denied in part, and Titan\u2019s motion will be granted in part and denied in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-6\">In July 2007, Commerce initiated an AD investigation to determine whether imports of certain pneumatic OTR tires from the People\u2019s Republic of China for the period of October 1, 2006 through March 31, 2007, were being sold in the United States at less than fair value. <em>See Initiation of Antidumping Duty Investigation: Certain New Pneumatic Off-the-Road Tires From the People\u2019s Republic of China, </em>72 Fed. Reg. 43,591 (Dep\u2019t Commerce Aug. 6, 2007). Commerce selected Xugong as a mandatory respondent. <em>Certain New Pneumatic Off-The-Road Tires From the People\u2019s Republic of China; Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value and Postponement of Final Determination, </em>73 Fed. Reg. 9278, 9282-83 (Dep\u2019t Commerce Feb. 20, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number>2008) (\u201cPreliminary Determination\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In a preliminary determination, Commerce calculated a dumping margin of 51.81% for Xugong. <em>Id. </em>at 9291.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-4\">After the preliminary determination, Commerce issued Xugong a supplemental questionnaire requesting clarifying information and an updated factors of production (\u201cFOP\u201d) database for the purpose of calculating normal value to compare with the United States price.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (See Xugong\u2019s Fifth Supplemental Questionnaire Resp. (\u201cFifth Supplemental Questionnaire\u201d), Exs. Accompanying the Resp. Br. of Xugong (\u201cXugong\u2019s App.\u201d) Tab 1.) In addition to providing the requested information, Xugong informed Commerce that fifteen of the raw material inputs it previously reported as direct materials were in fact indirect materials, as they were used for \u201ccleaning or supplemental purpose[s] in the production process,\u201d and included the corrections in the updated database. (Fifth Supplemental Questionnaire 4, Xugong\u2019s App. Tab 1.) Commerce had treated the fifteen inputs as direct materials in calculating the preliminary dumping margin. (See <em>Surrogate Value Memorandum, </em>A-570-912, POR 10/01/06-3/31/07, at 3 n.6 (Feb. 5, 2008), Xugong\u2019s App. Tab 12.) Although Bridgestone requested that Commerce \u201cverify that.. . each of [the fifteen] inputs is properly treated as overhead and cannot be reported as a direct input\u201d (Pre-Verification Comments 4, Xugong\u2019s App. Tab 3), Commerce\u2019s verification report does not discuss the nature of the inputs (see Verification Report, Xugong\u2019s App. Tab 4).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In their case briefs submitted after verification, none of the parties addressed the issue of whether the fifteen inputs were direct or indirect materials. In its case brief, however, Titan did argue that Commerce should have included in normal value the amount of VAT that the Chinese producers had paid to acquire inputs in producing the goods but which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number>the Chinese government had not refunded. (Pet\u2019r\u2019s Case Br. (\u201cTitan\u2019s Case Br. \u201d) 13-19, App. in Supp. of Defs.\u2019 Resp. to Pis.\u2019 Mot. for J. Upon the Administrative R. Tab 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-4\">In July 2008, Commerce published a final determination, calculating a zero dumping margin for Xugong. <em>Final Determination, </em>73 Fed. Reg. at 40,488. In its calculations, Commerce did not include unre-funded VAT in Xugong\u2019s normal value because its surrogate value methodology did not rely on Chinese prices and costs. <em>Issues and Decision Memorandum for the Antidumping Investigation of Certain New Pneumatic Off-the-Road Tires from the People\u2019s Republic of China, </em>A-570-912, POR 10/1/2006-3/31/2007, at 21 (July 7, 2008), available at http://ia.ita.doc.gov/frn/summary/PRC/E8-16156-l.pdf <em>(\u201cIssues and Decision Memorandum\u201d). </em>Commerce also reasoned that the normal value was already tax neutral and therefore no adjustment for unrefunded VAT was warranted. <em>Id. </em>Commerce did not address the nature of the fifteen inputs in its issues and decision memorandum, but in a separate memorandum calculating Xugong\u2019s final dumping margin, it stated: \u201cBecause there is no evidence that these raw materials are direct materials, we have treated all 15 inputs as indirect materials and excluded them from the calculation of the normal value.\u201d <em>(Analysis Memorandum for the Final Determination: Xuzhou Xugong Tyres Co., Ltd., </em>A-570-912, POR 10/01/06-3/31/07, at 3 (July 7, 2008) <em>(\u201cFinal Analysis Memorandum </em>\u201d), App. of Docs. Cited in Bridgstone\u2019s Br. in Supp. of Mot. for J. on the Agency R. (\u201cBridgestone\u2019s App.\u201d) Tab 21.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-5\">Thereafter, Bridgestone and Titan submitted comments, contending that Commerce\u2019s treatment of the fifteen inputs as indirect materials was a \u201cministerial error.\u201d (Comments Regarding Ministerial Errors In The Final Margin Calculations For Xugong 2-12, Bridge-stone\u2019s App. Tab 26.) Commerce rejected the contention.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>{Final Determination of Antidumping Duty Investigation on Certain New Pneumatic Off-The-Road Tires from the People\u2019s Republic of China: Allegations of Ministerial Errors, </em>A-570-912, POR 10/01/06-03/31/07, at 7 (Aug. 14, 2008) <em>{\u201cMinisterial Errors Memorandum\u201d), </em>Bridgestone\u2019s App. Tab 27.) Bridgestone and Titan then commenced separate actions, challenging Commerce\u2019s exclusion of Xugong from the final determination. (Titan\u2019s Compl \u00b6 1; Bridge-stone\u2019s Compl. \u00b6 1.) Xugong intervened in both (Order (No. 08-00258) (Sept. 25, 2008); Order (No. 08-00256) (Sept. 23, 2008)), and the actions were consolidated (Order (Dec. 22, 2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1044\">*1044</page-number>Bridgestone and Titan now. move for judgment on the agency record pursuant to USCIT Rule 56.2. Both contend that Commerce\u2019s treatment of the fifteen inputs as indirect materials was unsupported by substantial evidence and not in accordance with law and that substantial evidence actually shows that the inputs were direct materials. (Bridgestone\u2019s Br. in Supp. of Mot. for J. on the Agency R. (\u201cBridgestone\u2019s Br.\u201d) 13-25, 31; Br. of Titan in Supp. of Mot. for J. Upon the Agency R. (\u201cTitan\u2019s Br.\u201d) 14-22.) Titan also argues that Commerce\u2019s refusal to include the amount of unrefunded VAT in Xugong\u2019s normal value calculation was unsupported by substantial evidence and not in accordance with law. (Titan\u2019s Br. 12-14, 22.) Bridgestone and Titan request that the court remand the matter with instructions directing Commerce to reclassify the fifteen inputs as direct materials and to recalculate Xugong\u2019s dumping margin accordingly. (Bridgestone\u2019s Br. 31; Titan\u2019s Br. 22-23.) Bridgestone additionally requests that the court instruct Commerce to value thirteen of the inputs as it had valued them in the preliminary determination and, with respect to the remaining two, to consider the proper Harmonized Tariff Schedule (\u201cHTS\u201d) classification to use in valuing them.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Bridgestone\u2019s Br. 31.) Titan also requests that the court direct Commerce to include unrefunded VAT in the recalculation. (Titan\u2019s Br. 22-23.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-3\">JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-4\">The court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(c). The court must uphold Commerce\u2019s final determination in an AD investigation unless it is \u201cunsupported by substantial evidence on the record, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(l)(B)(i). \u201cCommerce\u2019s findings must be reached by reasoned decision-making, including a reasoned explanation supported by a stated connection between the facts found and the choice made. \u201d <em>Rhodia, Inc. v. United States, </em>185 F. Supp. 2d 1343, 1349 (CIT 2001) (internal quotation marks, citations, and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-6\">I. Direct/Indirect Materials</p>\n<p id=\"Aqe\">\n<em>A. Procedural Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-7\">Titan argues that Commerce\u2019s change of position as to the treatment of the fifteen inputs in the final determination was not in accordance with law because Xugong\u2019s case brief did not contest Commerce\u2019s treatment of the inputs as direct materials in the pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1045\">*1045</page-number>liminary determination and Titan therefore did not have an opportunity to rebut Xugong\u2019s corrections. (Titan\u2019s Br. 18-19.) Titan argues that under 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.309(c)(2), Xugong was required to raise the issue so that Titan was afforded notice and an opportunity to be heard. <em>(Id. </em>at 18-22). Titan\u2019s reliance on 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.309(c)(2) is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-4\">Interested parties in an AD investigation may submit case briefs after publication of a preliminary determination to raise arguments that the parties want Commerce to consider before it renders a final determination. <em>See </em>19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.309(c)(l)(i). Under 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.309(c)(2), the case briefs \u201cmust present all arguments that continue in the submitter\u2019s view to be relevant to [Commerce\u2019s] final determination or final results, including any arguments presented before the date of publication of the preliminary determination or preliminary results.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 351.309(c)(2). Titan claims that the requirement to \u201cpresent all arguments\u201d precluded Commerce from changing its position \u201coutside normal briefing procedures when [Titan] could have briefed [the issue of the nature of the fifteen inputs] and thereby subjected it to full examination.\u201d (Titan\u2019s Br. 19.) Titan contends that <em>Corus Staal BV v. United States, </em>502 F.3d 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2007), <em>Nakornthai Strip Mill Public Co. v. United States, </em>558 F. Supp. 2d 1319 (CIT 2008), and <em>Ta Chen Stainless Steel Pipe, Ltd. v. United States, </em>342 F. Supp. 2d 1191 (CIT 2004) support its assertion that adherence to 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.309(c)(2) is essential to fair procedure. <em>(Id. </em>at 19-20.) These cases, however, state that the requirement to present all arguments is to ensure that parties have exhausted their administrative remedies. <em>See Corus, </em>502 F.3d at 1378; <em>Nakornthai, </em>558 F. Supp. 2d at 1329; <em>Ta Chen, </em>342 F. Supp. 2d at 1205-06. The doctrine of administrative exhaustion \u201crequires a party to present its claims to the relevant administrative agency for the agency\u2019s consideration before raising these claims to the Court.\u201d <em>Timken Co. v. United States, </em>201 F. Supp. 2d 1316, 1340 (CIT 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-5\">Here, Titan is not arguing that Xugong is barred from asserting that the fifteen inputs were indirect materials because Xugong failed to present that position to Commerce and Commerce therefore did not have an opportunity to consider it. In fact, Xugong had presented it, and Commerce had considered it. <em>(See Final Analysis Memorandum </em>at 3, Bridgestone\u2019s App. Tab 21.) Rather, Titan is contending that Commerce\u2019s adoption of Xugong\u2019s position was procedurally unfair because Titan did not have notice of the position and therefore did not have an opportunity to rebut the position. Titan does not cite any authority for the proposition that 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.309(c)(2) is intended to afford notice and opportunity to be heard such that a private party may rely on it to bar another\u2019s judicial challenge. In any event, the record shows that Titan had notice of Xugong\u2019s submissions and could have challenged them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1046\">*1046</page-number>Subject to time limitations, parties are entitled to submit corrected information, as acceptance of corrections effectuate \u201cthe overarching principle of the antidumping statute, that is, to determine dumping margins as accurately as possible.\u201d <em>Timken U.S. Corp. v. United States, </em>318 F. Supp. 2d 1271,1277-79 (CIT 2004) (permitting respondent to submit previously misclassified home market sales after preliminary determination in tenth administrative review); <em>see also An-tidumping Duties; Countervailing Duties, </em>62 Fed. Reg. 27,296, 27,327 (Dep\u2019t Commerce May 19, 1997) (\u201cPrior to the deadline for submission of factual information, the Department\u2019s practice normally is to accept a respondent\u2019s correction of an error in its own data because the Department has time to review, analyze, and where applicable, verify the corrected data.\u201d). Here, Xugong timely submitted the corrections. Pursuant to 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.301(b)(1), the deadline to submit new factual information was March 18, 2008, seven days before the start of verification of another mandatory respondent. (Notifications Regarding Deadline for New Factual Information, Xugong\u2019s App. Tab 2.) Xugong submitted the corrected information on March 11, 2008. (Letter accompanying Fifth Supplemental Questionnaire, Xugong\u2019s App. Tab 1.) Commerce did not begin verification of Xugong until April 1, 2008. (Verification Report 1, Xugong\u2019s App. Tab 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-3\">Undermining Titan\u2019s claim of lack of notice is the fact that Bridge-stone was aware of the corrected information and had requested that Commerce ascertain the nature of the fifteen inputs at verification. <em>0See </em>Pre-Verification Comments 4, Xugong\u2019s App. Tab 3.) Also, Titan could have expected that Commerce would treat the fifteen inputs as indirect materials. Before verification, Commerce informed Xugong that it would examine \u201cthe most recent . . . [FOP] databases reported.\u201d (Verification Agenda 4, Bridgestone\u2019s App. Tab 13.) After verification and before filing of the case briefs, Commerce requested that Xugong correct certain information and submit a revised FOP database. <em>(See </em>Re-submission of Revised Databases, Xugong\u2019s App. Tab 7.) Nothing in the record indicates that Commerce had ever requested Xugong to reclassify any of the fifteen inputs as direct inputs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-4\">Titan also could have objected to Xugong\u2019s corrections. Interested parties \u201cmay submit factual information to rebut, clarify, or correct factual information submitted by any other interested party.\u201d 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.301(c)(1). At a minimum, like Bridgestone, Titan could have requested that Commerce verify the nature of the inputs. To the extent that Titan may argue that such a request would be futile, as Commerce did not address the issue in its verification report, Titan could have sought further clarification as to Commerce\u2019s position. <em>See Antidumping Duties; Countervailing Duties, </em>62 Fed. Reg. at 27,332 (\u201cParties are free to comment on verification reports and to make arguments concerning information in the reports up to and including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1047\">*1047</page-number>the filing of case and rebuttal briefs. \u201d) Given the record, Titan cannot claim that it was not afforded notice or opportunity to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-4\">Bridgestone and Titan also argue that Xugong abandoned its position with respect to two of the inputs. Specifically, they contend that Xugong\u2019s insistence that Commerce use the same HTS classifications as those used in the preliminary determination, and its failure to argue that HTS classification was not necessary for indirect materials, in its rebuttal brief constituted an implicit admission that the two inputs were direct materials. (Bridgestone\u2019s Br. 23-24; Titan\u2019s Br. 21-22); <em>see supra </em>note 7. It is true that Xugong insisted that Commerce continue using the same HTS classifications, but Xugong explained that it was merely rebutting Bridgestone and Titan\u2019s argument regarding the selection of surrogate values. (See <em>Ministerial Error Memorandum </em>at 7, Bridgestone\u2019s App. Tab 27; Xugong\u2019s Rebuttal Case Br. 27-29, Bridgestone\u2019s App. Tab 18.) Xugong never explicitly disavowed its position as to the inputs. Given the lack of evidence of intentional relinquishment of the claim, the court does not conclude that Xugong had abandoned its position as to the two inputs. See <em>Former Employees of Quality Fabricating, Inc. v. United States Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>343 F. Supp. 2d 1272, 1287-88 (CIT 2004) (holding that plaintiffs did not abandon claim merely by opposing motion for voluntary remand absent evidence of intentional relinquishment or abandonment). Further, looking at the circumstances as a whole, Xugong reasonably could have concluded that Commerce had accepted its corrections as part of the record, and it would be unreasonable to assume that Xugong abandoned a position that would have seemed to it to have been decided in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-5\">\n<em>B. Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-6\">Bridgestone and Titan argue that Commerce\u2019s treatment of the inputs as indirect materials is unsupported by substantial evidence, and that the court should remand the matter to Commerce for recalculation of the dumping margin. (Bridgestone\u2019s Br. 16-24; Titan\u2019s Br. 14-18.) They further contend that the court should instruct Commerce to treat the inputs as direct materials because substantial evidence shows that they were direct in nature. (Bridgestone\u2019s Br. 18-24; Titan\u2019s Br. 14-18.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-7\">Here, the only evidence on the record that could support Commerce\u2019s determination is Xugong\u2019s claim that it used the fifteen inputs for \u201ccleaning or supplemental\u201d purposes. (Fifth Supplemental Questionnaire 4, Xugong\u2019s App. Tab 1.) This statement, however, is conclusory, and Xugong did not provide any further information as to the use of the inputs. Further, Commerce did not cite cleaning or supplemental purposes as a reason for its treatment of the inputs. The only explanation it provided is that \u201cthere is no evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1048\">*1048</page-number>these raw materials are direct materials.\u201d <em>(Final Analysis Memora-dum </em>at 3, Bridgestone\u2019s App. Tab 21.) Accordingly, the court cannot conclude that the record provides substantial evidence supporting Commerce\u2019s determination. The court also cannot conclude that Commerce\u2019s rationale was \u201ca reasoned explanation supported by a stated connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u201d <em>Rhodia, </em>185 F. Supp. 2d at 1349. Indeed, Commerce itself admits that it \u201cha[d] not fully explained its reasons for treating the[] raw material inputs as indirect materials\u201d and requested a remand to \u201creconsider its decision and address certain information on the record relating to the raw material inputs in question and provide a reasoned explanation for [its] actions.\u201d (Government\u2019s Resp. Br. 28.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-4\">The court, however, disagrees with Bridgestone and Titan that substantial evidence shows that the inputs were direct materials. The record does not provide information sufficient for the court to determine how the inputs were used in the production process. As to the contention that Commerce treated certain of the fifteen inputs as direct materials in calculating the dumping margin for the other respondents, the court cannot discern whether these inputs are in fact the same materials and, even if so, whether they were used in the same manner by those respondents. As \u201cfactual determinations supporting anti-dumping margins are best left to the agency\u2019s expertise,\u201d <em>F.lli De Ceceo Di Filippo Fara S. Martino S.p.A. v. United States, </em>216 F.3d 1027, 1032 (Fed. Cir. 2000), it would be more appropriate to let Commerce determine the nature of each of the fifteen inputs.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On remand, Commerce should reconsider the nature of each of the fifteen inputs separately and, if necessary, reopen the record to allow the parties to submit relevant information.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-5\">II. Unrefunded VAT</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-6\">Titan argues that Commerce acted arbitrarily and illogically in refusing to include the amount of unrefunded VAT in Xugong\u2019s normal value calculation. (Titan\u2019s Br. 12.) Titan contends that the logic underlying Commerce\u2019s inclusion of unrecovered VAT as a cost of production in the \u201cconstructed value\u201d of goods produced in market economy (\u201cME\u201d) countries should also apply in nonmarket economy (\u201cNME\u201d) cases where NME producers have paid VAT to obtain inputs to produce the goods. <em>(Id. </em>at 12-14.) Titan asserts that because Xugong had paid VAT in acquiring inputs for production of the subject merchandise, and the Chinese government refunded only a portion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1049\">*1049</page-number>the VAT paid, the amount of unrefunded VAT constitutes a cost that Xugong incurred in producing the subject goods and should be included in the normal value calculation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>at 13.) Titan asserts that \u201cstrictly as a practical matter no meaningful distinction exists between the ME and NME producers so far as the impact of VAT is concerned.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 12.) Titan\u2019s argument is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-4\">In ME cases, Commerce determines the normal value of goods by looking at home market sales or, if home market sales are insufficient, at third country sales. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)(l)(B)-(C); 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.404; <em>AIMCOR, </em>141 F.3d at 1101. If Commerce cannot determine the normal value from home market or third country sales, it uses a \u201cconstructed value\u201d of the subject merchandise as the normal value. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)(4); 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.405(a). The constructed value is established by applying a statutory formula, and it includes the cost of materials, certain expenses and profits, and packing costs. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(e). The statute states that the \u201ccost of materials\u201d used in determining the constructed value \u201cshall be determined without regard to any internal tax in the exporting country imposed on such materials or their disposition which are remitted or refunded upon exportation of the subject merchandise produced from such materials.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Based on this statutory language, the Federal Circuit has held that, to the extent VAT paid on inputs has not been recovered by the foreign producer upon exportation of the subject goods, the unrecovered VAT may be included as a cost of materials in the constructed value. <em>See Elkem Metals Co. v. United States, </em>468 F.3d 795, 802-03 (Fed. Cir. 2006); <em>Camargo Correa Metals, S.A. v. United States, </em>200 F.3d 771, 774 (Fed. Cir. 1999); <em>AIMCOR, </em>141 F.3d at 1108-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-5\">The AD laws distinguish between ME and NME cases. Congress recognizes that NME countries, unlike ME countries, \u201cdo[] not operate on market principles of cost or pricing structures, so that sales of merchandise in such countries] do not reflect the fair value of the merchandise.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(18)(A). Thus, where merchandise is exported from a NME country, Commerce may not be able to calculate the normal value using the methods that it employs in valuing goods from ME countries. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1677b(c)(l). Where goods are exported from a NME country and available information does not permit normal value calculation using the methods in \u00a7 1677b(a), Commerce \u201cshall determine the normal value of the subject merchandise on the basis of the value of the [FOP] utilized in producing the merchandise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1677b(c)(l); <em>see </em>19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.408(a). Valuation of the FOP is based on \u201cthe best available information regarding the values of such factors\u201d in a surrogate ME country or countries. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(c)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1050\">*1050</page-number>Here, Commerce classified China as a NME country and determined that India was the most appropriate surrogate ME country to use to value the FOP. <em>Final Determination, </em>73 Fed. Reg. at 40,487. Commerce therefore used Indian surrogate values, rather than actual Chinese costs and prices, in calculating Xugong\u2019s normal value. Although Xugong paid VAT to acquire inputs in producing the subject goods, the Chinese VAT system is part of the \u201ccost or pricing structure\u201d of China. Pursuant to the statute, Commerce has determined that elements of the Chinese \u201ccost or pricing structure\u201d should not be used in calculating the normal value, as the elements do not reflect the fair market value of the merchandise. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1677(18)(A), 1677b(c)(l). Because the surrogate value methodology used here does not rely on Chinese prices and costs, the amount of unrefunded VAT is irrelevant to the normal value calculation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1072-4\">Further, Xugong\u2019s normal value is already tax neutral. The Indian surrogate values used here are exclusive of Indian taxes, <em>Issues and Decision Memorandum </em>at 21, and Commerce\u2019s \u201cnormal methodology\u201d is to exclude VAT from antidumping calculations involving goods from NME countries, <em>Issues and Decision Memorandum for the Final Results of Polyethylene Retail Carrier Bags (\u201cPRCBs\u201d) from the People\u2019s Republic of China (\u201cPRC\u201d), </em>A-570-886, POR 8/1/05-7/31/06, at 4-5 (Dep\u2019t Commerce Mar. 10, 2008), available at http://ia.ita.doc.gov/ frn/summary/PRC/E8-5300-l.pdf. As the normal value calculation is net of taxes, an adjustment for unrefunded VAT would be inappropriate. <em>See Notice of Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Manganese Metal From the People\u2019s Republic of China, </em>60 Fed. Reg. 56,045, 56,052 (Dep\u2019t Commerce Nov. 6, 1995) (\u201cBecause the [foreign market value] is net of taxes, neither a downward adjustment to [foreign market value] nor the alternative upward adjustment to [the United States price] suggested by respondents is necessary.\u201d) In any event, as the surrogate values used here are independent of the elements of the cost or pricing structures in China, any adjustment for Chinese VAT would be unwarranted. Accordingly, Commerce\u2019s refusal to include unrefunded VAT is in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-6\">Based on the foregoing, the court remands this matter to Commerce to reconsider whether each of the fifteen inputs was a direct or indirect material, to reopen the record as appropriate, and to recal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1051\">*1051</page-number>culate the dumping margin accordingly. If Commerce concludes that the inputs [\u00b6] ]] were direct materials, it should also consider the proper valuation of those inputs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-4\">Commerce shall file its remand determination with the court within sixty days of this date. Titan, Bridgestone, and Xugong have eleven days thereafter to file objections, and Commerce will have seven days thereafter to file its response.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1063-7\"> Bridgestone initially joined in this argument but has abandoned it. <em>{See </em>Order of Partial Dismissal (June 2, 2009); Partial Consent Mot. for Partial Dismissal.)

United States, </em>141 F.3d 1098, 1101 (Fed. Cir. 1998). Where dumping causes or threatens material injury to a domestic industry, an AD duty is imposed upon the dumped merchandise. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673. The AD duty assessed is \u201c an amount equal to the amount by which the normal value exceeds the export price (or the constructed export price) for the merchandise. \u201d19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673; <em>see </em>AIMCOR, 141 F.3d at 1101 (stating that dumping margin is \u201cthe amount by which the foreign market value of the goods exceeds their United States price.\u201d)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1064-8\"> Commerce, however, conferred with Xugong regarding the use of one of the inputs, [\u00b6] ]], but it was to determine how Xugong recorded purchases of certain inputs, not to verify the nature of the fifteen inputs at issue here.

In their joint case brief, Bridgestone and Titan contended that Commerce should apply HTS [\u00b6] ]] and HTS [\u00b6] ]] in calculating the final dumping margin, as opposed to HTS [\u00b6] ]] and HTS [\u00b6] ]], which Commerce applied in the preliminary determination. Commerce did not address the issue because it decided that it did not need to value the inputs. <em>Confidential Data Deleted</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1070-7\"> Bridgestone argues that there is a presumption that inputs are direct materials unless affirmative evidence shows otherwise, and suggests that the presumption applies here because Xugong failed to meet its burden of providing such affirmative evidence. (Bridge-stone\u2019s Br. 13-15.) Even if such a presumption exists, applying it here would be inappropriate because it is unclear whether Commerce even apprised Xugong that it needed to submit evidence such that Xugong had an opportunity to rebut the presumption. <em>See Transcom, Inc. v.
