The parties are in dispute over the correct tariff classification of a frozen dessert known as mellorine, imported by Plaintiff. For the reasons set forth below, Plaintiff\u2019s motion is granted in part and denied in part, and Defendant\u2019s motion is granted in part and denied in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1914-8\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1914-9\">Plaintiff is an importer of mellorine from the Philippines.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The parties are not in dispute as to the nature of mellorine: it is marketed and sold as a frozen dessert, with a consistency and manner of consumption similar to ice cream; it is eaten in a frozen state in bowls, ice cream cones and sundaes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The six specific varieties of mellorine involved in this lawsuit are Ube Royale (made with purple yam), Quezo Royale (also known as Quezo Real) (made with cheese), Fruit Salad, Mango, Macapuno (made with coconut preserve), and Durian.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Mellorine is manufactured from a variety of ingredients, including water, refined sugar, vegetable oil, fruit puree or preserve, corn syrup, skim milk powder, whey, stabilizers, emulsifiers, artificial food flavors, and maltodextrin.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Depending on variety, mellorine may also contain cheese, whole milk powder, purple yam or pieces of fruit.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Mellorine is manufactured by adding fruit or vegetable purees and artificial colors and flavors to a base mixture, and then partially freezing the result.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Once partially frozen, distinguishing fruit pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1893\">*1893</page-number>serves, vegetable pieces or cheese are then added, before the product is completely frozen, packaged and ready for sale.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1915-4\">Customs and Border Protection (\u201cCustoms\u201d) classified Plaintiff\u2019s mellorine under HTSUS heading 2105 for \u201cIce cream and other edible ice, whether or not containing cocoa.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Specifically, Customs classified mellorine under HTSUS subheading 2105.00.40,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which applies to \u201cdairy products described in additional U.S. note 1 to chapter 4.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Additional U.S. note 1 to chapter 4 encompasses three categories of dairy products, separated by semicolons.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Customs classified Plaintiff\u2019s product under HTSUS subheading 2105.00.40 because it regards mellorine as falling within the first of these three categories as an \u201carticleO of milk or cream.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1915-5\">Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1915-6\">Plaintiff moves the Court for partial summary judgment, asking the Court \u201cto issue an order determining that [General Rule of Interpretation] GRI 3(b) controls the proper tariff classification of mellor-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1894\">*1894</page-number>ine and to construe the term \u2018articles of milk\u2019 in additional U.S. note 1 to Chapter 4 to exclude merchandise in which milk constitutes a minor ingredient, compared to the predominant ingredients.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Defendant moves the Court for summary judgment in favor of its proffered classification, asserting that mellorine is properly classified as \u201cice cream and other edible ice\u201d and as a \u201cdairy product described in additional U.S. note 1 to Chapter 4.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1916-4\">Jurisdiction And Standard Of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b1916-5\">This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(a). \u201cPartial summary judgment is appropriate when it appears that some aspects of a claim are not genuinely controvertible and genuine issues remain regarding the rest of the claim.\u201d <em>Ugg Int\u2019l, Inc. v. United States, </em>17 CIT 79, 83, 813 F. Supp. 848, 852 (1993) (quotations and citations omitted).

Cir. 2002) (internal quotations and citations omitted). A party challenging Customs\u2019 preferred classification may satisfy its burden of proof simply by demonstrating that Customs\u2019 classification is incorrect, without necessarily providing the correct classification. <em>See Jarvis Clark Co. v. United States, </em>733 F.2d 873, 878 (Fed. Cir. 1984). Ultimately, it is \u201cthe court\u2019s duty ... to find the <em>correct </em>result, by whatever procedure is best suited to the case at hand.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court of International Trade reviews Customs\u2019 protest decisions \u201cupon the basis of the record made before the court.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2640(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1916-7\">When there is a dispute over classification, the court first undertakes the legal question to \u201cconstrue the relevant classification headings\u201d and then undertakes the factual question to \u201cdetermine under which of the properly construed tariff terms the merchandise at issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1895\">*1895</page-number>falls.\u201d <em>Bausch &amp; Lomb, Inc. v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1363, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 1998). When \u201cthe nature of the merchandise is undisputed, . . . the classification issue collapses entirely into a question of law.\u201d <em>Cummins Inc. v. United States, </em>454 F.3d 1361, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1917-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1917-5\">I. <em>Mellorine Is Properly Classifiable Under HTSUS Heading 2105</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1917-6\">A. Parties\u2019 Contentions as to HTSUS Heading</p>\n<p id=\"b1917-7\">The first challenge Plaintiff brings in its motion for partial summary judgment is to the appropriate tariff heading of the HTSUS for mellorine. Plaintiff contends that mellorine is a \u201ccomposite good\u201d and therefore should be classified according to GRI 3(b).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Plaintiff asserts that if GRI 3(b) controls classification, mellorine would either fall under heading 0811, which covers \u201cfruit and nuts, uncooked or cooked by steaming or boiling in water, frozen, whether or not containing added sugar or other sweetening matter,\u201d or heading 2106, which covers \u201c[flood preparations not elsewhere specified or included.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Plaintiff argues for heading 0811 on the basis of the large quantity, by weight, of fruit in each of the varieties of mellorine.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1917-8\">Defendant responds by asserting that only products with \u201csmall quantities of sugar\u201d may be classified in heading 0811, and that products such as mellorine, which contain \u201csignificant levels of sugar and syrups\u201d cannot be so classified.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Defendant also asserts that the small quantities of sugar permitted in frozen fruit and nuts under heading 0811 may only be added in order to \u201cinhibit oxidation and thus prevent 0 the change of colour which would otherwise occur, generally on thawing out,\u201d and that sugar is not added to Plaintiff\u2019s mellorine for that purpose.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Last, Defendant argues that the pres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1896\">*1896</page-number>ence of multiple additional ingredients including \u201cvegetable oil, skim milk powders, com syrup, stabilizers, emulsifiers, artificial flavors, artificial colors, and maltodextrin\u201d means that mellorine is not prima facie classifiable under heading 0811.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1918-4\">Defendant also advances arguments in support of its own preferred tariff classification, heading 2105. Defendant asserts that the heading for \u201cIce cream and other edible ices\u201d is an <em>eo nomine </em>provision, and that products described by the specific name of the heading are therefore appropriately classified in that heading.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> For a definition of what constitutes an \u201cedible ice,\u201d Defendant points to a food science textbook which states</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1918-5\">The broad term, frozen desserts, refers to ice cream and related products. Specific products include ice cream and its lower fat varieties, frozen custard, frozen yogurt, mellorine (vegetable fat frozen dessert), sherbet, water ice and frozen confections. Some of these desserts are served either soft frozen or hard frozen. . . . The broader category, frozen desserts, also called edible ice, includes products that contain no milk-derived ingredients, e.g., water ices.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1918-6\">(Def.\u2019s MSJ 10 <em>(quoting Ice Cream </em>1 (2003 6th edition) (emphasis added)).) Defendant also cites to the explanatory notes for heading 2105 which state \u201c[t]his heading covers ice cream, which is usually prepared with a basis of milk or cream, and other edible ice <em>{e.g. </em>sherbet and iced lollipops) whether or not containing cocoa in any proportion.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Finally, Defendant points to regulations issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) which indicate that ice cream, mellorine and sherbet are all members of a broader category of \u201cfrozen desserts.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1918-7\">B. Analysis of HTSUS Heading</p>\n<p id=\"b1918-8\">HTSUS GRIs direct the proper classification of all merchandise and are \u201capplied in numerical order.\u201d <em>Carl Zeiss, Inc. v. United States, </em>195 F.3d 1375, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 1999). The court may not consult any subsequent GRI unless the proper classification cannot be determined by reference to GRI 1. <em>Conair Corp. v. United States, </em>29 CIT 888, 891 (2005) <em>(citing Mita Copystar Am. v. United States, </em>160 F. 3d 710, 712 (Fed. Cir. 1998). According to GRI 1, \u201cclassification shall be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative section or chapter notes[.]\u201d HTSUS GRI 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1919-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1897\">*1897</page-number>The heading under which Customs classified mellorine is HTSUS 2105, \u201cIce cream and other edible ice, whether or not containing cocoa.\u201d HTSUS heading 2105. Mellorine is not ice cream, nor do the parties contend that it is, so the first issue for the Court to decide is whether mellorine is an \u201cother edible ice\u201d within the meaning of this heading.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The term \u201cother edible ice\u201d is not explicitly defined within the HTSUS, and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has explained that in such circumstances, the court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1919-4\">may rely upon its own understanding of terms used, and may consult standard lexiographic and scientific authorities to determine the common meaning of a tariff term. In addition, the court may look to the Explanatory Notes accompanying a tariff subheading as a persuasive, but not binding, interpretative guide.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1919-5\"><em>Value Vinyls, Inc. v. United States, </em>568 F.3d 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (internal citations and quotations omitted). After conducting such analysis, the Court concludes that \u201cother edible ice\u201d plainly includes mellorine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1919-6\">The Court is persuaded by the three authorities cited by Defendant that mellorine is a type of edible ice within the meaning of heading 2105. First, the Court notes that the food science textbook cited by Defendant indicates that the term \u201cedible ice\u201d is interchangeable with the term \u201cfrozen dessert.\u201d <em>See </em>Robert T. Marshall, H. Douglas Goff &amp; Richard W. Hartel, <em>Ice Cream </em>1 (6th ed. 2003). As both parties have acknowledged that mellorine is a frozen dessert,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> it follows that mellorine is also an edible ice. Second, the Explanatory Notes for heading 21.05 list as examples of other edible ice: \u201csherbet, iced lollipops.\u201d <em>Explanatory Notes </em>21.05. Sherbet, like mellorine, is a frozen dessert with some dairy component; a dictionary definition of sherbet is \u201ca water ice to which milk, egg white, or gelatin is added before freezing.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>2094 (1981). The Court is persuaded that the composition of mellorine is sufficiently similar to sherbet to warrant the conclusion that mellor-ine is also a type of \u201cedible ice\u201d within the meaning of heading 2105. Third, the Food and Drug Administration regulations have grouped ice cream, goat\u2019s milk ice cream, mellorine, sherbet and water ices under the heading \u201cfrozen dessert,\u201d which is further persuasive evidence in support of Customs\u2019 position. <em>See </em>21 C.F.R. Part 135 (2006). Taken together, the Court concludes that these three sources provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1898\">*1898</page-number>substantial justification for the conclusion that mellorine is an \u201cother edible ice\u201d within the meaning of HTSUS heading 2105.</p>\n<p id=\"b1920-4\">Having concluded that HTSUS 2105 is the appropriate heading for classifying mellorine, Plaintiff\u2019s second argument, that GRI 3(b) dictates that mellorine should be classified under heading 0811 as \u201cfruit and nuts\" is unavailing.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Resort to a later numbered GRI is inappropriate if the correct heading for the product in question can be determined under GRI 1, as in this case. <em>See Conair Corp., </em>29 CIT at 891. Moreover, mellorine does not meet the threshold requirement which permits classification pursuant to GRI 3(b); it is not <em>prima facie </em>classifiable under more than one heading. Mellorine, which the parties agree is \u201csimilar to ice cream in consistency and manner of consumption,\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> \u201cis eaten frozen in bowls, ice cream cones and sundaes,\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and is sometimes \u201creferred to as imitation ice cream,\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> is not made \u201cfruit and nuts\u201d for tariff classification purposes simply because select varieties of mellorine are flavored with such ingredients. Consequently, as to the issue of the correct HTSUS heading, the Court finds that mellorine is classifiable under heading 2105 as \u201cIce cream and other edible ice, whether or not containing cocoa.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1920-5\">II. <em>Mellorine Is Not An Article Of Milk Or Cream Within The Meaning Of Additional U.S. Note 1 to Chapter 4 of the HT-SUS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1920-6\"><em>A. </em>Parties\u2019 Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b1920-7\">The Court now turns to the question of the appropriate subheading for the product in this case. Defendant classified mellorine under HTSUS subheading 2105.00.40, as \u201cdairy products described in additional U.S. note 1 to Chapter 4,\u201d because it maintains that mellor-ine is an \u201carticleQ of milk or cream.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Plaintiff argues that mellorine is not an article of milk or cream, and therefore is not a dairy product described in additional U.S. note 1 to Chapter 4.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1920-8\">As support for its position that mellorine is an article of milk or cream, Defendant points to a Customs tariff classification ruling from 1993: [\u00b6] 952776.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> In this ruling, the agency determined that \u201cbeverages which contain over 5 percent milk solids are considered to have an appreciable amount of milk.\u201d Customs Headquarters Ruling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1899\">*1899</page-number>Letter (February 10, 1993) (\u201cHQ 952776\u201d): The products classified in this ruling letter were three flavors of protein drink, each of which were comprised chiefly of water, sweetener and nonfat dry milk. <em>Id. </em>Defendant asserts that since issuing this ruling, Customs has consistently \u201capplied that 5% standard in determining what is an article of milk,\u201d and this ruling letter is consequently owed <em>Skidmore </em>deference and speaks persuasively on the appropriate classification of mellor-ine.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s position is that mellorine contains more than 5% milk, ergo it is an article of milk or cream.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1921-4\">The Plaintiff offers two legal bases for its position that mellorine is not an article \u00f3f milk or cream. First, Plaintiff points to <em>Wilsey Foods, Inc. v. United States, </em>18 CIT 212 (1994). In <em>Wilsey Foods, </em>the court construed a similar phrase to the one at issue in this litigation \u2014 \u201cfood preparations of milk or cream\u201d \u2014 under HTSUS 1901.90.3030. <em>Id. </em>The court found that the product in question was not a food preparation of milk or cream because \u201cmilk or cream [was] not the essential ingredient, not the ingredient of chief value, nor [was] it the preponderant ingrediente]\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 213. The court went on to note that the products were \u201ccomprised chiefly of vegetable fat and sugar and in any event were not considered milk or cream products in the industry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Plaintiff asserts that under this rubric, mellorine also is not an article of milk or cream.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1921-5\">Plaintiff goes on to point out that Customs itself actually relied on the framework of <em>Wilsey Foods </em>in another classification ruling, and that this ruling should be accorded <em>Skidmore </em>deference in the present case.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Plaintiff points to Customs Headquarters Ruling Letter [\u00b6] 965771, in which Customs determined that white chocolate with sweetener was not an article of milk or cream because, \u201cthe Court of International Trade has ruled in <em>Wilsey Foods ... </em>that products which are comprised chiefly of vegetable fat and sugar are not to be classified as articles of milk or cream.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Plaintiff argues that because mellorine is comprised chiefly of vegetable fat and sugar, it too should not be classified as an article of milk or cream.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1921-6\">The government contends that mellorine is an article of milk or cream, even under the rubric of <em>Wilsey Foods. </em>It asserts that \u201cthe dairy ingredients in the mellorine at issue are essential because mellorine is legally required to contain a significant percentage of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1900\">*1900</page-number>dairy.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Defendant also relies on the testimony of its expert witness, Dr. Bradley, that the frozen dessert industry considers mellorine to be a dairy product.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1922-4\">It should be noted that Arko Foods previously received a tariff classification letter for mellorine which determined the product was classifiable under HTSUS 2105.00.3000<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> or 2105.00.4000 as a dairy product described in additional U.S. note 1 to chapter 4. New York Ruling Letter (August 23, 2001) \u201cNYRL H83504\u201d. Notably, however, the government does not argue that this ruling letter is controlling on the Court\u2019s current decision, or even persuasive on the issue of classification.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Plaintiff also argues prophylactically that because the ruling letter \u201cwas not adopted pursuant to a deliberative notice and comment rulemaking process,\u201d it is not proper to accord the ruling <em>Skidmore </em>deference.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1922-5\">B. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b1922-6\">In a dispute over classification the Court is obliged to determine \u201cthe proper meaning of the tariff provisions at hand.\u201d <em>Universal Elees. Inc. v. United States, </em>112 F.3d 488, 491 (Fed. Cir. 1997.) Here, the Defendant asserts that of the various categories of dairy products \u201cdescribed in additional U.S. note 1 to chapter 4,\u201d the only one that pertains to mellorine is \u201carticles of milk or cream.\u201d This phrase is not defined in the HTSUS, and the parties dispute whether mellorine is an article of milk or cream. Therefore, the Court must construe the term to determine its proper meaning, and then decide whether the term encompasses mellorine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1922-7\">The Court finds that the Customs classification ruling pertaining to certain milk-based beverages, cited by Defendant, does not warrant <em>Skidmore </em>deference either in the Court\u2019s ultimate question \u2014 the proper classification of mellorine \u2014 or in the immediate task of construing the phrase \u201carticles of milk or cream.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1922-8\">Under the <em>Skidmore </em>standard articulated in <em>Mead, </em>a classification ruling may at least seek a respect proportional to its power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1901\">*1901</page-number>to persuade. <em>Mead </em>teaches that whether <em>Skidmore </em>deference should be afforded to a Customs classification ruling varies depending on its writer\u2019s thoroughness, logic, and expertness, its fit with prior interpretations, and any other sources of weight.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1923-4\"><em>Structural Indus., </em>356 F.3d at 1370 (internal citations and quotations omitted). Contrary to Defendant\u2019s characterization, [\u00b6] 952776 does not \u201cset forth a detailed and careful analysis for [Customs\u2019] determination of what may constitute an article of dairy.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Instead, the ruling letter addresses the considerably narrower question of what percentage of milk solids a beverage needs to have in order to \u201chave an appreciable amount of milk.\u201d [\u00b6] 952776 at 2. This ruling letter lacks the power to persuade in the present case because mellorine is not a beverage, and because the varieties of mellorine imported by Arko Foods contain not just water and sweeteners, but significant quantities of vegetable fat and various fruit purees and preserves as well.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Moreover, the Court is not concerned with the quantity of milk solids necessary to make a beverage have an \u201cappreciable amount of milk,\u201d but rather with what makes a food product an article of milk or cream.</p>\n<p id=\"b1923-5\">The Court is persuaded that the factors set out in <em>Wilsey Foods </em>for determining whether a product was a \u201cfood preparation of milk or cream\u201d provide an appropriate rubric for determining what constitutes an \u201carticle of milk or cream\u201d within the meaning of additional U.S. note 1 to Chapter 4 of the HTSUS.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Specifically, in determining if an item is an article of milk or cream, the Court will consider whether milk or cream is the essential ingredient, the ingredient of chief value, and the preponderant ingredient. <em>See Wilsey Foods, </em>18 CIT at 213. Additionally, the Court will consider any evidence that mellorine is considered an article of milk or cream within the industry. <em>See id. </em>On the basis of the record assembled before the Court, including various stipulations<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> by the parties, the Court concludes that mellorine is not an article of milk or cream.</p>\n<p id=\"b1924-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1902\">*1902</page-number>\n<em>1. Milk or Cream, is Not the Essential Ingredient</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1924-4\">In order for mellorine to be labeled and sold as such in the United States, it must conform with the \u201cstandard of identity\u201d set out by FDA regulation. In pertinent part, the regulation states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1924-5\">Mellorine is a food produced by freezing, while stirring, a pasteurized mix consisting of safe and suitable ingredients including, but not limited to, <em>milk derived nonfat solids </em>and <em>animal or vegetable fat, or both, only part of which may be milkfat. </em>Mel-lorine is sweetened with <em>nutritive carbohydrate sweetener </em>and is characterized by the addition of flavoring ingredients.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1924-6\">21 C.F.R. \u00a7 135.130(a)(1) (2006) (emphasis added). The Court finds that while \u201cmilk-derived nonfat solids\u201d make up <em>an </em>essential ingredient of mellorine, they do not make up <em>the </em>essential ingredient. According to this standard of identity, mellorine must also include animal or vegetable fat and nutritive carbohydrate sweetener.</p>\n<p id=\"b1924-7\">Moreover, the Court notes that the mere presence of milk-derived ingredients in a product does not make that product \u201can article of milk or cream\u201d within the meaning of additional U.S. note 1 to Chapter 4. For example, in other standards of identity issued by the FDA, there are products which are similarly required to have milk-derived ingredients, but which do not thereby become articles of milk or cream. For instance, 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 136.130, governing \u201cMilk bread, rolls, and buns,\u201d states that \u201cthe only moistening ingredient permitted in the preparation of the dough is milk or, as an alternative, a combination of dairy products [meeting certain technical specifications.]\u201d 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 136.130 (2006). Similarly, 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 139.120 requires that in milk macaroni products, \u201cmilk [or certain specified milk ingredients] is used as the sole moistening ingredient in preparing the dough.\u201d 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 139.120 (2006). That milk bread and milk macaroni are likely not \u201carticles of milk or cream\u201d within the meaning of additional U.S. note 1 to chapter 4 suggests that the mere presence of dairy in a given product is not controlling, and underscores that the multi-faceted consideration of <em>Wilsey Foods </em>is reasonable and justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b1924-8\">\n<em>2. Milk or Cream is Not the Ingredient of Chief Value in Most Varieties of Mellorine</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1924-9\">Turning to the second factor from <em>Wilsey Foods, </em>upon considering the stipulation of the parties indicating the relative value of the different ingredients in each flavor of mellorine, the Court finds that milk is not the ingredient of chief value in mellorine. Skim milk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1903\">*1903</page-number>powder is the ingredient of [\u00b6] ]] in [\u00b6] ]] varieties of mellorine, and in relative terms, the value of milk-derived ingredients is frequently a [\u00b6] ]] of the value of the signature fruit preserve or puree in each flavor.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> In one flavor of mellorine, [\u00b6] ]] is the ingredient of chief value, but if the value of [\u00b6] ]] in that flavor are combined, the milk-derived ingredients would fall to the same position it occupies in the other flavors of mellorine: second.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> The Court again notes, however, the prudence of allowing a three-part rubric to determine whether a given product is an article of milk or cream. When the relative value of milk-derived ingredients for this flavor of mellorine is considered alongside of the essentiality and preponderance of the milk-derived ingredients, it becomes clear that different flavors of mellorine do not require classification under different subheadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1925-8\">\n<em>3. Milk or Cream is not the Preponderant Ingredient in Mellorine</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1925-9\">As in <em>Wilsey Foods, </em>the Court finally considers whether milk or cream is the preponderant ingredient in mellorine. It is not. In most varieties of mellorine, there is more water, sugar, fruit preserve or puree and vegetable oil than milk. In order of preponderance, milk-derived ingredients range from third to sixth most prevalent ingredient among the varieties of mellorine at issue in this litigation.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1925-10\">\n<em>4. Other Considerations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1925-11\">In <em>Wilsey Foods, </em>after setting out the rubric analyzed above, the court also noted that \u201cin any event [the products] were not considered milk or cream products in the industry.\u201d <em>Wilsey Foods, </em>18 CIT at 213. Industry treatment is therefore not irrelevant to the Court\u2019s determination, and the Court considers the testimony of the government\u2019s expert witness that the frozen dessert industry considers mellorine to be a dairy product to have some persuasive weight. However, Dr. Bradley\u2019s testimony is of limited value because the Court\u2019s obligation is not to determine whether mellorine is a dairy product in general, but rather whether it is a specific type of dairy product: namely, a dairy product described in additional U.S. note 1 to Chapter 4 as an article of milk or cream. The question of whether mellorine is an article of milk or cream for tariff classification purposes is a decision that lies within the sole discretion of the Court on the basis of the record assembled before it. <em>See Jarvis Clark, </em>733 F.2d at 878 (\u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1904\">*1904</page-number>court\u2019s duty is to find the <em>correct </em>result\u201d) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1926-4\">Because the Court finds that milk or cream is not the essential ingredient, not the ingredient of chief value and not the preponderant ingredient in mellorine, the Court finds that the Plaintiff has carried its burden of proof, and rebutted the presumption of correctness that attaches to Customs\u2019 classification. However, as Plaintiff has not identified an alternative subheading within heading 2105, the Court finds that neither Plaintiff nor Defendant have advanced the proper tariff subheading for mellorine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1926-5\">III. <em>The Proper Classification of Mellorine is HTSUS2105.00.50</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1926-6\">Plaintiff has not, and is not required to, establish the correct classification of mellorine to prevail in its case. <em>See id. </em>In a case such as this, where Plaintiff has succeeded only in demonstrating the incorrectness of Customs\u2019 preferred classification, the final step of classification belongs to the Court. <em>See id. </em>In its entirety, the text of HTSUS heading 2105 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1926-7\">2105.00 Ice cream and other edible ice, whether or not containing cocoa:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1926-8\">Ice cream:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1926-9\">Described in general note 15 of the tariff schedule and entered pursuant to its provisions 2105.00.05</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASRG\">Described in additional U.S. note 5 to this chapter and entered pursuant to its provisions 2105.00.10</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVq\">Other 2105.00.20</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AnB\">Other:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1fS\">Dairy products described in additional U.S. note 1 to chapter 4:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AML\">Described in general note 15 of the tariff schedule and entered pursuant to its provisions 2105.00.25</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALZ\">Described in additional U.S. note 10 to chapter 4 and entered pursuant to its provisions 2105.00.30</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARZ\">Other 2105.00.40</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj2\">2105.00.50 Other</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1927-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1905\">*1905</page-number><em>See </em>heading 2105, HTSUS (2005). Having determined that mellorine is an \u201cother edible ice\u201d within the meaning of heading 2105, but not a dairy product described in additional U.S. note 1 to Chapter 4, there remains only one subheading under which it can be classified: 2105.00.50 \u201cIce Cream and other edible ice, whether or not containing cocoa: Other: Other\u201d at a duty rate of 17% <em>ad valorem. See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1927-4\">On December 8, 2009 the Court submitted a letter to the parties soliciting their perspectives and comments on the appropriateness of HTSUS 2105.00.50 as a classification for mellorine. Plaintiff states that it \u201cfully agrees\u201d with this classification, but only \u201c[t]o the extent the Court may be considering . . . 2105.00.3000 or 2105.00.4000 as incorrect.\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Plaintiff then proceeds to reiterate its argument that GRI 3(b) directs the tariff classification of mellorine under heading 0811. Defendant, in its response to the Court\u2019s request, states that \u201c2105.00.50, HTSUS, is not an appropriate classification for the different flavors of mellorine at issue. Mellorine is not only an edible ice, it is also a dairy article.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1927-5\">After considering the positions of the parties, the Court\u2019s opinion remains unchanged. The Court notes that Defendant, in its opposition to the Court\u2019s proffered subheading, goes to great length to demonstrate how mellorine is a \u201cdairy product\u201d or \u201cdairy article.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> As already explained, <em>supra </em>at 21-22, this is not the precise question facing the Court, and the Court finds Defendant\u2019s arguments unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1927-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1927-7\">As explained above, Plaintiff moved the Court for partial summary judgment, which is appropriate \u201cwhen it appears that some aspects of a claim are not genuinely controvertible [but] genuine issues remain regarding the rest of the claim.\u201d <em>Ugglnt\u2019l, </em>17 CIT at 83. Because there is no dispute between the parties as to the nature of the merchandise involved in this case, and the only issues to be resolved are legal, there is no need merely to grant partial summary judgment;<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> the case is ripe for disposal at the summary judgment stage. <em>See e.g., Value Vinyls, Inc. v. United States, </em>31 CIT_,_, 2007 WL 273839 at *2 (2007) <em>(citing Anderson v.

For the foregoing reasons, and pursuant to the Court\u2019s independent obligation to determine the correct tariff classification, Plaintiff\u2019s entries of the subject merchandise shall be reliquidated under HTSUS 2105.00.50.
