Reg. 59,562 (Dep\u2019t Commerce Nov. 29, 2001) (notice of antidumping duty order) <em>(\u201cAntidumping Duty Order\u201d). </em>From 2001 to 2007, as a result of <em>foe Antidumping Duty Order, </em>Nakornthai paid the separate \u201call others\u201d duty rate of 3.86 percent on its imports. <em>See id. </em>at 59,563. In May 2007, following Commerce\u2019s publication of the opportunity to request an administrative review of the <em>Antidumping Duty Order, see Antidumping or Countervailing Duty Order, Finding, or Suspended Investigation, </em>70 Fed. Reg. 65,883 (Dep\u2019t Commerce Nov. 1, 2005) (notice of opportunity to request administrative review), U.S. Steel and Nucor Corp. (\u201cNucor\u201d) requested review for the period of November 1, 2004 through October 31, 2005. Commerce granted this request, <em>see Initiation of Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Administrative Reviews and Request for Revocation in Part, </em>70 Fed. Reg. 76,024 (Dep\u2019t Commerce Dec. 22, 2005), and, after publishing preliminary results of its review, and inviting comments thereon by Nakornthai, U.S. Steel and Nucor, revised the <em>Antidumping Duty Order </em>to calculate a Nakornthai-specifie dumping margin for the period of review (and a resulting antidumping duty cash deposit rate for the next review period) of 8.23 percent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Certain Hot-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products from Thailand, </em>72 Fed. Reg. 27,802, 27,803 (Dep\u2019t Commerce May 17, 2007) (final results and partial rescission of antidumping duty administrative review) <em>{\u201cFinal Results\u201d)', Issues &amp; Decision Memorandum, </em>A \u2014 549\u2014817, ADR 11/01/04\u2014 10/31/05 (May 7, 2007), <em>available at </em>http://ia.ita.doc.gov/frn/ summary/THAILAND/E7-9526-1.pdf <em>{\u201cDecision Memorandum\u201d)', Proprietary Arguments from the Issues and Decision Memorandum for the Final Results of Certain Hot-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products from Thailand, </em>A-549-817, ADR 11/01/04-10/31/05 (May 7, 2007) <em>{\u201cProprietary Memorandum\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">During the period of review, according to Nakornthai\u2019s responses to Commerce\u2019s questionnaires, Nakornthai made one U.S. sale of hot-rolled steel pursuant to a contract with a U.S. wholesaler (the \u201coriginal contract\u201d). The original contract specified certain terms, including both a total \u201cquantity tolerance\u201d and \u201cper item tolerance level\u201d of products to be shipped.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After the original contract was signed, Na-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>komthai and its wholesaler executed three changes in the contract: elimination of the line item quantity tolerance level, changes to payment terms<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and amendments to delivery dates.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nonetheless, Na-kornthai claimed, and continues to claim, that these changes are immaterial and did not affect the uniform net unit price or the total quantity agreed to be purchased.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">At a certain point, Nakornthai issued commercial invoices to the wholesaler. The final invoice quantity, though changed slightly from the total quantity specified in the original contract, remained within the total quantity tolerance provided for in the original contract. In fact, the contract amendment affected less that 0.1% of the total quantity of goods sold and shipped under the contract, and each of the individual line item quantities shipped were also within the original stated tolerance levels, except for one single line item. The quantity shipped of the single, changed line item was 14.5% more than the upper end of the original line item tolerance level and more than 25% above the specific line item quantity for that product.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Faced with this record, Commerce made a \u201cdate of sale\u201d determination pursuant to its regulations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-6\">In identifying the date of sale of the subject merchandise or foreign like product, the Secretary normally will use the date of invoice, as recorded in the exporter or producer\u2019s records kept in the ordinary course of business. However, the Secretary may use a date other than the date of invoice if the Secretary is satisfied that a different date better reflects the date on which the exporter or producer establishes the material terms of sale.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.40KD.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>Applying its regulation in Nakornthai\u2019s case, despite the limited nature of the quantity changes, Commerce concluded that the elimination of the line item tolerance levels demonstrated that the contract\u2019s material terms were not settled until the invoice date. According to Commerce, the elimination of the line item quantity tolerance level materially changed the original contract, because the elimination, at least potentially, allowed Nakornthai to make quantity changes affecting \u201cproduct mix\u201d and \u201cresulting in [ ] products being</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">shipped.\u201d <em>Proprietary Memorandum </em>14. Given this finding, Commerce did not address the materiality of the changes to payment and delivery terms, as it deemed these issues \u201cmoot.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">In response, and in accordance with 19 U.S.C \u00a7\u00a7 1516a(a)(2)(i)(I), 1516a(a)(2)(B)(iii) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(c), Nakornthai filed this action, to contest Commerce\u2019s determinations in calculating Nakorn-thai\u2019s specific antidumping duty rate. Specifically, as is relevant here, Nakornthai claimed that Commerce erred by using the invoice date, instead of the contract date, as the date of sale to determine its weighted average dumping margin for the period covered by the administrative review and the assessment rate going forward.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Na-kornthai argued to Commerce and argues before the court that Commerce should adhere to its \u201clong-standing practice\u201d of using the contract date as the date of sale, because, according to Nakornthai, the record reveals that the contract date \u201cbetter reflects the date on which the exporter or producer established the material terms of sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">\n<em>I. Nakornthai I</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">In Nakornthai I, the court affirmed Commerce\u2019s initial legal interpretation, holding that Commerce\u2019s identification of line item quantities as a \u201cmaterial term of sale\u201d of Nakornthai\u2019s contract was based on the agency\u2019s reasonable interpretation of its own regulation. <em>Nakornthai I</em>, 558 F. Supp. 2d at 1327. In addition, the court refused to consider alternative dates of sale, other than contract date, as Nako-rnthai had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies on this issue. <em>Id. </em>at 1329-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">However, the court held that Commerce\u2019s factual findings on the finality of the terms of sale were incomplete, and remanded the issue back to the agency for reconsideration. <em>Id. </em>at 1328-29. Noting that Commerce, in applying it\u2019s date-of-sale regulation, \u201cweighs the evidence presented and regularly determines the significance of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>changes to the terms of sales involved\u201d, <em>id. </em>at 1327, the court stated that \u201cCommerce did not discuss or make a finding with regard to this [i.e., Nakornthai\u2019s] evidence [as to the quantities of goods actually ordered and delivered], either on its own or when considered in light of the elimination of the tolerance levels in the contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1328. Therefore, the court could not determine whether the variation in quantities for one line item was sufficiently significant, e.g., either to affect \u201cproduct mix\u201d in a significant way or to alter the dumping margin, to meet the regulatory standard that the terms of the contract not be essentially \u201cestablished.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As such, the court remanded the case back to Commerce to make a factual finding \u201cwith regard to the significance of Nakornthai\u2019s evidence\u201d and whether \u201cthe date the terms of the contract were essentially \u2018established\u2019 [at the date of contract] in light of the evidence submitted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1328-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">\n<em>II. Nakornthai II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">On remand, Commerce reconsidered its original determination, but again chose to use the date of invoice rather than the date of contract as the date of sale. <em>See Final Results of Redetermination Pursuant to Remand, </em>A-549-817, ADR 11/1/2004 \u2014 10/31/2005 (July 28, 2008) <em>{\u201cFirst Remand Results\u201d). </em>Commerce distinguished Nakornthai\u2019s case from prior instances where Commerce found changes to contractual terms of sale insignificant, and thus used the contract date for date of sale. Id. 3-4 (discussing <em>Certain Cut-to-Length Carbon Steel Plate from Romania, </em>72 Fed. Reg. 6,522 (Dep\u2019t Commerce Feb. 12, 2007)(notice of final results of antidumping duty administrative review and final partial rescission) and accompanying Issues and Decision Memorandum, A-485-803, ADR 08/01/2004-07/31/ 2005 (Feb. 2, 2007), <em>available at </em>http://ia.ita.doc.gov/frn/summary/ROMANIA/ E7-2216-l.pdf <em>{\u201cRomanian Plate\u201d)-, Circular Welded Non-Alloy Steel Pipe from the Republic of Korea, </em>63 Fed. Reg. 32,833 (Dep\u2019t Commerce June 16, 1998) (final results of antidumping duty administrative review)). In addition, Commerce refused to address Nakornthai\u2019s proposed alternative dates of sale. <em>Id. </em>11-12. The court sustained these two determinations. <em>Nakornthai II, </em>587 F. Supp. 2d at 1308-09, 1311-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">However, Commerce seemingly ignored the court\u2019s specific instructions regarding analysis of Nakornthai\u2019s particular evidence, declaring that the change to the specific quantity shipped \u201cis not [ ] relevant\u201d and concluding that the \u201crelevant change\u201d was the elimination of the tolerance levels from the original contract. <em>First Remand Results </em>5. Rather, Commerce merely restated its prior hypothetically-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>based reasoning previously rejected by the court,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and therefore the court remanded again as to Commerce\u2019s factual findings on date of sale. <em>Nakornthai II, </em>587 F. Supp. 2d at 1309. The court instructed Commerce to, on remand:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-5\">determine [in accordance with its standard practice], and explain its rationale, as to whether the evidence presented by Nakornthai of the change in the quantity shipped was actually of any significance, and whether, in context, this change materially affected the date that the terms of the contract were essentially established.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1311.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">\n<em>III. Commerce\u2019s Second Remand Results</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">Pursuant to the court\u2019s second remand, Commerce once again re-examined its date of sale analysis. <em>See Second Remand Results </em>1, 3. Commerce first determined \u201cthat the change in aggregate quantity shipped [by Nakornthai] is not, on its own, significant and does not, by itself, materially affect the date that the terms of contract were essentially established.\u201d <em>Id. </em>3. Commerce explained that, according to its practice, differences between aggregate quantity contracted for and shipped, as long as these differences fall within the overall quantity tolerance, do not constitute changes to material contractual terms. <em>Id. </em>5-6 (citing <em>Romanian Plate', Certain Large Diameter Carbon and Alloy Seamless Standard, Line and Pressure Pipe From Mexico, </em>65 Fed. Reg. 39,358 (Dep\u2019t Commerce June 26, 2000) (notice of final determination of sales at less than fair value)).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AJp\">But Commerce continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-9\">[However,] when the change in aggregate quantity is considered in the context of ongoing amendments to material contract terms subsequent to [Nakornthai\u2019s] original contract date, including the elimination of the line item quantity tolerance from [Nakornthai\u2019s] original contract and subsequent amendments to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>payment and delivery terms, record evidence demonstrates a continuum of change to material contract terms that fails to overcome [Commerce\u2019s] regulatory presumption that invoice date is the appropriate date of sale.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-4\"><em>Id. </em>3-4. In other words, Commerce determined that \u201cthe context in which [the within-tolerance change] occurred demonstrates that the terms of [Nakornthai\u2019s] U.S. sales contract were not set in the original contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>7.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">This \u201ccontext\u201d as considered by Commerce has several elements. First, Commerce noted that, unlike the record in <em>Romanian Plate, </em>\u201cthe record in this case lacks any similar evidence [of the parties\u2019 conclusion of a final agreement regarding terms of sale] supporting [Nakornthai\u2019s] proposal that [Commerce] rely upon the contract date.\u201d <em>Id. </em>5.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Second, Commerce identified a \u201cseries of changes to the material terms of sale\u201d including (1) the elimination of the line item quantity tolerance, as well as (2) changes to payment terms and (3) amendments to delivery terms, that demonstrate that Nakornthai and its U.S. customer \u201cdid not share an agreement on final contract terms until the invoice date.\u201d <em>Id. </em>7.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">With respect to the elimination of the line item quantity tolerance level, Commerce stated that this \u201cby itself\u2019 was material to its date of sale analysis because \u201cit shows that parties did not share an agreement on the final terms of sale on the original contract date.\u201d <em>Id. </em>13. Commerce also found that this change was \u201ccommercially significant\u201d because Nakomthai\u2019s original contract</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">stated that a certain quantity of each item would be shipped, and that a [line item] quantity beyond [ ]% of the [line item] quantity tolerance would constitute a breach of contract. Therefore, the final sale quantity... would have resulted in a breach of contract had the original contract not been subsequently amended. Amending the original contract to allow for a final shipment that would have constituted a breach of the original contract is a \u201csignificant\u201d amendment for commercial purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-9\"><em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">Similarly, Commerce also concluded that, \u201cas a factual matter, the amendments to payment and delivery terms demonstrate that the parties did not share an agreement concerning these material terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>at the time of their original contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>8. Commerce determined that the fact that the payment and delivery terms, considered \u201cmaterial\u201d in Commerce\u2019s practice, were subject to amendment \u201cis sufficient to demonstrate their materiality....\u201d <em>Id. </em>13. But Commerce further noted that \u201cthe record demonstrates that [the amendments to payment and delivery terms] impacted [sic] the sales transactions at issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>14. More particularly, the payment term change allowed Nakornthai to receive a certain percentage of its payment at an earlier point in time<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> than specified in the original contract, and the changes to the letter of credit\u2019s expiration and last shipment dates<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> gave Nakornthai [ ] additional days to ship the subject merchandise to its customer and still be entitled to full payment. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, these changes affected \u201cthe credit calculation for [Nakornthai\u2019s] U.S. sales used to derive [its] weighted-average dumping margin.\u201d Id.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>Finally, Commerce again refused to consider any alternate dates proposed by Nakornthai and limited its date of sale analysis to the contract and invoice dates. <em>Id. </em>15. Accordingly, Commerce reaffirmed its conclusion to use invoice date. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">\n<em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">As in reviewing earlier Commerce determinations in this case, the court reviews remand determinations for compliance with the court\u2019s remand order. <em>See NMB Sing. Ltd. v. United States, </em>28 CIT 1252, 1259-60, 341 F. Supp. 2d 1327, 1333-34 (2004); <em>Olympia Indus., Inc. v. United States, </em>23 CIT 80, 82, 36 F. Supp. 2d 414, 416 (1999). Moreover, again, the agency\u2019s legal determinations on remand must be in accordance with law and its factual findings must be supported by substantial evidence. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(l)(B); <em>see Huaiyin Foreign Trade Corp. v. United States, </em>322 F.3d 1369, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2003); <em>AG der Dillinger Hiittenwerke v. United States, </em>28 CIT 94, 95, 310 F. Supp. 2d 1347, 1349 (2004). \u201cSubstantial evidence is \u2018such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Huaiyin Foreign Trade Corp., </em>322 F.3d at 1374 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">Commerce\u2019s <em>Second Remand Results </em>comply with the court\u2019s remand orders in <em>Nakornthai I </em>and <em>Nakornthai II. </em>At the same time, the court cannot affirm Commerce\u2019s conclusion that the elimination of a line item quantity tolerance level from the contract constituted a significant change that materially affected Nakomthai\u2019s contract. Nonetheless, based on Commerce\u2019s further analysis of the significance of the particular evidence presented in this case, the court otherwise deems Commerce\u2019s factual findings in its <em>Second Remand Results </em>to be supported by substantial evidence and its interpretation of its own regulation to be in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">\n<em>I. The Court Cannot Affirm Commerce\u2019s Conclusion Regarding Nakornthai\u2019s Elimination of the Line Item Quantity Tolerance Level</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">Despite Commerce\u2019s conclusion, based on its established practice, that differences in line item quantities, so long as the overall quantity is within the overall quantity tolerance level, are not significant, Commerce nonetheless concluded that the elimination of the line item tolerance from the contract was \u201cmaterial\u201d in this case. Previ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>ously, in <em>Nakornthai I </em>and <em>Nakornthai II, </em>the court rejected Commerce\u2019s proffered hypothetical reasoning that this contractual change potentially allowed Nakornthai to manipulate the \u201cproduct mix.\u201d Now, as explained in its <em>Second Remand Results, </em>Commerce presents a different rationale. Commerce reasons that, \u201c[a]s a factual matter, the elimination of the line item quantity tolerance demonstrates that the parties did not share an agreement concerning quantity, a material contract term, at the time of their original contract.\u201d <em>Second Remand Results </em>7. Commerce based its conclusion upon the court\u2019s previous holding that Commerce can reasonably consider the change to a line item quantity tolerance a \u201cmaterial\u201d contract term, <em>see Nakornthai I, 558 </em>F. Supp. 2d at 1327, and upon the fact that the shipped quantity of the line item was 14.5% more than the upper end of the original tolerance level and more than 25% above the specific line item quantity for that product. <em>Second Remand Results </em>7.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Nakornthai argues that Commerce, in employing \u201cflawed\u201d reasoning, has not followed the court\u2019s remand instructions with regard to its analysis of the elimination of the line item quantity tolerance level. <em>PL\u2019s Comments on the Dep\u2019t ofComm.\u2019s Second Remand Results Pursuant to Slip Op. 08-128 (\u201cPl.\u2019s Comments\u201d) </em>1. More specifically, Nakornthai charges that Commerce once again relied on speculation and hypotheticals, as there was no actual breach of contract. <em>Id. </em>5-6. Nakornthai also attacks Commerce\u2019s conclusions, that the amendment demonstrates that the contract was subject to change, as \u201cabsurd and illogical.\u201d <em>Id. </em>9.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Nakornthai\u2019s position, though somewhat overstated, has merit. Commerce has once again attempted to make a factual finding of \u201cpotential\u201d significance regarding the line item contractual quantity change, while at the same time making a factual finding that the change in quantities, in total, are not significant. Because of this inconsistency, Commerce has, with regard to this issue, again failed to provide a non-arbitrary, reasoned basis for its conclusion. Commerce argues that the elimination of the line item tolerance level, because that tolerance level is, as a legal matter, a material contract term, in and of itself materially alters the contract. But, as Nakorn-thai points out, this determination is directly contrary to the court\u2019s instructions in <em>Nakornthai I. See Nakornthai I, </em>558 F. Supp. 2d at 1328 (\u201cCommerce argues that the fact that the quantity tolerance level was changed, in whatever amount, demonstrates that the contract\u2019s material terms were subject to change and therefore not finally settled until the invoice date. The problem with this argument is that it begs the question of whether any such changes were insignificant.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>Nor, as the court has also previously instructed, can Commerce use speculative or hypothetical reasoning to support its conclusions. <em>See Nakornthai II, </em>587 F. Supp. 2d at 1310 (\u201cCommerce\u2019s use of hypo-theticals, generalizations...and conditional language suggesting possible distortions in antidumping calculations offer conjecture rather than a reasoned explanation founded on substantial evidence.\u201d (quoting <em>Hynix Semiconductor, Inc. v. United States, </em>27 CIT 1719, 1722, 295 F. Supp. 2d 1365, 1369 (2003), <em>rev\u2019d in part, </em>424 F.3d 1363, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2005))). Thus, Commerce\u2019s hypothetical scenario, indicating that Nakornthai \u2014 had it and its U.S. customer not amended the contract \u2014 would have breached the contract when delivering its particular quantity of the relevant line item, is of limited persuasiveness. Because it is Commerce\u2019s practice to disregard changes that are not significant, <em>see Nakornthai II, </em>587 F. Supp. 2d at 1309, Commerce cannot simultaneously rely on contractual changes that it has found insignificant to claim that such changes demonstrate that a contract\u2019s terms are not established.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Moreover, Commerce\u2019s argument is circular. Commerce contends that, because the contract was amended, the amendment was \u201ccommercially significant.\u201d Had the line item quantity shipped fallen within the original line item quantity tolerance, i.e., had the amount shipped been consistent with the original contractual terms, Nako-mthai would have had no need to amend the contract in the first place. Nonetheless, an amendment is not commercially significant simply because it changes a contractual term, even if that term is material.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Because Commerce, in making its date of sale determination, must, in accordance with its own regulation, make a factual determination with regard to whether the material terms were not set until invoice, and because Commerce\u2019s own practice in making such a determination is to disregard changes that are insignificant, the record must contain evidence sufficient to support the finding that the change to the material terms represented in the contract was significant. Commerce still has not done so here with regard to the line item quantity tolerance level and, thus, Commerce has not demonstrated to the court that its determination of significance of the elimination of the line item quantity tolerance level is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">\n<em>II. Commerce Nonetheless Provides Substantial Evidence to Support Its Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">However, the court finds other reasons to sustain Commerce\u2019s <em>Second Remand Results. </em>As a general matter, Commerce maintained that evidence, other than differences between contracted-for and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>shipped quantities, demonstrates that Nakornthai\u2019s contract was subject to change. Commerce noted that Nakornthai has not provided evidence, such as that presented in <em>Romanian Plate, </em>that would warrant deviation from its presumption of using invoice date as date of sale. <em>Second Remand Results </em>5. In addition, Commerce noted that it regularly considers payment and delivery terms as material terms of sale, <em>id. </em>7 (citing <em>SeAH Steel Corp. v. United States, 25 </em>CIT 133, 134 (2001)), and concluded that Nakornthai\u2019s amendments to payment and delivery terms \u201cdemonstrate that the parties did not share an agreement concerning these material terms at the time of their original contract.\u201d <em>Id. 8.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Nakornthai first takes issue with Commerce\u2019s statement that payment and delivery terms are generally considered by Commerce as \u201cmaterial,\u201d citing <em>Certain Hot-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products from Thailand, </em>66 Fed. Reg. 49,622 (Dep\u2019t Commerce Sept. 28, 2001) (notice of final determination of sales at less than fair value). Commerce responds that its date of sale practice has \u201cevolved,\u201d and that it \u201cnow considers, among other contractual terms, delivery and payment terms as material terms of sale.\u201d <em>Def.\u2019s Resp. </em>10.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">The court accepts Commerce\u2019s reasonable interpretation of its regulatory practice and notes that this interpretation is supported by recent Commerce decisions. <em>See, e.g., Issues &amp; Decision Memorandum for Stainless Steel Sheet and Strip in Coils from Taiwan </em>(final results of the fourth antidumping administrative review), A-583-831, AD/CVD 7/1/02-6/30/03 15 (Feb. 7, 2005), <em>available at</em></p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">http://ia.ita.doc.gov/frn/summary/taiwan/E5-631-l.pdf (\u201cThe Department has interpreted \u2018material terms of sale\u2019 to include price, quantity, and payment terms....\u201d); <em>Certain Cold-Rolled Flat-Rolled Carbon-Quality Steel Products from Brazil, </em>65 Fed. Reg. 5,554, 5,575 (Dep\u2019t Commerce 2000) (final determination) (payment terms); <em>Issues &amp; Decision Memorandum for Cold-Rolled Flat-Rolled Carbon Quality Steel Products from Turkey, </em>A \u2014 489\u2014808, POI 1998 \u2014 99 Date of Sale cmt. 1 (Mar. 21, 2000), <em>available at </em>http://ia.ita.doc.gov/frn/summary/ turkey/00-6992-l.txt (payment terms). Therefore, the court finds Commerce\u2019s legal conclusion that payment and delivery terms are \u201cmaterial\u201d to be in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">Second, according to Nakornthai, Commerce failed to make a significance finding for the payment term change or the delivery term change. Nakornthai charges that Commerce\u2019s analysis on these terms\u2019 affect on Nakornthai\u2019s credit calculation is also \u201cpurely conjectural,\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-9\">[nlowhere does Commerce explain exactly how this is so, or how such minor changes to secondary terms of sale are otherwise \u201csignificant\u201d to any aspect of the actual dumping calculation. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>fact, Commerce never determines whether [Nakornthai] used additional days or received payment any earlier, nor has Commerce analyzed whether there was any actual impact on its dumping calculation. Not surprisingly, Commerce provides no citation to the record on its claim because there was no impact on the margin.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-4\"><em>Pl.\u2019s Comments </em>7. For the same reasons stated above with regard to the quantity tolerance level, the court cannot affirm Commerce\u2019s finding that merely because these material contractual terms were amended, such amendments in and of themselves demonstrate that the contract was subject to change.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Despite this deficiency, Commerce also made the requisite factual findings of significance with regard to the change in payment and delivery terms. Commerce\u2019s decision has sufficiently demonstrated to the court that the payment and delivery terms affected the sales transaction in a significant way, that is, that these changes significantly affected the terms of Nakornthai\u2019s contract. Moreover, this demonstration is supported by substantial evidence. For example, the payment term change allowed Nakornthai to receive a significant portion, [ ], of its payment at an earlier point in time than specified in the original contract, and the changes to the letter of credit\u2019s expiration and last shipment dates gave Nakornthai [ ] additional days to ship the subject merchandise to its customer while still being entitled to full payment. <em>Id. </em>Indeed, \u201c[ ] of Nakornthai\u2019s shipments to the United States were conducted in accordance with the shipment terms present upon invoice date.\u201d <em>Supra </em>note 12. In turn, these amendments changed the credit expense calculation used to compute Nakornthai\u2019s dumping margin for the period of review.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">Based on Commerce\u2019s findings and reasoned analysis regarding the delivery and payment terms of Nakornthai\u2019s contract, the court concludes that Commerce\u2019s conclusion in the <em>Second Remand Results </em>\u2014 that Nakornthai has not established that the material contract terms were established on a date other than invoice date \u2014 is based on a reasonable interpretation of the \u201cdate-of-sale\u201d regulation and on sufficient factual findings that are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">Therefore, upon consideration of the pending motions before the court, in accordance with this opinion, it is hereby:</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>ORDERED that the Department of Commerce\u2019s second remand determination is sustained.

Commerce\u2019s Antidumping Manual explains that the most common adjustment for differences in circumstances of sale is for differences in credit costs, and that this adjustment is necessary because there \u201cis usually a period of time between the shipment of merchandise to a customer and payment for the merchandise.\u201d The manual further states that this adjustment is required \u201cto account for the opportunity cost associated with the loss of the use of monies involved,\u201d and that in \"all instances where the respondent provides shipment andpayment dates, we use this information to calculate the actual number of days credit is outstanding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-14\">In this case, Nakornthai reported its credit expenses to Commerce using the following formula:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-15\">CREDITU {credit expenses) = GRSUPRU {gross unit price) x U.S. dollar interest rate x ((PAYDATEU {payment date) -SHIPDATU {shipment date))/365)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-16\">Therefore, by definition, the shipment date or the payment date . . . reported by Nakornthai affects the credit calculation.
