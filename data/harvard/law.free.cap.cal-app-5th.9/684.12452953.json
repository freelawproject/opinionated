The retail pharmacy is the one obligated to pay sales tax to the State of California (Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 6051),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and accordingly charges the customer a \u201csales tax reimbursement,\u201d to cover the cost of the sales tax, and remits that amount to the state. If the retail pharmacy subsequently believes no sales tax is owed, it\u2014as the taxpayer\u2014can file an administrative claim for a refund with the State Board of Equalization (the Board) and challenge any adverse ruling in court. (\u00a7\u00a7 6901, 6932.) But the retail pharmacy usually has no financial incentive to pursue such a remedy because any refund it obtains from the Board must be passed back to the customer. (\u00a7 6901.5; <em>Decorative Carpets, Inc. v. State Board of Equalization </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 252, 254-255 [23 Cal.Rptr. 589, 373 P.2d 637] <em>(Decorative Carpets).) </em>What is more, and as our Supreme Court recently reaffirmed in <em>Loeffler </em>v. <em>Target Corp. </em>(2014) 58 Cal.4th 1081, 1123-1124 [171 Cal.Rptr.3d 189, 324 P.3d 50] <em>(Loeffler), </em>the customer is not the taxpayer and thus cannot herself seek a refund from the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">May the customer obtain a court order compelling the retail pharmacy to file an administrative refund claim with the Board? Our Constitution strictly limits refund actions to those \u201cprovided by [our] Legislature\u201d (Cal. Const., art. XIII, \u00a7 32), and no such statutory remedy exists. However, our Supreme Court in <em>Javor v. State Board of Equalization </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 790, 802 [117 Cal.Rptr. 305, 527 P.2d 1153] <em>{Javor) </em>held that the Legislature\u2019s authority in this regard is not exclusive and that courts retain a residual power to fill remedial gaps by fashioning tax refund remedies in \u201cunique circumstances.\u201d <em>Loeffler </em>had no occasion to define those \u201cunique circumstances.\u201d <em>(Loeffler, supra, </em>58 Cal.4th at pp. 1101, 1133-1134.)</p>\n<p id=\"b681-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>This case squarely presents this unanswered question. We conclude that a court may create a new tax refund remedy\u2014and, accordingly, that the requisite \u201cunique circumstances\u201d exist\u2014only if (1) the person seeking the new tax refund remedy has no statutory tax refund remedy available to it, (2) the tax refund remedy sought is not inconsistent with existing tax refund remedies, and (3) the Board has already determined that the person seeking the new tax refund remedy is entitled to a refund, such that the refusal to create that remedy will unjustly enrich either the taxpayer/retailer or the Board. Here, a group of customers filed a class action predicated on their ability to obtain an order compelling the retail pharmacies to file an administrative claim with the Board seeking a refund of the sales tax paid for skin puncture lancets and glucose test strips. Because the Revenue and Taxation Code does not provide for this remedy, and because they have not established any of the three prerequisites to the exercise of the judicial residual power to fashion new remedies, the trial court correctly sustained demurrers to all of the claims in the customers\u2019 operative complaint without leave to amend. We consequently affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">I. <em>Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Plaintiffs and appellants Michael McClain, Avi Feigenblatt, and Gregory Fisher (collectively, customers) each bought skin puncture lancets and glucose test strips from retail pharmacy stores owned and/or operated by defendants and respondents Sav-On Drugs, Gavin Herbert Company, Longs Drug Stores Corporation, Longs Drug Stores California, Inc., Rite Aid Corporation, Walgreen Co., Target Corporation, Albertson\u2019s Inc., The Vons Companies, Inc., Vons Food Services, Inc., and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (collectively, the retail pharmacies). Skin puncture lancets (or lancets) and glucose test strips are used by persons living with diabetes to draw their blood and test its glucose level, which is critical to knowing when to inject insulin to reduce their glucose levels. When the customers purchased lancets and test strips from the retail pharmacies, the retail pharmacies charged them \u201csales tax\u201d on those items. The retail pharmacies subsequently remitted the money they collected as sales tax to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">II. <em>Procedural History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">In the operative fourth amended complaint filed in 2014,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the customers sued the retail pharmacies and the Board<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for a refund of the \u201csales tax\u201d they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>paid for lancets and test strips, alleging that these items have been exempt from sales tax since March 10, 2000, the date on which the Board made effective California Code of Regulations, title 18, section 1591.1, subdivision (b)(5) (Regulation 1591.1). This complaint sought to certify a class comprised of \u201call persons who were charged by and paid one or more of the [retail pharmacies] a sales tax on glucose test strips or skin puncture lancets in California when such should not have been charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">The operative complaint alleges that the retail pharmacies collected sales tax reimbursement for lancets and test strips when no sales tax was due on these items and that this conduct: (1) breached an implied term of the contract that is deemed by statute to exist whenever a retailer collects a sales tax reimbursement from a customer under Civil Code section 1656.1 and also breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (2) constituted an unlawful, unfair and/or fraudulent business practice and thereby violates the unfair competition law (UCL) (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200 et seq.); (3) constituted negligence; and (4) violated the Consumers Legal Remedies Act (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1750 et seq.) by misrepresenting the taxability of those items. The operative complaint further seeks declaratory and injunctive relief compelling the retail pharmacies to prosecute a tax refund claim with the Board and the Board to award such a refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">The retail pharmacies and the Board demurred to the operative complaint. Following briefing, the trial court issued an oral ruling sustaining the demurrers to all of the claims in the operative complaint without leave to amend. The court reasoned that <em>Loeffler, supra, </em>58 Cal.4th 1081 held that a customer could not seek a tax refund of sales tax from a retailer; that <em>Javor, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d 790 allowed a customer to seek a refund of sales tax where the Board had already decided the question of taxability and concluded that a refund was due; and that \u201c[t]his case is more like <em>Loeffler </em>than <em>Javor' </em>because the taxability of lancets and test strips was \u201cvery hotly in dispute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Following entry of judgment, the customers filed this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">I. <em>Pertinent Legal Principles</em></p>\n<p id=\"Acx\">A. <em>Relevant tax law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">1. <em>Sales tax generally</em></p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">In California, <em>retailers </em>are generally required to pay the state a sales tax on any \u201ctangible personal property\u201d they sell \u201cat retail.\u201d (\u00a7 6051; see <em>Loeffler, supra, </em>58 Cal.4th at p. 1103 [\u201cunder California\u2019s sales tax law, the taxpayer is the retailer, not the consumer\u201d]; <em>De Aryan v. Akers </em>(1939) 12 Cal.2d 781, 783 [87 P.2d 695] [same].) Retailers pay the sales tax as a percentage of their \u201cgross receipts\u201d (\u00a7 6051), and it is rebuttably presumed that all \u201cgross receipts\u201d are subject to the tax (\u00a7 6091). Retailers pay the sales tax they owe on a quarterly basis. (\u00a7\u00a7 6451-6459; <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 633, 640 [217 Cal.Rptr. 238, 703 P.2d 1131].)</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">2. <em>Collection of sales tax reimbursement from the customer</em></p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">Although retailers were in the past <em>required </em>to collect the money they had to pay as sales tax from their customers (former \u00a7 6052),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> our Legislature altered that approach after the United States Supreme Court held that a retailer\u2019s mandatory collection of sales tax from customers rendered <em>the customer </em>the de facto taxpayer. <em>(Diamond National v. State Equalization Bd. </em>(1976) 425 U.S. 268, 268 [47 L.Ed.2d 780, 96 S.Ct. 1530].) Under our Legislature\u2019s current approach, it is up to each retailer to decide\u2014as a matter of contract with its customers\u2014whether to charge its customers a \u201csales tax reimbursement to the sales price\u201d for items subject to the sales tax, or whether to pay the sales tax itself. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1656.1, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If a retailer \u201cshow[s]\u201d a charge for sales tax on the receipt or \u201cother proof of sale,\u201d or otherwise notifies a customer that it has or will charge sales tax, it is rebuttably presumed that the retailer and customer have contractually agreed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>that the retailer is collecting a sales tax reimbursement from the customer. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1656.1, subds. (a) &amp; (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">3. <em>Pertinent exemptions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">The retail sale of many items of tangible personal property is exempt from the sales tax. (\u00a7\u00a7 6351-6380 [exemptions from sales and use taxes], 6381-6396 [exemptions from sales tax].) Since 1961, the sale of \u201cmedicines\u201d has been exempt from sales tax if \u201c[prescribed for the treatment of a human being by a person authorized to prescribe the medicines, and dispensed on prescription filled by a registered pharmacist in accordance with law.\u201d (\u00a7 6369, subd. (a)(1).) A few years later, in 1963, our Legislature declared \u201c[i]nsulin and insulin syringes\u201d exempt from the sales tax if they were \u201cfurnished by a registered pharmacist to a person for treatment of diabetes as directed by a physician.\u201d <em>(Id,, </em>subd. (e).) On March 10, 2000, the Board promulgated Regulation 1591.1, which expanded this statutory exemption from the sales tax to reach \u201c[g]lucose test strips and skin puncture lancets\u201d if they were \u201cfurnished by a registered pharmacist [and] used by a diabetic patient to determine his or her own blood sugar level ... in accordance with a physician\u2019s instructions.\u201d (Reg. 1591.1, subd. (b)(5); see generally Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 7051 [conferring upon Board the power to \u201cprescribe, adopt, and enforce rules and regulations relating to the administration and enforcement\u201d of the sales tax].) The Board expanded the sales tax exemption to these additional items because they \u201care an integral and necessary active part of the use of insulin and insulin syringes\u201d expressly exempted by statute. (Reg. 1591.1, subd. (b)(5).)</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">B. <em>Relevant statutory tax refund procedures</em></p>\n<p id=\"AcS\">1. <em>For retailers</em></p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">If a retailer believes it has paid the state sales tax \u201cin excess of the amount legally due\u201d (\u00a7 6901), the retailer\u2014as the taxpayer\u2014has two options available to it by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">First, the retailer can file an administrative claim with the Board for a refund of any amount \u201cnot required to be paid.\u201d (\u00a7 6901.) It has three years from the last day of the quarter in which it is seeking a refund to file such an administrative claim. (\u00a7 6902, subd. (a).) If and only if the Board declines to issue a refund, the retailer may challenge that denial in court if it files suit \u201c[wfithin 90 days\u201d of the Board\u2019s mailing the notice of denial. (\u00a7 6933; see \u00a7 6932; <em>State Bd. of Equalization v. Superior Court </em>(1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 568, 571 [169 Cal.Rptr. 3] <em>(State Bd. of Equalization) </em>[\u201cpending completion of . . . administrative proceedings [before the Board], [the] court lacks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>jurisdiction\u201d].) Requiring the retailer to litigate its refund claim before the Board \u2018\u201cin the first instance\u201d is designed to \u2018\u201cobtain the benefit of the Board\u2019s expertise, permit it to correct mistakes, and save judicial resources.\u201d <em>(Loeffler, supra, </em>58 Cal.4th at pp. 1103, 1127.) If a refund is ordered (either by the Board or in subsequent judicial review), the retailer can either \u2018\u201creturn[]\u201d the corresponding sales tax reimbursement it collected to \u2018\u201cthe customer\u201d or leave the funds with the state. (\u00a7 6901.5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">Second, the retailer can elect to waive its right to a refund by declining to file a timely claim for administrative review. (\u00a7 6905.)</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">2. <em>For customers</em></p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">If the customer believes it has paid a sales tax reimbursement for items on which no sales tax is due, the customer has no statutory tax refund available to her\u2014either administrative or judicial\u2014against the Board or the retailer. (See \u00a7 6901 [no administrative refund procedure for person who did not \u2018\u201ccollect\u201d or \u2018\u201cpa[y]\u201d the tax], 6932 [no lawsuit \u2018\u201cunless a claim for refund . . . has been duly filed\u201d]; see also \u00a7\u00a7 6901.5-6909, 6931, 6933, 6937; <em>Loeffler, supra, </em>58 Cal.4th at pp. 1092, 1133 [customer may not sue the retailer for excess sales tax reimbursement]; <em>Javor, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d at p. 800 [customer has no \u2018\u201cdirect cause of action against the Board for . . . erroneously collected sales tax reimbursements\u201d]; see generally <em>Delta Air Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 518, 526 [262 Cal.Rptr. 803] <em>(Delta) </em>[\u2018\u201cGenerally, persons who have not paid the tax in question are barred from bringing suits for refund of that tax\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">C. <em>Law governing demurrers and their review on appecd</em></p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">In reviewing an order sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend, we must ask (1) whether the demurrer was properly sustained, and (2) whether leave to amend was properly denied. The first question requires us to \u201c \u2018 \u2018\u201cdetermine whether [that] complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Centinela Freeman Emergency Medical Associates v. Health Net of California, Inc. </em>(2016) 1 Cal.5th 994, 1010 [209 Cal.Rptr.3d 280, 382 P.3d 1116] <em>(Centinela Freeman), </em>quoting <em>Zelig v. County of Los Angeles </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 1112, 1126 [119 Cal.Rptr.2d 709, 45 P.3d 1171].) In undertaking this task, we accept as true all \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018material facts properly pleaded\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d and consider any materials properly subject to judicial notice; we disregard any \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d set forth in the operative complaint. <em>(Centinella Freeman, </em>at p. 1010; see <em>Mitchell v. State Dept. of Public Health </em>(2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1000, 1007 [205 Cal.Rptr.3d 261].) We independently review the operative complaint and independently decide whether it states viable causes of action. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number><em>(Lee </em>v. <em>Hanley </em>(2015) 61 Cal.4th 1225, 1230 [191 Cal.Rptr.3d 536, 354 P.3d 334].) The second question requires us to decide whether \u201c \u2018 \u201cthere is a reasonable possibility that the defect [in the operative complaint] can be cured by amendment <em>(Centinela Freeman, </em>at p. 1010.)</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">II. <em>The Demurrer Was Properly Sustained</em></p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">The premise of every claim in the customers\u2019 operative complaint is that the retail pharmacies erred in collecting sales tax reimbursement on lancets and test strips at a time when they were exempt from sales tax. Accordingly, the customers cannot state a cause of action unless they can establish their entitlement to a refund. This raises the preliminary procedural question that lies at the heart of this case: Can the customers seek a refund of the amount they paid as sales tax reimbursement through the lawsuit they have filed?</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Relying on <em>Javor, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d 790, the customers argue that this lawsuit is a viable means for seeking a refund of the sales tax reimbursement they paid for lancets and test strips. <em>Javor, </em>they argue, held that customers who wrongly paid the sales tax reimbursement could obtain injunctive relief compelling retailers to file administrative claims with the Board to obtain a sales tax refund that could be passed back to the customers. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 802-803.) This result, the customers urge, preserves the Board\u2019s ability to decide the taxability question in the first instance <em>and </em>prevents the state from being unjustly enriched by retaining sales tax to which it is not entitled. The retail pharmacies and the Board respond that the remedy sanctioned in <em>Javor </em>is limited to situations in which the Board has already determined that a refund is due and in which the newly created tax refund remedy would not create inconsistencies with existing tax refund statutes; both prerequisites, the retail pharmacies and Board urge, are absent. The availability of a judicially created remedy to supplement existing statutory remedies is a question of law that turns in part on questions of statutory interpretation; accordingly, our review is de novo. <em>(City of San Diego v. Board of Trustees of California State University </em>(2015) 61 Cal.4th 945, 956 [190 Cal.Rptr.3d 319, 352 P.3d 883] [questions of law reviewed de novo]; <em>Department of Health Care Services v. Office of Administrative Hearings </em>(2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 120, 140-141 [210 Cal.Rptr.3d 790] [statutory interpretation is a question of law].)</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">A. <em>Governing law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">Our state Constitution expressly entrusts to our Legislature the power to regulate pm/payment actions for refunds. Specifically, California Constitution, article XIII, section 32 provides: \u201cAfter payment of a tax claimed to be illegal, an action may be maintained to recover the tax paid, with interest, <em>in such manner as may be provided by the Legislature.\u201d </em>(Italics <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>added; see also <em>Masi v. Nagle </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 608, 611 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 423] [\u201cThe Constitution . . . grants the power to the Legislature to prescribe the manner of proceeding in tax cases\u201d].)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cThis constitutional limitation rests on the premise that strict legislative control over the manner in which tax refunds may be sought is necessary so that governmental entities may engage in fiscal planning based on expected tax revenues.\u201d <em>(Woosley </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 758, 789 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 30, 838 P.2d 758] <em>(Woosley); </em>see <em>Sprint Telephony PCS, L.P. v. Board of Equalization </em>(2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 871, 883 [189 Cal.Rptr.3d 673] <em>(Sprint </em>Telephony).)</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">This constitutional mandate has two necessarily implied corollaries. First, the \u201c[a]dministrative tax refund procedures [enacted by the Legislature] are to be strictly enforced\u201d <em>(McCabe </em>v. <em>Snyder </em>(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 337, 344 [89 Cal.Rptr.2d 315]); \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with those procedures will not do. <em>(Sprint Telephony, supra, </em>238 Cal.App.4th at p. 883; see <em>IBM Personal Pension Plan v. City and County of San Francisco </em>(2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 1291, 1299 [32 Cal.Rptr.3d 656] <em>(IBM)). </em>Second, and most pertinent here, courts may not \u201cexpand[] the methods for seeking tax refunds expressly provided by the Legislature.\u201d <em>(Woosley, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th at p. 792; see <em>Kuykendall </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 1194, 1203 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 783] <em>(Kuykendall).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">However, this second corollary is not an absolute one and courts have on occasion recognized \u201cequitable exception[s]\u201d in \u201ccertain unique circumstances.\u201d <em>(IBM, supra, </em>131 Cal.App.4th at p. 1305, fn. 16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">The first case to do so was <em>Decorative Carpets, supra, </em>58 Cal.2d 252. There, a retailer selling carpet sought a tax refund of the sales tax from the Board. It was determined in a tax refund suit between the retailer/taxpayer and the Board that the retailer was entitled to that refund. The retailer nevertheless declared its intention to keep the refund for itself and not to return it to its customers, even though the retailer had charged them a sales tax reimbursement. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 253-254.) The Board balked at issuing the refund, arguing that it would \u201cunjustly enrich[]\u201d the retailer at its customers\u2019 expense. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 254.) Our Supreme Court in <em>Decorative Carpets </em>agreed, holding that the Board\u2019s \u201cvital interest in the integrity of the sales tax\u201d gave it the authority to \u201cinsist as a condition of refunding overpayments to [the retailer] that [the retailer] discharge its trust obligations to its customers\u201d by refunding to them the corresponding sales tax reimbursement they had paid. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 255.)</p>\n<p id=\"b688-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>The next case was <em>Javor, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d 790. There, the Board \u201cadmitted\u201d that a recent retroactive repeal of the federal excise tax on motor vehicles entitled car dealers, as retailers, to a partial refund of the sales tax because the federal excise tax had been included in the price of the cars on which sales tax had been assessed. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 794, 801-802.) The Board went so far as to promulgate rules to effectuate these refunds. <em>(Ibid.) </em>When car dealers did not apply for the tax refund money the Board had set aside, the customers themselves sued to compel the retailers to do so. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 795-796, 802.) <em>Javor </em>held that this judicially created remedy\u2014a lawsuit by customers to compel retailers to file administrative claims for refunds and pass those refunds back to the customers\u2014was appropriate \u201cunder the unique circumstances of this case.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 797-803.) In reaching this conclusion, our Supreme Court placed weight on the facts that the Legislature had \u201cprovide [d] no procedure by which [the customers] [could] claim the refund themselves\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 797); that its newly fashioned remedy was \u201cconsonant with existing statutory procedures\u201d <em>(id. </em>at pp. 800, 802); and, drawing on <em>Decorative Carpets, supra, </em>58 Cal.2d 252, that the newly fashioned remedy was necessary\u2014given that the retailers themselves had \u201cno particular incentive to request the refund\u201d (because they would act solely as a passthrough for the refund money)\u2014to ensure that the state would not be \u201cunjustly enriched\u201d by getting to keep the admittedly erroneous sales tax revenue <em>(Javor, </em>at pp. 800-802).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Although <em>Decorative Carpets </em>dealt with a \u201cgreedy\u201d retailer and <em>Javor </em>dealt with unmotivated retailers, both cases share three commonalities that, in our view, define the \u201cunique circumstances\u201d to which <em>Javor </em>alludes and that are prerequisites to the judicial recognition of any new tax refund remedy. First, in both <em>Decorative Carpets </em>and <em>Javor, </em>the customers had no available statutory tax refund remedy. <em>(Decorative Carpets, supra, </em>58 Cal.2d at pp. 255-256; <em>Javor, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d at p. 797; see also <em>Loeffler, supra, </em>58 Cal.4th at p. 1114 [noting that customers in <em>Javor </em>had \u201cno direct statutory provision for . . . refunds\u201d]; cf. <em>State Bd. of Equalization, supra, </em>111 Cal.App.3d at p. 571 [declining to recognize new remedy because the \u201creal party . . . does not lack a [statutory tax refund] remedy\u201d].) Second, in both <em>Decorative Carpets </em>and <em>Javor, </em>the judicially crafted remedies were \u201cconsonant\u201d with the statutory tax refund procedures that our Legislature <em>did </em>provide. <em>(Decorative Carpets, </em>at p. 255; <em>Javor, </em>at pp. 800, 802; accord, <em>Kuykendall, supra, </em>22 Cal.App.4th at p. 1204 [noting that the \u201cequity\u201d of judicially created remedies \u201cwill defer to statute\u201d].) Lastly, in both <em>Decorative Carpets </em>and <em>Javor, </em>there had been a precursor determination\u2014either by the Board on its own volition or through its acquiescence to a court ruling in a tax refund action between the retailer/taxpayer and the Board\u2014that a tax refund was due and owing. <em>(Decorative Carpets, </em>at p. 254; <em>Javor, </em>at pp. 794, 802.) Such a determination left no question that the court\u2019s refusal to fashion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>a new remedy would result in either the retailer (in <em>Decorative Carpets) </em>or the state (in Javor) keeping money that the customers had paid as sales tax reimbursement and to which the customers were unequivocally entitled. And it was the <em>certainty </em>of this unjust enrichment that offended the Board\u2019s \u201cvital interest in the integrity of the sales tax\u201d and warranted judicial intervention. <em>(Decorative Carpets, </em>at pp. 254-255; <em>Javor, </em>at pp. 800-803.) Limiting a court\u2019s authority to fashion new tax remedies to situations involving all three of these requirements specifically reinforces the constitutional mandate, described above, that the <em>Legislature </em>have primacy in fixing the procedures by which tax refunds are obtained. (Cal. Const., art. XIII, \u00a7 32.)</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">The customers in this case do not dispute the necessity of the first two prerequisites, but dispute the third and offer several reasons why courts should have the power to fashion new tax refund remedies even when the entitlement to that refund is yet to be decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">To begin, they assert that <em>Javor </em>itself disclaims any requirement of a prior determination that the tax refund is due and owing because, at one point, <em>Javor </em>explains that the customers there sought an order \u201cto compel defendant retailers to make refund applications to the Board and in turn to require the Board to respond to these applications by paying into court all sums, <em>if any, </em>due defendant retailers.\u201d <em>(Javor, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d at p. 802, italics added.) The customers argue that the phrase \u201cif any\u201d means that the retailers\u2019 entitlement to a refund was still an open question in <em>Javor. </em>They are wrong. <em>Javor </em>makes clear that \u201c[t]he Board ha[d] admitted that it must pay these refunds to retailers\u201d (ibid.); the court\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cif any\u201d simply acknowledged that some retailers might not have sold cars for which a refund is due\u2014not that there were lingering questions about whether, as a legal matter, a refund was due.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Next, the customers argue that <em>Javor </em>s \u201cunique circumstances\u201d exist whenever a court is confronted with a situation involving a \u201clegal taxpayer\u201d who has the right but no incentive to seek a refund (here, the retail pharmacies) and an \u201ceconomic taxpayer\u201d who has the incentive but not the right to seek a refund (here, the customers). As the customers frankly acknowledge, however, this division of \u201ctaxpayer\u201d status is an inherent feature of \u201cthe peculiar structure of California\u2019s retail sales tax\u201d law, making that circumstance ubiquitous\u2014not unique. More to the point, if courts could fashion new tax refund remedies simply because the Revenue and Taxation Code does not label the customer as the taxpayer, our Constitution\u2019s directive that the Legislature be the branch primarily charged with \u201cproviding]\u201d tax refund remedies would be rendered all but meaningless. (Cal. Const., art. XIII, \u00a7 32.) The customers urge that the risk to the state\u2019s coffers by virtue of new tax refund remedies is minimal given the statutory presumptions that customers agree to pay sales tax reimbursement (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1656.1, subd. (a)) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>that all of a retailer\u2019s gross receipts are subject to the sales tax (Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 6051). But the affront to the constitutional mandate stems from the judicial creation of new tax refund remedies, whether or not the use of those remedies ultimately leads to a refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">The customers further cite a number of cases in which courts have allowed one party to file a derivative action for another. These cases fall into three broad categories, each of increasing irrelevance. The first is <em>Delta, supra, </em>214 Cal.App.3d 518. There, the Court of Appeal held that an airline that paid sales tax reimbursement to a retailer for fuel could sue for a sales tax refund, even though it was not the taxpayer. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 526-528.) In so holding, the court cited <em>Javor </em>and ruled that the case involved a \u201c[unique] circumstance[]\u201d authorizing judicial recognition of a new remedy of a direct lawsuit for a refund\u2014namely, that California\u2019s tax statutes \u201cregard[] common carriers such as Delta as retailers as well as purchasers.\u201d <em>(Delta, </em>at p. 528.) Indeed, <em>Delta </em>expressly distinguished common carriers from \u201cordinary purchasers or consumers.\u201d (I<em>d. </em>at p. 526.) The customers here are ordinary consumers, not common carriers. The second category involves cases in which a retailer who collected county or municipal taxes from consumers was held to have standing to sue for a refund, even though the retailer was not technically the taxpayer. (See <em>Andal, supra, </em>137 Cal.App.4th at pp. 93-95; <em>TracFone, supra, </em>163 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1364-1365; <em>Sipple, supra, </em>225 Cal.App.4th at pp. 358-362.) In so holding, these cases declined to recognize a \u201csharp distinction between a \u2018taxpayer\u2019 and a \u2018tax collector\u2019 \u201d or to follow a \u201cstrict rule denying standing in all circumstances to \u2018tax collectors.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Sipple, </em>at p. 359.) These cases are doubly irrelevant because they deal with the standing of a <em>retailer </em>who is a tax collector and not the standing of a <em>consumer </em>who is neither a tax collector nor a taxpayer, and because they deal with local taxes and thus are not constrained by California Constitution, article XIII, section 32\u2019s mandate which, as noted above, <em>does </em>require \u201cstrict\u201d construction of tax refund statutes. (See <em>Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. v. City of La Habra </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 809, 822, fn. 5 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 369, 23 P.3d 601] [Cal. Const., art. XIII, \u00a7 32 does not apply to \u201clocal governments\u201d]; <em>City of Anaheim, supra, </em>179 Cal.App.4th at pp. 830-831 [same].) The last category involves the right of a limited partner to file a derivative action on behalf of a limited partnership. <em>(Wallner v. Parry Professional Bldg., Ltd. </em>(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 1446, 1449-1450 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 834].) Because it arises in a different context and involves a different statutory scheme, it is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">The customers lastly contend that limiting judicially created remedies to cases in which there has been a prior determination that a tax refund is due will lead to absurd results. We agree that courts are loathe to interpret the law in a way that yields absurd results <em>(John </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2016) 63 Cal.4th 91, 96 [201 Cal.Rptr.3d 459, 369 P.3d 238]), but disagree with the customers\u2019 prognostications. The customers assert that if consumers can sue for a tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>refund only if there is a prior determination that a refund is due, then the same must be true for retailers seeking a refund from the Board, which will make it nearly impossible for retailers to obtain a tax refund. But the conclusion of this argument does not flow from its premise. The <em>reason </em>why a prior determination is required for consumers is because they are asking the court to create a new tax refund remedy when none exists by statute in order to avoid certain unjust enrichment; that reason has no application to retailers, who are authorized by statute to seek administrative and then judicial relief. The customers also argue the Board is not infallible because its rulings are sometimes overturned, such that placing limits on the power of courts to fashion new tax refund remedies makes it more possible for the Board\u2019s incorrect interpretations to go unreviewed. However, the question before us is to define the conditions that must be satisfied before the judiciary may fashion tax refund remedies notwithstanding our Constitution\u2019s primary commitment of defining remedies with the Legislature; it is not to afford maximum opportunities for judicial review. Moreover, retailers still have the right to directly challenge the Board\u2019s rulings and, as we discuss below, consumers have a more diluted right to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">B. <em>Application</em></p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">As explained above, a court may create a new tax refund remedy\u2014and, accordingly, <em>Javor\u2019s </em>\u201cunique circumstances\u201d exist\u2014only if (1) the person seeking the new tax refund remedy has no statutory tax refund remedy available, (2) the tax refund remedy sought is not inconsistent with existing tax refund remedies, and (3) the Board has already determined that the person seeking the new tax refund remedy is entitled to a refund, such that the refusal to create that remedy will unjustly enrich either the taxpayer/retailer or the Board. The trial court in this case ruled that it could not fashion a new judicial remedy to allow the customers to attack the Board\u2019s collection of sales tax on lancets and test strips. This ruling was correct because none of the three prerequisites is present in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">First, the customers do not have a statutory right to directly file for a refund of the sales tax from the Board or for a refund of sales tax reimbursement from the retailers, but they are not remedy-less. In fact, they have several other remedies available to them. They may urge the Board to initiate an audit of the retail pharmacies\u2019 practices in collecting sales tax or to conduct a deficiency determination of the retail pharmacies\u2019 sales tax payments (\u00a7\u00a7 6481, 6483, 7054; <em>Loeffler, supra, </em>58 Cal.4th at pp. 1103-1104, 1123 [noting that \u201cconsumers who believe they have been charged excess reimbursement . . . may complain to the Board, which may in turn initiate an audit\u201d or a \u201cdeficiency determination\u201d].) They can, as \u201cinterested person[s],\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>petition the Board under the Administrative Procedure Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11340 et seq.) to compel the Board to \u201cadopt[], amend[], or repeal\u201d Regulation 1591.1, subdivision (b)(5) and the collection of sales tax under that regulation. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11340.6; see <em>Loeffler, </em>at p. 1123.) And they can, as \u2018\u201cinterested person[s],\u201d sue the Board under the Administrative Procedure Act, for declaratory relief \u2018\u201cas to the validity of\u2019 Regulation 1591.1. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11350, subd. (a); see <em>Loeffler, </em>at p. 1123.)</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">Second, judicial recognition of a right of customers to sue retailers and the Board for a sales tax refund when the Board has yet to determine whether any refund is due is inconsistent with at least two provisions of the Revenue and Taxation Code. It is inconsistent with section 6905. That section allows retailers to waive their right to seek a tax refund; if consumers can compel a retailer to seek a refund when it would rather waive it, the retailer\u2019s right to waiver would be negated. <em>(Loeffler, supra, </em>58 Cal.4th at p. 1129 [so noting].) The consumers assert that the retailers\u2019 power to waive their right to a refund is irrelevant because the retailers\u2019 power to collect sales tax reimbursement from consumers is a matter of contract under Civil Code section 1656.1. But the contractual nature of the right to collect sales tax reimbursement in no way affects the fact that a judicial remedy compelling a retailer to seek a refund overrides a retailer\u2019s election not to seek one.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Judicial recognition of a right of customers to sue retailers when the Board has yet to determine whether a refund is due is also inconsistent with section 6901.5. That section requires a retailer that obtains from the Board a sales tax refund collected from its customers to do one of two things: (1) return that money to the customers once its entitlement to the refund \u2018\u201chas been ascertained\u201d; or (2) leave that money with the state. (\u00a7 6901.5; see also Cal. Code Regs., tit. 18, \u00a7 1700, subd. (b)(1) [containing identical language].)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In <em>Loeffler, </em>our Supreme Court read this section as providing a \u2018\u201csafe harbor\u201d or \u201csafe haven\u201d for any retailer/taxpayer \u201cvis-a-vis the consumer\u201d if the retailer/taxpayer \u201cremits reimbursement charges [it collects] to the Board.\u201d <em>(Loeffler, supra, </em>58 Cal.4th at pp. 1100, 1103-1104, 1119.) If consumers can sue retailers to compel them to seek a refund from the Board, then the \u201csafe harbor\u201d from suit erected by section 6901.5 is no safe harbor at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>all. (Accord, <em>Loeffler, </em>at p. 1126 [noting conflict].) Indeed, the customers concede as much when they raise the issue before us only to preserve it for challenge before the Supreme Court. To be sure, the regulation implementing section 6901.5 provides that it \u201cdo[es] not necessarily limit the rights of customers to pursue refunds from persons who collected tax reimbursement from them in excess of the amount due.\u201d (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 18, \u00a7 1700, subd. (b)(6).) But <em>Loeffler </em>held that this language did no more than \u201cacknowledge[] that <em>if </em>other remedies are available, the regulation does not interfere with them.\u201d (Loeffler, at p. 1122.)</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">Third, the Board has yet to decide whether the retail pharmacies\u2014and, by extension, the customers\u2014are entitled to a refund. Regulation 1591.1 exempts the sales of lancets and test strips, but only when they are (1) \u201cfurnished by a registered pharmacist,\u201d and (2) \u201cused by a diabetic patient ... in accordance with a physician\u2019s instructions.\u201d (Reg. 1591.1, subd. (b)(5).) It has yet to be determined whether those two conditions are legally valid or were factually satisfied as to the customers\u2019 purchases. In their reply brief on appeal, the customers argue that the Board has conceded that a refund was due because the Board, in its brief on appeal, did not address the merits of the taxability issue and admitted that a 2003 opinion letter sent by a Board staff member arguably setting forth additional prerequisites to application of Regulation 1591.1 \u2019 s exemption was not a \u201cbinding determination of the Board.\u201d There was no concession. The Board did not address the merits of the taxability issue because the chief issue in this appeal is not the merits, but <em>where </em>and <em>hy whom </em>they may be litigated. And the validity or invalidity of the 2003 opinion letter does not alter the undisputed fact that the Board has yet to determine that all of the sales the customers challenge fall within the ambit of Regulation 1591.l\u2019s exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">For these reasons, the customers have not established that this case involves the \u201cunique circumstances\u201d that empower a court to fashion a new tax refund remedy.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Absent such a remedy, there can be no judicial determination that the retail pharmacies\u2019 collection of sales tax reimbursement was improper. And absent that determination, none of the customers\u2019 claims\u2014all of which are premised on the unlawful collection of sales tax reimbursement\u2014state a viable cause of action. <em>(Centinela Freeman, supra, </em>1 Cal.5th at p. 1010.)</p>\n<p id=\"b694-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>C. <em>Customers </em>\u2019 <em>further arguments</em></p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">The customers level two further categories of arguments at our conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">First, the customers note that courts must generally \u201cconstrue . . . statute [s] in a manner that avoids doubts as to [their] constitutional validity.\u201d <em>(Steen v. Appellate Division of Superior Court </em>(2014) 59 Cal.4th 1045, 1048 [175 Cal.Rptr.3d 760, 331 P.3d 136].) From this, they argue that we must not construe the Revenue and Taxation Code to deny them a judicially fashioned tax refund remedy because doing so will risk violations of the takings clause and due process. No such risks exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">The federal and California Constitutions guarantee that \u201cprivate property\u201d shall not \u201cbe taken for public use, without just compensation.\u201d (U.S. Const., 5th Amend.; see Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 19, subd. (a).) Two types of \u201ctakings\u201d are assured just compensation: (1) categorical or per se takings, which arise when the government physically occupies property or deprives its owner of all viable uses of the property <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>Legal Foundation of Wash. </em>(2003) 538 U.S. 216, 233 [155 L.Ed.2d 376, 123 S.Ct. 1406]; <em>California Building Industry Assn. v. City of San Jose </em>(2015) 61 Cal.4th 435, 462 [189 Cal.Rptr.3d 475, 351 P.3d 974]); and (2) regulatory takings, which arise when government regulation of a property\u2019s use sufficiently impairs its value <em>(California Building Industry Assn., </em>at p. 462). No matter how it is viewed, consumers\u2019 payment of the sales tax reimbursement does not effect a \u201ctaking\u201d: To the extent we focus on the retailer\u2019s initial collection of the sales tax reimbursement, it is not a \u201ctaking\u201d because the retailer is not a government entity <em>(City of Perris v. Stamper </em>(2016) 1 Cal.5th 576, 591 [205 Cal.Rptr.3d 797, 376 P.3d 1221] [\u201cThe takings clause . . . prohibits a <em>governmental entity </em>from taking private property for public use without just compensation\u201d (italics added)]); to the extent we focus on the Board\u2019s subsequent receipt of that money as part of the retailer\u2019s sales tax, it is not a \u201ctaking\u201d because \u201c \u2018[t]axes and user fees ... are not \u201ctakings\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Koontz </em>v. <em>St. Johns River Water Mgmt. Dist. </em>(2013) 570 U.S. 595, _ [186 L.Ed.2d 697, 133 S.Ct. 2586, 2600]; see <em>United States v. Sperry Corp. </em>(1989) 493 U.S. 52, 62, fn. 9 [107 L.Ed.2d 290, 110 S.Ct. 387]; accord, <em>San Remo Hotel </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 643, 671 [117 Cal.Rptr.2d 269, 41 P.3d 87] [noting that \u201c \u2018the taking of money is different, under the Fifth Amendment, from the taking of real or personal property\u2019 \u201d]). Thus, the collection of sales tax reimbursement from consumers does not implicate the takings clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">The federal and California Constitutions also provide that the state shall not deprive persons of their property \u201cwithout due process of law.\u201d (U.S. Const., 14th Amend., \u00a7 1; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 7, subd. (a).) This guarantee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>applies to the payment of taxes <em>(T. M. Cobb Co. v. County of Los Angeles </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 606, 617, fn. 6 [128 Cal.Rptr. 655, 547 P.2d 431]), but authorizes a state to relegate taxpayers to a \u201c \u2018postpayment refund action\u2019 \u201d as long as they are afforded \u201c \u2018meaningful backward-looking relief to rectify any unconstitutional deprivation\u2019 \u201d <em>(River Garden Retirement Home v. Franchise Tax Bd. </em>(2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 922, 937-938 [113 Cal.Rptr.3d 62] <em>(River </em>Garden), quoting <em>McKesson Corp. v. Florida Alcohol &amp; Tobacco Div. </em>(1990) 496 U.S. 18, 31 [110 L.Ed.2d 17, 110 S.Ct. 2238] (McKesson); see <em>City of Anaheim, supra, </em>179 Cal.App.4th at p. 831). A state provides \u201c \u2018meaningful-backward-looking\u2019 relief\u2019 if it gives taxpayers (1) \u201ca \u2018fair opportunity to challenge the accuracy and legal validity of their tax obligation,\u2019 \u201d and (2) \u201ca \u2018 \u201cclear and certain remedy\u201d \u2019 for the erroneous or unlawful tax collection.\u201d <em>(River Garden, </em>at p. 938, quoting <em>McKesson, </em>at p. 39.)</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">We conclude that our refusal to craft a judicial tax refund remedy for consumers does not risk a due process violation. To begin, it is not precisely clear how due process applies to them. The payment of sales tax alleged in the operative complaint entails two sequential transactions: Consumers pay sales tax reimbursement to retailers, and retailers pay sales tax to the state. The first transaction is ostensibly outside the reach of due process because it reflects a contractual arrangement between two private parties (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1656.1; <em>Coleman v. Department of Personnel Administration </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 1102, 1112 [278 Cal.Rptr. 346, 805 P.2d 300] [\u201cOnly those actions that may fairly be attributed to the state ... are subject to due process protections\u201d]), and the consumers are not parties to the second transaction. Further, our Supreme Court in Loeffler\u2014although silent on this point\u2014noted no constitutional impediment to its ruling that left consumers with no direct remedy for a refund and instead relegated them to urging Board inquiry and to filing claims or actions under the Administrative Procedure Act. <em>(Loeffler, supra, </em>58 Cal.4th 1081.) Were we to come to a contrary conclusion, we would effectively overrule <em>Loeffler, </em>something we are not allowed to do except in narrow circumstances not present here. <em>(Auto Equity Sales, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 450, 456 [20 Cal.Rptr. 321, 369 P.2d 937].)</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Second, the customers assert that our ruling that we are powerless to craft a new judicial tax refund remedy does not warrant dismissal of their breach of contract claims or their second UCL claim. Specifically, the customers urge (1) that their breach of contract claims are grounded in Civil Code section 1656.1, which is effectively part of the Revenue and Taxation Code and is more specific than section 6901.5, and thus cannot be inconsistent with either the code or section 6901.5, (2) their second breach of contract claim is premised on allegations that one of the retailers who charged sales tax reimbursement sometimes did not mean to do so because its corporate policy did not call for it, and (3) that their second UCL claim is based upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>allegations that the retail pharmacies should have informed them of the requirements to qualify for Regulation 1591.1 \u2019 s exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">We reject the customers\u2019 first argument because, as explained above, the premise of their breach of contract claims is that the retail pharmacies wrongly collected sales tax reimbursement <em>that was not due, </em>yet they have no means in this lawsuit of establishing whether it was due. We reject the customers\u2019 second argument because the only contract at issue is the one between the retailer and customer; because the express terms of that contract, which arise from the presumption in Civil Code section 1656.1 because the retailer showed a charge for sales tax on its receipts, are that the retailer is charging sales tax reimbursement; and because the retailer\u2019s unexpressed intention not to charge sales tax in some transactions cannot alter the express terms of the parties\u2019 contract or otherwise rebut the statutory presumption <em>(Patel v. Liebermensch </em>(2008) 45 Cal.4th 344, 352 [86 Cal.Rptr.3d 366, 197 P.3d 177] [\u201c \u2018The terms of the contract are determinable by an external, not by an internal standard\u2019 \u201d]). We reject the customers\u2019 third argument because the pharmacies owed no duty to explain how to qualify for the exemption. (Accord, <em>Buller v. Sutter Health </em>(2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 981, 987-988 [74 Cal.Rptr.3d 47] [insurance company has no duty to explain to clients how to get the best deal]; <em>Levine </em>v. <em>Blue Shield of California </em>(2010) 189 Cal.App.4th 1117, 1136-1137 [117 Cal.Rptr.3d 262] [same].)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">III. <em>Leave to Amend Was Properly Denied</em></p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">The customers argue that the trial court erred in not allowing them to amend the operative complaint to add a claim that they were suffering an unconstitutional taking. Because, as explained above, such a claim lacks merit as a matter of law, the trial court\u2019s conclusion that there was no reasonable possibility the customers could amend their complaint to state a claim was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>* * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">The result we reach in this case is not an entirely satisfying one. The retail pharmacies lack any financial incentive to challenge the Board\u2019s implementation of Regulation 1591.1 by seeking a refund, and the statutory remedies available to the customers\u2014urging the Board to conduct an audit or filing a claim or lawsuit under the Administrative Procedure Act\u2014while effective enough to satisfy due process, are nevertheless the practical equivalent of allowing them to tug (albeit persistently) at the Board\u2019s sleeve. However, this is the result we must reach because our Constitution chiefly assigns the task of creating tax refund remedies to our Legislature, and our Legislature has yet to address the situation that arises when the legal taxpayer has no incentive to seek a direct refund and the economic taxpayer has no right to do so. It is a topic worthy of legislative consideration. Because the prerequisites for making it a topic of judicial consideration are not present, we adhere to the statutes as they are written and affirm the order dismissing this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">The judgment is affirmed.

Because the initial round of briefing on appeal is not a dry run for a whole new round of postopinion briefing on rehearing, we respectfully decline to consider these arguments for the first time on rehearing.
