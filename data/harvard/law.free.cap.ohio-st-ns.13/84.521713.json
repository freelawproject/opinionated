That the defendant, though often requested, refused tp construct the road or any part thereof across his farm. That the plaintiff thereupon constructed the same across said farm at an expense of $828.30. That in October, 1858, the plaintiff tendered stock to the defendant to that amount, and then demanded payment by said Coy of said.sum, which stock he refused to aceept and also refused to pay the amount.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-4\">Judgment is thereupon demanded for the sum of $828.30, with interest from September 30, 1858.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-5\">In the court of common pleas, the demurrer to the petition was sustained and judgment rendered for the defendant.

The contract of the defendant was evidently made in anticipation of the organization and incorporation of the company and for its exclusive benefit. He designates it, in his written promise, as the \u201cDayton, Watervleit Yalley and Nenia Turnpike Company,\u201d which name it subsequently assumed upon incorporation; and agreed to build, or pay for building, a portion of the road across his farm, taking his pay, in either event, from the company in its stock. This is, in our judgment, a contract to <em>false stoclc in the road, </em>equal to the cost of constructing the same across his farm ; such cost to be fixed by the engineer\u2019s estimate. It was a contract by which the defendant secured in addition, if he desired, the probable profits to result from constructing the same, being the difference between the cost of building it and the engineer\u2019s estimate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-8\">Agreements to take stock and pay for the same in labor, materials, etc., are valid; being, in cases like the present, equivalent to the money. <em>Philadelphia and West Chester Railway </em>v. <em>Hickman, </em>28 Penn. 318; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Farmington, (Wisconsin), </em>West. Law Monthly, 1860, 401.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>2. Being a contract to take stock in the road, a sufficient consideration to support it in the beginning is found in the anticipation of dividends and profits in tolls; and it becomes a binding contract, if' there are proper parties, from the time of subscription; acceptance by the other party being presumed. There was an additional consideration in this instance, being the location of the road upon a designated route across the defendant\u2019s farm. In order to compel the defendant to build the road it was necessary to locate it as he had stipulated; but this proviso, although material, being only a part of the consideration, gave him no power to annul the contract at his option at any time before location, but only in case of a location elsewhere. <em>Commissioners of Canal Fund </em>v. Perry, 5 Ohio Rep. 57; <em>State of Ohio v. </em>Collins, 6 Ohio Rep. 142; <em>Milford, etc., Turnpike Co. </em>v. <em>Brush, </em>10 Ohio Rep. 111; <em>Henderson and Nashville R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Leavett, </em>16 B. Mon. 358; Angell and Ames on Corp. (6th ed.), ch. xv, secs. 517, 519.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-5\">3. The .contract feeing founded upon sufficient consideration, and being in other respects lawful and binding, the remaining inquiry is in regard to parties, it is objected that there is a defect in this particular, based upon the fact that the plaintiff was not incorporated at the time the promise was made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-6\">Upon this branch of the ease we submit that a promise made to individuals, upon a good consideration, te induce the. organization of an incorporated company, and tho construction by it of a road advantageous to the promisor, having-been accepted and acted upon by them, for the same -purposes, instead of being forfeited or destroyed by the act of incorporation which executes the intentions of both parties, rather derives from it additional vitality.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-7\">This writing may be considered in two lights;</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-8\"><em>First. </em>As a contract -with the person -named and to wh-onj it was delivered, the benefits to accrue -to the corporation in contemplation by both parties; or,</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-9\"><em>Second. </em>As a continuing offer in their hands made by the defendant to the corporation, which became a contract between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>him and it, as soon, as it came into existence under the law and accepted the offer. This acceptance, as was before stated, will be presumed, in the absence of proof. <em>Mitchell\u2019s Lesses </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>3 Ohio St. Rep. 377.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-4\">In either view the objection of the defendant falls to the ground. For if we regard it as a contract with the persons to whom it was delivered, it had proper parties, as they were in existence and capable; and if we construe it simply as a continuing offer, not binding until aecepted by the corporation after it came into existence, the objection is entirely \u2022 waded. And whether we regard it as a contract, or as an c-fer not binding until acceptance, the action was properly brought by the corporation in its own name. In the one view: it was the. actual party to the contract by acceptance ; and in the other was the real party in interest, and for Yfhose benefit the bargain was made ; being thus entitled, under the code and the rulings in the cases in Ohio, heretofore cited, <em>Commissioners of Canal Fund </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>5 Ohio Rep., 57; <em>State of Ohio </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>6 Ohio Rep. 126; <em>Milford and Chillicothe Turnpike Co. </em>v. <em>Brush, </em>10 Ohio Rep. 111; and in <em>Thompson\u2019s Adm'x. v. Thompson, </em>4 Ohio. St. Rep. 323, to institute the suit in its own name.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-5\">The weight ef authority is strongly in favor of the positions above taken. We cite: Angell &amp; Ames on Corp., secs. 523, <em>et seq.; </em>Redfield on Railways, see. 57 <em>Kidwelly Canal Co. </em>v. <em>Raby, </em>2 Price (Ex.), 93; <em>Selma amd Tennessee R. R.

The conduct of the defendant was for a purpose. * * Under all the circu.mstan.ces it. seems clear to. us that the ae~ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>tion of the defendant in making and delivering this paper, at the very least, amounts to a standing and continuing offer upon his part to the corporation to build the road across his farm, provided the same was located as he desired. There is no allegation that this offer was retracted before acted upon and accepted by the company. On the contrary, it is alleged that the persons named relying upon the defendant\u2019s promise proceeded to organize the company; and that the company thereupon proceeded to locate the road as agreed with him, and to build the same up to his farm, at great expense, and with notice to him. Being such offer to build the part across his farm, provided it was located there as desired, it became an accepted offer, or in other words, a contract, the moment that the company complied with the proviso, and its binding obligation dated from that time. The wanf of parties can not be urged as an objection in this view of the ease. The offer needed but one party; and when accepted, it became a contract by the acceptance, of the corporation then in existence. <em>Kennaway </em>v. Treleavan, 5 M. &amp; W. 501; <em>Mosley </em>v. <em>Tinker, </em>1 Or. Mees. &amp; Ros, 692; <em>Boston and Maine R. R. Co.r. Bartlett, </em>3 Cush. 224; <em>Connecticut and Passumpsic R. R.

Nesbitt, </em>for defendant in error :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-6\">The obligation upon which suit is brought bears date March 25,1854. The certificate of plaintiff\u2019s incorporation is dated April 27,1854. The contract, therefore, was not made with the plaintiff, because the plaintiff was not in.existence\u2014was not authorized to contract\u2014until after the contract was made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-7\">If the defendant is at all liable upon it, his liability must rest upon some act or promise of his to the plaintiff since the plaintiff became authorized to make a contract. The record discloses neither a promise nor act of the defendant binding him to do the work or pay for it. The case is one in which there was no mutuality, and, from its very nature, could not be.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b116-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>The courts refuse to enforce such a contract, unless the party who may have made a subscription of stock to a corporation, <em>before </em>it was legally chartered as such, either permitted his name to be used in the act of incorporation, or after the incorporation acknowledged his liability, by a payment of part, or a promise to pay, or giving his note or other written obligation to pay. Angell &amp; Ames on Corp., sec. 255, p. 271; <em>Phillips Limerick Academy </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>11 Mass. 113, and the cases there, cited; <em>Amherst Academy </em>v. <em>Cowles, </em>6 Pick, 434-6, where the authorities are examined.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b116-5\">Gholson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7J\">The petition in this case seeks to recover a specific amount, as a debt becoming due on the tender of the stock. It states that the stock was tendered, payment of the sum which, by the t contract, was tobe given for the stock demanded, and that the defendant refused to accept the stock and to pay the amount so demanded, and a judgment is therefore asked for that amount and interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Regarded as an action of debt\u2014as an action to recovera certain sum\u2014it is questionable whether it could be maintained\u2014 the contract being very clearly executory, and no title to the stock having passed, in fact neither the company nor its stock being in existence at the time of the contract, and no assent of the defendant at any time thereafter to become a stockholder being shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">The rule in England appears to be, that on an executory contract for the sale of property, where an agreed price is to be paid on the transfer of a title to the property, the remedy for a refusal to complete the contract by acceptance and payment, is an action for the damages sustained thereby. <em>Laird </em>v. <em>Pim, </em>7 Mees. &amp; Welsh. 474, 478. The principle appears to be, that a party can not retain the title to the property and also recover the price, and to pass the title the assent of the other party is requisite. This assent may, in a proper caso, be enforced in a court of equity; but in amere action on the coiitract to recover the price, that can not be done. There are American cases which hold that in such cases, after a tender, an action to recover the price, may be maintained. <em>Alna </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number><em>Plummer, </em>4 Greenl. 258; <em>Bement v. Smith, </em>15 Wend. 493. It was said of these cases, in <em>Shannon </em>v. <em>Comstock, </em>21 Wend. 457, 460, by Cowen, J.: \u201cI admit that in some cases, where property is so tendered, and the tender is not withdrawn, the price may be recovered; but this is on the ground that the thing sold has an independent existence, and the corpus not being perishable, and having legally passed by the tender and subsequent recovery, may still be actually delivered over whenever the vendee shall demand it.\u201d The reasoning of the court, in <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Alger, </em>12 Metc. 428, and in <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Jarvis, </em>20 Conn. 38, appears to sustain the English rule, though an exception was allowed under the circumstances of those cases. The language of the court, in <em>Sawyer </em>v <em>McIntyre, </em>18 Vt. 27\u201431, accords with that rule. The case of <em>Garrard </em>v. <em>Dollar, </em>4 Jones L. 175, is to the contrary. But it is not ne_ cessary that we should pass on this point. The facts are stated in the petition, and an amendment claiming damages, instead of a specific. amount, if necessary, could be readily made. Indeed, on demurrer, the difference between the demand of a specific amount as a debt due and the same amount as damages for the breach of the contract, might not be regarded as fatal to a petition. We therefore proceed to consider the question, upon which the right of the plaintiff to maintain the action depends.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">If the instrument sued on in this case showed simply an agreement on the part of the defendant to accept and pay for stock in a turnpike company, thereafter to come into existence, and which could not be a party to the instrument, or be bound to furnish the stock, there could certainly be no contract binding on the defendant for the want of mutuality. A written stipulation to take stock in a turnpike company which is not in existence, can not be enforced by the contemplated turnpike company when it comes into existence, because it would be under no obligation to do the act which is the consideration for the promise of the other party, to furnish the stock. But it is said that the objection of a want of mutuality \u201c must be confined to those cases where the want of mutuality would leave one party without a valid or avail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>able consideration for his promise.\u201d <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>Mayor of Poole, </em>4 M. &amp; Gr. 861-896. And to this it has been replied, that \u201c It is difficult to conceive a case where there should be a valid consideration on both sides, and jet a want of mutuality.\u201d Smith on Contracts, 88, note. <em>\u201c </em>Every contract consists of a request on one side, and an assent on the other.\u201d <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Galloway, </em>5 Bing. N. C. 75. \u201cThese are the terms of mutuality: if either are absent, there is no contract. The request may be express or- implied, and likewise the promise or assent. Both are far oftener implied than expressed in simple contracts. The cases in which the request or the promise are-express, require little comment. The ordinary meaning of the words used will determine the legal effect, according to the established rules of construction. The assent to the contract must be to the precise terms offered.\u201d \u201c A oontract,\u201d says Pothier, \u201c includes a concurrence of intention in two parties, one of whom -promises something to the other, who on his part accepts such promise.\u201d Hence is assent or acceptance indispensable to the validity of every contract; for \u201c as I can not \u201d continues Pothier, \u201c by the mere act of my own mind transfer to another a right in any goods, without a concurrent intention on his part to accept them, neither can I by any promise confer a right against any person until the person to whom the promise is made has, by his acceptance of it, concurred in the intention of acquiring such right. Wherever there is not assent, express or implied, to the terms of the proposed contract by both parties, there is no mutuality, and no contract.\u201d Smith on Contracts, 88, note.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">\u201c In contracts, where the promise of the one party is the consideration for the promise of the other, the promises must be concurrent and obligatory upon both at the same time.\u201d<em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Raynbred, </em>Hobart, 88b ; <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>12 Johns. 190, 192; <em>Reep </em>v. <em>Goodrich, </em>12 Johns. 397; 1 Chitty on Pl. 325; Story on Cont., sec. 448; Addison on Cont. 34. But where the consideration is not the promise, but the doing of some act, which being done would constitute a valid consideration, then assent to the contract may be shown by doing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>the act. The promise to pay a certain sum on the doing a certain act, which will benefit the promisor or prejudice the promisee, implies a request to do the act, and unless such request be withdrawn before it is complied with, the doing the act is an assent, and the promise becomes obligatory. In such a case, performance is an assent to the terms proposed* But suppose the terms proposed were such, as to require the doing of one thing and a promise to do another thing, then in the language which has been quoted, \u201c the assent to the contract .must be to the precise terms offered.\u201d If there was no mutual promise there would be no contract, but if the thing should be done and a benefit derived therefrom, the party might.be charged on an implied agreement to pay the value.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">We think it doubtful, whether a fair construction of the instrument under consideration shows a request to locate the road across the farm of the defendant. The contingency that it might be so located, was contemplated, and in the event that it should be, then, the defendant bound himself to build the road or pay for the building, at the engineer\u2019s estimate, and take the amount'in stock. But there was not, nor could there have been, any promise then made by the plaintiff to permit the building of the road or to deliver the stock. The case would then fall within the principle of <em>Cooke </em>v. Oxley, 3 T. R. 653, in which there was a proposal to sell goods to the plaintiff, and an agreement to give him a certain time to determine if he would take them. He determined to take them, within the time and gave notice thereof, requested a delivery of the goods and offered to pay the price, but it was held, that he not being bound by the original contract, there was no consideration to bind the other party. This principle was acted on in <em>Burnell </em>v. <em>Johnson, 4 </em>Johns. 235. In the case of <em>Branch Bank at Huntsville </em>v. <em>Steele, </em>10 Ala. 915, there was an agreement by the bank to receive state bonds at a future day in discharge of a debt, but the debtor was not also bound to deliver the bonds, and the contract was held to be not binding on the bank for want of mutuality, and therefore did not discharge an indorser who relied upon it as a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>Assuming, however, that the locating the road across the farm of the defendant, entered into the consideration, it was, as admitted by the counsel for the plaintiff, only a part of the consideration, and a silent assent by the performance of that part of the consideration, would not, according to the principles above stated, suffice. It may be true, that \u201cif a contract has been executed by the performance of the act forming the consideration for the promise, then it is no answer to an action, to say that the plaintiff was not, by the terms of the original contract, <em>bound </em>to do the act, and there was consequently no mutuality of obligation.\u201d Addison on Contracts, 85. But this rule does not appear to be applicable, where the act done only constitutes a part of the consideration and shows no assent to the terms of the contract. The objection of the want of mutuality is avoided, because the contract shows a request to do the act and an agreement to be bound upon its being done, and the doing the act is an assent to those terms. This can not be said, where the terms of the contract require more than a silent performance of a part of the consideration, and shows that there was no intention to be bound,- unless there was a mutual obligation to perform the other part of the consideration, in its nature concurrent. The rule certainly can not apply in this case, where that which is alleged to have been part of the consideration and to have been performed, does not necessarily connect itself with the defendant, and may or may not have been done with a view of assenting to the promise of the defendant. Without something more than the act of locating the road across the farm of the defendant, it would be impossible for the defendant to show that it constituted an agreement on the part of the turnpike company. Had the stock on the completion of the road advanced to above its par value, and the defendant been desirous to procure stock equal to the amount of the estimate for building the part of the road dc-\u25a0scribed in the instrument, he certainly could not sustain his claim by showing the written instrument and the fact of the location of the road. He would be bound to show assent in some other way, and other evidence of assent being requisite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>to bind the company, it is also requisite to hind the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">We have been asked by the counsel for the plaintiff, if we found there was no mutuality in the contract, still, to look at the conduct of the defendant\u2014his purpose in the execution of the instrument. But we do not see how we can look at the conduct of the defendant with any other view, than to ascertain whether he has entered into a contract. In such a case as this, it is not our province to decide as to the propriety of the conduct of the party. We have only to inquire whether he has incurred a legal obligation, and being of opinion for the reasons which have been stated, that he has not, the judgment of the court of common pleas will he affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b121-7\">Sutlers', C.J., and Peck, Brinicerhoee and Scott, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
