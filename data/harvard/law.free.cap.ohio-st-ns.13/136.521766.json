Wherefore it is considered by the court that said defendant do recover of the said plaintiff the costs of this suitj taxed at thirteen dollars and twelve cents.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-8\">On the 20th of October, 1854, Chapman &amp;

McKernan, of the judgment against Hall, the guaranty, iu said assignment, that if Chapman &amp; McKernan should fail in collecting said judgment after' prosecuting Hall to insolvency, he, Woodward, was to-be responsible for and pay to them four hundred dollars..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-10\">The petition further alleges that suit was instituted against Hall, on said judgment, by Chapman &amp;

McKernan, and that they had executed the assignment of that guaranty .to the plaintiff, Moore, in the forms set out in the copy of the same attached to his petition, \u201c the plaintiff, to maintain the issue on his part,offered in evidence to the jury a transcript of the record of the proceedings and judgment in the case of Ebenezer Gr. Woodward, for the use of Chapman &amp; McKernan, against Jonathan C. Hall, in the district court of Des Moines county, Iowa, which transcript is attached to the original petition in this case, and a true copy of which, marked \u2018 A,\u2019 is attached to the bill of exceptions and made a part thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-7\">\u201c To the introduction of said transcript as evidence, the said Ebenezer Gr. Woodward, by his counsel, then and there objected, on the ground, that the record of the judgment in Iowa was incompetent evidence in the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-8\">\u201c And thereupon the court overruled said objection, and allowed said record to be given in evidence. To which ruling of the court the defendant excepted.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-9\">The plaintiff, Moore, thereupon rested his ease.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-10\">The defendant moved for a nonsuit, which motion was overruled and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-11\">The defendant was then sworn as a Avitness., and testified that he never had any notice or knoAvledge of the bringing or pendency of said suit in IoAva.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-12\">He then offered to prove by his OAvn testimony and other evidence, that the judgment against Hall Avas in fact unpaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-13\">^The plaintiff objected to this testimony, and the court sustained the objection, and excluded the testimony from the jury, and the defendant again excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-14\">After further testimony Avas given by both parties upon the issue as to failure of consideration for the assignment and guaranty by Woodward to Chapman &amp; McKernan, the cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>was submitted to the jury, who returned a verdict for the plaintiff, Moore, for the sum claimed in the petition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-5\">Thereupon the defendant, Woodward, moved for a new tidal, for the reasons that the court refused to nonsuit the plaintiff, and to permit the defendant to give evidence to show that the judgment against Hall was unpaid when he assigned it to Chapman &amp; McKernan; and because the court overruled the defendant\u2019s. objection to the introduction of the Iowa record in evidence to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-6\">The court overruled the'motion for a new trial, and entered judgment on the verdict. To reverse that judgment the defendant filed his petition in error in this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b166-7\"><em>8. Israel </em>and <em>Curtis \u00a7 Scribner, </em>for Woodward, argued :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-8\">1. The written contract of guaranty, in plain terms, is a guaranty of solvency, and nothing more.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-9\">The petition is not founded upon the <em>writing, </em>but upon the alleged fraud, or upon the undertaking arising <em>by implication of lato </em>that the judgment was <em>unsatisfied </em>at the time of the assignment. This undertaking exists independently of the writing, and would have existed had there been no written contract whatever.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-10\">The writing does not undertake that the judgment is unsatisfied; neither-does it undertake that it was not barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-11\">The implied contract arising in law that the judgment is unsatisfied, does not include an undertaking that it is not barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-12\">2.

If the record did establish the fact of payment, it was but <em>prima facie </em>evidence; and Woodward, in law, was entitled to the privilege of introducing evidence on Ms part to overcome the <em>prima facie </em>case so made. The refusal of the' court to permit such evidence to be given was error, for which the judgment should be reversed. <em>Lam </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>10 Ind.

Critehfield,'iov </em>defendant in error, argued :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b167-10\">The Iowa record was competent and conclusive evidence against Woodward.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b167-11\">A guaranty for a valuable consideration, as distinguished from a mere suretyship, is to be construed liberally. <em>Mauran </em>v. <em>Bullus, </em>16 Pet. 537. The guaranty in question, made by Woodward, was for a valuable consideration, as the verdict of the jury upon that direct issue shows.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b167-12\">Instead of Woodward\u2019s contract of assignment and guaranty being a mere undertaking that Hall was at the time solvent, it is an undertaking that the judgment was unpaid, and that a new judgment could be obtained thereon against Hall by proceeding in an action against Mm in Iowa, and that the new judgment could be collected. And a breach of such a contract is made out by showing that the original judgment was not enforceable either by reason of its having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>been paid, or by reason of the bar of the statute of limitations, as well as by the fact that it could not be collected upon execution issued on a neAV judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-5\"><em>A </em>guaranty that a judgment can be collected \u201cif well attended to,\u201d is a guaranty that the judgment is a valid one. <em>Snow </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>3 Grillman (Ill.) 258-60.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-6\">To show insolvency is equivalent to showing that a claim can not be collected by due process of law. <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>11 Verm. 265; <em>Marsh </em>v. <em>Day, </em>18 Pick. 321-2; <em>Sanford </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>1 Cush. 473.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-7\">Why is not the use of due process of law, to the extent the nature of the case admits, equivalent to prosecuting to insolvency ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-8\">Then we have a record 'of a proceeding, under the guaranty, against Hall, in Iowa, <em>wherein Woodward is plaintiff, </em>as the law and his contract required, and that record is not only competent but conclusive against him, unless he be relieved from the operation of the well-settled rule that a judgment in an action concludes parties and privies.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-9\">It will not do to say that WoodAvard, in the Iowa action, was merely a nominal party. That Avon\u2019t relieve him from the rule above mentioned. But he was not merely a nominal party; he was the necessary plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-10\">The numerous cases cited by opposite counsel to show that a judgment is not conclusive upon a guarantor, are cases in which he Avas neither party nor privy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-11\">Had not Woodward, in the Iowa proceeding, been the plaintiff, but had Chapman &amp; McKernan prosecuted the action, in their own name, as plaintiffs, Woodward would have been bound by the result. <em>Jackson </em>v. Griswold, 4 Hill, 529; <em>Milley </em>v. <em>Paulk et al., </em>6 Conn. 74; <em>De Forest </em>v. <em>Strong, </em>8 Conn. 521.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-12\">But it is said that, conceding the record of the Iowa proceeding to be admissible, it does not establish the fact of payment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-13\">The tAvo issues in the Iowa action were: 1. The statute of limitations of six years; 2. Payment. One or both pf .those issues were determined by the judgment in favor of Hall. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>Either of them shows a breach of Woodward\u2019s contract of guaranty. If the judgment is conclusive upon the first issue, then it shows that when Woodward, in 1852, assigned the old judgment upon which he pretended that no payment had been made since 1840, the statutory bar was complete; and, if pleaded in the new action, it would preclude his assignees from \u201cprosecuting Hall to insolvency\u201d therein. But the judgment in Iowa was intended to and does determine the issue of payment, as is manifest from the form of the judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-4\">Counsel for Woodward, in reply, insisted, in addition to the points taken in their opening argument, that the fact that the action in Iowa was prosecuted in the name of Woodward by the assignees, can not change the rule requiring notice to be given him in order to make the record conclusive upon him.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b169-5\">Gholson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQp\">The express condition of the contract is that</p>\n<p id=\"AW7\">Woodward was to be responsible after the prosecution of Hall to insolvency. The inference is clear that it was the understanding of the parties that Hall <em>could </em>be prosecuted to insolvency, and Woodward must be regarded as having.made such an agreement. This suit is brought for the breach of that agreement, and to show such breach it appears to us that the record of proceedings in Iowa was competent evidence. Those proceedings showed that the effort to prosecute Hall to insolvency failed, because the judgment against him had been paid, as found by the district court in Iowa. The institution of the suit in Iowa was a proper step in the exercise of the diligence required to prosecute Hall to insolvency. But when the defense of payment was interposed, proper diligence required that notice should have been given to Woodward; and there having been a failure to give such notice, he can not be concluded by the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">We do not see that it can make any difference whether the suit on the judgment was prosecuted in the name of. Woodward for the use of the assignees of the judgment, or in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>name of the assignees. It was none the less the suit of the assignees, and conducted by them in compliance with their contract to prosecute Hall to insolvency before calling on Woodward. If they have been wanting in proper diligence in conducting the suit they can not escape the consequence by a resort to the technical form in which it was instituted. Eor the practical and substantial purposes of the contract it is the same as if the suit had been in their own names. Indeed, we do not doubt that, under the law of Iowa, Woodward, without their assent, would not have been allowed fo interfere with the conduct of the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The most that could be claimed for the effect, as evidence, of the record of the proceedings in Iowa, would be to make a <em>prima facie </em>case for the plaintiff in the action below. Had notice been given to Woodward of the pendency of the suit in Iowa and of the defense set up, it might have been his duty in that action to sustain the validity of the judgment he had assigned. Having received no such notice, he is not precluded from showing in the action against him that the judgment he assigned was a valid and subsisting judgment, and that had proper diligence been used in the conduct of the suit against Hall, his defense to that suit would not have been successful. In rejecting the evidence offered for that purpose by Woodward we think the district court erred, and for that error the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b170-7\">Sutlife, C.J., and Peck, Brinkerhoee and Scott, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
