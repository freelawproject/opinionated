Poster to loan him $500 for at least ten days, on a note for that sum and interest at the rate of ten per cent., the note to be payable on ten days\u2019 notice, and to be signed by Poster as principal, and the defendant, Brown, as surety.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-10\">Poster and-Hurlbut resided in Norwalk. Brown resided in Ridgefield.

Poster.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-14\">With the note in this form, Poster sent his son to Brown, in Ridgefield, where he resided, to procure his signature thereto. The messenger found Brown, and got his signature to the note immediately under Poster\u2019s, but having no pen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>and ink at hand, Brown wrote his signature in pencil, and handed it thus signed back to the messenger, saying: <em>\u201c </em>tell your father that when I come to Norwalk, I will ink over my signature with a pen, if desired to do so.\u201d The messenger carried the note, with Brown\u2019s message to Foster, and the latter immediately presented the note to Hurlbut, who objected to Brown\u2019s signature being in pencil; but Foster told Hurlbut of Brown\u2019s promise to ink o'ver his \u2018signature when he came to Norwalk, if desired to do so, and promised that Brown would do it. Hurlbut then told Foster that he wished the words \u201c interest to be paid annually,\u201d were in .the note, and requested Foster to insert them. Thereupon Foster wrote those words at the end of the note, before, and on the same line with his signature thereto, and, handing the note thus altered to Hurlbut, asked him if that was - satisfactory. Hurlbut replied that it wras, and put the note in his pocket, and let Foster have the money. Brown was not present, and knew nothing of the .alteration. Neither Hurlbut nor Foster intended any fraud upon Brown; and Hurlbut supposed the note to be valid. All this was on the 3d of November, 1857. Between this- time and the 1st of December, 1857, Hurlbut twice called on Foster and asked him if Brown had come to Norwalk yet, adding that he wished him to ink over his signature to the note. On or about the 1st of December, 1857, Hurlbut met Brown near Foster\u2019s store, in Norwalk, and asked him to \u201c ink over his signature to that note,\u201d assigning no other reason for the request than that Brown\u2019s signature, being in pencil, might wear off, but not then, nor at any other time, telling.Brown of the alteration of the note. Brown replied to Hurlbut that his signature was good as it was, but that he was willing to ink it over, and, taking the note from Hurlbut, he went to a desk, and then and there, with pen and ink, blacked over his pencil signature, in the presence of Foster, and then handed the note back to Hurl-but. When Brown thus inked over his signature, he had no knowledge or information of the alteration of the note, or of the conversation which had passed between Foster and Hurlbut at the time the alteration was made. He might, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>he had taken the care to do so, have read the note and discovered the alteration, but he did neither. He only noticed that the note was in Foster\u2019s handwriting, and -that the pencil signature was his own, and supposing the note to be then precisely as it was when he affixed his pencil signature thereto; and he had no knowledge or information to the contrary, until April, 1858, when the note had passed to the plaintiff. Brown was never anything more than a surety on the note. Hurlbut knew that when the note was first presented to him by Foster. There was no new consideration \u2022 for Brown\u2019s inking over his signature as he did. The only consideration for the note as signed by Brown with pencil, or as altered by Foster, at Hurlbut\u2019s request, was the five hundred dollars received by Foster of Hurlbut at the date of the note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-5\">Boalt, the-plaintiff in error, as assignee, became the holder and owner of the note previous to April 6,1858, and on that day gave notice to Foster and Brown to pay the note and interest to him at the expiration of ten days from that time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-6\">Payment not having been made, Boalt brought suit on the note, in the court of common pleas of Huron county, April 21, 1858, against Foster, Brown and Hurlbut.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-7\">At the October term, 1859, of the common pleas, after a motion for a new trial was overruled, judgment was entered in favor of Brown on the facts stated, as found in a special verdict, and shown by the record; and Boalt excepted, and to reverse that judgment, filed his petition in error in the district court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-8\">The judgment of the common pleas was affirmed in the district court, at its May term, 1860; and to reverse such judgment of affirmance, a petition in error was filed in this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b392-9\"><em>Charles B.

The alteration made in the note after Brown signed it in pencil, and before he inked his pencil signature over, by the insertion of the words \u201cinterest to be paid annually,\u201d was not a material alteration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b392-11\">The materiality of the alteration depends upon the construction to be given to the language of the note, \u201cfive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>hundred dollars, on ten days\u2019 notice, at ten per cent.\u201d \u201c At ten per cent,\u201d may as well mean ten per cent, payable annually, as ten per cent, when the principal sum is paid, or ten per cent, to accumulate. Either construction would stand consistently with the language of the note; and' no default would accrue upon the note, unless demanded, or notice were given.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b393-5\">The insertion of words in a bill which do riot affect the responsibility of the parties, will not vitiate it. <em>Marion </em>v. <em>Petit, </em>1 Camp. 82n; 1 Harrison\u2019s Dig. 1249.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b393-6\">II. If the alteration was material, it was made under such circumstances that the note, after delivery, was not void, as to Brown.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b393-7\">1st. The note in the hands of Foster, and the message sent with it, constituted Foster the agent of Brown, and the facts authorize the presumption of authority do make the alteration. And if not, Hurlbut, having acted in the belief, in good faith, that Foster had the authority, and in that belief having advanced his money upon the delivery of the note, will be protected. <em>Downes </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>5 B. &amp; A. 674; 1 D. &amp; R. 332; Bayl.

Treating the note in the hands of Foster as an unexecuted power, the subsequent delivery of it, with the alteration, was a good execution of the power, and the addition, so far as Brown is affected by it, may be rejected.

The addition of the Avords \u201c interest to- be paid annually \u201d to the note as originally drawn, Avas a material alteration, and, under the circumstances, rendered the note void as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>to Brown. <em>Sturges &amp; Hale </em>v. Williams, 9 Ohio St. Rep. 443.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b395-5\">Brown, being a surety merely, has a right to stand upon the very letter of his contract. There can be no construction or equity against him. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Williamson\u2019s adm\u2019r, </em>9 Ohio St. Rep. 17; <em>The State </em>v. <em>Medary et al., </em>17 Ohio Rep. 554; <em>Brickhead </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>5 Hill, 634; <em>McGovney </em>v. <em>The State, </em>20 Ohio Rep. 93.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b395-6\">The note was perfect wften Brown, having signed it in pencil, sent it back with the messenger to Foster. And there was nothing in the note, nor in the message he sent with it, to authorize any one, either expressly or by implication, to make the alteration in question. Hurlbut\u2019s mistaken belief in regard to Foster\u2019s authority over the note could not enlarge that authority or Brown\u2019s liability. Brown '..neither did nor said anything to lead Hurlbut into the mistake. The good or bad faith of Foster or Hurlbut, or both, could not increase their power over the note, or change Brown\u2019s contract, as expressed by it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b395-7\">2. Brown\u2019s inking over his signature after the alteration of the note did not make it valid. That act of Brown was no assent on his part to the alteration, under the circumstances; and the promise by Foster to Hurlbut that Brown would thus ink over his signature, has nothing to do with the question. Brown was not a party to that agreement, and did not act,.in pursuance of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b395-8\">To say that Brown, by inking over his signature, thereby assented to the alteration, when he was totally ignorant that it had been made, would seem to be preposterous. 1 Parsons on Contr. 506; <em>Howe </em>v. <em>Peabody, </em>2 Gray\u2019s Rep. 557; <em>Merrimae County Bank </em>v. Brown, 12 N. H. Rep. 320; <em>Fowler </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>13 N. H. Rep. 340.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b395-9\">3. The origin\u00e1l action was upon the note as altered, not as it was when Brown first signed it. That being the case, the plaintiff in error is not entitled to any \u201c equity powers\u201d of the court to enforce the note against Brown as though it had not been invalidated by the alteration. Foster and Hurlbut were liable upon one note, and Brown, if liable at all, upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>another and \u25a0' different note. The two cases could not be properly joined in one action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b396-5\">4. If Brown\u2019s inking over his signature were to be held equivalent to putting his name to the altered note, yet he did not thereby become a maker of the altered note, but only a guarantor without consideration, and was entitled to a verdict and judgment in the original action; for Brown did not ink over his signature in pursuance of an agreement or intention to become responsible on the altered note from its date and delivery. The intention is the subject of proof. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>9 Ohio Rep. 139; <em>Stage </em>v. <em>Olds, 12 </em>Ohio Rep. 158; <em>Champion </em>v. <em>Griffith, </em>13 Ohio Rep. 228; <em>Gale\u2019s adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Van Arman, </em>18 Ohio Rep. 336.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b396-6\">Scott, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Afp\">Do the facts of this case, as shown by the record, make a case of contract between Brown, the surety, and Hurlbut, the payee of the note ? Or, in other words, was there a valid signing and delivery of the note, in any form, by Brown ?</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">It is clear that the note, in the form in which it was signed by Brown, in pencil, was never delivered to the payee. He declined to accept it in this form; and, at his instance, the words \u201c interest to be paid annually\u201d were added to it, <em>before (delivery, </em>in the absence of Brown, and without his knowledge or assent. Foster had no express authority from Brown to modify the terms of the instrument, nor do the circumstances show an implied authority. For it is fiot the case of the filling up of a blank, with words necessary to give effect to the instrument, but of the addition of further terms to a perfect instrument. And this addition materially changed the rights and obligations of the parties; for it gave the payee the right to demand and collect interest annually, without any demand for the principal; while, without the clause thus added, interest could only have been collected with the principal, and neither without ten days\u2019 previous notice. The delivery of the note, in its altered form, by Foster, and its acceptance by Hurlbut, and his delivery to Foster of the money agreed to be loaned, perfected a contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>between the parties to the transaction. But Brojvn was no party to this contract. He had never assented to its terms. And Hurlbut <em>knew </em>that the alteration of the note had been made at his own instance, without Brown\u2019s knowledge, and without asking for his consent. The case, then, so far, stands thus: Brown had assented to, signed and authorized the delivery of <em>one </em>note; and Hurlbut, declining to accept <em>it, </em>did accept another, which he knew Brown had never assented to, had never signed, and had never seen. In all this there is evidently no contract; for the parties, Brown and Hurlbut, did not mutually assent to the same t\u2019erms. Brown\u2019s note was never delivered, and the note which was delivered was not Brown\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">But was the assent of Brown to the terms of the altered note, subsequently given, by the act of <em>\u201c inking over\u201d </em>his pencil signature ? It is certain that by this act, Brown did not <em>intend </em>to express any such assent\u2014for he was, at the time, wholly ignorant that any change had been made in its terms, since his signature had been affixed to it, in pencil. Neither Foster nor Hurlbut, though both were present, informed him of the alteration, which they had made without his knowledge. He was not asked by Hurlbut to <em>become </em>a party to a note, to which he was then a stranger, but to give <em>durability </em>to his pencil signature, <em>previously affixed,, </em>by tracing it over with ink ; and the reason assigned for the request was, that the signature, being in pencil, might wear off. This he had promised to do, when he first signed the instrument in pencil, and his intentions, in the fulfillment of his promise, could not have had any reference to other promises made by Foster of which he had no knowledge. Hurlbut asked him to perform merely what he had himself promised to do, without communicating to him the fact that Foster had promised that he should do more.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">It is claimed, however, that Brown must be held to have assented to the terms of the altered note, although, in fact, he intended no such assent, because, having opportunity to read the note, and discover the alteration, it was his own negligence that he did not do so, before blacking over his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>signature -with ink. Hurlbut had asked him <em>\u201c </em>to ink over his signature to <em>that note.\u201d </em>And Brown, upon taking the note to the desk for that purpose, saw that it was in Poster\u2019s handwriting, and that his own genuine pencil signature was affixed to it, and, without looking farther, he proceeded to the blackening of the signature. \"Was it his'duty to suspect that Hurlbut had altered its terms, or procured them to be altered, without his knowledge, after the note had been signed by him? Might he not assume that Hurlbut had not, either through gross ignorance, or disregard of his rights, permitted such an interference with them? And that the note which Hurlbut handed to him, and represented to be \u201c <em>that note,\u201d </em>was the <em>same </em>one which he had previously read and signed, and not <em>another ? </em>Hurlbut, at least, has no right to complain, that Brown confided in him as a man of ordinary intelligence, and common honesty. And the character of the instrument sued upon is such that Hurlbut\u2019s assignee simply stands in his shoes. It is clear that the terms of the altered note were never assented to by the surety, Brown; - nor is he shown to have said or done anything which would justify the payee,. Hurlbut, in presuming such assent. In the absence of such assent there is no contract between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">And this difficulty can not be obviated by the facts that the alteration was not made with <em>intent to </em>defraud Brown, and that Hurlbut when he accepted the note, with full knowledge of the facts, supposed, without reason, that it was good and valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Judgment of the district court affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b398-7\"><em>Svtlxev, </em>U.
