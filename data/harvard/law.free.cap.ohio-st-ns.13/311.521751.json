This reading, requiring the change of but one word, \u201cand\u201d to \u201cin,\u201d and the transposition of that and another word, is a much less liberty with the text of a statute than has frequently been taken by courts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-11\">Section 2 of the act of March 25, 1851, authorizes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>question of a township subscription to be voted on at a <em>special.election, </em>to be called, if the county commissioners <em>shall not </em>be authorized, by a vote at a special election provided for in the first section, to subscribe, etc. Here is the sole authority to hold a <em>special election </em>to vote on the question of a township subscription, and jt is made to depend upon a county subscription having been first voted down.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-5\">The election under which the relator claims was a special one, held August 30, 1851. Where did the township derive the authority to hold this <em>special </em>election? Not from the charter, for that required the vote to be taken at one of the <em>annual </em>elections prescribed by law; and not from the act of March 25, 1851, as above shown.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-6\">II. The foregoing defense is available against Hopple, the relator.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-7\">1. There is no statutory estoppel in the case. There is no statutory provision that the so-called bonds shall be <em>prima fade </em>even, much less conclusive evidence of anything. Indeed, there is no statute authorizing their issue to the company in payment for stock.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-8\">2. Upon general principles, Hopple was bound to take .notice of the <em>defect of power </em>aforesaid. The bonds were issued by the trustees of a township, and expressed upon their faces for what they were issued. And the defect of power was not owing to any omission of anything that the township or its trustees could perform; nor to any act of commission of theirs. Under these circumstances, the authorities are conclusive that, upon the general principles of the law, Hopple took the bonds subject to their infirmity aforesaid. Angell and Ames on Corp., 3d ed., 285, 286; <em>Concord Township </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>5 Ohio Rep. 182; <em>Treadwell </em>v. <em>Com. of Hancock County, </em>11 Ohio St. Rep. 191, 192; <em>Com.

Co., </em>Id. 443, 444, 445.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-9\">3. The trustees of the township were not constituted a tribunal to decide <em>conclusively </em>on the existence of the conditional fact that would authorize them to subscribe. No <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>statute confers any such, function upon them; and certainly they do not derive it from general principles. <em>Treadwell </em>v. <em>Com. of Hancock County, </em>11 Ohio St. Rep. 191; <em>Goshen Township </em>v. <em>Shoemaker et al., </em>12 Ohio St. Rep. 628.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-5\"><em>4. </em>But were the trustees clothed with power to decide conclusively as to the existence of the conditional fact, they never have so decided. They never have decided that Delaware county had not authorized a subscription; and so, in any view, we are not estopped to show the truth.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-6\">5. There is no estoppel <em>in pais </em>here, arising out of acquiescence, on the part of the township or its trustees. Eor:</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-7\">(1.) There has been no such acquiescence. To issue the bonds is all that has been done. Not a cent of principal or interest has been paid. Not a cent of taxes, for any such purpose, has been levied. No -demand for either has ever been made, except by the institution of this suit. Not a foot of the road has been made in the township.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-8\">(2.) There is no estoppel <em>in pais </em>where the infirmity of the bonds is a <em>defect of power to issue them. </em>Where there is an absence of power, the act is <em>void.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-9\"><em>\u201c </em>Where there is no legal power, an attempt to act can be followed by no legal consequence.\u201d' Nash\u2019s Dig. 679, sec. 7; <em>Ludloiw\u2019s Lessee </em>v. <em>McBride, </em>3 Ohio Rep. 240, 259.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-10\">Acquiescence of the principal may amount to a <em>ratification, </em>where the act is capable of ratification. It is not upon the doctrine of estoppel that he is bound; but, because he has <em>ratified </em>the act. But void things, in the language of Coke, are \u201c as no things.\u201d They are incapable of ratification.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-11\">6. Hopple is not a <em>bona fide </em>holder. ' When he took the bonds, a large amount of interest was overdue\u2014not a cent having been paid.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b348-12\"><em>James B,.

It is, therefore, urged that these public municipal corporations should be, to some extent, regarded as private moneyed corporations, and that the very act of issuing such paper, by the authorities of the township, authorized by legislation, under any circumstances, to make and issue the paper, should be held conclusive of the liability of the township upon the paper in the hand of a <em>bona fide </em>holder, for value.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">We have carefully considered these important suggestions, and the able argument of counsel in support of this view of the case. But we think the rules of law, well established by former adjudications upon similar questions, and held by our own and other courts as applicable to the facts here presented, forbids the adoption of the views thus urged as applicable to these securities.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">The validity of these securities, as contracts, must, then, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>necessarily depend upon the general principle governing all contracts. There must, in the first place, have been parties capable to contract, and also a lawful subject matter of contract, as well as an actual contract made in the case, in order to constitute a valid contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">It is not denied, in this case, that memorandums purporting to be the contract, are sufficient in form. Rut it is denied that there appears to have been parties capable of contracting in the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Whatever powers to contract are possessed by either of the parties to this contract, they being mere bodies politic and corporate, are necessarily conferred upon them by the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">The railroad company is evidently invested, by its charter and the several acts of the legislature referred to, with power to contract, in relation to the receiving of subscriptions and bonds, for the construction of its road\u2014-the object for which these bonds appear to have been executed to them. It remains, therefore, only to ascertain, upon this point, whether the township trustees had the power to issue said bonds, on their part. If they had, they, too, were a party capable of contracting, or making the contracts under consideration; but, if otherwise, then it must follow that there are not parties to these contracts capable of contracting.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">The township, although denominated by the statute a body politic and corporate, is not invested with the general powers of a corporation. This class of aggregate persons, incorporated for mere municipal purposes, are often denominated <em>quasi </em>corporations, and are invested, by the statutes creating them, with limited powers only, co-extensive with the duties imposed upon them. The same is true of the trustees, and other officers through whom they act. They, in like manner, only possess the powers expressly conferred upon them, as such body and officers respectively, by the statute, and, perhaps, where the statute is silent upon the subject, the authority, by necessary implication, which is requisite to execute the duties so imposed upon them. In the exercise of their powers, as trustees of the township, the trustees can take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>nothing by implication, therefore, beyond the authority thus conferred by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The liberality extended to the proceedings of those inferior jurisdictions, in the exercise of their powers, as respects regularity and form, does not extend to their powers to, in any respect,, enlarge the same. It follows, therefore, that the trustees, by virtue of their powers as tAustees, were not, by virtue of the statute organizing townships, and authorizing the election of trustees, and conferring their powers and prescribing their duties, authorized to malte the contracts in question. But their powers, if possessed for 'that purpose, must have been conferred by some other act or acts of the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">It only remains, therefore, in determining this question of power, to ascertain ^whether the legislature has, by any other act of legislation, conferred the power upon the trustees, or made it their duty, to make the subscription dr undertaking to this railroad company.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">The only acts of the legislature relating at all to the subject, are those set forth in the statement of the case. Do those statutes, either of them or when taken together, confer the power ?</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">Upon recurring to the provisions of the several acts, it appears, in the first place, that the legislature, by the act of February 28, 1846, required the commissioners of any county in this state, whenever thereafter authorized to subscribe to the capital stock of any railroad, etc., to give at least twenty days\u2019 notice, in one or more newspapers, etc., to the qualified voters of said county to vote, at the next annual election, to be held in the several townships, and wards, if any there should be, in said county, for or against the subscription; and to subscribe or forbear to subscribe according to the result of such vote being in favor of or opposed to the contemplated subscription.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">And by the act of March 21,1850, incorporating the Springfield and Mansfield Railroad Company, the county commissioners of any county through which the road should be located, were authorized to subscribe any sum not exceeding <em>fifty thou</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number><em>sand dollars. </em>And the next section provides, that if the commissioners shall not be authorized by the vote of the county to subscribe stock, etc., <em>the trustees of any township </em>through which the road may be located, shall be authorized \u201c to subscribe any sum not exceeding fifty thousand dollars, to the capital stock, and provide for the payment of said stock, in the same manner that the county commissioners aforesaid are authorized: provided that the <em>total amount </em>which may be subscribed to the capital stock of said company by any county, and the townships therein, on the line of said road, shall not exceed <em>one hundred thousand </em>dollars.\u201d And the next section provides that no subscription shall be made by either the commissioners or trustees until a vote of the qualified voters shall have been declared in favor of the subscription in the manner provided by the act of February 28, 1846. And that act, as we have seen, requires the vote to be taken upon \u25a0 the notice therein prescribed, \u201cat the next annual election to be held in the several townships * * * in said county.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The charter of the company, therefore, only authorized the trustees to subscribe \u201c any sum of money not exceeding fifty thousand dollars,\u201d upon the condition that \u201c the county commissioners * * * shall not be authorized by the vote of the county to subscribe.\u201d This is clearly the extent of the power, by the language of the act, conferred upon the trustees. And there could be no question of any further - power by implication, were it not for theproviso at the end of the section, and immediately following the express grant of power.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">That the proviso was intended to, and does, in fact, restrict the power otherwise conferred, is evident. For in case the county vote should be adverse to a county subscription, in that event each township through which the road should pass, would be authorized, but for the proviso, to subscribe fifty thousand dollars. And in order to restrict the proviso to this sole purpose, and thereby remove all appearance of intention to enlarge the powers of the trustees inconsistent with the previous express grant of their powers, it has been urged that a slight change of words should be made in the reading. It is suggested that, by a liberal rule of interpretation, it might be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>thus read: \u201c that the total amount that may be subscribed <em>in </em>any county <em>by </em>the townships therein on the line of said road shall not exceed $100,000.\u201d The proposed change in the two words indicated, is, it is true, only a slight change, and may quite probably thereby -make the sentence conform to the intent of the legislature. It might, however, be very* properly objected to the proposed change in the reading, that it is forbidden by the maxim, \u201c <em>a verbis leg\u00eds non est reeeden</em>dumAnd it may well be doubted, whether the proposed change of the words is admissible as an exception to the very general and important rule, that statutes are to be read according to the natural import of their language.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">But even if <em>the </em>proviso <em>be </em>so read as to give full effect to the words used, there are no words in the proviso removing the express limitation of the powers of the trustees, to the failure of the commissioners being authorized to subscribe\u00bb And, as we have seen, the next section of the charter prohibits both the commissioners and trustees from subscribing until after the vote of the qualified voters at the <em>annual election </em>has been declared in favor of such subscription. And, inasmuch as no vote, taken at any <em>annual </em>election, has ever been declared in favor of sueh subscription, it is therefore impossible that by any construction of the proviso, power could have been derived by the trustees of the township under the charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">It is, therefore, to the aet of March 25,1851, entitled \u201c an act t\u00a9 authorize <em>special </em>elections,\u201d that we are to look for the powers claimed by the trustees, to have been derived by a <em>special </em>election held according to the provisions of that aet.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">But under this aet of T851, it will he perceived that while the county commissioners are authorized without any restrictions to submit the question of subscription, upon due notice, to the qualified voters at a <em>special </em>election, the question of subscription by township trustees is <em>only </em>allowed tobe submitted to the people of the township at a <em>special </em>election, in <em>ease the county commissioners </em>of the county <em>shall not be authorized </em>by vote to subscribe. It therefore follows, that inasmuch .as ih.e co.unty commissioners of Delaware county, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>in this case, <em>were authorised by </em>the voters of the county t\u00a9 subscribe, and did subscribe, to the capital stock of the road, the township trustees were not authorized or empowered by the provisions of the act to submit the question to the people at a <em>special </em>election; since it is so provided, <em>only </em>in the case-where the county commissioners had <em>not </em>been so authorized by the voters.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">It appears, therefore, that the <em>special </em>elections so held by the people of Brown township, both on the 17th of July, and on the 80th of August, 1851, were neither\u2019of them authorized by any existing statute; and the township, trustees consequently were not empowered by any statute to subscribe to the capital stock of said company, and provide for the payment of the subscription. The issuing of said bonds by the trustees was therefore without any statutory authority or power on their part as such trustees. For it is a well-established'principle, that where a power is claimed under a statute affecting a community, and requiring as a condition t\u00a9 the validity of the statute, that something should be done, or some.event happen before it goes into operation, the statute has, in such case, no force or effect until the event has happened, or the thing so required to he done is performed. This is unlike a case where the statute affects only one or more persons designated by the act, in which case it is true the person or persons interested in the object may dispense with the preliminary condition, and claim the benefit of the statute, without requiring the performance of such condition in their favor. <em>Savage and Harrington </em>v. <em>Walshe and Eman</em>uel, 26 Ala. 619.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">It is, however, insisted on the part of the relator, that even \u201cif the trustees had <em>no&lt; powers </em>present this question with the alleged condition, yet the voters having decided <em>for </em>subscription, the authority in the trustees would thereby become absolute, and the condition void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">If the authority of the trustees rested uponth\u00a9 ground of .agency merely, and all the parties now interested as taxpayers had voted in favor of the subscription, the argument, would be of some weight. But in. the present case- it is, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>pretended that more than a bare majority of the voters at the last election, voted in favor of the trustees subscribing stock on their behalf; while all the remainder of the voters of the township voted their refusal to suffer said trustees to subscribe. If, therefore, it could be shown that the same voters then acting, and no others, are now the taxpayers of said township, this would by no means be a case in which the taxpayers of Brown township would be, either in law or equity, bound, as having executed the contracts or bonds in question by their agents. And this conclusion must neces-' sarily result from the fact that no one citizen, nor any number of citizens of a township, is authorized, either by statute .or by the circumstance of their living in the same township or neighborhood, to obligate another citizen of, the same township, or to subject his property to the payment of a contract which he has neither made nor consented to.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">We are referred, however, to the case of <em>Garrett et al. </em>v. <em>Van Horne, </em>7 Ohio St. Rep. 332, as maintaining a-contrary doctrine. We do not recognize that case as necessarily opposed to the views above expressed. The facts of that case were briefly as follows: Under the act of March 12, 1849, and January 16,1851, authorizing the trustees of Jefferson township to subscribe for the stock of the Steubenville and Indiana Railroad Company, an election was duly held (August, 1851), and a certificate of the election, in favor of subscription, duly filed in March, 1852, recorded in the recorder\u2019s office, and subscription made, and bonds issued by the trustees in April, 1852, and the amount of interest upon the bonds for 1856, was assessed, and paid into the treasury of the county; and the auditor refused to give an order to the holders of the bonds for the same, inasmuch as the town authorities insisted that the bonds were void for the reason that the road was not in fact located and constructed through the township until after the 1st of April, 1852. The authority conferred in that case by the statute is thus expressed: \u201c The mayor and town council of the town of Steubenville, and all other incorporated towns through or near which said road may be located, * * * are each respectively hereby authorized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>to subscribe to the capital stock of said company,\u201d etc. It thus appears that the authority to the town of Steubenville was conferred (upon vote, as expressed in the next section) to subscribe irrespective of the location of the road. ' Nor does the act require that other incorporated towns, \u201cthrough or near which the said road may be located,\u201d should withhold either their vote or subscription until after the location of the road. The power was therefore fully conferred by the statute. And its early exercise before the actual location,'could only, after the location of the road, be objected to as an impropriety in time, or at most as a mere irregularity on the part of the town authorities, even if the location of the road \u201cthrough or near\u201d the town, related to Steubenville as well-as to other towns. There was not, therefore, in that case, any want of power in the town authorities, at the time of their so subscribing to the stock and issuing the bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">In delivering the opinion in that case, Judge Swan, it is true, makes use of the following language: \u201c When public officers exceed the powers vested in them by general laws, their acts are no longer official, but void; and this principle would be applicable to the ease -before us, if the trustees had derived their sole authority to make the contract under consideration from the law, without any interposition, sanction or authority from the taxpayers of the township. But in the case before us, the trustees derived their authority to subscribe for the stock of the railroad, and to issue the bonds, specifically from the taxpayers of the township,\u201d etc. The language thus used, it will be perceived from a statement of the c\u00e1se, may be regarded rather as a dicium, than as at all necessary to support the decision made upon the facts of that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">It is certainly impossible to regard the issuing of the contracts or bonds, in this case, as a transaction either made or authorized by the present taxpayers of the township with the railroad company. For, as we have seen, in order to arrive at such a conclusion, it is necessary to show, not only that the present taxpayers are the same taxpayers, and no others, who resided in the township at the time of issuing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>the bonds, but also that those who voted against the subscription thereby authorized or empowered the trustees to impose upon them the obligations expressed by the bonds. Indeed, the bonds do not profess to impose any obligation upon natural persons, but merely upon the township in its corporate capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Again, it is said that the bonds in this case are at least issued under the color of authority; and that third persons, and the public, in the absence of notice, have a right to presume a compliance with the conditions on the part of the trustees, and that the bonds were legally issued by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">If the defect in the bonds were a mere irregularity in the issuing of them, or if the\"bonds were those of a private corporation, there would be much force-in the argument; but it certainly does not reach the objection, that the trustees in this case had no power to make a contract obligatory upon the township, a mere municipal corporation, at the time they made and delivered the bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">It is also apparent that all persons receiving these bonds or securities were notified by the recitals upon their face, that their validity depended upon the statutory provisions and requisitions under which they were issued having been complied with, so far at least as to authorize their issue. And tne trustees were not, either by statute or by virtue of their office, constituted a tribunal, or authorized, to decide upon their own authority to issue the bonds, as against the township upon which' the obligation was to be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">Nor can it be said that there has been any such acquiescence or conduct on the part of the taxpayers of the township in this case, even if it were conceded that could in such a case constitute an answer to the want of power to issue the bonds, which distinguishes this ease from that of <em>Treadwell </em>v. <em>Commissioners of Hancock </em>County, 11 Ohio St. Rep. 191. And we are satisfied with the correctness of the principles of law as expressed in that case, and again in the case of <em>Goshen Township </em>v. Shoemaker, etc., 12 Ohio St. Rep. 624.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">In accordance with the foregoing views in regard to the facts of this case, and the principles of law applicable thereto, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>the motion of the relator must be dismissed, and judgment ent\u00a7red in favor of the defendants..</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b358-6\">Peck, Gholson, Brinkerhoee and Scott, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
