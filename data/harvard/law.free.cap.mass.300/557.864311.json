Both corporations intended to comply with the statute respecting sales in bulk, G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 106, \u00a7 1, but they failed to comply with the requirement that they \u201cmake a full, detailed inventory, showing the quantity and, so far as possible with the exercise of reasonable diligence, th\u00e9 cost price to the seller of each article to be included in the sale,\u201d or the requirement that the written list of names and addresses of the creditors of the seller be certified by the seller on oath to be \u201ca full, accurate and complete list.\u201d Either of these failures had the legal result of making the sale \u201cfraudulent and void as against the creditors of the seller.\u201d For the meaning of these words, see <em>Kelly-Buckley Co. </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>195 Mass. 585, 588, 589; <em>Rabalsky </em>v. <em>Levenson, </em>221 Mass. 289, 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-11\">On November 17, 1937, the plaintiff, a creditor of Locke Stevens &amp; Sanitas, Inc., brought this bill to establish its claim and to apply the stock of merchandise thereto. The final decree merely established the debt, ordered execution against Locke Stevens &amp; Sanitas, Inc., and declared the sale void as to the plaintiff. The plaintiff and the defendants appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-12\">There is nothing in the appeal of the defendants. Even though the plaintiff received notice of the proposed sale, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>it was not bound to take action within the five days mentioned in the statute. It did act'' with reasonable despatc<em>h. Kelly-Buckley Co. </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>195 Mass. 585, 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-3\">The decree, in declaring the sale void as to the plaintiff, did not give the plaintiff adequate relief. The plaintiff was entitled to the same remedies \u201cas those of other creditors in case of a sale in fraud of creditors.\u201d <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Collaro, </em>265 Mass. 10, 12. One remedy of a creditor in case of a fraudulent conveyance is to \u201chave the conveyance set aside ... to the extent necessary to satisfy his claim.\u201d G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 109A, \u00a7 9 (a). See <em>Service Mortgage Corp. </em>v. <em>Welson, </em>293 Mass. 410, 413. This implies an actual application of the property fraudulently conveyed to the satisfaction of the debt. <em>Dondis </em>v. <em>Lash, </em>277 Mass. 477, 487. By G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 214, \u00a7 3 (9), jurisdiction in equity is given of \u201csuits to reach and apply in payment of a debt any property, right, title or interest, real or personal, of a debtor, liable to be attached or taken on execution in an action at law against him and fraudulently conveyed by him with intent to defeat, delay or defraud his creditors.\u201d The plaintiff is entitled to have the decree provide effective machinery to apply the stock of merchandise, or its value if it is no longer existent or available, to the satisfaction of its claim. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Martin-Wilson Automatic Fire Alarm Co. </em>151 Mass. 515. <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>180 Mass. 543. <em>Rioux </em>v. <em>Cronin, </em>222 Mass. 131. <em>Martell v. Dorey, </em>235 Mass. 35. <em>Mascari </em>v. <em>Mascari, </em>255 Mass. 92, 96. <em>Beacon Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Maniatis, </em>284 Mass. 574, 577. The final decree is reversed, and a new final decree is to be entered, giving to the plaintiff additional relief by providing such machinery.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">\n<em>Ordered accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
