The order was made and signed by the judge in the following form: \u201cNov. 9, 1937. Demurrer sustained and Bill ordered dismissed without costs and without prejudice to plaintiff bringing an action at law.\u201d The docket entry of the same date sets out the order in full. On November 12, 1937, the plaintiff appealed \u201cfrom the order sustaining the Defendant\u2019s Demurrer.\u201d An examination of the docket entries discloses that no final decree has been entered dismissing the bill as ordered in the interlocutory order and that the only appeal is that of the plaintiff which appears in the record from the \u201corder\u201d of the judge sustaining the demurrer and directing that the bill be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">It is settled that suits in equity can be brought before this court as of right only by appeal from a final decree, see <em>Knox </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>273 Mass. 109, 110, and cases cited; <em>Check </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>280 Mass. 170, 175, and that \u201cThe only way in which an appeal from an interlocutory decree can be brought to this court before final decree is by report of the judge entering the decree. G. L. c. 214, \u00a7\u00a7 26, 30.\u201d <em>Knox </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>273 Mass. 109, 110. See also <em>Check </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>280 Mass. 170, 175; <em>Geragosian </em>v. <em>Union Realty Co. </em>289 Mass. 104, 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">The interlocutory decree \u201cDemurrer sustained and Bill ordered dismissed . . .\u201d and its entry in full form on the docket constitute not a final decree, see <em>Merrill </em>v. <em>Beckwith, </em>168 Mass. 72, 75, 76; <em>Tyndale </em>v. <em>Stanwood, </em>187 Mass. 531, 532; <em>Crossman </em>v. <em>Griggs, </em>188 Mass. 156, but rather an order for final decree from which no appeal lies. See <em>Graustein </em>v. <em>Dolan, </em>282 Mass. 579, 583; <em>Fusaro </em>v. <em>Murray, ante, </em>229, and cases cited. In the case at bar, as no final decree has been entered, and the judge has not reported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>his action in sustaining the demurrer (G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 214, \u00a7\u00a7 26, 30), the plaintiff\u2019s appeal is not properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
