The other creditors of the maker are no way affected by such an agreement, nor does it contravene any policy of the Bankrupt Act.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b38-6\">Before Monell, Jones, and Fithian, JJ.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b38-7\"><em>[Decided February </em>12, 1869.]</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-8\">This action was on two promissory notes made by defendant Farrar, payable to the order of, and endorsed by, defendant Bloodgood. The defense was, that the defendant Farrar being insolvent, and indebted to the firm of Repplier <em>&amp; </em>Brother in $19,000, and the firm of John Street <em>&amp; </em>Co. in $4,000 or $5,000, and other creditors in various amounts, the firm of Repplier &amp; Brother institut\u00e9d proceedings against Farm*, under the provisions of the United States Bankrupt Law in relation to <em>\u201c </em>involuntary bankruptcy.\u201d After such proceedings an arrangement was made by and between Farrar and Repplier <em>&amp; </em>Brother, by which it was agreed Farrar should, and he did, execute and deliver the two notes in suit\u2014one to Repplier <em>&amp; </em>Brother, and one to Street &amp; Co.\u2014to apply on his indebtedness to those firms; and in consideration thereof, Repplier &amp; Brother agreed to, and did, withdraw their proceedings against Farrar, and agreed to assist him in \u201c every way.\u201d The defendant claimed that the consideration of the notes was illegal, and the notes void\u2014the transaction being contrary to the \u201c policy,\u201d if not the letter, of the Bankrupt Act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-9\">This action was tried before Mr. Justice Jones and a jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-10\">Under the direction of the Court, the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b39-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number><em>Mr. E. L. Fancher </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A9\">The termination of the bankruptcy proceedings delayed the coming of the estate to the creditors, as it compelled new bankruptcy proceedings to be initiated. Such delay is contrary to the letter and spirit of the Bankrupt Law, besides being a fraud on the other creditors, and an agreement to that effect is void (secs. 35, 29; Davis <em>v. </em>Holding, 1 M. <em>&amp; </em>W., 159).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-6\">It is of no moment how Repplier effected this, whether by his own withdrawal at a time when the creditors were ignorant of his intention to desist, or by his inducing their desistance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-7\">The <em>thing agreed </em>to be done, <em>i. e., </em>the absolute termination of the bankruptcy proceedings, was consummated, and the creditor\u2019s remedy injured thereby (Bell <em>v. </em>Leggett, 7 N. Y., 182; Sharp <em>v. </em>Teese, 4 Halst., 355).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-8\">The promises \u201c to withdraw the bankruptcy proceedings,\u201d and <em>\u201c </em>to assist Farrar in every way possible,\u201d meant to forbear opposing Farrar\u2019s discharge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-9\">If the withdrawal was illusory, this forbearance to oppose a discharge was the only real aid to Farrar in the agreement, and was clearly illegal (Nerot <em>v. </em>Waller, 3 T. R., 17; Holland <em>v. </em>Plummer, 1 Bos. &amp; Pull., 95; 7 N. Y., 131; 4 Halst. [N. J.] 354).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-10\">It is contrary to the policy of the Bankrupt Act for a petitioning creditor to extort from a bankrupt or his friends new security by <em>illusory or illegal promises </em>of this kind.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-11\">It is putting the bankrupt under a temptation to prefer one creditoi as to so much (U. S. Bankrupt Act, sec. 35; Avery <em>&amp; </em>Hobbs, p. 251; ibid., 209, sec. 29; Bello <em>v. </em>Leggett, 7 N. Y., 181).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-12\">It contravenes the policy of the law (Davis <em>v. </em>Holding, 1 M. &amp; W., 159; 3 T. R., 17; 1 Bos. <em>&amp; </em>Pull., 95; Bell <em>v. </em>Leggett, 7 N. Y., 176).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-13\">The policy of our insolvent laws is, that a <em>full </em>and <em>fair disclosure </em>and <em>surrender </em>of the property of the debtor shall be obtained; and on such disclosure and surrender, he shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>without further impediment, liberated from confinement; and all the creditors shall be placed on an equal footing without preference (4 Halst. [N. J.] 354; Phelps <em>v. </em>Thomas, 6 Gray, 327; Coates <em>v. </em>Blush, 1 Cush., 564; Barnard <em>v. </em>Crosby, 6 Allen, 327).</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b40-5\"><em>Mr. John E. Parsons </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-6\">So far as concerned the John Street &amp; Co. note of $315.70, the facts do not permit defendant\u2019s argument. They had taken no bankruptcy proceedings and made no promise to withdraw.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-7\">It is security given to a creditor to induce him \u201c to forbear opposing the application for discharge of the bankrupt,\u201d which the act makes void. The principle is one well recognized. The debtor\u2019s proceeding for a discharge is by him as against all his creditors. Any advantage to one creditor, in view of which he withdraws opposition, operates as a fraud upon the others, who by his -withdrawal are influenced to adopt the same course in ignorance of the secret motive influencing his action, and are thus cheated (Bankruptcy Act, sec. 35).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-8\">The case does not come within the provisions of the act. It does not offend its policy; though it would be immaterial if it did. An involuntary proceeding is between the petitioning creditor and the debtor. No one is defrauded by its withdrawal. The act neither prevents nor avoids security given by a third person in consideration of it (Bell <em>v. </em>Leggett, 2 Sandf. S. C. R., 450, 457).</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b40-9\">\n<em>By the Court.:</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"b40-10\">Fithian, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ax\">I do not see any thing in the facts in this case contravening any of the express provisions or the policy of the Bankrupt Act. ' Section 25 of the act declares void all securities or contracts made or given in order to induce any creditor to \u201cforbear opposing the <em>application for discharge of the bank</em>rupt.\u201d But in this <em>\u201c </em>involuntary \u201d proceeding, taken.by a creditor <em>against </em>the bankrupt, there is not, nor can there be, any \u201c <em>application </em>for discharge of the bankrupt,\u201d The statute provides no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>method or means whereby a bankrupt can apply for a discharge in a proceeding <em>hostile </em>to him, instituted by a creditor. In this respect, as well as others, the United States law differs from the English bankrupt statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Ueither am I able to see wherein the agreement, alleged and proved as one consideration of the notes in suit, is in conflict with any policy of the law. The policy and general intent of the bankrupt act is, that the bankrupt\u2019s estate, and the <em>whole therreofi </em>without concealment or diminution, shall be honestly, and as speedily as possible, <em>equally </em>divided among <em>all </em>of his <em>bona fide </em>creditors. And there are various provisions of the statute forbidding and declaring void certain specified acts and things having a tendency to defeat such general intent and policy. But I do not think the agreement here tends, in any manner, to do that. If the defendant Farrar had paid these two creditors the amount of the notes in suit, in money of his own, or given a collateral security out of his estate, or had indemnified, out of his estate, Bloodgood, the endorser, it might have presented an entirely different question (although, as to that, I give no opinion). But there is nothing of the kind appearing here.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">It is well settled that payment in full to a creditor of a bankrupt by a third person, as a friendly act, is not illegal preference, as between the creditor so paid and the other creditors, because it no way affects the other creditors. The fund to which they looked for payment was in no way diminished by it (Winson <em>v. </em>Kendall, 3 Story, 507; Fox <em>v. </em>Paine, 10 Alabama R., 523). And so, where <em>all </em>the creditors of the bankrupt, but <em>one, </em>had agreed to take a certain sum each in discharge, and the bankrupt afterward paid the <em>one </em>a greater sum, it was held not illegal (25 L. and E. Rep., 476).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">So, here, the defendant Farrar merely gives an additional promise to pay part of his indebtedness. A judgment obtained against him in favor of plaintiff in no way affects his other creditors. It operates only as a transfer of part of his indebtedness from the original creditor to the plaintiff in this action. And in respect to the defendant Bloodgood, his endorsement was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>voluntary, and for the accommodation of the debtor, and without any consideration flowing from the <em>debtor </em>to him. It will be time enough for him to look to the interests of the other creditors, and they to raise the objection, when Bloodgood shall (if he ever does) attempt to claim against the bankrupt for endorsing.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">The authorities cited by defendant\u2019s counsel from the English cases are not, in my opinion, applicable. They arose out of particular provisions of the English Bankrupt Act, and establish no general principle applicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">.1udgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
