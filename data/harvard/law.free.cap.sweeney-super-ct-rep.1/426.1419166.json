The action was brought against the defendant Sears, and also Frederick Judson, and John Doe and Richard Roe (names unknown). The complaint alleged that the defendants were co-partners in trade, doing business under the name and style of <em>\u201c </em>The Judson Horseshoe Company and that on or about the first day of November,.one thousand eight hundred and sixty-six, the plaintiff, by an indenture made between it and the defendants, demised and leased to the defendants certain premises therein mentioned, at the yearly rent or sum of thirteen hundred and fifty dollars, from said first day of November Until the first day of January thereafter, and from the said first day of January until the first day of January, one thousand eight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>hundred and sixty-eight, at the yearly rent or sum of fifteen hundred dollars, payable monthly in advance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-4\">Complaint also alleged default in the payment of the rent to the amount of $733.13, and prayed judgment for that amount. The defendant Sears alone answered, by a general denial of all the allegations in the complaint. On the trial the plaintiff proved the execution and delivery of the lease and premises in the complaint referred to by plaintiff, in its corporate name, signed by \u201c J. H. Crane, President,\u201d to \u201c The Judson Horseshoe Company,\u201d lessee, executed on the part of the latter by \u201c F. Judson, President,\u201d demising certain premises on the First avenue, in the City of New York, from November, 1866, to the first of January, 1868, at a stipulated rent; and that the amount of rent claimed by the plaintiff was in arrears and unpaid. It was proved that the defendant Judson alone negotiated with plaintiff for the lease, and on its execution and delivery Judson entered into possession of the demised premises, and used them for the exhibition and selling of patent rights or interests in a patent \u201c calk \u201d for horseshoes; that he, Judson, had upon the premises a blacksmith\u2019s forge and tools for making these patent <em>\u201c </em>calks,\u201d and putting them upon horseshoes for purposes of exhibition ; that a horse was kept travelling through the city with a sign of <em>horseshoes </em>on each side; and that there was a sign on the premises with the words <em>\u201c </em>The Judson Horseshoe Patent \u201d thereon, and facsimiles of horseshoes and calks.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-5\">To establish the alleged partnership between the defendants Judson and <em>Sears, </em>so as to charge the latter as a partner, the <em>plaintiff </em>then caused to be produced and read in evidence a written agreement between the defendants Judson &amp; Sears, in the words and figures following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-6\">\u201c This agreement, made at the City of New York, this twenty-second day of June, 1866, between Frederick Judson, of Jersey City, in the State of New Jersey, and Herman B.

For, however that may be, if I am right in my construction of the agreement, the defendant <em>Sears </em>is to bear no losses or expenses on account of the business, other or in addition to the four thousand dollars which he put at the risk of the business; while all other loss, if any, is to be borne by the defendant <em>Judson. </em>It is clearly competent for partners even, as between themselves, to enter into any stipulations they please as to how and in whose name the business shall be conducted, and what shall be the proportion of loss or profit to be borne or received by either respectively; and the courts will uphold and enforce such agreements as against the parties thereto, and all other persons dealing with either partner, with <em>full knowledge </em>of all the facts in respect to the rights and responsibilities of others with whom he does <em>not </em>deal.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">The plaintiff cannot, therefore, rely upon this contract alone to charge Sears; because, if he use it at all, he must take it as a <em>whole. </em>He cannot avail himself of such provisions in the agreement as, standing by themselves, would tend to establish a partnership between Sears and Judson, for the purpose of charging Sears, while he rejects other clauses that <em>discharge </em>him. The agreement is evidence as well for Sears as against him, and by it he is exempt from liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The only remaining question is whether Sears has in any manner held himself out to plaintiff, or other persons, or knowingly permitted Judson, so to hold him out as an ostensible partner in this business <em>% </em>I do not find any evidence in the case of any such fact. The agreement, and the lease itself, were made (on the part of the lessee) by Judson alone. By no agreement, verbal or written, not even by tacit consent, did the defendant Sears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>\"ever authorize Judson to use the name of the <em>\u201c </em>Horseshoe Co.,\u201d or connect him (Seal\u2019s) with any such company, or <em>any </em>company. Judson was \u201cto transact <em>all </em>business\u201d and make all grants in his <em>own name </em>; and defendant Sears swears positively (and there is no evidence to the contrary) that he never was consulted about the making the lease; and \u201c never heard or dreamed of any company,\u201d until demand made on him for rent. This is not like a case of a <em>\u201c </em>dormant \u201d or secret partner, having an interest in the capital and profits of a business authorized to be carried on by his co-partners in a certain <em>firm name. </em>For in such case the firm name would be <em>his </em>name. Here there was no firm or company whatever created or authorized to exist. In no way, directly or indirectly, either as principal or by any authorized agent, was there any privity of contract, between plaintiff and tiie defendant Sears.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
