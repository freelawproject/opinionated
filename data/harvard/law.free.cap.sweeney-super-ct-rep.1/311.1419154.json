Afterward, Falkner sold the property and business and interest in the lease to one Van Buren. Subsequently to that (but when did not appear), the plaintiff Peck bought Van Buren\u2019s goods and business, including the property in question, which was then in the store, and thereupon took the other plaintiff in as a partner, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>continued the business or some business. Whether these plaintiffs became assignees of the lease to Falkner did not <em>appear; </em>but they were in possession under it, either as assignees or sub-lessees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b316-5\">It further appeared that on and before the 17th of February, 1869, there was rent in arrear and unpaid, due to Knox on the lease to Falkner, of about the sum of <em>$687; </em>and that defendant Knox had commenced \u201c summary proceedings \u201d under the statute to eject the tenants (plaintiffs), for non-payment of the rent. On the 17th of February, the rent not having been paid, and judgment and process of dispossession having been rendered and issued in the proceedings above stated, an officer of the court, by virtue of such process, removed the plaintiffs from the premises, and all their goods and property, except the property in question in this action, which being fixed or fastened to the freehold, the officer could not or did not remove it. The plaintiffs gave evidence tending to show that they desired and attempted to remove these fixtures themselves, but were prevented from so doing by the officer. It did not, however, appear that the defendant Knox had any thing to do with this prevention by the officer. The officer, having thus removed the plaintiffs and their goods, late in the afternoon of the 17th of February delivered the keys and possession of the store to defendant\u2019s clerk. It further appeared, that thereupon, on the same day, the keys of the store were_delivered to one William S. Burke, and that on the morning of the 18th of February Knox executed and delivered to Burke a lease of the premises for a year and more for a certain rent. And that in consideration of obtaining the lease, Burke then and there paid to Knox $687.50, being the amount of back rent owing by the outgoing tenants. And Knox thereupon transferred to Burke his claim against such outgoing tenants for such - back rent, together with whatever interest Knox might have (if any) in^the fixtures remaining in the store\u2014Burke immediately entering into possession of the store. Subsequently, on the same day, plaintiffs demanded of Knox the keys, and permission to' enter the premises and remove the property in controversy, which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>refused. Plaintiffs then demanded the delivery of the property of Knox, with like refusal on his part, he alleging, as plaintiffs say, that he would have nothing to do with them; and, as he swears, because he had not the possession and could not deliver the property. The plaintiffs also gave evidence tending to show that, pending the summary proceedings to remove plaintiffs, the defendant Knox entered into a verbal agreement with the plaintiff Peck to the effect that, after Knox had obtained possession by virtue of the proceedings, he would execute a new lease to Peck, which he afterward refused to do. This was denied, however, by the defendant Knox. The Court dismissed the complaint, on the ground that there was no proof of wrongful taking or detention of the property. Plaintiffs excepted to the decision, and the exceptions were ordered to be heard in the first instance at the General Term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b317-5\"><em>Mr. E.

The only possession of the property defendant is shown to have had is the constructive possession of the premises in which the \"property was on the night and morning of February 17 and 18. This possession was certainly not wrongful. It was delivered to him by the judgment and process of a court of competent jurisdiction. The premises belonged to the defendant. He came rightfully and legally into the possession of them on the night of the 17th of February. The plaintiffs\u2019 property (if any they had) was fixed to defendant\u2019s freehold. And if it was necessary, in receiving lawful and rightful possession of his own property, to receive, also, possession of plaintiffs\u2019 property, such talcing cannot be said to be wrongful.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">Heither was the leasing of defendant\u2019s premises, and the delivering possession thereof, including plaintiffs\u2019 fixtures, to Burke, on the 18th of February, such a disposition of the property as in law amounts to a wrongful conversion of the same, or an interference therewith, to the owner\u2019s exclusion. It was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>the defendant\u2019s fault that plaintiffs had omitted to remove their fixtures until after the lease under which they were holding was terminated by judgment of dispossession for non-payment of rent. The defendant had a perfect right to lease his premises, or make any other disposition of them he chose. He is not to be barred of that right, or charged with a wrongful conversion, because, in the exercise of it, by delivering possession of his own property to another, it became necessary to deliver, also, possession of a third person\u2019s property, stored on the premises. By so doing, he transfers possession of his own property merely/ in respect to which, plaintiffs have no rights whatever. And the person receiving possession takes it subject to every legal right or claim which plaintiffs had to any property belonging to them remaining upon the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Nor can the defendant be charged with a conversion, or a wrongful detention of the property, by reason of his refusal to deliver, when demanded, on the 18th of February. And this because he had before that rightfully parted with all possession, control, and right of entry of and to the premises wherein the property demanded was situated. He would himself have been a trespasser if he had attempted, without the consent of his tenant, to comply with the demand. It is settled that a demand \u25a0 and refusal is only <em>prima facie </em>evidence of a conversion or wrongful detention. And that, notwithstanding the refusal to deliver, the party refusing may, if he can, show that he had not in fact converted the property to his own use, or detained it wrongfully; as in the case of one having the possession of property as a mere servant or custodian for another, neither claiming nor asserting any interest, or right \u00aef possession, or control in himself. This principle is so familiar that it is unnecessary to cite authorities to sustain it.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">The claim of plaintiffs\u2019 counsel that the defendant Knox had sold the property in question to Burke, and received a consideration therefor, is not sustained by the evidence. Knox did not assume absolutely to sell the property, but only such interest in the same (if any) as he had. If he had or has an interest, plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>tiffs cannot object to Ms selling Ms own. If he had none, then notMng was sold, and plaintiffs\u2019 rights are unaffected thereby. If the plaintiffs were wrongfully prevented by the officer from removing the property on the 17th of February, and have been injured thereby, their remedy is against the officer, and not the defendant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Exceptions were taken by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to various rulings of the justice during the trial. But I see no error in those rulings. Indeed, I tMnk all the evidence in respect to the alleged parol agreement to lease the property to the plaintiff Peck could have been properly excluded, as it was not claimed that such alleged agreement was ever perfected so as to become an actual lease, or give plaintiffs any rights of entry to the premises as tenants. The declarations of the officer, not in the presence of defendant, were clearly inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">The above considerations, if correct, constitute a complete barrier to plaintiffs\u2019 right of recovery in this action. It is therefore unnecessary to consider the other question in the case, as to whether plaintiffs had not lost title to this property, by reason of its being fixed to the freehold, and not removed before the termination of the tenancy, by the judgment and removal on the summary proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Exceptions overruled, and judgment ordered for defendant on the verdict, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
