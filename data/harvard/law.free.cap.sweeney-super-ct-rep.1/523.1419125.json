MARSH and JOSHUA REED, Plaintiffs and Respondents, <em>v. </em>B. FRANK PALMER and WILLIAM RICHARDSON, Defendants and Appellants.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b527-5\">Where an appeal from a judgment entered upon the report of a referee presents only questions of fact, in regard to which there is a conflict of evidence, the findings of the referee upon such evidence will he held conclusive.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A4V\">Before Monell, Jones, and Freedman, JJ.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b527-7\"><em>[Decided October </em>30, 1869.]</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-8\">This case was tried before a referee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-9\">The action was brought to recover commissions alleged to be due to the plaintiffs for orders for artificial limbs sent to the defendants ; also for the defendants\u2019 proportion of the cost of advertising their artificial leg in circulars and books issued and distributed by the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-10\">The referee reported in favor of the plaintiffs:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-11\">Judgment was entered, and defendants appealed to the General Term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A7j\"><em>Mr. Joseph H. Choate </em>for appellants.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-13\">The fatal defect in the referee\u2019s report is that he fails to state all the terms of the agreement, which was made solely with reference to and as a part of the plaintiffs\u2019 agency for the defendants, which was terminated by mutual consent in 1854, and never resumed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-14\">The agreement found by the referee is a part of the agreement which the parties made in writing, by reference to which its true limits and nature are immediately apparent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-15\">If there were any grounds for liability of the defendants\u2019 firm, consisting of Palmer, Hudson, and Richardson, the parties sued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>as partners; they certainly cannot be charged for work done in the way of advertising before their firm existed, and after it was dissolved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-5\">The finding of the referee that the 'advertising after 1854 was done \u201cin pursuance of such agreement\u201d falls to the ground when it appears that that agreement, the only one that was made to pay for advertising, was terminated, by mutual consent of the parties, in 1854.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b528-6\"><em>Mr. Ira D. Warren </em>for respondents.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-7\">There is no question of law in this case. Upon all the disputed ' questions of fact the preponderance of testimony is in favor of the plaintiffs; besides, the only witness who attempts to controvert the agreement is impeached\u2014contradicted by his own letters. In eases of conflict.of evidence the referee\u2019s decision is conclusive (Watson <em>v. </em>Campbell, 28 Barb., 421; Hooglan <em>v. </em>Night, 9 Bos., 894, cases cited; Voorhees\u2019 Code, sec. 373,note h).</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b528-8\">\n<em>By the Court:</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"b528-9\">Freedman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALt\">This is an appeal from a judgment entered upon the report of a referee in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendants. The plaintiffs\u2019 claim- for commissions having been waived, we have carefully examined the evidence bearing upon the liability of the defendants for the cost of the advertisements of their business inserted in the pamphlets issued by plaintiffs, and the findings of the referee thereon, and are of the opinion that the only questions arising therefrom, and presented upon this appeal, are questions of fact, in regard to which the evidence is conflicting, and upon which the decision of the referee must be held conclusive (Watson <em>v. </em>Campbell, 28 Barb., 421; Hooglan <em>v. </em>Wight, 7 Bosw., 394).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">The judgment appealed from must, therefore, be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
