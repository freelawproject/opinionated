Justice Jones and a jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-10\">Action for money lent and advanced, and goods sold and delivered in the City of Hew Orleans, State of Louisiana, during the years 1858, 1859, and 1861.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-11\">Defence, Statute of Limitations of the State of Louisiana.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-12\">On the trial, \u00e1 witness for the defendant testified that he was a practising lawyer in Hew Orleans, and acquainted with the laws of Louisiana. He was then ashed the. following question: \u201c What is the law of Louisiana with regard to prescription or limitation of actions for goods sold and delivered and money loaned ?\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-13\">The question was objected to, and excluded by the Court, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-14\">The plaintiff had a verdict, and the defendant appealed, and also from an order made at Special Term denying a motion for a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b49-15\"><em>Mr. E. Lauterbach </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b49-16\"><em>Mr. H. Morrison </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b49-17\">\n<em>By the Court:</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"b49-18\">Monell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWX\">The statute of the State of Louisiana, in which State the cause of action in this case arose, limiting the time for bringing actions, is not available as a defence in the courts of this State (Ruggles <em>v. </em>Keeler, 3 John R., 263). It is therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>immaterial that, by the laws of that State, the right of action would be lost. If six years have not elapsed since the statute of our own State began to run, the right of action is not barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">The evidence offered of the Louisiana statute was therefore properly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">The manner of proving such statutes was also objectionable. The defence was the \u201c <em>Statute </em>of Limitations,\u201d and, although the question which was overruled admitted of an answer, proving the existence in that State of some common-law bar, recognized by the courts of that State, yet, under the answer, the <em>statute </em>was the only bar which could properly be proved; and the attempt was to prove such statute <em>by parol. </em>That probably could not be done. Until a recent period, such laws could be proved in our courts <em>only </em>by a copy properly exemplified by the officer having the custody of them\u2014at least such seems to be the current authority (Packard v. Hill, 2 Wend., 411; Thomas <em>v. </em>Robinson, 3 id., 267).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">In 1848 a statute was passed, in this Statue, allowing the printed volumes of the statute laws of any other of the United States to be admitted in our courts <em>asprima facie </em>evidence of such laws (Sess. Laws, 1848, chap. 312).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">The question was therefore properly overruled, and the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
