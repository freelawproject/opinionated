R De Wolf <em>&amp; </em>Co., and other persons, in violation of his said agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-6\">That by reason of the premises the defendants have sustained injury and damage to the amount of ten thousand dollars, or thereabout, which the defendants claim to recover against the plaintiff in the action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-7\">Wherefore the defendants demand judgment against the said plaintiff for the amount of their damages aforesaid, with costs of defending this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-8\">The plaintiff replied, denying the counterclaim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-9\">The plaintiff proved the transfer and delivery to defendants of the office, business, and place of business, furniture, &amp;c., to defendants at the time specified in the contract; that defendants took possession and entered upon the prosecution of the business specified in the contract, paid the first instalment therein provided for, and have continued in the business ever since, but have refused, after demand made, to pay any subsequent instalment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b564-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>The defendants gave evidence to show that the plaintiff had violated his covenant not <em>\u201c </em>for five years to start, commence, or do any business of a similar kind in the city of New York;\" in this, that plaintiff had, against defendants\u2019 objection, continued at the same place to do a general \u201cshipping and commission business,\u201d in all respects as he had done before the execution and delivery of the agreement. Also, that plaintiff had persisted, in disregard of defendants\u2019 remonstrance, in doing the general business as well of \u201c vessels \u201d in which he \u201c owned a share,\u201d as those which he \u201c could and did control;\" all of which business he had expressly and specifically sold to the defendants. Also, evidence tending to show that plaintiff had \u201cbought for custom ers of defendants\u2019 firm,\u201d and did all the general business of ships whose owners had been customers of the old and continued to be customers of the new firm. Also, that plaintiff had endeavored to and had dissuaded persons, who had been customers of the old firm, from continuing with the <em>new </em>firm of defendants, and had successfully diverted such business to himself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b564-5\">On the trial the defendants\u2019 counsel offered to prove the meaning of the words \u201c shipping and commission business,\u201d which was excluded by the court,'under'defendants\u2019objection-. The court likewise excluded evidence offered by defendants\u2019 counsel to show that the persons for whom plaintiff had transacted \u201c shipping business,\u201d viz., selling bills of exchange for money to pay for supplies, were customers of the old firm. To this there was an exception. Defendant also gave evidence to show the damages sustained by them in consequence of such all\u00f3ged violation of the agreement on the part of plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b564-6\">At the close of the testimony defendants\u2019 counsel, among other things, demanded permission to \u25a0 submit to the jury the evidence as to his counterclaim, insisting there was evidence upon which the jury would be authorized to find damages, by' way of counterclaim, in defendants\u2019 favor. The justice excluded the evidence from the jury, and directed a verdict for plaintiff for the full amount claimed, less a single item of four dollars and seventy-five cents; to all which defendants\u2019 counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>excepted. From the judgment entered on the verdict defendants appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b565-5\"><em>Mr. E. C. Benedict </em>for appellants.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b565-6\">The court erred in holding that the clause in the agreement <em>\u201c </em>stipulating that the plaintiff should not engage in the shipping business for five years,\u201d was qualified by the clause which provided that he should not engage in that business with any of the customers of the firm of D. R. De Wolf <em>&amp; </em>Co.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b565-7\">The plaintiff sold to the defendants his \u201c interest of the business now being carried on at No. 103 Broad street, New York, under the name, style, and firm of D. R. De Wolf &amp; Co., as a shipping and commission business,\u201d and he covenanted that he would not \u201c start, commence, or do any business of the <em>same nature or hind </em>in the city of New York for five years, but this was not to be understood as debarring him from doing business as a merchandise, ship, commercial, or insurance broker (except buying for and shipping to any of the customers of the present firm), or chartering vessels for others on his own account, or making advances for vessels or for any person, or furnishing vessels with outfit.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b565-8\">This the court held to be an exception, including every kind and description of business done by the old firm, and that it only prohibited the plaintiff from doing a shipping business with the customers of the old firm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b565-9\">The court erred in refusing to dismiss the complaint after the plaintiff had rested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b565-10\">By the terms of the agreement, the plaintiff had agreed not to carry on any business of the same nature or kind as a shipping and commission business, in the city of New York, for five years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b565-11\">It appeared in evidence by the sworn admission of the plaintiff that \u201c he has been and still is engaged in business as a shipping and commission merchant\u201d ever since the malting of the agreement. This is a violation of his contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b566-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>A shipping and commission business is not what is reserved. Moreover, the court had no right to assume that the business done was within the limits of the reservation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b566-5\">The party relying upon an exception or reservation must always prove himself within it. The presumption is against, him antecedent to proof (1 Duer on Ins., 161; Breasted <em>v. </em>The Farmers\u2019 Loan &amp; Trust Co., 6 N. Y., 405 ; Hoffman <em>v. </em>The Etna Ins. Co., 32 N. Y., 405).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b566-6\">The .court erred' in refusing to allow the defendants to show that the parties for whom this business was transacted were customers of D. R. De Wolf &amp; Co., also in refusing to allow proof of the meaning of <em>\u201c </em>shipping and commission business.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b566-7\">The court below held that the agreement only prohibited the plaintiff from engaging in the business of the old firm with any of its former customers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b566-8\">Under this construction it was the right of the defendants to show that the parties for whom this business was transacted were customers of the late firm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b566-9\">The court erred in refusing- to submit the ease to the jury to decide upon the question whether the plaintiff had violated his part of the contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b566-10\">If the court should hold that our claim for the violation is a recoupment, we were entitled to the verdict of the jury upon fhe amount of damages.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b566-11\"><em>Mr. Erastus Cooke </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b566-12\">After the agreement went into effect, the plaintiff carried on no business, nor did he do any act which did not come within the reservation clauses in the agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b566-13\">After delivery of the business, office, and furniture, on the first d'ay of May, 1867, the covenants were, from the nature of the case, independent, and each can be enforced without any regard to the others.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b566-14\">The plaintiff never bound himself not to sell bills of exchange, consequently the judge was right in ruling out the transactions with Irving &amp; Co.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b567-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>There is no act relied on by the defendants as a violation of the contract, until after the delivery of the business to the defendants, and after they had entered into the enjoyment of it, under the contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b567-5\">If, then, the plaintiff broke his covenants, he may be liable for the breach, but it can form no defence to an action on an independent covenant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b567-6\">When a person has received part of the consideration for which he entered into the agreement, it would be unjust that, because he has not had the whole, he should therefore be permitted to enjoy that part without either paying or doing any thing for it, <em>and therefore the lem obliges him to perform the agreement on his part, a/nd leaves him to his remedy to recover damages for not receiving the whole consideration </em>(Peffee <em>v. </em>Haight, 20 Barb., 430, 440; Tompkins <em>v. </em>Elliott, 5 Wend. 498).</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b567-7\">\n<em>By the Court:</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"b567-8\">Fithian, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALq\">The covenants contained in the agreement in this case are mostly independent. The only covenant or thing, the performance of which on the part of the plaintiff can be construed into a condition precedent to his right to demand the money agreed to be paid by defendants, is the delivery of the books of the old firm, with the possession of the office and furniture, and transfer of the lease. This the plaintiff did, so far forth, at least, that it was accepted by defendants as a sufficient \u201cdelivery and relinquishment of the business aforesaid,\u201d to induce defendants to enter upon the performance 'of the contract on their part, by paying the first instalment or down payment and entering upon the business. The lease, it appears, was a verbal one, and could be transferred without writing. The delivery of the written agreement was doubtless a sufficient transfer to defendants of such verbal lease as against the plaintiff, especially when accompanied with a delivery of the possession of the demised premises. The other covenants on both sides were executory and continuing, relating to subsequent business and subsequent acts to be done and forborne. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>were in their nature independent of each other, and neither could be a condition precedent to the performance of the other. The defendants having thus elected to enter upon the performance of this agreement on their part, could not be permitted thereafter to rescind the contract by reason of any failure on the part of plaintiff to perform any independent agreement in the contract contained and on his part to be performed. For any such breach, defendants have their action at law for damages (Day <em>v. </em>N. Y. C. R.R. Co., 53 Barb. R., 250). The defendants cannot, therefore, set up as a flat <em>hcor </em>to this action any non performance, by the plaintiff, of all or any of the independent covenants \u00f3n his part to be performed. In that regard the ruling of the learned justice on the trial was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">: The defendants may, however, under the Code, allege and prove, by way of defence, and for a counterclaim (which is in the nature of a cross-action), the neglect or refusal of the plaintiff to perform any or all the covenants by him agreed to be performed and kept, and may offset such damages as they can prox^e resulting from such breach, against the plaintiff\u2019s demand in the action, so as to defeat plaintiff\u2019s recovery altogether, if the damages shown be sufficient toYalan.ce the amount of - plaintiff\u2019s demand proved on Iris part. This defence the defendants have alleged and attempted to prove. And, in my opinion, the proof was of a character which should have been submitted to the jury, under proper instructions from the court. The agreement is very loosely and inartificially drawn. There arc exceptions, reservations, and explanations. Different words, not-precisely equivalent in their meaning, are used in different parts of the instrument, in respect to the same subject-matter, while in two or more instances\" general words are used, which, in their broadest and largest sig-' nifieation, would include matters entirely beyond the scope and-purview of the contract, thus showing an intent to use suchxvords in some technical or restricted sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">It is not surprising then, but quit\u00e9 probable,-that in the hurry of a trial, without time to hear argument or carefully examine, a judge should err in the construction of so uncertain an in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>strument. Indeed, there are certain provisions of the contract which seem to me incapable of a satisfactory interpretation without parol evidence in explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">The first covenant on the part of the plaintiff is \u201c to sell, relinquish, transfer, and deliver to defendants the <em>good-will and interest </em>of the business now being carried on at No. 103 Broad street, under the name, style, and firm of D. R. De Wolf <em>&amp; </em>Co., as a <em>shipping and commission </em>business,\u201d together with a lease of the office, furniture, books, papers, stationery, &amp;c. \u201cAlso, the business of the vessels when in this port, in which the party of the first part now at the present time owns a share, in which he may be able or can control \u201d (excepting, &amp;c.). Then follows this provision: \u201c The said party of the first part (plaintiff) agrees that from and after the 1st day of May next, he will not start, commence, or do any business of the <em>same nature or </em>hind, in the city of New York, during the term of five years next ensuing, commencing from the first day of May next. This is not to be understood as debarring him (plaintiff) from buying and selling, to any extent, nor from acting as broker in merchandise, ship or commercial broker (except buying for and shipping to any of the customers of the present firm), insurance broker, or chartering vessels for others, or on his own account, or making advances on or for vessels or for any person, or furnishing new vessels with outfits,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The first step in construing or interpreting the foregoing provisions is to determine in some way what particular business transactions (if any) the plaintiff had covenanted to abstain from \u201cstarting,\u201d \u201ccommencing,\u201d or \u201cdoing,\u201d and whether there was any thing pertaining to a \u201c shipping and commission business,\u201d or <em>\u201cbusiness of the same nature or hind\u201d </em>other or different, or not included in those particular business transactions, which it was stipulated the plaintiff should not be \u201c debarred\u201d from doing. In order to determine these questions with any degree of certainty, it is necessary to ascertain, either from the contract itself or evidence outside, the precise character, nature, and extent of the business which was \u201c then (now) being conducted and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>carried on at No. 103 Broad street, under the name, &amp;c., of D. R. De Wolf &amp; Co., <em>as a shipping and commission </em>business.\u201d This cannot be satisfactorily ascertained from the contract itself, because the term \u201c shipping business,\u201d in its broadest extent, may mean any and every ldnd of business relating to ships, and may include ship-building; while the - term \u201c commission business,\u201d in its largest signification, may mean any and every kind of business, for the transaction of which a commission is paid, and include every vendible commodity. It is clear that the term \u201c business conducted, &amp;c., at No. 103 Broad street, in the name of D. R.De Wolf &amp; Co., as a <em>shipping-and commission </em>business,\u201d was not intended to have the large and extended signification above indicated. It was necessary and proper, therefore, to show by evidence <em>aliunde </em>the contract, what was the precise business carried on by the firm of De Wolf &amp; Co. at No. 103 Broad street, \u201cas 'a shipping and commission business.\u201d This the counsel for the defendants was prohibited by the court from doing, though lie offered and desired so to do. Such ruling, I am of opinion, was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Again, the plaintiff, in and by the contract, sells to the defendants not only his <em>interest </em>in the business of the firm of De Wolf &amp; Co., but also the <em>\u201c good-will </em>\u201d of such business. And I see nothing in any other clause of the contract modifying or qualifying this provision. - If the term \u201c good-will of the business \u201d is to have any signification whatever, it must be held to be, even in its most restrictive sense, an agreement on the part . of a vendor that, in respect to the \u201c business \u201d which he thus sells the \u201c good-will \u201d of, he will not attempt, by any direct act or' word o'f his, to injure of depreciate' such business while being Carried on by his vendee, or divert from it any custom or \"patronage which would otherwise come to it in consequence of the reputation and \u201cgood-will\u201d pertaining to it while conducted, by the vendor. On the trial, defendants gave uncontradicted , evidence to show that, in a number of instances, the plaintiff: had deliberately and persistently intercepted business and custom, which would otherwise come to defendants\u2019 firm, and' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>which before pertained to the firm of De Wolf <em>&amp; </em>Co., and diverted the same to himself, by representing to the customer that defendants were unable and had not the facility of doing such business on as favorable terms as the plaintiff. There was also evidence of pecuniary damages sustained by the defendants in consequence of such conduct. This evidence should have been submitted to the jury, and if found to be true, defendants were entitled to recover for such damage.</p>\n<p id=\"AMq\">Again, without examining the evidence in detail, which is quite voluminous, it suffices to say there was evidence tending to show quite satisfactorily that plaintiff had assumed to, and did, against the objections of the defendants, transact all and every the commission business of and for a number of vessels in the port of New York, in which he (plaintiff) at the time of the making of the contract <em>\u201c </em>owned a share,\u201d and which he was \u201c able to and could control,\u201d thus wrongfully diverting to himself moneys, being proceeds of business which he had expressly sold to the defendants, and which was the consideration of their agreement to pay. There was also evidence that plaintiff had likewise, in a number of instances, <em>\u201c </em>bought for \u201d <em>\u201c </em>the <em>customers of the present firm\u201d </em>(D. R. De Wolf &amp; Co.), which he was expressly prohibited from doing, as well in the clause enumerating the particular transactions, which plaintiff is not \u201c debarred \u201d from doing, as in the preceding general prohibitory clause; and that plaintiff had received as profits of such business divers sums of money which justly belonged to the defendants. The jury should likewise have been permitted to take this evidence into consideration, and, if true, awarded to defendants such damages as they have sustained in consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">For these reasons the judgment should be reversed and a new trial ordered, costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
