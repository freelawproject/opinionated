On Saturday (23d), defendants said they had filled their orders elsewhere, and refused to receive it. This witness explained the meaning of the words \u201cto be received from wharf\u201d to be, that the cotton was to. be delivered on the wharf by the seller and taken off the wharf by the buyer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b10-23\">Another of plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses testified that all the cotton was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>not on the wharf until the 25th, on which day he took a letter from the plaintiffs to the defendants, notifying them that the cotton was ready for delivery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b11-5\">A motion to dismiss the complaint was denied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b11-6\">The defendants proved that they demanded a delivery of the cotton on Thursday, the 21st.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b11-7\">One of the defendants\u2019 witnesses testified that he went, by the direction of the defendants, to the wharf about one o\u2019clock on Thursday (21st), to ask for the cotton; that there was no cotton out; that the brokers, or some one on their behalf, asked permission to let <em>\u201c </em>the thing \u201d lie over until the next day (Friday); that he went over to get a delivery of the cotton once or twice on Thursday, and three times at least on Friday; the last time was about four o\u2019clock on Friday evening.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b11-8\">The action was tried before Chief-Justice Robertson and a jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b11-9\">The Court directed a verdict for the plaintiffs, to which the defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b11-10\">Judgment was suspended, and the exception sent to the General Term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b11-11\"><em>Mr. Henry H.

These bought and sold notes were not the contract. They were neither made nor seen by the broker, nor were they signed by him nor by the defendants, but were made up by clerks from the broker\u2019s memorandum, and the defendants had a right to inquire whether this note contained the whole contract (Livewright <em>v. </em>Archibald, 6 Eng. Law and Eq., 286; Hayman <em>v. </em>Neale, 2 Camp. 337; Hawes <em>v. </em>Foster, 1 Moo. and R., 368).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b11-13\">The Court erred in refusing to dismiss the complaint.

He could only repudiate it by returning the note at once with his dissent (Parsons on Contracts, 5th ed., vol. 1., p. 543).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b12-11\">When no time is expressed in a written contract for the performance of a duty, the Court presumes a reasonable time, and it becomes a matter of judicial construction in the light of all the surrounding circumstances; nor will any extrinsic testimony be allowed going to fix a definite term, because that would vary the contract (Parsons on Contracts, vol. ii., pp. 661, 662, and cases cited in notes; Newton <em>v. </em>Wales, 3 Robertson, 453).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b12-12\">The evidence shows conclusively that under the contract, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>the usual practice of the trade, the cotton was deliverable on the wharf when discharged from the vessel, and that immediately the cotton in question was so discharged the defendants were notified that the plaintiffs were ready to deliver the same under their contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-5\">Upon the whole case, the plaintiffs having established the contract of sale, as set out in the complaint, which it was not competent for the defendants to contradict or vary by parol evidence, and the plaintiffs having also shown an offer to deliver the cotton within such a time as upon the evidence it cannot be doubted was a reasonable time, the jury were properly instructed to render a verdict in their favor.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b13-6\">\n<em>By the Court:</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"b13-7\">Monell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AI\">There were no disputed facts in this case, and therefore no question for the jury. The main facts were sufficiently , established, and the only question to be examined is, whether upon such facts the direction of the learned justice was correct. The contract of sale was made on the 21st of November. On that day, and again on the next day, the defendants demanded a delivery. The cotton was not delivered, for the reason that it had not been discharged from the 'vessel. On the 25th a delivery was tendered and refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b13-8\">The contract did not specify any time for the delivery, nor were there any extrinsic facts or circumstances which can materially aid the court in determining upon the time the parties had in which to perform. The case must, therefore, be disposed of upon principles applicable to contracts, which are silent in respect to the time for their execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b13-9\">The question resolves itself into this: Did the demand made by the defendants on the 21st and 22d, and the inability, refusal, or neglect of the plaintiffs to deliver on those days, put an end to the contract and discharge the defendants; or, did the plaintiffs have until the 25th to make delivery ?</p>\n<p id=\"b13-10\">The general rule is, that where goods are to be delivered, and no time is specified in the contract, it is a presumption of law that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>the parties intended and agreed that they should be delivered in a reasonable time. What is a reasonable time is a question of law, to be determined upon the facts and circumstances of each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b14-5\">There is one fact in this case, which was proven, I suppose, with the view of aiding the Court in determining the question of reasonable time, which was, that at the time of the contract the cotton was on board the steamer \u201c Zodiac,\u201d then reported as being in the harbor; that on coming up the bay she got aground, and her cargo had to be lightered to the city. That fact does not, however, in my judgment, help us in ascertaining what would be a reasonable' time for delivery, however much it might, under certain circumstances, perhaps, <em>excuse </em>a delivery. It was not contemplated by the parties that any casualty would prevent an immediate execution of the contract, and cannot, therefore, be presumed to have entered into their intentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b14-6\">I cannot find any thing in the contract, or in any surrounding-fact or circumstance, to excuse an immediate delivery, or at least a delivery on demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b14-7\">The commodity sold was capable of an immediate delivery, and no particular space of time was required to complete the sale by the symbolical delivery usual in such cases. The cotton was to be received by the purchaser upon the wharf. Placing it upon the wharf and giving an order for its delivery to the purchaser, would constitute a delivery, and it, would thereafter be his property and at his risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b14-8\">There is nothing in the character of the property sold that would indicate that four days would not be an unreasonable time for its delivery; nor is there any thing in the circumstances of the sale that would lead us to the conclusion that the plaintiffs had the right to tender performance on the fourth day after the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b14-9\">If any thing is to be gained extrinsically, it is, that in the absence of express stipulations fixing the time of performance, parties intend and mean an immediate performance, provided, of course, the contract is capable of such performance; and it would not be unfair to presume that the parties, in the case before us, contemplated, as well as intended, that the cotton should be de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>livered on the day of sale. Their acts indicate such intention The plaintiffs and defendants, -through and by their respective agents, went down to the wharf on the 21st, the former to deliver and the latter to receive the cotton. L</p>\n<p id=\"b15-5\">As I have said before, the casualty which prevented a delivery on that day cannot enter into the question of reasonable time; for it may very well be, that to the defendants the delivery on the day of purchase was of the very <em>essence </em>of the contract. They might have purchased for immediate re-shipment or re-sale, either or both of which would have been defeated by the plaintiffs\u2019 delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-6\">I am of opinion, therefore, that the delay of four days in tendering a delivery was unreasonable, and that the refusal or neglect of the plaintiffs to deliver on the demand of the defendants relieved the latter from all responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-7\">The exceptions should he <em>sustained, </em>the verdict set aside, and a new trial ordered, with costs to defendants to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
