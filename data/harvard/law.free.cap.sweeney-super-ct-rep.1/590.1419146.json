it then charged, that the whole price to be paid for said hats amounted to the sum of $9,800.75; that said hats were delivered pursuant to the agreement, and received and accepted by the defendants; that afterward defendants, without the consent of and against the protest of plaintiffs, returned the hats to the factory of plaintiffs; that plaintiffs caused said hats to be sold on account of the defendants, having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>first given them due notice of the time and place of sale, and that the sale would be on their account, as they would be held liable for all loss and damage sustained by plaintiffs ; that the net proceeds of the sale were $7,638.18, and that by reason of the premises plaintiffs have suffered loss and damage in the sum of $2,162.57, being the difference between the sum defendants agreed to pay for the hats and the sum they sold for at said auction, for which difference plaintiffs demanded judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AKO\">The defendants admitted the partnership of the plaintiffs, as also that of the defendants, and that plaintiffs gave them notice of the auction sale, and then alleged that they made a verbal arrangement with plaintiffs at Philadelphia, to the effect that if the plaintiffs would at once furnish to them at New York a full, true, and accurate written statement, in detail, of the cost of a certain (then unascertained) number of felt hats, then of the plaintiffs (showing all the items from which to ascertain the exact cost thereof), the defendants would buy said hats and pay the plaintiffs therefor the said cost thereof, with $2 for each dozen of said hats added thereto, upon delivery thereof in the city of New York; that plaintiffs, without furnishing to defendants said statement, sent them eighty-four cases of hats, which defendants then refused, and now have refused, to receive or accept, and which they caused to be returned to the plaintiffs with a notice that they declined to receive or accept them ; that plaintiffs never have furnished any such statement as aforesaid; that defendants have laid out for the cost of transportation of said hats $43.80, for which they demanded judgment against plaintiffs by way of counterclaim, and denied all allegations in the complaint not specifically answered, except so far as the answer admited them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b595-6\">On the trial it appeared that plaintiffs were manufacturers of hats, and that the defendants were general commission merchants, and knew plaintiffs to be such manufacturers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b595-7\">Philip Ilerst testified, among other things, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b595-8\"><em>Q. </em>You had an interview with Mr. De Oomeau on or about tire 2d day of May, 1866 ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number><em>A. </em>Tes, sir.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-5\"><em>Q. </em>Be so good as to state to the jury exactly what took place.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-6\"><em>A. </em>On or about the 2d day of May, Mr. De Comean, accompanied by Mr. Curran, of Philadelphia, came into our factory.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-7\"><em>Q. </em>Who was Mr. Curran ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-8\"><em>A. </em>A broker also;

He told me that he had no difficulty in selling those hats, but that he found a ready sale for them, and was receiving orders at that time for such goods. \u2022Being raised in the hat trade, and a little familiar with the value of hats, they struck me as being cheap at the price he named; the more so as the hats were well made and very salable; and. at the price fur then was; I thought they would be a good purchase at the price he named, and I told him so. We walked out, bidding him good-by, and he accompanied us down stairs. I did not know that he was coming down stairs; At the door there were three or four cases of hats, if I remember rightly, exposed to view; that is, some of the hats were taken out of the paper, boxes. Mr. Herst showed me those hats, and I admired them likewise. Some other conversation took place, of no importance in this case, which I do not remember. I asked him whether he found a ready sale\" for those goods, and he said he did. I told him I would not mind if he would sell me a lot; that I would buy a lot of him if he would sell me a lot of them. He asked me what offer I would make him, and I told him that I would give him two dollars a dozen profit above the cost for all the goods he had in his store\u2014of such goods;' Mr. Herst said that two dollars a dozen would be a foolish offer, that they would not listen to it, but that if I made it three he might confer with his partners and give me their decision. I told him that I did not .care increasing my offer above the two dollars first made; that if he chose to accept that, well and good. He declined, and I went out, and I happened to meet Mr. Samuel on the street, in Philadelphia ; after shaking hands with him, he told me that he had some fur which he wished to dispose of, and asked me to retprn with him to his store, where I could see samples.

That is apparent to me, because the actual cost has not been shown\u2014indeed, it is almost' impossible to show the actual cost of these goods $ at all events, it has not been shown; and, therefore, if the contract was that the defendants were only to pay the actual cost, and $2 in addition, inasmuch as the plaintiffs have not -shown the actual cost, they cannot recover. If, however, the contract was that they were to pay that cost which the manufacturers had assigned to their goods when making them up, as being the price at which they were willing to sell, so as to produce no loss, and $2 in addition to that cost-price, then the plaintiffs can recover their whole demand, because they have shown that in the evidence. That is the question for you to determine: What was this contract 2 And you are to look at the evidence in the light of your experience as business men; as men having ordinary reason and experience. One of these parties is a manufacturer of hats, the other a broker and dealer in general merchandise, and when they made the bargain as regards the sale of the goods, and spoke of $2 a dozen over the cost, what did they mean by that term 2 What is the ordinary acceptation of that term among business men, when a contract of this kind is made 2 Does it mean the cost which the manufacturer has made up as being the sum at which he has satisfied himself he can sell without loss, all over it being profit, and all below it loss ? When two parties, situated as these were, come together and make a contract for $2 profit over the cost, or, as has been charged here, $2 profit, what do the two mean 2 Do \u2022they mean that the manufacturer, if he has had these goods on hand any length of time, shall go, back and bring the persons from whom he purchased articles used in the manufacture of the goods, to show how much he paid for those articles, at that previous time 2 Is that what they mean 2 Or is it that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>purchaser is dealing upon his faith in the seller, upon the faith he has in the seller having fairly conducted his business in the ordinary manner in which business of that character is conducted, and that both mean that sum which the manufacturers, in making up their lots for sale, have put them at, for the purpose of ascertaining at what price they can sell their goods, in order to secure a profit or save themselves from loss ? H the latter was the cost referred to here, viz., the cost in the lot-books, and the plaintiffs were to have in addition to that the sum of two dollars a dozen, then the plaintiffs are entitled to recover their demand. There was nothing said at the time particularly referring to these books, and you have got to arrive at the conclusion that the amounts in the books were the cost-prices contemplated by the parties, from the circumstances in the case and from your general business experience in matters of this kind. There are some indications on both sides of the question, and you will have to weigh those in making up your mind as to what the contract was. There is evidence tending to show that in all their correspondence, or rather at the end of their correspondence, the desire was to get a copy of the books, on the part of the defendants, they alleging that they'could not ascertain how much they were to pay unless they had a copy of the books, and that they sent the goods back because such a copy was not sent them. The plaintiffs, on the other hand, assert that all the defendants asked for was the mixtures, and they did not want the proportions of those, but only wanted to know what kind of fur the hats were composed of, in order that they could tell their customers \u2018 this is' a hat made of such and such fur.\u2019 If that testimony is true, it goes some way to show that the meaning of the parties, when speaking of the cost, was to refer to the cost which the plaintiffs had made up as being the cost of their different lots. On the other hand, the defendants say, at the time of this bargain they expressly told the plaintiffs, <em>\u2018 </em>We want you to make out and send us on a statement or an account of the mixtures, so that we can ascertain what the cost will be.\u2019 Assuming that, and not the statement of the plaintiffs, to be true, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>would go a considerable way to show that the defendants depended for the ascertainment of the amount of the payment to be made by them, not upon the lot-books, cr the amount which the plaintiffs had fixed as being the proper cost-price of their goods, but upon a detailed account, containing the quantity, the quality, and the price of every thing that entered into the composition of a hat, in order that they might be able to submit that detailed account to other people who would tell them whether it was correct or not. That is the defendants\u2019 version of the bargain ; they say that that was what they wanted, and that they told the plaintiffs, at the time the bargain was made, that they wanted that detailed account for the purpose of figuring up the cost, and that they might show it to other dealers and ascertain whether they had been correctly charged for the goods.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b604-5\">\u201c These are all the remarks I deem it necessary to submit to you. If you find that the bargain was that the defendants were to pay the sum which the manufacturers had, in making up theiy goods, fixed them at as being their cost\u2014the price at which they could sell and clear themselves from loss\u2014and all over which would be profit, and all under which would be loss, and that they were to have two dollars a dozen in addition to that sum\u2014if that was the bargain made between the parties, the plaintiffs are entitled to recover. If, however, you find that the bargain between them was that they were to pay only two dollars a dozen over and above the actual cost, to be ascertained by the actual quantity, quality, and cost of material that entered into the composition of these goods, and the actual amount of time and labor spent upon them, then that would have to be made out and agreed upon subsequently to the contract, for, if not agreed upon, it would of course lead to a dispute. But if that was the contract, if the plaintiffs were only to receive over and above the actual cost \u00f3f every article of material and every item of labor that entered into these hats the sum of two dollars a dozen, then, as the plaintiffs have not shown a proper case for a recovery, you will find a verdict for the defendants.

They therefore had no right to return them, even if there had been a breach of the contract to give information as to the mixture, which there was not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b607-5\">The plaintiffs had a right, after the goods were returned to them, to sell them at public auction at the risk of the defendants, giving due notice of the time and place of sale.

After such sale the plaintiffs were entitled to recover the difference between what they brought at such sale and the sum the defendants agreed to pay for the goods, together with the plaintiffs\u2019 expenses in reference to the goods after their return; and the juiy gave the plaintiffs this amount.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b607-6\">The principal question presented by the appeal, and made at the trial, was as to what the contract was on the point of the amount the defendants were to pay for the goods, and whether the plaintiffs had given any evidence as to what that amount was. If there was evidence given of this amount, then the verdict cannot be disturbed, except for some other exception of the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"127\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b607-7\">The construction of the contract contended for by the defend ants was an impracticable and unreasonable one; it would have been impossible ever to have proved the cost under the strict view contended for by the defendants. The contract was made in reference to the lot-boolcs, a species of books generally kept by manufacturers, for the purpose of satisfying themselves of the cost of the goods manufactured.

The very object of having a jury is to have the benefit of the experience of men versed in the affairs of life, especially in a commercial case.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"133\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b608-7\">\n<em>By the Court:</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"b608-8\">Jones, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Adf\">There were numerous exceptions taken on the trial, all of which were abandoned on the argument of the appeal, except such as arose out of the submission to the jury, the determination of what was meant by the parties by the term cost used in their contract, and the charge of the court on that subject, and two objections to evidence which will be noticed hereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">The appellants insist: First\u2014That the contract was undisputed, and that the court should have construed it; and that in so doing the court should have given to the word \u201c cost \u201d its usual and ordinary signification, there being no evidence that it had any other meaning. Second\u2014That, there being no evidence that the word \u201c cost, \u201d as used in this contract, had any technical meaning, or that the parties attached to it any meaning other than its usual one, it was error to submit the case to the jury with the instruction that they were to look at the evidence in the light of their experience as business men, and were to arrive at a conclusion as to what the parties meant by the word \u201ccost\u201d from the circumstances in the case and their general business experience in matters of this kind; and Third\u2014That it was error, under any circumstances, to instruct the jury that they might look at the evidence in the light of their experience as business men, and determine the point involved from the cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>enmstances in the case and their general business experience in matters of that kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Let us now consider these objections. The answer put in issue the terms of the contract as alleged in the complaint, and also the amount of damages sustained by its breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">It is true the answer substantially concedes, as alleged in the complaint, that the amount to be paid for the hats was the cost-price and $2 a dozen in addition. On this point there is no question raised either by the pleadings or the proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">But the complaint alleges that the cost-price, with the additional $2, amounts to a certain sum. This is denied by the answer. It was therefore necessary on the trial to establish this allegation; and, in establishing it, the meaning to be attached to the words \u201c cost-price \u201d was necessarily involved. The term \u201ccost\u201d is a relative one, and differs in its meaning according to the circumstances under which it is used: thus, the cost-price to animporter is one thing, to a jobber or middle-man another,to a retailer another, and to a purchaser from a retailer still another. In determining what the contracting parties mean by the term, reference must be had to the situation of the parties and the circumstances under which the word is used. Ordinarily it would refer to the sum which the seller had himself paid for the article ; but it may refer to the sum paid to its original producer, or to some one of the numerous holders through whose hands it has passed between the original producer and the immediate seller. To what it is meant to refer by the contracting parties must be judged of by all the surrounding circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">Now, in this case, it is evident that both parties contemplated that the sellers should receive $2 profit; and consequently that a proper proportion of the general expenses of carrying on the business, such as rent of the buildings, insurance, book-keeper\u2019s salary, light, fuel, &amp;c., should enter into the cost as well as the bare cost of the material and of the labor directly bestowed on it. These matters necessarily enter into the cost of an article to the manufacturer. It is apparent that a manufacturer must take all these matters into consideration in fixing the cost of his manu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>factored article, which is, that price at which he can afford to. sell it without positive loss to himself ; and it is also apparent that it is necessary for him to keep a record of such assigned cost, for it is by this means that he is to keep -track of his business, determine how much he is to charge for a profit, the amount of profit he makes on any particular species of article, to what extent he can vary his charge for profit to shit the market and the demand for the article, to regulate him in making his bargains for sales, and to keep the run of his losses on the article.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">The natural power of our reason teaches us that this must necessarily be the mode in which manufacturers transact their business, and ascertain the cost of their articles; and by the same power we are also taught that when a manufacturer speaks of the cost of articles manufactured by him he refers to the cost thus assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">The affirmative evidence given by the plaintiff in this case shows our reason not to be at fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">It shows that the plaintiffs kept such a record in books called lot-books; \u2022 it also shows that at the time of the sale the lot-' boobs were in the minds of both parties, and the cost therein set down was referred to as the cost over which the $2 profit was to be receiv\u00e9d.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\"><em>\u201c </em>Hr.' Be Comean th\u00e9n asked me (Henry Samuel) what I thought the hats would come to, and I told him Hr. Herst and his son were busily engaged in calculating it at that time from <em>the lot-booTcs, </em>and that I would let him know. A short -time afterward Hr. Herst came down stairs and told me the amount,, and I told Hr. Be Comean. I told him they would come to something like $9,000 or $10,000. Hr. Be Comeau said it was all right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">The hats did in fact come to $9,800.75.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">This evidence, together with the other facts and circumstances \u25a0 above referred to, and the fact that t^e purchaser was a business man (being a general commission merchant), and knew plaintiffs' to be manufacturers, amply justifies the verdict of the jury finding' that the cost, referred to by the parties was that assigned in the' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>lot-books. It is unnecessary, therefore, to discuss the question whether, conceding there was no evidence tending to show that these parties attach a different meaning to the word \u201c cost,\u201d it devolved on the court, and not on the jury, to construe the meaning of the word as used by them; for the jury having given that construction which the court should have given, if it were within its province, a verdict will not be set aside for an error in submitting the question to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">In this case, however, there was evidence given, in behalf of the' defendant, tending to show that the parties attached a different meaning to the word \u201c cost\u201d as used by them. Mr. De Gomeau was satisfied of that at the time of the contract; he said to Mr. Blaylock, in the presence of Mr. Samuel: <em>\u201c </em>It will be necessary for me, in order to examine and ascertain the cost of these goods, to have a detailed copy of the mixtures. I said it was my intention to ascertain the cost, as I wished to be furnished with the mixtures, for the purpose of ascertaining the cost of these goods. He told me Mi'. Samuel would make it out and forward it, and Mr. Samuel said, <em>\u2018 </em>Certainly, I will send it around to your hotel this evening.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">This evidence, if credited, tends to destroy the effect of the evidence of Samuel, and also the effect of the necessary course of business of manufacturers in making up lot-books fixing therein to the cost of the manufactured articles a sum at which sales can be made without a loss, and tends strongly to show that the meaning attached by the parties to the word \u201ccost\u201d was the actual cost of the material and labor in the market, at the time of the purchase of the material and performance of the labor; and would, with other evidence in the case, have sustained a verdict finding that to have been the meaning of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">On the part of the plaintiffs, however, it was testified that Mr. Be Comean said he only desired to have \u201ca general idea of what the hats were made of, so that he could tell his customers the ingredients, or what the hats were made of\u2014the name of the fur.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>Thus there was contradictory evidence as to the meaning attached by the parties to the word cost used by them; and hence it became a proper case for the jury to decide, as to what was the meaning they attached to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">In deciding on this conflicting evidence the jury were at liberty to bring to their aid their own experience of things,\" the natural power of their reason, and an application of those principles on which they would act in their affairs of ordinary life; for, as Starkie says, it is by thes\u00e9 aids they must necessarily decide (Starkie on Ev., vol. 1, p. 14); and, as Graham says, \u201c the idea of the superior qualification of juries to decide issues of fact is based upon the presumption that their association with everyday life gives' them\" just views of men and things, and enables them to form correct conclusions. The judge not only may but ought to instruct them that in considering their verdict they are to make use of their own experience so far as it shall be the guide to their reason\u201d (Graham on New Trials, vol. 8, p. 833.)</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">They have the right to draw from proven or known facts such inferences and considerations as their power of reason and general experience teach them to be the usual or necessary consequence thereof, and in so doing to bring to their aid their experience of the motives that govern human action generally, or of human action under the particular circumstances of the case before them, and also their experience in the daily transactions of life, including necessarily their experience (if they have any) in transactions of the nature of the one out of which the cause before them may have arisen.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">True, the law now is (although formerly it was different) that the jury cannot decide an issue on their own personal knowledge of the facts in dispute; but when certain facts are proved they may draw from them such inferences and conclusions as their experience or power of reason teaches them to be ordinary or necessary concomitants or consequences of the proven facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">Appellants\u2019 counsel has misapprehended the charge in this case. He makes the point that, by the charge, the jury were permitted to find for the plaintiff, on their general experience as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>the meaning of the word cost, without any evidence on that subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Not so. It has already been shown that there was sufficient evidence that the parties, when they used the word \u201c cost,\u201d referred to the sums set down in the lot-books, as the cost of the articles, to carry the case to the jury, and that there was evidence for the other side tending to show that actual cost was referred to. The judge left it to the jury to determine what the parties referred to when they used the word <em>\u201c </em>cost,\u201d charging them that they must decide the point from the circumstances in the case, applying thereto their general business experience in matters. of that kind, as men of ordinary reason and experience. This is the sole effect of the charge and is perfectly proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">It is true the judge told the jury there was nothing said, particularly referring to the lot-book, overlooking the evidence at folio 167. We cannot, however, say that the jury overlooked that testimony, or that they'excluded it from their consideration. On the contrary, we must assume that, notwithstanding the charge of the judge, they had that evidence in mind when considering this verdict. \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">As the case was tried on the theory that plaintiffs were bound to show that the contract was to pay the cost assigned to the goods in the lot-books, and two dollars a dozen in addition, or else wholly failed, it is obvious that it was wholly immaterial whether the books stated the exact cost or not, unless the costs had been fraudulently exaggerated in the books; and it is also obvious that the books were competent evidence of the costs therein stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"134\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b613-9\">Barbour, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXV\">(dissenting). This was an action to recover the difference between the contract price and the actual value of eighty-four cases of\u2018 hats, contracted to be sold by the plaintiffs to the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">The testimony of the witnesses upon the trial showed that an agreement was made between the plaintiffs, who were hat manu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>facturers, and the defendants, whereby the latter undertook to purchase, and the former to sell and deliver, the hats in question, at and for the price of two dollars per dozen over and beyond the cost of manufacture. Evidence was also given <em>on </em>the part of the defendants, tending to prove that when that bargain was made, and as a par\u00ed and parcel thereof, the plaintiffs also undertook and promised to furnish the defendants with a detailed statement of the mixtures used in making the hats, so as to enable the latter 'to estimate their cost; and the plaintiffs gave testimony tending to show that such promise to furnish a statement formed no part of the contract of sale, but was .made subsequently thereto, and was entirely independent .of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Sobn after the making of the .contract, the hats were sent by the plaintiffs to the defendants, but without any bill or statement showing the mixtures or the cost of the goods. The defendants thereupon telegraphed and wrotfe several times to the plaintiffs for the promised statement, and, not being able to obtain such an one as was satisfactory to themselves, finally returned the hats to the plaintiffs, upon the ground that the promise to furnish the statement was a part of the main contract, and that they were not bound to take and pay for the goods unless it was furnished to them. Upon the return of the hats, the plaintiffs sold them at auction, after notifying the defendants (of the intended sale, and then brought this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">The plaintiffs were permitted, against the objection and exception of the defendants, to prove upon the trial, by the production of certain extracts from a book of theirs, called a \u201c lot-book,\u201d and the testimony of witnesses, the sums at which they had estimated in detail the cost to themselves of the various parcels of hats which were sent to the defendants. But the evidence given upon the trial to prove what the actual cost of the hats really was, was wholly insufficient fpr that purpose; and so the court ultimately charged, the jury. When the plaintiffs rested their case the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint, upon the ground of the entire failure of the plaintiffs to prove the cost of the hats, which motion was denied, and an exception <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>taken. Several other exceptions were also taken during the progress of the trial, and upon the charge of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">I know of no principle of law which would have allowed the introduction of the extracts from the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201c lot-hook,\u201d to prove the sums at which the plaintiffs had estimated or calculated the cost of the hats, together with the further evidence upon that subject, imless it was done for the purpose of enabling the plaintiffs to prove that they had acted in good faith in sending to the defendants the statements showing what the former really believed to have been the cost of the hats, and had thus substantially performed that part of the agreement which required them to send a statement of the cost to the defendants. Upon that theory, and to enable the plaintiffs to show that even if the agreement to furnish such statements was to be considered as a condition precedent to a demand of payment, it may be that the evidence was properly admitted; for, it will be borne in mind, it was a statement merely, and not legal evidence, that was to be furnished. In the view I take of a much more important question, however, I deem it unnecessary to express an opinion upon that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">In his charge, the learned justice told the jury sxibstantially that it was for them to determine what the terms of the contract were, and if they should find the agreement to have been that the defendants were to pay such cost as the manufacturers had assigned to the goods on making up their statement, with two dollars per dozen added thereto, then the plaintiffs were entitled to recover; and the verdict,\"undoubtedly, was based upon that direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-15\">As the evidence upon the agreement touching the statements to be fxxrnished to the defendants and the details of the estimates d'f cost which the plaintiffs had entered in their \u201c lot-book,\u201d was exceedingly voluminous and complicated, it is not surprising that the judge should have fallen into the error of supposing, as he evidently did, that some evidence. had been given that the estimate which the plaintiffs had made and placed upon their \u201c lot-book \u201d as the cost of the hats was, by the terms of the contract, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>to be considered and taken as the <em>\u201c </em>cost of manufacture \u201d mentioned therein, and agreed upon. In fact, however, the plaintiff and the defendant who made the agreement both stated, in their testimony, that the price was to be two dollars per dozen over and above the cost; or, rather, to be more exact, the plaintiff said that the price was to be <em>\u201c </em>two dollars per dozen over the cost of manufacture,\u201d while the defendant stated it to be <em>\u201c </em>two dollars a dozen profit, above the costs; \u201d and there was no evidence, so far as I have been able to discover, tending to show that the parties, or either of them, then attached any meaning to the word <em>\u201c </em>cost,\u201d other than its legitimate and usual one. When, therefore, the learned judge told the jury that the plaintiffs had not proved what the actual cost of the goods was, he virtually determined the action in favor of the defendants, and the further direction to the jury, which is the subject of the exception under consideration, was consequently erroneous; and, for that reason, as well as because the court erred in refusing to dismiss the complaint, the judgment should be reversed and a new trial directed, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">I may add, I think, without impropriety, that I am unable to perceive any principle upon which the plaintiffs can be entitled to recover in this action, unless they succeed in proving upon the trial what the goods actually cost, or that the term <em>\u201c </em>cost,\u201d or <em>\u201c </em>cost of manufacture,\u201d as employed by the contracting parties, had, &gt;in the trade, or in mercantile parlance, a definite though technical meaning, different from that which the words themselves impart in their ordinary use. It may be difficult, or even impossible, for them to do this ; but, if so, that will not be the fault of the law or of the court, but that of the plaintiffs themselves, who should have seen to it that their bargain was such an one as they would have the power of enforcing by means of proper proofs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
