Indeed,' this was expressly admitted by the defendants\u2019 counsel on the trial; and there-is just as little doubt but that the Harlem car was going slowly, not trotting nor walking, but a slouching gait, between the two. It is also undisputed that, by the uniform custom and practice of the drivers and conductors of both railroads, the Harlem Company had the right of way.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>How, the evidence on the part of the plaintiff goes to show that the Harlem freight car was much nearer the crossings where the accident occurred when they saw each other, than the Third avenue car.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">This being so, it was gross negligence on the part of the Third avenue car not to stop until the Harlem car had passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Indeed, I fully agree with the plaintiff\u2019s counsel that the accident was the result of a reckless and wicked horse-racing experiment on the part of the Third avenue driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Dooley says (and he is a fair witness) that, when he first discovered the Fourth avenue car, he should judge that he was one hundred and fifty or two hundred feet from it. He says that some distance above the crossing the conductor came out and hurried up the drived, who accordingly whipped his horses, and on this point he is not contradicted. On the contrary, he was corroborated by Morrill, by Berner, and by Pruden in his statement, and he says that in his judgment the forward part of the small car was struck.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Indeed, the learned justice who tried the case at circuit left every point as to which there was any possible doubt or dispute, or which could have any bearing on the question of negligence, to the jury; and no rule is better settled than that which requires to have the issues of negligence submitted to the jury, when it depends upon conflicting evidence, or on inferences to be deduced from a variety of circumstances in regard to which there is room for fair difference of opinion among intelligent men (Wolfkiel <em>v. </em>The Sixth Avenue R.R. Co., 38 N. Y. Rep., 49; Ernst <em>v. </em>Hudson River R.R. Co., 35 N. Y. Rep., 9, and 39 N. Y. Rep., 61).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">It will not be seriously urged that the negligence of the Harlem Company contributed to bring about the collision, and that such negligence is a bar to this action. In discussing this branch of the case, I cannot do better than quote the language of Judge Grover, in the case of Clark <em>v. </em>The Eighth Avenue R.R. Co., 36 N. Y. Rep., 138, where he says: \u201c If the negligence of the defendant contributed to the injury, it is no defence that the negligent act of another contributed thereto, if the injury would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>have occurred but for the negligence of the defendant. The defendant, it is manifest, is only made responsible for the result of his own wrong. That wrong produced the injury, and although it would not have occurred but for the wrongful act of another, that circumstance furnishes no excuse for the defendant so far as an innocent party is concerned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">There is no virtue in the point urged by the defendants to the effect that a new trial, on the ground of surprise, ought to be granted upon the affidavits attached to the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">The evidence of Pruden was offered in rebuttal, and the defendants had no right to open the question again if they had a thousand witnesses present to contradict Pruden when he left the 'stand. The new evidence, therefore, for the introduction of \u25a0which a new trial is sought, is merely cumulative, consequently there is no law for the granting of a new trial on the grounds presented (People <em>v. </em>Superior Court, 10 Wen., 285).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Though a witness proves a fact to the surprise of the other party, and though by mistake he was not cross-examined, nor was evidence given to contradict him or any observation made on his evidence, the court will not grant a new trial. Such was the rule held by Lord Ellenborough in Bell <em>v. </em>Thompson (2 Chitty\u2019s Rep., 194).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Indeed, a verdict is never set aside to give the party an opportunity of impeaching the credit of witnesses sworn at a former trial (Bunn <em>v. </em>Hoyt, 8 John., 255).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">And to set aside a verdict when the testimony is conflicting and the question doubtful, would be not an exercise of discretion, but a gross usurpation of power (Cothran <em>v. </em>Collins, 29 How. Pr. Rep., 155).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">I fully concur with the learned justice who tried the cause where he says that \u201c the law in respect to tire carriers of passengers holds them to the highest responsibility. They are required to exercise the utmost care, and to adopt all known and tested improvements calculated to secure the 'safety of passengers.\u201d Story says : \u201cPassenger-carriers bind themselves to carry safely those whom they take into their coaches, as far as human care. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>and foresight will go, that is, for the utmost care and diligence of very cautious persons.\u201d And this- is the rule laid down in Bowen <em>v. </em>The Central R.R. Co., 18 N. Y. Rep., 410; Maverick <em>v. </em>The Eighth Avenue R.R. Co., 36 N. Y. Rep., 381.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">There is no virtue in the point raised by the defendants to the effect that the plaintiff having been paid by the Harlem company something, such payment has satisfied the claim against the defendants. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The answer to such a proposition is that no evidence was given of any release or receipt of money in satisfaction of damages, or of any written or verbal agreement or understanding to that effect. The court, after fully stating the law, charged the jury that what had been proven did not amount to a discharge of the Harlem .Company, and was not therefore a defence to this action, and in this we fully concur. The rule is-well settled that a release of one of several covenanters will not discharge his eo-covenanters, unless it be a technical release under seal; a parol agreement to release will not have that effect (De Zeng <em>v. </em>Bailey, 8 Wendell, 336).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The order at Special Term granting a new trial should be reversed, and the judgment entered below ordered to stand.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b579-7\">Monell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AcO\">(concurring). Was the verdict in this case against the clear weight of the evidence <em>% </em>The theory of the defendants, were it the only theory in the case, and the theory upon which the case ought to have been disposed of, would give an affirmative answer to the inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">The defendants\u2019 theory is that the collision,, so far as they were concerned, was unavoidable. They claim that, at the point where the car of the Harlem Company was first discovered by the driver of the defendants\u2019 car, it was too late to brake up their car, or to avoid the collision. And they\" claim that the evidence, and their admission at the trial, go no further than to establish that the accelerated speed of the horses was\" to carry the car out of danger, and not into it.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">But, I think, the error of the defendants\u2019 counsel is in claim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>ing that there was no proof of negligence on the part of the defendants, and no want of care <em>before the ear reaehed the point of danger.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">Leaving out of view that there was evidence which would warrant the inference that the driver of the defendants\u2019 car did, or, had he been watchful and attentive to his ..duty, could have seen the approaching car on the other track in season to have escaped the danger (Wolfkiel <em>v. </em>Sixth Av. R.R. Co., 38 N. Y. R., 49, 51), there is much evidence which, although contradicted, was proper for the consideration of the jury, and, if credited by them, sufficient in-its nature to predicate-a verdict upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">At the point wliere the collision occurred, the tracks of the two railroads cross each other at a very acute angle. The distance between the extreme points of danger, as shown at the trial, is about sixty-five feet. That distance it was necessary to traverse on either track to pass out of danger, if the other track was being or likely to be used at the same time. The grade at the crossing is ascending from Fifth to Sixth street. The defendants\u2019 car was passing down upon a descending grade, and the Harlem car up upon an ascending grade. The respective cars-were of different size and weight. The defendants\u2019 car was the smaller and lighter.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">It was well known that at the crossing is a, somewhat crowded part of the city. The business and traffic of the Bowery passes, at that point, into the Third and Fourth avenues. It is also well known that several hundred cars daily pass the crossing upon either track, the average being, probably, one in each three to four minutes until nine or ten at night. The drivers of the several cars, upon the one as well as upon the other, must be presumed to have known the condition of the thoroughfare, the frequent passing of cars, and the distance (by estimation, at least) between the points of danger at the crossing. It is not, therefore, too much to say that, in such a condition of things, a little more than ordinary care, it seems to me, ought to he exercised by'each of these railroad companies. And it is not, perhaps, going too iar to say that the mere fact of a car passing such a point <em>at the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number><em>usual rate of speed, </em>of say five miles an hoar, in the night, when it is difficult to see far, should of itself be enough to impute negligence. Prudence, and a due regard for the safety of passengers, should not be balanced by the few seconds of time gained to a company, in going too rapidly over a place exposed to so great danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">How there was evidence that the defendants\u2019 car, for some considerable time before it reached the crossing, was going at a rapid rate of speed; that the driver was told by the conductor to \u201c hurry up,\u201d that he was behind time. The rapid and unusual rate of speed of the horses of the defendants\u2019 car was testified to by several witnesses. One witness (Dooley) was on the front platform, and said he saw the Harlem car when the defendants\u2019 car was from one hundred and fifty to two hundred feet from it, and that when within fifteen to twenty feet he jumped off. Another witness (Eemer) said the Harlem car was fifteen feet from the crossing when the defendants\u2019 car was one hundred feet above, \u201c coming pretty fast on a down grade.\u201d Another witness (Pruden) said the Harlem car was twenty-five or thirty feet and the defendants\u2019 car one hundred and twenty-four or ofie hundred and twenty-five feet from the place of collision when he first saw them. It was not disputed that the Harlem car was going at a slow rate of speed.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Much of this evidence was contradicted. The driver of the defendants\u2019 car stated that he was only about thirty feet from the Harlem car when he first saw it; that his horses had just entered on the Harlem track; that he then whipped up his horses, hoping to avoid a collision, it being too late to retreat and more dangerous to stop. He said, until he saw the Harlem car, he was going at his usual rate of speed, and in this he was corroborated by other witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Among other things submitted to the jury was this conflicting evidence as to the speed at which the defendants\u2019 car was being driven before it' had reached the crossing, under the instruction that, \u201cif the ear was driven at an unusual rate of speed, <em>and by reason of such rapid speed the collision </em>occurred,\u201d the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>ants yrere liable. There was no assumption in this instruction of a fact not proven, and we have the right, if it were necessary, to presume that the jury founded their verdict solely upon their belief that, for some time previous to reaching the crossing, the defendants\u2019 horses had been driven at an unusually rapid and consequently dangerous rate of speed, which, they were told by the court, if it produced the collision; was negligence. The evidence to support such a conclusion was abundant if the jury believed it, and their verdict proves that they did believe it.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">From the fact that, at the time of the collision, the defendants\u2019 car had passed over eighty-nine feet of the whole distance between the possible points of danger, the defendants insisted that, in the position of the cars at the point of collision, there was time, at the usual rate of speed of the respective cars, for the defendants\u2019 car to have passed if the Harlem car had not increased its speed. The diagrams and the proof undoubtedly show that the defendants\u2019 car was within a few feet of being over the Harlem track, and that fact might tend to establish that it had first entered upon the crossing, were it not that the rapid rate at which some of the witnesses say it was going would enable it to get over the greater space in the shorter time. I am not able to see any thing in these facts going to prove that the driver of the defendants\u2019 car could not, and therefore did not, see the Harlem car until too late to 'escape. If there had been no evidence that he was driving rapidly, and the proof had been that the speed .of the two cars was alike, then the position of the defendants\u2019 car would justify the inference that it was first upon the crossing, and, having proceeded until the other car came in view, it was then too late to stop with safety. But the evidence is hostile to any such inference; and if it was true that the defendants\u2019 car was going very fast for some time before it arrived at the crossing, its having reached the opposite side of the Harlem track when the cars collided is accounted for; and, therefore, whether the driver saw the Harlem car in season to stop is not material upon the question of negligence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number><em>The negligence was in driving too fast for safety at such a place. </em>The negligence of the defendants being the want of ordinary care to avoid the collision, it was competent for the jury to say that such negligence was the too rapid driving of the homes <em>previous </em>to as well as at the time of the collision; and the verdict being general, we cannot say that they did not adopt that theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">Indeed, a careful reading of the whole evidence will, I think, produce the belief that proper care on the part of the driver of the defendants\u2019 car in approaching and driving upon and across the other track would have saved the plaintiff and her fellow-passengers from injury; and it will be doing no injustice to the defendants to say that there was evidence sufficient to justify the jury in finding that the driver saw the large car in time to brake up and avoid the collision, and was bound to do so; and, in the language of the judge, \u201c <em>he had no right to experiment or venture on the probability or possibility of crossing and avoiding the </em>collision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Any concurring negligence on the part of the Harlem Company, it is conceded, will not defeat a recovery against the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">The rule now is, that if upon the whole evidence it would have been proper at the trial to have taken the case from the jury and directed a.verdict, then the Court will set the verdict aside, if found against what such direction should have been (Suydam <em>v. </em>Grand Street, &amp;c., R.R. Co., 41 Barb., 375). The judge who tries the case is best able to judge .of the weight and effect to be given to evidence; and if one of the parties considers it so preponderating in his favor that a verdict against him ought not to stand, it should be his duty <em>to move at the trial </em>to have the verdict directed in his favor, and should not afterward be allowed to raise any question as to the sufficiency of the evidence, for the first time, on a motion for a new trial, for the same reason that it is too late to object on appeal that contested questions of fact should have been passed upon by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>But I am satisfied that it would have been clearly erroneous to have taken this case from the jury, and therefore the verdict must be allowed to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">Approving of the views expressed by my associate upon the other questions raised by the defendants, I concur in reversing the order appealed from, and in directing judgment to'be entered on the verdict.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
