In \u00a1November, 1867, plaintiff held an auction sale of certain farm produce, stock, and farming utensils, before then belonging to the estate of which she was administratrix. The defendant, a neighboring farmer, sent two of his hired men to purchase for him property at this public auction. One of them purchased, and had struck off to him, for the defendant, various articles of property, to the amount in all of eight hundred and. fifty-eight dollars and thirty-five cents; and the other purchased and had struck off to him, at the sale, articles to the amount of ninety-one dollars and ninety-five cents. All -the articles, so purchased, were delivered and taken to the defendant\u2019s farm, and used thereon. The defendant acknowledged his liability for articles to the value of eight hundred and thirty-six dollars and forty cents, but refused to pay for the balance, about one hundred and fourteen dollars, alleging that the purchase of those articles was wholly unauthorized by him. He so testified, and the two hired men corroborated him in that respect on the trial. There was some evidence tending to show that the hired men.had discretionary authority as to what they should purchase on defendant\u2019s account; also some evidence tending to show that all the property, including the articles in dispute, was bid. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>off in the name of defendant, by the hired men,, respectively, and defendant\u2019s name given to the auctioneer as the purchaser; and that afterward defendant ratified these acts of his agents, and agreed to pay. The preponderance of evidence, however, was the other way.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-5\">The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff for the full amount claimed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-6\">The defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b387-7\"><em>Mr. James A. Seaman </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-9\">The verdict was against evidence, and should be set aside.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-10\">The sale of the goods in question was at auction, and there is no doubt that the defendant was not present at the sale. He can be charged with the amount in dispute only by establishing either that the goods which he denied having purchased were bought by his agents authorized to buy them, or that he agreed to become responsible for their purchases as his own.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-11\">There was no original authority to purchase the goods in question shown by the testimony. Both of the men who are alleged to have bought them for the defendant, while testifying that they had been authorized by him to buy <em>some </em>things, srich as hay, oats, &amp;c., deny that they were authorized to buy the goods in dispute, and state that they bought those things for themselves, gave their own names in at the sale, and were personally charged with them by the auctioneer. There was no testimony by which these statements .are contradicted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-12\">The jury could have had no right to interpret any thing in the conversation or acts of defendant as amounting to an acceptance by him of the purchases in question as his own, and as a.promise to pay for the goods so bought; such a promise would have been within the statute of frauds. The Judge\u2019s charge was explicit on this point. Tet, as the proof is all to the effect that the defendant did not authorize the purchase, the jury must have founded their verdict upon some such supposed subsequent assumption of the debt by him.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b388-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number><em>Mr. Alfred Roe </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-5\">No exception having been taken to the charge of the Justice this Court will review only the exceptions taken to certain parts of the evidence relative to questions of law, and none of such exceptions are well taken.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b388-6\">\n<em>By the Court:</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"b388-7\">Fithian, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Azu\">In the opinion of the Justice before whom the cause was tried, there was a sufficient conflict of evidence on those points to send the case to the jury. The case was so submitted in a very clear charge, to which no exception was taken by either party. The jury were instructed' substantially that in order to find a verdict for the plaintiff, they must be satisfied from the evidence, either that defendant Conger authorized the purchase of the articles in dispute, or that they were purchased on his account, and he afterward ratified the act. <em>&gt;</em></p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">By finding for the plaintiff the full amount of her claim, the jury must have found one or both of the above propositions against the defendant. I cannot say there is such a preponderance of evidence against it as to justify the court in reversing the decision of a jury on question of fact, especially where the amount in controversy is so small.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
