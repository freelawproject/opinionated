The General Term will not, upon appeal from the judgment, make such corrections in the first instance.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b219-7\">Before Barbour, C.J., Fithian and Freedman, JJ.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b219-8\"><em>[Decided May </em>11, 1869.]</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-9\">This case was tried before Chief-Justice Robertson and a jury, and was brought to recover goods and chattels belonging to the plaintiff, and alleged to be wrongfully detained by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-10\">The defendant admitted the possession of the goods, but alleged that they were deposited with him by one William B. Sluyter, the husband of the plaintiff, he agreeing to pay forty dollars per month for the storage of the same. Defendant further alleged that no part of said money due for storage had been paid or tendered by said William B. Sluyter or the plaintiff, and that he was ready to deliver the same upon payment of his charges for storage. Upon the plaintiff resting her case, the defendant\u2019s counsel moved to dismiss the complaint upon\u2019 the ground that no demand for the goods had been made upon the defendant by the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-11\">The Court granted the motion, to which ruling the plaintiff excepted:</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b219-12\"><em>Mr. George W.

It was incumbent on the\" plaintiff to prove a sufficient demand \"as a part of his case, and as the evidence is totally insufficient upon this point, no error has been committed upon the trial in dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. In the case relied on by the plaintiff (6 Hill, 613), the goods had been wrongfully <em>taken, </em>and for that reason no previous demand was held to be necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">If the judgment entered is irregular in form, the plaintiff\u2019s remedy is by motion at Special Term, and the General Term will not, upon appeal, make the corrections in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">The judgment appealed from should be affirmed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
