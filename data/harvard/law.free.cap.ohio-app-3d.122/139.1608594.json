Because appellant\u2019s case was not prejudiced by the actions of the trial court, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-11\">Appellant, Daniel E., was charged with delinquency in violation of R.C. 2151.02, based upon one count of rape (R.C. 2907.02[A][2]) and One count of abduction (R.C. 2905.02[A][2]).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-12\">The trial court judge assigned to appellant\u2019s case had just previously conducted the adjudication and disposition of a co-defendant. On the first day of appellant\u2019s adjudicatory hearing, appellant orally moved that the trial judge recuse himself because of the personal knowledge gained during the co-defendant\u2019s judicial proceeding. The trial court denied the motion, proceeded to trial, and found appellant delinquent.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-13\">Appellant now appeals setting forth the following sole assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-14\">\u201cThe Trial Court committed reversible error when it overruled the defense motion to recuse the Trial Judge pursuant to Code of Judicial Conduct 3(C)(1)(a), because the Trial Judge applied the \u2018personal knowledge\u2019 standard in 3(C)(1)(a), rather than the overall standard of \u2018A judge should disqualify himself in a proceeding in which his impartiality'might reasonably be questioned\u2019 found in 3(C) as required in the case of <em>Liteky v. United States </em>(1994) [510 U.S. 540 at 547-548, 114 S.Ct. 1147 at 1153-1154], 127 L.Ed.2d 474 at 486.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-15\">A judge need not recuse himself on the basis that he acquired knowledge of the facts during a prior proceeding. <em>State v. D'Ambrosio </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 185, 188, 616 N.E.2d 909, 912-913. What a judge learns in his judicial capacity, whether from pretrial proceedings, co-defendant pleas, or evidence presented in a prior case, is properly considered as judicial observations and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>creates no personal bias requiring recusal. <em>Id. </em>In this case, the mere fact that the same trial court judge presided over separate proceedings involving both appellant and a co-defendant does not require the judge to disqualify himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Appellant also argues that the judge\u2019s refusal to accept appellant\u2019s offer of a plea bargain is evidence of the trial court\u2019s bias. However, it is well settled that the decision of whether to accept a plea bargain rests within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Akron v. Ragsdale </em>(1978), 61 Ohio App.2d 107, 109, 15 O.O.3d 107,108, 399 N.E.2d 119, 120-121.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Therefore, having fully reviewed the record, we conclude that the trial court judge was not required to recuse himself, since the prior knowledge was acquired in a judicial proceeding and was not the type of personal information encompassed by Canon 3 of the Judicial Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">Accordingly, appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">The judgment of the Sandusky County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, is affirmed. Court costs of this appeal are assessed to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b173-10\">Glasser and Knepper, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
