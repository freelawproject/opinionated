Relator requested that respondents city and chief of police make available the \u201cStrike Plan\u201d and related records prepared in connection with the possible strike by teachers employed by the Cleveland Board of Education (\u201cschool board\u201d). After respondents refused to release these records, relator commenced this action in mandamus pursuant to R.C. 149.43. Relator requests that this court compel respondents to release the disputed records.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-10\">By entry dated November 19, 1996, this court granted relator\u2019s application for alternative writ and ordered that respondents submit disputed records under seal. We also established a briefing schedule. Having reviewed the briefs of the parties and the records submitted under seal, we deny relator\u2019s request for a writ of mandamus compelling respondents to make the disputed records available to relator.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-11\">\u201cPublic record\u201d is defined in R.C. 149.43(A)(1) as \u201cany record that is kept by any public office, including * * * city * * * units, except * * * confidential law enforcement investigatory records * * * and records the release of which is prohibited by state or federal law.\u201d R.C. 149.43(A)(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-12\">\u201c \u2018Confidential law enforcement investigatory record\u2019 means any record that pertains to a law enforcement matter of a criminal, quasi-criminal, civil, or administrative nature, but only to the extent that the release of the record would create a high probability of disclosure of any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-13\">\u201c :|i * :|:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-14\">\u201c(c) Specific confidential investigatory techniques or procedures * * *;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-15\">\u201c(d) Information that would endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel, a crime victim, a witness, or a confidential information source.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>The primary argument asserted by respondents is that the disputed records contain \u201cspecific confidential investigatory techniques or procedures.\u201d Additionally, respondents contend that the records contain information the release of which \u201ccould endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel and others,\u201d as well as material the release of which is prohibited by state law because it is protected by the attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">Attached to the brief of respondents is the affidavit of Ronald R. James, Sr., Deputy Chief for Special Operations of the Division of Police, who states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-5\">\u201c4. To the Affiant\u2019s knowledge the strike plan and the related documents contain all specific procedures, plans and techniques necessary to accomplish the mission and goal of the Division of Police in the event of a labor strike with Cleveland Public Schools.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-6\">\u201c5. To the Affiant\u2019s knowledge, the mission and goal of the Cleveland Police in the event of a labor strike with Cleveland Public Schools, is the [sic ] prevent criminal activity and maintain public order and safety. To the Affiant\u2019s knowledge, information and belief, the ability of the Respondent, the Cleveland Division <em>[sic </em>] Police to accomplish its\u2019 [sic ] mission and goals will be severely harmed unless this Court denies the relief requested by the Relator C.P.P.A.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">Relator has not presented any evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">Respondents state in their brief that the \u201cStrike Plan\u201d is a police contingency plan which is intended to prevent crime as well as maintain public order and safety. Respondents also assert that these records contain \u201cthe specific techniques, procedures and other information that the police utilize to prevent crime and maintain public order and safety.\u201d Respondents\u2019 Brief, at 4. Respondents contend, therefore, that the \u201cStrike Plan\u201d and related records are \u201cspecific confidential investigatory techniques or procedures\u201d which are exempt from disclosure under R.C. 149.43(A)(2)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">Respondents acknowledge that the issue of whether the disputed records contain \u201cspecific confidential investigatory techniques or procedures\u201d is a matter of first impression. As a consequence, we must utilize the established analytical framework for public records cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-10\">R.C. 149.43(B) requires that public records be made available for inspection and copying. If, however, a governmental unit refuses to make records available, the aggrieved party may challenge that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-11\">\u201cMandamus is the appropriate remedy to compel compliance with R.C. 149.43. <em>State ex rel. Steckman v. Jackson </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 420, 426, 639 N.E.2d 83, 89. Exceptions to disclosure are strictly construed against the custodian of the public records, and the burden to establish an exception is on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>custodian. <em>State ex rel. Multimedia, Inc. v. Snowden </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 141, 142, 647 N.E.2d 1374, 1377.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Yant v. Conrad </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 681, 682, 660 N.E.2d 1211, 1213.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">\u201cExempting records from release under R.C. 149.43(A)(2) involves a two-step analysis: (1) Is the record a confidential law enforcement record? and (2) Would release of the record create a high probability of disclosure of any of the four types of information specified in R.C. 149.43(A)(2)? <em>[State ex rel. Multimedia, Inc. v. Snowden </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 141, 142, 647 N.E.2d 1374, 1377].\u201d <em>Yant, supra </em>at 684, 660 N.E.2d at 1214.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Relator\u2019s response to respondents\u2019 position focuses on the second step of the analysis. That is, relator argues that the plain language of R.C. 149.43(A)(2)(c) requires that records exempt from disclosure under the \u201cspecific confidential investigatory techniques or procedures\u201d exception must pertain to an \u201cinvestigation.\u201d Implicit in relator\u2019s position is the assumption that the meaning of the word \u201cinvestigation\u201d does not include planning for future events. This assumption is not well -founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">R.C. 1.42 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-7\">\u201cWords and phrases shall be read in context and construed according to the rules of grammar and common usage. Words and phrases that have acquired a technical or. particular meaning, whether by legislative definition or otherwise, shall be construed accordingly.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-8\">\u201cInvestigatory\u201d is not defined in the Revised Code. Pursuant to R.C. 1.42, therefore, we must consider the common usage of the word \u201cinvestigatory.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-9\">Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1993) indicates that \u201cinvestigatory\u201d is synonymous with \u201cinvestigative.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1189-1190. \u201cInvestigative\u201d is defined as \u201cof or relating to an investigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1189. The definition of \u201cinvestigation\u201d includes: \u201c1: the action or process of investigating: detailed examination: STUDY, RESEARCH * * *. 2: a searching inquiry: EXAMINATION, SURVEY.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Synonyms capitalized in original.) The definition of \u201cstudy\u201d includes \u201ca careful examination or analysis of a phenomenon, development, or question usu. within a limited area of investigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2268.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-10\">Obviously, none of these definitions is limited to consideration of events which have already occurred. Furthermore, the definition of \u201cstudy\u201d as \u201ca careful examination or analysis * * * of a question\u201d clearly indicates that a \u201cstudy\u201d or \u201cinvestigation\u201d may involve preparation for circumstances which have yet to occur. For example, the phrase \u201cinvestigate the possibility of\u2019 is commonplace. We hold, therefore, that records pertaining to a police contingency plan that is intended to prevent crime as well as maintain public order and safety are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>exempt from disclosure as \u201cspecific confidential investigatory techniques or procedures\u201d under R.C. 149.43(A)(2)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">We have reviewed the records submitted \u2022 under seal by respondents. All of these records are \u2014 in their entirety \u2014 exempt from disclosure as \u201cspecific confidential investigatory techniques or procedures\u201d under R.C. 149.43(A)(2)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Relator also opposes respondents\u2019 contention that these records are exempt from release under R.C. 149.43(A)(2)(d) as \u201c[i]nformation that would endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel, a crime victim, a witness, or a confidential information source.\u201d In support of its position, relator cites <em>State ex rel. Jenkins v. Cleveland </em>(1992), 82 Ohio App.3d 770, 613 N.E.2d 652. In <em>Jenkins, </em>the city of Cleveland asserted that the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of the victim\u2019s relatives fell within the public safety exception in R.C. 149.43(A)(2)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">The circumstances in this case are distinguishable from <em>Jenkins. </em>If the disputed records were made available, any person could have prior knowledge of the deployment of law enforcement personnel at a time of potential civic unrest. This is precisely the kind of \u201c[/Information that would endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel.\u201d As a consequence, the disputed records are exempt from disclosure pursuant to R.C. 149.43(A)(2)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">Respondents also contend that certain portions of the disputed records are exempt from release pursuant to the attorney-client privilege. Relator requests that this court conduct an <em>in camera </em>inspection to determine whether the attorney-client privilege is applicable to these records.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">Attached to respondents\u2019 brief is the affidavit of an attorney for the school board, in which he avers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-9\">\u201cIn the Affiant\u2019s capacity as legal counsel to the Cleveland BOE [Board of Education] [he] drafted four documents for the purpose of giving legal advice in the event of a teachers\u2019s [sic ] strike. The four documents are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-10\">\u201ca) A memorandum dated Sept 3, 1996 concerning a meeting between certain City and BOE officials.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-11\">\u201cb) A memorandum regarding Labor Dispute Instructions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-12\">\u201ce) The BOE/CPS [Board of Education/Cleveland Public Schools] Strike Activities Calendar.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-13\">\u201cd) The BOE/CPS Educational Program for Schools and Staff Personnel to be Utilized.\u201d Affidavit of Bradley A. Sherman, paragraph 3 (capitalization in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>The records submitted under seal are (1) the \u201cStrike Plan\u201d and (2) a memorandum with attachments. Respondents refer to the memorandum as the \u201cCPSS memorandum.\u201d As respondents note in their brief, some of the records described in the Sherman affidavit are included in both the \u201cStrike Plan\u201d and \u201cCPSS memorandum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Given the uncontroverted averments in the Sherman affidavit, these records qualify for the attorney-client privilege. As a consequence, the attorney-client privilege exempts these records from release.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Accordingly, relator\u2019s request for relief in mandamus is denied. This court will reseal the records submitted to it. Relator to pay costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">\n<em>Writ denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b734-8\">James D. Sweeney, C.J., and Nahra, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
