Appellant, Ashley Pulford, putative father, appeals from an order determining that he was not legally entitled to share in the proceeds from any wrongful death distribution emanating from the death of decedent Kevin Pulford, he was not entitled to anything from decedent\u2019s estate, and his name was to be stricken from the form listing decedent\u2019s next of kin, legatees, and devisees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">On January 29, 1996, decedent, born October 19, 1995, was traveling with his mother, Adrea Bontrager, and grandmother in an automobile. Decedent was sitting in a child restraint seat and began to cry. Bontrager removed decedent from the child restraint seat and held him in her lap. The vehicle was then involved in an accident that resulted in decedent\u2019s death. Decedent died intestate.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">On March 28, 1996, Bontrager filed her application for authority to administer decedent\u2019s estate. That same day, she filed a list of decedent\u2019s survivors, including appellant, the purported father of decedent, who would be entitled to inherit under the statute of descent and distribution. On April 19, 1996, Bontrager filed a motion to remove appellant\u2019s name from the next-of-kin form, since, as stipulated by the parties, appellant failed to satisfy the legal prerequisites to be named the legal father of decedent. In a motion filed on May 21,1996, appellant requested that Bontrager be removed as administrator of decedent\u2019s estate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In a judgment entry dated July 24, 1996, the court below overruled Bontrager\u2019s application to administer decedent\u2019s estate because she had potential conflicts that precluded her from being a qualified applicant. Although both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>appellant and Bontrager testified that appellant was decedent\u2019s father, the probate court held that since appellant had failed to take the necessary steps to be recognized as the legal father of decedent, his name should be removed from the next-of-kin form. Furthermore, the court held that appellant could not share in the proceeds from any wrongful death action triggered by decedent\u2019s death and that appellant could not receive any distribution from decedent\u2019s estate. The court appointed appellee, William C. Hofstetter, to serve as the administrator of decedent\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">From this judgment entry, appellant asserts the following assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-6\">\u201c[1.] The trial court erred when it granted Adrea Bontrager\u2019s motion to amend the next-of-kin form.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-7\">\u201c[2.] The trial court erred when it determined that [appellant] was not entitled to participate in any wrongful death distribution since that issue was not properly before the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">Since appellee argues that the judgment entry in this matter is not a final appealable order, we will address that issue before proceeding to the merits of appellant\u2019s appeal. R.C. 2505.02 provides that \u201can order that affects a substantial right made in a special proceeding\u201d is a final appealable order. The Supreme Court of Ohio has held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-9\">\u201cOrders that are entered in actions that were recognized at common law or in equity and were not specially created by statute are not orders entered in special proceedings pursuant to R.C. 2505.02.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Polikoff v. Adam </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 100, 616 N.E.2d 213, syllabus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">In an attempt to clarify the <em>Polikoff </em>syllabus, the Supreme Court of Ohio has stated that \u201c[u]nder <em>Polikoff, </em>it is the underlying <em>action </em>that must be examined to determine whether an order was entered in a special proceeding.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) Walters v. The Enrichment Ctr. of Wishing Well, Inc. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 118, 121-122, 676 N.E.2d 890, 893-894.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-11\">In the present case, there are two separate actions involved in the court\u2019s order that require analysis under <em>Polikoff. </em>The first action relates to appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, in which appellant argues that the trial court erred in determining that appellant could not share in any distribution from decedent\u2019s estate. In determining whether this order is final and appealable, our inquiry is whether the procedure for determining a decedent\u2019s next of kin was recognized at common law or in equity. <em>Polikoff.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>\u201cThe \u2018common law1 is all the statutory and case law background of England and the American colonies before the American revolution. * * * \u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6 Ed.1990) 276. The Supreme Court of the United States has stated that Blackstone\u2019s Commentaries is the most reliable source on the common law of England. <em>Schick v. United States </em>(1904), 195 U.S. 65, 69, 24 S.Ct. 826, 827, 49 L.Ed. 99. Blackstone recognized that at common law, a decedent\u2019s next of kin was determined by \u25a0 calculating a person\u2019s degree of consanguinity to the decedent. Blackstone\u2019 Commentaries on the Law (Gavit Ed.1941) 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Furthermore, although some aspects of estate administration were within the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts of England, some of the issues were resolved in that country\u2019s common-law courts. A leading text has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-6\">\u201cJurisdiction over decedents\u2019 estates was divided between the common law courts and the ecclesiastical courts. The common law courts, a part of the royal judicial system, decided cases involving the distribution and use of real property. The ecclesiastical courts, a part of the judicial system of the Roman Catholic Church, decided cases involving the distribution and use of personal property. * * * \u201d (Footnote omitted.) Ritchie, Alford, Effland &amp; Dobris, Cases and Materials on Decedents\u2019 Estates and Trusts (1993) 6. See, also, Simes &amp; Basye, The Organization of the Probate Court in America: I (1944), 42 Mich.L.Rev. 965, 968.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">Those facets of estate administration not within the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts were within the authority of either the common-law courts or the chancery courts. Simes at 967. Thus, the administration of estates was not conducted' solely in ecclesiastical courts, but rather occurred in both the cdmmonlaw courts and courts of equity in England. Therefore, to declare that estate administration is not a part of the English common law would require an erroneously narrow definition of the common law. Consequently, the administration of decedents\u2019 estates was recognized at common law and in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">Since the procedure for determining a decedent\u2019s next of kin was recognized at common law, the process is not a special proceeding under the <em>Polikoff </em>definition. Therefore, the order striking appellant\u2019s name from the next-of-kin form was not a final appealable order. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is dismissed for lack of a final appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">In the second assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred in finding that appellant was not legally entitled to share in any wrongful death distribution brought as a result of decedent\u2019s death. Again, before reaching the merits of this assignment, we are compelled to address the. question of whether this holding is a final appealable order ripe for appellate review. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>Unlike the procedure for determining the next of kin, the wrongful death action was statutorily created in Ohio in 1851 and was not recognized at common law. <em>Sabol v. Pekoc </em>(1947), 148 Ohio St. 545, 551-552, 36 O.O. 182, 184-185, 76 N.E.2d 84, 87-88; McCormac, Wrongful Death in Ohio (1982) 1, Section 1.01. Therefore, the probate court\u2019s order that appellant was not entitled to any wrongful death distribution is also an order made in a special proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\"> Our next inquiry is whether the order stating that appellant could not share in the proceeds from a wrongful death action affected a substantial right of appellant. R.C. 2505.02. The Supreme Court of Ohio has held that \u201c[a]n order which affects a substantial right has been perceived to be one which, if not immediately appealable, would foreclose appropriate relief in the future.\u201d <em>Bell v. Mt. Sinai Med. Ctr. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 60, 63, 616 N.E.2d 181, 184.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">In th\u00e9 present case, appellant\u2019s right to share in the proceeds from the wrongful death action depends entirely upon his name being included among the next of kin so that he would be a potential beneficiary of the action. Without being listed as a beneficiary on the next-of-kin form, appellant would not be entitl\u00e9d to notice of the settlement of the wrongful death claim, and would have no further opportunity to share in the wrongful death proceeds. McCormac at 155-156, Section 10.03. Therefore, the order striking appellant\u2019s name from the next-of-kin form affects a substantial right of appellant. Consequently, that portion of the order is final and appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">In the second assignment of error, appellant argues that the probate court erred in concluding that appellant was not entitled to share in the proceeds of a wrongful death action resulting from decedent\u2019s death. Appellant basically relies upon R.C. 3111.03, which sets forth the circumstances under which a man is presumed to be the natural father of a child. Appellant argues that the policy behind R.C. 3111.03 is to avoid fraud by potential heirs and that this policy is not served by rigidly applying statutory paternity requirements in the present case because both Bontrager and appellant testified that appellant was decedent\u2019s natural father.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">In <em>Ginter v. Woodell </em>(May 17, 1988), Clark App. No. 2392, unreported, 1988 WL 53919, the Second District Court of Appeals addressed a similar issue. In <em>Ginter, </em>the mother, who was in her seventh month of pregnancy, was killed in an automobile accident, and the child was stillborn. The mother and putative father were not married. When the administrator of the decedent\u2019s estate sought approval for settlement of the mother\u2019s wrongful death settlement, the probate court determined that the father had not established a parental relationship for purposes of receiving wrongful death proceeds. The court of appeals affirmed and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>\u201cWe agree with the trial court that the word \u2018parent\u2019 as used in R.C. 2125.02 contemplates that a legal parent-child relationship had existed at the time of the wrongful death of the child. Since the [putative father] failed to demonstrate that such a legal relationship existed between [the child] and himself, the court properly denied [the putative father\u2019s] right to participate in the wrongful death proceeds. * * * \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">However, the Supreme Court of Ohio has recently held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-6\">\u201cA child born out of wedlock is not foreclosed from recovering damages for the wrongful death of his or her putative father, simply because paternity had not been acknowledged, adjudicated or otherwise established during the putative father\u2019s lifetime. Paternity may be established after the death of the decedent in order to permit an illegitimate child recovery under the Wrongful Death Act for the wrongful death of his or her father.\u201d <em>Brookbank v. Gray </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 279, 658 N.E.2d 724, paragraph two of the syllabus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">The <em>Brookbank </em>court also stated that \u201c[t]he term \u2018children,\u2019 as used in R.C. 2125.02(A)(1), includes all natural or adopted children, <em>whether legitimate, legitimated, acknowledged or illegitimate.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">Thus, <em>Brookbank </em>emphatically rejected <em>Ginter'</em>s reliance upon the technical distinction between establishing the parent-child relationship before or after the putative father\u2019s death. Therefore, although <em>Brookbank </em>addressed the rights of an illegitimate child to receive a distribution from wrongful death proceeds stemming from the father\u2019s death, we find that its rationale is applicable to the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">In the present case, appellant admits that he failed to satisfy the technical requirements to establish a parent-child relationship. However, after decedent\u2019s death, both appellant and decedent\u2019s mother, Bontrager, testified that appellant was decedent\u2019s natural father. Additionally, it is uncontroverted that appellant and Bontrager were the natural parents of three other children. Furthermore, appellant, acting on the assumption that he was decedent\u2019s father, visited decedent several times before decedent\u2019s death. Therefore, pursuant to the Supreme Court of Ohio\u2019s reasoning in <em>Brookbank, </em>we hold that a father who has failed to legally establish a parent-child relationship during the child\u2019s lifetime may receive a distribution from the wrongful death proceeds awarded as a result of his child\u2019s death when there is no controversy concerning the father\u2019s paternity-</p>\n<p id=\"b130-10\">Therefore, the probate court erred in holding that appellant was not legally entitled to receive wrongful death proceeds awarded as a result of decedent\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is dismissed for lack of a final appealable order and appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is well taken. The judgment of the Geauga County Court of Common Pleas, Probate Division, is reversed, and this cause is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b131-6\">Christley and Nader, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b126-12\">.
