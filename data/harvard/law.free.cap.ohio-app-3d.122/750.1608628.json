Forester assigns the following error for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-11\">I. \u201cThe trial court erred [in] adopting the appellee\u2019s proposed decision and entry when the county human services department did not prove clearly and convincingly that the appellant intended to commit an intentional food stamp program violation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-12\">Mary Forester was the \u201cprimary information person\u201d for a food stamp assistance group consisting of Forester, Forester\u2019s disabled husband, and the couple\u2019s children and stepchildren. On June 18, 1992, Forester executed a required semiannual eligibility reapplication form which indicated that Forester\u2019s family, <em>i.e., </em>her \u201cassistance group,\u201d had no earned income.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-13\">On June 25, 1992 Forester\u2019s daughter Loretta, a member of Forester\u2019s assistance group, became employed. On December 17, 1992, Forester executed a reapplieation form, which once again indicated that Forester\u2019s assistance group had no earned income. Subsequently, the Meigs County Department of Human Services<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (\u201cCDHS\u201d) discovered that Forester\u2019s daughter had earned $3,317.11 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>while residing in Forester\u2019s household, resulting in a food stamp overissuance of $727.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">On May 5, 1995, Forester was mailed a Form DHS 4026, \u201cWaiver of Administrative Disqualification Hearing,\u201d advising her that CDHS was accusing her of an intentional food stamp program violation, based upon her failure to report employment and earned income of a member of her assistance group.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">An administrative disqualification hearing was held, via telephone, before a hearing officer of the Ohio Department of Human Services on August 10, 1995. The following day, August 11, 1995, the hearing officer issued a recommendation that CDHS\u2019s determination, that Forester had committed an intentional program violation, be upheld. The hearing authority adopted the hearing officer\u2019s recommendation, issuing a final administrative decision and order disqualifying Forester from the food stamp program for six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">On September 8, 1995, Forester filed a timely notice of appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of Meigs County. Following receipt of briefs, the trial court, on September 19, 1996, filed a proposed decision and entry affirming the decision of the Department of Human Services. Forester filed notice of the instant appeal on October 21, 1996.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">On appeal from a judgment of an administrative agency, the court of common pleas is limited to determining whether the judgment is supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence and is in accordance with law. R.C. 119.12; <em>Kennedy v. Marion Correctional Inst. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 20, 21-22, 630 N.E.2d 324, 325-327; <em>Pons v. Ohio State Med. Bd. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 619, 621, 614 N.E.2d 748, 750-751; <em>Wright v. Ohio Dept. of Human Serv. </em>(Mar. 26, 1993), Washington App. No. 92CA15, unreported, 1993 WL 97791. Our review is more limited' than that of the trial court. We determine only whether the trial court has abused its discretion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Kennedy, Pons, </em>and <em>Wright, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">In the instant case, Forester does not dispute that an overissuance occurred or that the overissuance must be repaid. Rather, Forester disputes the determination regarding her culpability, <em>ie., </em>Forester argues that the overissuance was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>attributable to household inadvertence as opposed to an intentional program violation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Specifically, Forester argues that the Department of Human Services failed to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that the overissuance resulted from an intentional program violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">The standards for determining whether an individual has committed an intentional program violation are set forth in Section 273.16(c), Title 7, C.F.R., which provides, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-6\">\u201c[I]ntentional Program violations shall consist of having <em>intentionally: </em>(1) Made a false or misleading statement, or misrepresented, concealed or .withheld facts, or (2) committed any act that constitutes a violation of the Food Stamp Act, the Food Stamp Program Regulations, or any State statute relating to the use, presentation, transfer, acquisition, receipt, or possession of food stamp coupons or ATP\u2019s.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">The intent to commit an intentional program violation must be proven by clear and convincing evidence. Section 273.16(e)(6), Title 7, C.F.R. provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-8\">\u201cThe hearing authority shall base the determination of intentional Program violation on <em>dear and convincing evidence </em>which demonstrates that the household member(s) committed, and <em>intended </em>to commit, intentional Program violation as defined in paragraph (c) of this section.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">While we believe that the evidence in the record clearly and convincingly establishes that an overissuance occurred, we find that the evidence is insufficient, as a matter of law, to meet CDHS\u2019s heavy burden of establishing, <em>by clear and convincing evidence, </em>that Forester <em>intended </em>to commit an <em>intentional </em>Program violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-10\">At the disqualification hearing, CDHS called a single witness, Dan Tobin, a CDHS social program administrator. Tobin testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-11\">\u201cThe statement of facts on this ease are that on June 18th, 1992 Mary Forester completed a redetermination application. Among her household members was her daughter, Loretta Smith.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>\u201cOn June 25th, 1992, Loretta Smith became employed by The Kroger Company. This employment was not reported to the Meigs County Department of Human Services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-5\">\u201cOn December 17th, 1992, Mary Forester completed a redetermination interview, failed to \u2014 she continued to fail reporting Loretta Smith\u2019s employment, and an IVES match was received. A gross earned income of $3,317.11 was received by Loretta Smith from the date her employment began until she left Mary Forester\u2019s household.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-6\">\u201cMary Forester stated she reported Loretta Smith\u2019s employment when she became employed to this agency and that she also told Loretta to report her income. The failure of Mary Forester to report the earned income and employment of Loretta Smith resulted in a food stamp overpayment of $727.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-7\">\u201cOn May 5th, 1995, an ODHS 4026 was mailed to Mary Forester.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-8\">\u201cOn May 8th, 1995, Mary Forester telephoned this agency regarding this form. She said that she reported when Loretta Smith became employed but admitted she reported no changes during a subsequent redetermination interview. On June 8th, 1995, Mary Forester telephoned this agency, said she had a problem with the word \u2018intentional\u2019 and would not be signing the waiver.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-9\">\u201cLet\u2019s see. Basically, Loretta Smith became employed on June 25th, \u201992, and this employment was never reported to the Meigs County Department of Human Services and it was discovered through an IVES match.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-10\">\u201cThat\u2019s basically it, except for the exhibits * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-11\">\u201cI have nothing else to add at this time. Basically, what we have is, you know, a situation that has occurred and, you know, Mary says she reported it, but we have no record of that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-12\">In addition to Tobin\u2019s testimony, CDHS submitted nine exhibits, consisting of (1) a one-page agency-generated claim report, undated; (2) a twenty-nine-page June 18, 1992 redetermination application signed by Forester; (3) a one-page notice of verification/penalty warning dated June 18, 1992 and signed by Forester; (4) a twenty-five-page December 17, 1992 redetermination application signed by Forester;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (5) a one-page notice of verification/penalty warning dated December 17, 1992 and signed by Forester; (6) wage and employment verification information for Loretta Smith consisting of four pages; (7) a one-page statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>dated April 4, 1995 and signed by Forester;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (8) seven pages of \u201cRUNNING RECORD COMMENTS,\u201d which appear to be CDHS computer entries, covering the period June 5, 1992 through September 7, 1993; and (9) a \u201cWaiver of Administrative Disqualification Hearing\u201d form, dated May 5,1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">Forester, who was unrepresented at the hearing, presented no exhibits, but did testify on her own behalf. Forester testified that she called CDHS when her daughter began working and was informed that the agency would need to be provided with a copy of her daughter\u2019s first paycheck. Forester subsequently spoke with her daughter on three occasions regarding the matter and was assured each time that a copy of her daughter\u2019s check had been provided to CDHS. Forester further testified that she could not recall whether she was actually asked at her December, 1992 reapplication interview if her daughter was employed. All she recalled was being asked if anything in the household had changed. Believing that the agency was already aware of her daughter\u2019s employment, Forester replied that nothing had changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">\u25a0 Based upon the forgoing evidence, the hearing officer found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-7\">\u201cFacts indicate the appellant completed a food stamp reapplication interview on December 17, 1995 [sic ]. The application signed by the appellant indicates the appellant answered \u2018no\u2019 to the specific question in regards to whether the appellant\u2019s daughter was currently employed (page 15 of exhibit 4).<footnotemark>[9]</footnotemark> The agency became aware of the employment/income through data match. It is the judgement of the hearing officer that this false and misleading statement given to the agency and signed by the appellant in the reapplication on December 17, 1992, is clear and convincing evidence that the appellant has committed and intended to commit an intentional program violation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">The trial court affirmed, finding that \u201cthe testimony presented was reliable, substantial and probative enough to satisfy Ohio Adm. Code 5101:6-20-16 as was the documentary evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>Proof of affirmative misrepresentation is not necessary to establish an intentional program violation. Failure to report earnings (sans affirmative misrepresentation), if proven by clear and convincing evidence to be an intentional concealment or withholding of facts, would constitute an intentional program violation. By definition, however, not every failure to report earnings is an intentional program violation. See <em>Smith v. Dept. of Health &amp; Rehab. Serv. </em>(Fla.App. 1 Dist.1988), 522 So.2d 956, 959. .(\u201cMere failure to report income does not establish by clear and convincing evidence that there was intent to commit an intentional program violation.\u201d) Thus, to establish an intentional program violation, CDHS was required to show more than a simple failure by Forester to report earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">One of the most direct ways to establish an intentional program violation would have been to show an affirmative misrepresentation, <em>i.e., </em>to prove that Forester consciously lied at the December 1992 interview about her daughter\u2019s employment status. If Forester had lied, CDHS could easily have established this through the affidavit or testimony of the case worker who conducted the interview or, perhaps, by presenting evidence as to the manner in which the form would have been completed at the time of the interview. See, <em>e.g., Frank v. Ohio Dept. of Human Serv. </em>(1996), 110 Ohio App.3d 86, 673 N.E.2d 653 <footnotemark>11</footnotemark>; <em>Jones v. Ohio Dept. of Human Serv. </em>(Nov. 29, 1995), Allen App. No. 1-95-42, unreported, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>1995 WL 705216. CDHS did not do so. CDHS presented no evidence whatsoever regarding Forester\u2019s December 17, 1992 reapplication interview and/or execution of the reapplication form. Neither did CDHS present any evidence of CDHS\u2019s standard application procedure that would tend to show that the subject of Forester\u2019s daughter\u2019s employment would have actually been addressed at the interview. Forester was not even asked at the hearing if she read the reapplieation form before signing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">The fact that Forester signed a lengthy, computer-generated form prepared by a CDHS representative simply does not, without more, clearly and convincingly establish that she was aware of each and every item in the form or that she affirmatively, <em>intentionally </em>misrepresented to CDHS via the form that her daughter was not employed. To be sure, signing such a form without carefully reviewing it in its entirety would be extremely imprudent. Such imprudence does not, however, amount to intentional misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">Because we find very little, if any, evidence in the record probative of the issue of whether Forester acted intentionally, we find that the trial court abused its discretion in affirming the decision of the Department of Human Services.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Accordingly, Forester\u2019s sole assignment of error is sustained, and the judgment of the trial court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b789-8\">Peter B. Abele, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b789-9\">Harsha, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b783-14\">.

Although the Ohio Supreme Court apparently utilized the same standard of review as the common pleas courts, the court did not overrule any of its previous decisions holding that our standard of review in R.C. 119.12 cases is abuse of discretion.

This distinction is outcome-determinative in my mind, for if we were in a position to make a <em>de novo </em>review of the facts, I would not hesitate' to join my colleagues in reversing this judgment. However, since I believe we are much more limited in our review by the abuse-of-discretion standard set forth in <em>Kennedy, supra, </em>I cannot second-guess both the agency and the trial court. I readily concede that trial courts should not be permitted to reach the wrong legal conclusion on a question of law and yet pass muster under the highly deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. To me, a prejudicial error of law always amounts to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>abuse of discretion, holdings to the contrary notwithstanding. However, because I find that the record contains some evidence which would allow the agency to infer that the misrepresentation was intentional, <em>ie., </em>that she knowingly signed a written document, I cannot say that the decision of the trial court was wrong as a matter of law. While I would like to join the majority, I feel constrained to defer to the wisdom of the trial court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
