An alleged disregard of the forms of legislation required by the constitution in the passage of a law is not the subject of judicial inquiry. So far as the duty and conscience of the members of the legislature is involved, the law is mandatory. They are bound by their oaths to obey the constitutional mode of proceeding, and any intentional disregard is a breach of duty and a violation of their oaths. But when a law has been passed and approved and certified in due form the courts cannot go behind the law as duly certified, to inquire into the observance of form in its passage.</headnotes>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b402-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>November 8th 1877.</decisiondate>\n<judges data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A6k\">Before Agnew, C.

Magee, city treasurer, and indirectly extending his term of office indefinitely, in that it provides he \u201c shall, previous to the 1st day of August 1877, appoint a person, to be denominated collector of outstanding or delinquent taxes and water-rents,\u201d who shall hold his office for a term of five years, and \u201c until his successor shall be duly appointed and qualified.\u201d That said act is unconstitutional and void because it diminishes the rights and emoluments of plaintiff, city treasurer elect of the city of Pittsburgh, after his election to said office, by depriving him of the right to collect said taxes and water-rents and of the compensation therefor, contrary to sect. 13 of art. 3 of the constitution, and imposing upon him onerous duties without compensation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-7\">The bill then prayed that the said Act of Assembly be declared unconstitutional and void; that Magee, the treasurer, be restrained and enjoined from appointing the collector provided for in said act, or doing any other matter or thing authorized thereby, and that the controller, finance committee, and said collector, if appointed, bo likewise enjoined from performing any duty in pursuance of said pretended law or appointment.

Phelps the collector of delinquent taxes, as provided by the act, who thereupon entered upon the duties of his office.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-10\">The Central Board of Education of the city of Pittsburgh, on the 21st of September 1877, filed a bill in equity against said Phelps. This board was incorporated by virtue of an Act of Assembly, entitled \u201cAn Act consolidating the wards of the city of Pittsburgh for educational purposes,\u201d approved the 9th day of February 1855, Pamph. L. 10, &amp;c., and was continued in existence and clothed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>with additional powers, <em>by </em>an act with the same title, approved February 12th 1869, Pamph. L. 160, &amp;c., under which acts, with a few immaterial modifications, it has continued to control the schools of the city until the present time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-6\">By the provisions of the Act of 1865, the city of Pittsburgh was created an independent school district, and had complete control of the' schools of the city; with duty and power of maintaining a high school, and school of color, and to pay the teachers of the sub-districts. For these purposes they were required to levy a tax, to appoint a treasurer, and to \u201c appoint some suitable and competent person as collector of the school duplicate of each ward;\u201d and all moneys collected were to be paid to the treasurer of the board, and disbursed by him, on warrants drawn by direction of the board.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-7\">Under this act the Central Board of Education was entirely distinct from, and had no connection with the city government.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-8\">The Act of February 12th 1869, contained substantially the same provisions, except that by the twentieth section, it was made the \u201c duty of the treasurer of the city of Pittsburgh for the time being, to receive and collect all school rates and taxes assessed by the central board, to whom he gave bond and accounted monthly. He was also authorized to appoint collectors of delinquent taxes in each ward. In all other respects the taxes were entirely subject to the control of the central board, who, by the twenty-first section, had the sole power to make exonerations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-9\">The bill set forth the powers of the board under the above recited acts and further averred that said Phelps, having been appointed collector of delinquent taxes under the provisions of the Act of March 22d 1877, threatened to demand and receive from the tax-payers the school taxes due to said Central Board of Education;. that defendant is not responsible to said board for the money which will be collected by him and the recovery thereof cannot be enforced by law. The bill then alleged that the Act of 1877 was unconstitutional and void, on the same grounds set forth in the bill filed by Kilgore, and for the additional reason that it regulates the affairs of the school districts of the city of Pittsburgh in violation of art. 3, sect. 7, of the constitution, which provides that \u201cthe General Assembly shall not pass any local or special law regulating the affairs of cities, counties, * * * or school districts, or regulating the management of public schools, &amp;c.;\u201d and further, that said act amends the charter of the Central Board of Education in violation of the constitution, art. 3, sect. 7, which provides that the General Assembly shall not pass any local or special law \u201c creating corporations, or amending, renewing, or extending the charter thereof.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-10\">To this -bill a demurrer was also filed on the same grounds, and that the decision of the question involved might be reached as soon as practicable, a decree <em>pro forvia </em>sustaining the demurrers was entered in each case by the court without argument.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>From these decrees these appeals were taken.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b407-6\"><em>Jeremiah S.

In many of the states and in most of the courts of last resort it has been decided that the courts have not only the power but it is their duty to inquire into and determine whether the proceedings of the legislature have been in conformity with the provisions of the constitution, where questions of public or private rights are the subjects of litigation: Cooley Const.

And whenever a question arises in a court of law as to the existence of a statute, or as to the time when it took effect, or as to its precise terms, the judges who are called upon to decide such questions, have a, right to resort to any source of information which in its nature is capable of conveying to the judicial mind a clear and satisfactory answer to such question, the best and most satisfactory evidence in all cases being required: Gardner <em>v. </em>The Collector, 6 Wall. 499; Legg <em>v. </em>Mayor, &amp;c., of Annapolis, <em>supra. </em>Parol evidence will be received to show that the legislature exceeded its powers and disregarded constitutional limitations: Jones <em>v. </em>Jones, 2 Jones 350; Cronise <em>v. </em>Cronise, 4 P. F. Smith 262; Miles <em>v. </em>Stevens, 3 Barr 41; Southwark Bank <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, 2 Casey 446; DeChastellux <em>v. </em>Fairchild, 3 Harris 18; Dorsey\u2019s.Appeal, 22 P. F. Smith 192.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b408-7\">By the Act of May 23d 1874, the cities of the state were divided into three classes: 1. Those containing more than three hundred thousand inhabitants; 2. Those containing less than three hundred thousand and more than one hundred thousand; and 3. Those containing less than one hundred thousand and more than ten thousand. In fact, Philadelphia is the only city with a population greater than three hundred thousand, and Pittsburgh the only one with less than three hundred thousand and over one hundred thousand. To separate these two cities from all others in the state and put them apart, \u25a0 each by itself, and to call that classification, is a curious use of language. When you separate persons or things, and deal with each by itself, you perform a process the very opposite to classifying, which consists in arranging a number of things together in accordance with some quality or accident which they all have in common. Class is a noun of multitude, and you cannot properly call a city a class of cities, for the same reason that you cannot speak of one ox as a drove, or one wolf as a pack. When the legislature says classification, it means segregation. It was intended to individualize these two cities \u2014 not to arrange them in classes or put them to<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>gether with one another. In that same act, and other acts subsequently passed, the phrase \u201call cities of the first class\u201d signifies precisely the same thing as Philadelphia, and the words \u201call cities of the second class\u201d furnish a perfect synonym for Pittsburgh. This law, therefore, applies solely and especially to Pittsburgh, and operates upon Pittsburgh as exclusively as if the framers of it had said so without circumlocution. It is not in form a local law for one particular place; it professes on its face to be made for all cities of the second class ; but all cities of the second class mean Pittsburgh. It might as wrell have been described by the words \u201c all cities situated between the rivers Monongahela and Allegheny, at the point of their junction with the Ohio.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-6\">But this interpretation, which we think so clear, has been pronounced not sound, but specious, by this court, in Wheeler <em>v. </em>Philadelphia, 27 P. F. Smith 338. The opinion of the court seems to be predicated upon the case of Walker <em>v. </em>Cincinnati, 11 Ohio 14, and no other precedent or authority for the ruling is cited. The case cited is not at all like this, nor could the same question arise in an Ohio court upon an Ohio statute, for that state has not, and never had, any provision in her constitution similar to the one in ours, which is violated by the act under consideration. The question involved is of such importance, affecting, as it does, the interests of great communities who supposed they had the protection of those wise provisions of the constitution providing against special legislation, a.nd to our minds the Act of Assembly is such a manifest attempt to evade the constitution and to pass a local law under the color and false appearance of a general enactment, that we feel justified in asking this court to reconsider their judgment, as given in Wheeler <em>v. </em>Philadelphia, <em>supra, </em>believing that more careful consideration will lead to a different conclusion as to the validity of the Act of 1874, and, consequently, as to the validity of the legislation now in question.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b409-7\"><em>George P.

If the act itself is within the scope of their authority, it must stand; and wo are bound to make it stand, if it will, upon any intendment. It is its effect, not its purpose, which must determine its validity. Nothing but a clear violation of the constitution, a clear usurpation of power prohibited, will justify the judicial department in pronouncing an act of the legislative department unconstitutional and void: Speer <em>v. </em>School Directors, &amp;c., of Borough of Blairsville, 14 Wright 150; Sharpless <em>v. </em>The Mayor, 9 Harris 164; Hilbish <em>et al. v. </em>Catherman, 14 P.

Within the constitution it is supreme, and when a law, confessedly within the power of the legislature to make, comes down to the people, authenticated by the presiding officers of the respective houses, approved by the governor, and certified and declared by the secretary of state to be the law of the state, no citizen, we contend, in a private controversy, can call upon the courts to go behind the record thus made up, and impeach the validity of the law, by showing that in its enactment some form or proceeding had not been properly followed or adopted by the legislature, the supreme law-maker: People <em>v. </em>Devlin, 6 Tiffany 269; Evans <em>v. </em>Browne, 30 Ind. 514; Bender <em>v. </em>The State, 53 Id. 254.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-6\">The cases in Pennsylvania, cited by appellant, viz: Jones <em>v. </em>Jones, Cronise <em>v. </em>Cronise, Miles <em>v. </em>Stevens, and Bank <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, are inapplicable to the question now under discussion. None of them relate to modes or processes of legislation, but exclusively to the power of the legislature under the constitution. The question in all these cases was whether the legislature possessed the power to enact the laws in question, and not whether they had been enacted according to forms and rules of procedure.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-7\">The authentication of a law should preclude all inquiries, not merely into the routine of legislation, but also the grounds of it. Are the provisions in the constitution relating to the passage of bills, limitations upon the powers of the legislature ? Or are they prescriptions merely as to the mode or manner in which the powers shall be exercised ? Our constitution is a limitation and not a grant of powers. The legislature possesses all powers, inherent in legis- \u25a0 lative bodies, unless expressly prohibited. The prohibition must be so clear as to preclude all doubt. There may be laws directory as well as mandatory, and this is predicable of fundamental as well as of statutory laws: Miller <em>v. </em>State, 3 Ohio (N. S.) 483; Pim <em>v. </em>Nicholson, 6 Id. 179; People <em>v. </em>Supervisors of Chenango, 8 N. Y. 328; McCulloch <em>v. </em>The State, 11 Ind. 432; Lehman <em>v. </em>McBride, 15 Ohio St. 602; Washington <em>v. </em>Page, 4 Cal. 388; Pierpont <em>v. </em>Crouch, 10 Id. 316; McPherson <em>v. </em>Leonard, 29 Md. 377; Anderson <em>v. </em>Baker, 23 Id. 531.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-8\">The emoluments or salary of a public officer are not property, and may be increased or diminished by law at all times, except when the constitution has forbidden it. The appellant is not within the protection of the constitution. He is not a public officer, but an officer of a municipal corporation, constituting only an integral part of the public, and a territorial division of the Commonwealth. A public officer is an officer who is appointed by the governor or elected by the people of the state: Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Burrell, 7 Barr 34-39; People <em>v. </em>Devlin, 33 N.

The only question before us in these cases is, upon the power of the legislature to pass this law. After a thorough argument and a careful consideration, we' are unable to pronounce the law unconstitutional. The power to classify cities according to the number of their population was fully discussed and decided in the case of Wheeler <em>v. </em>Philadelphia, 27 P. E. Smith 338. We adhere to that decision, and indeed cannot see how the question of power could have been decided differently. To say that no general law can be passed to regulate a certain subject because some of the classes contained in the regulation do not yet exist, or exist only in a limited number, is to hold that no law can be passed to provide for future wants or necessities. The welfare of the state and one of the chief purposes of legislation would be struck down by such a decision. If the classification had been different and the number of the population to constitute a city of the first class, had been fixed at one million, would the classification be void because no city had yet reached that number ? The absurdity of such a proposition is manifest, and it is simply to say that no law can provide for a state of affairs to which the subject is rapidly approaching, but which it has not yet reached. If the power to classify and regulate the subjects of cities generally be admitted, and clearly it cannot be successfully denied, the question of local legislation is at an end; for though it may happen that but one city may fall within the class, <em>non- constat </em>that others will not shortly do so and therefore may be provided for. The law was not passed for Pittsburgh as the only city happening within the second class, but for all cities having the population to bring them within that class. If I agree to sell all my lands at a certain rate according to a classification of tracts I have adopted, and only one tract falls within the rate of a given class, will any one be guilty of the absurdity of saying that it is not governed by my classification. The motives of those who passed the law are not involved. Suppose they did perceive that Philadelphia was the only city falling within the first class, and Pittsburgh the only one in the second, yet the motive influei\u00edbing that classification cannot be inquired into. If the power to classify for wise purposes exists, that ends the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">This act concerns a municipality \u2014 a division of the state for governmental purposes, and falls within the power of repeal and revision. Those who occupy merely official positions, unprotected by any special constitutional provisions, cannot set themselves up against the exercise of this governmental power. We know of no constitutional right of Mr. Kilgore or of the Central Board infringed by this law. They fill the place of public servants merely.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>In regard to the passage of the law and the alleged disregard of the forms of legislation required by the constitution, we think the subject is not within the pale of judicial inquiry. So far as the duty and the consciences of the membei\u2019s of the legislature are involved the law is mandatory. They are bound by their oaths to obey the constitutional mode of proceeding, and any intentional disregard is a breach of duty and a violation of their oaths. But \u2019when a law has been passed and approved and certified in due form, it is no part of the duty of the judiciary to go behind the law as duly certified to inquire into the observance of form in its passage. The presumption applies to the act of passing the law, that applies generally to the proceedings of anybody whose sole duty is to deal with the subject. The presumption in favor of regularity is essential to the peace and order of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">If every law could be contested in the courts on the ground of informality in its enactment, the floodgate of litigation would be opened so widely, society would be deluged in the flow. It is not a question of fraud in which that is set up as a law which never was so in form or in fact, but a question of regularity in the conduct of those who have the power to enact the law, and who declare it to be such. The evidence of a law \u2014 its actual existence \u2014 we may inquire into; for before we are bound by it, we must be satisfied it is the act of the legislature, however informally they may have conducted the process by which they have made it a law.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">Upon the whole case, we discover no substantial error, and the decree in each case sustaining the demurrer is affirmed, with costs of the appeal to be paid by the appellants in each case, and the appeals respectively are dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
