If that is the law of Pennsylvania, it will be a very easy matter to get clear of paying purchase-money, and our bonds and mortgages for purchase-money will be the most uncertain securities that can be imagined. Even if the alleged contract had been in writing, I doubt whether the defendant could defend an action on the bond without proving a tender of re-conveyance, and putting the vendor in <em>statu quo.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-9\">The court then directed a verdict to be rendered for the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-10\">A motion was subsequently made for a new trial, which was refused, White, J., filing the following opinion:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-11\">\u201c The offers of evidence rejected by the court may be reduced and condensed into two:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-12\">\u201c 1. That defendant was induced to purchase the property by the promise of Bingler to buy it back if defendant should become dissatisfied, and to pay for his improvements and a premium on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>purchase ; that at the time the deed, mortgage and bond were executed, defendant called attention to that agreement, Bingler admitted it, and promised to carry it out; and relying upon his promise, defendant executed the bond and mortgage, without having Binglcr\u2019s agreement reduced to writing; a year or so afterwards he called upon Bingler, in pursuance of the agreement to take back the property, &amp;c., which he promised to do, but died without doing it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-6\">\u201c 2. That there was to be no personal liability on the bond; Bingler was to look to the mortgaged premises only for payment; that when the bond was ready for signing, defendant objected to signing it, because that provision was not inserted, and was induced to sign it because of the representations of Bingler that it made no difference, and of his promise that he would not part with the bond, and would faithfully carry out his agreement to look to the land only for payment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-7\"><em>\u201c </em>The old common-law rule that parol evidence is inadmissible to contradict, add to, change or vary a written agreement, has been greatly relaxed in Pennsylvania. In a recent case it was said by the judge, delivering the opinion of the Supreme Court, that it does not exist in this state. Perhaps he did not mean that the rule has been wholly abrogated; but that it does not exist in this state to the same extent and stringency it does in England. Certainly we have no adjudicated case that goes so far as to say that there is no limit to the admission of parol evidence to contradict a deed or written instrument. As late as Martin <em>v. </em>Berens, 17 P. F. Smith 459, the rule is recognised and applied, and the exceptions to it clearly defined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-8\">4 4 It is difficult to reconcile and harmonize all our decisions on the subject. Great latitude has been allowed in the admission of parol evidence to prevent fraud or injustice. For this purpose parol evidence has been admitted of all the circumstances of the transaction, the subject-matter, the parties, the consideration \u2014 to prove a contemporaneous verbal agreement not directly contradictory to the written one \u2014 to supply omissions and deficiencies so as to carry out the true intent of the agreement, and generally to save a party from injustice, where a court of equity would give relief, from fraud, accident or mistake.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-9\">44 Where a deed or other writing has been obtained by fraud, or where there was no fraud in obtaining it, but it is being used, or attempted to be used, for a purpose different from what it was intended, parol evidence is admissible: Thompson <em>v. </em>White, 1 Dali. 427, and the long list of cases following it, are based on this principle.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-10\">44 The principle running through all the cases seems to be this: that the common-law rule, which was intended to guard against fraud and injustice by not permitting parties to deny their solemn written agreements, or overthrow them by the uncertain words and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>memories of unreliable witnesses, should not be invoked as a shield to fraud, or be so applied as to work injustice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-6\">\u201c The rule, as it stood at common law, was, perhaps, too stringent. In the progress of judicial inquiry eases arose which required modifications of it. But the principle upon which it was based has received the sanction of the best judicial minds in England and America, and strikes even the common mind as eminently sound and proper.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-7\">\u201c I know of no decision of our Supreme Court that goes the full length claimed by the defendant in this case. And I am unwilling to hold that a purchase-money bond and mortgage can be set aside and made utterly null and void by parol evidence,, .such-as was offered in this case, until our Supreme Court shall expressly so decide.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-8\">\u201c The defendant does not deny that he bought the property and voluntarily executed the bond and mortgage. He does not allege any mistake or omission in the deed or mortgage. There is no defect in the title. He took possession in pursuance of his purchase, and still retains possession. He never tendered to Bingler a re-conveyance of the property, and no such tender accompanied his offer of evidence. While thus in possession, he seeks to defeat a recovery on his bond on the ground of a parol agreement by the vendor to buy back the property. He does not charge any fraud in the sale to him. He does not allege any accident or mistake in the conveyance to him. But he says that the vendor promised to buy back the property if he should become dissatisfied with it, and, as he offered to give back the property, it is against conscience and fraudulent for the vendor, or his assignee, to insist upon collecting \u2022the bond. Hp claims the right to refuse payment on his bond, and to hold title and possession of the land as a means of compelling his vendor to comply with his parol contract to buy back the property, pay for his improvements, and pay a certain premium on his purchases.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-9\">\u201c The defendant, therefore, stands on the footing of a vendor seeking to enforce a parol contract for the purchase of land. In the face of the statute against frauds and perjuries a direct action on the parol contract in this case could not be sustained. Why should it be more efficacious as a defence to an action on his bond ? The only fraud that can be charged against Bingler is his refusal to carry out his parol contract to buy back. But a mere refusal to consummate a parol contract for the purchase of land is not fraudulent in law. If that were considered sufficient evidence to sustain an action on a parol contract, the statute would be a nullity. And I cannot conceive why it should have greater force when set up as a defence to the payment of his bond.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-10\">\u201c The defendant trusted in the verbal promise of Bingler. He knew, or must be presumed to have known, the provisions of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>statute against frauds and perjuries. He knew that a parol contract for the purchase of lands was worth nothing. He spoke about having it put in writing, but when Bingler said that was unnecessary, that he would keep his promise and faithfully live up to it, he did not insist upon having the agreement put in writing, but relied upon the word and trusted to the honor of Bingler. If he has suffered by Bingler\u2019s refusal to keep his promise, he has no person to blame but himself. Ho is in no worse condition than many others who have relied upon parol contracts for the purchase of real estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-6\">\u2022 \u201c That this promise of Bingler was a main inducement for the defendant to purchase does not alter the case. It was not a fraudulent concealment or representation of any fact. It does not touch the validity of the sale from Bingler to defendant. When the defendant got his deed and gave his bond and mortgage, and thus closed his contract of purchase, it was his duty, if he considered that previous promise of any importance, to have it reduced to writing and signed by Bingler. Failing\u2019 to do so it amounts to nothing. If parol evidence of such promises, by a vendor, during the preliminary negotiations of a sale, are to be admitted to set aside a sale and defeat a recovery on the bond and mortgage of the vendee, sales of real estate would become very uncertain transactions, and purchase-money bonds and mortgages would become the most worthless of securities. We are, therefore, of opinion that the evidence, so far as it constituted a defence to the action, was properly ruled out.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-7\">\u201c But on the other part of the offers, which related to the agreement that the defendant was not to be personally liable on the bond, and that Bingler was to rely solely upon the mortgaged premises for its payment, wo have more doubt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-8\">\u201c Offer C. was to prove that the agreement between Bingler and defendant was that defendant was not to be liable personally for the purchase-money, that at the time defendant signed the bond he called attention to that agreement, when Bingler said it was not necessary to have it put in the bond, that he \u2018 would stand to and keep his agreement as fully and effectually as if it was inserted,\u2019 that he would \u2018never claim any personal liability,\u2019 and that \u2018 defendant would not have signed the bond or consummated the purchase but for such inducement and promise,\u2019 &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-9\">\u201c This seems to come within the ruling of Irwin <em>v. </em>Shoemaker, 8 W. &amp; S. 75, and some other cases. It is undoubtedly in derogation of the common-law rule. But it is our duty to follow the rulings of our Supreme Court, and we shall cheerfully do so wherever those rulings clearly cover the case before us. But in Irwin <em>v. </em>Shoemaker the opinion seems to be based on a mistake made by the scrivener in drawing the bond, thus bringing the case within the exception, that where there was a mistake a court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>equity will reform the instrument. In this case there was no mistake. Whether the declaration of Bingler, that there was no necessity for inserting the provision against personal liability and that he would keep his promise, was evidence of fraud sufficient to admit parol evidence to contradict the plain terms of the bond, may be doubted. But even if that should be the case it was not sufficient to prevent a recovery on the bond, it would only limit an execution on the judgment to a levy on the mortgaged premises. And it is unnecessary to send the case back for another trial on that point at this time. We must assume that the defendant could have established what he offered to prove. The plaintiff objected 0to the evidence and it was not received. If it had been received, its only effect would have been to restrain the execution. We can do that until the question shall be passed upon by the Supreme Court. In any event the case will go to that tribunal. It is better, therefore, for the plaintiff to have the execution restrained to the mortgaged premises and have the case heard in the Supreme Court. If that should decide that the evidence was properly rejected, the plaintiff will have leave to issue execution generally. If decided otherwise, and the plaintiff should wish to have the question tried by a jury, it can be tried, perhaps, by a feigned issue, or if necessary a new venire will be ordered by the Supreme Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-6\"><em>\u201c </em>Believing this to be the best course for both parties, a new trial is refused. And it is ordered that any execution, issued on the judgment that may be entered on the verdict, shall be restrained until the further order of the court to the premises described in the mortgage which was given to secure the payment of the bond in suit.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-7\">The defendant took this writ, assigning for error the rejection of his offers of evidence, and the direction of the court that the verdict should be for the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b374-8\"><em>Hill </em>Burgwin, for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0d\">\u2014 Parol testimony is admissible to show what passed at the time of the execution of the deeds: Thomson <em>v. </em>White, 1 Dall. 424: Overton <em>v. </em>Tracey, 14 S. &amp; R. 326; Oliver <em>v. </em>Oliver, 4 Rawle 144. Evidence is admissible to prove a parol agreement to release an obligor from personal liability on a bond: Irwin <em>v. </em>Shoemaker, 8 W. &amp; S. 75; Hoeveler <em>v. </em>Mugele, 16 P. F. Smith 348. A written instrument may not only be explained by parol but its terms may be varied or contradicted when it is shown that had it not been for the oral stipulation made at the time, the party affected would not have executed it: Caley <em>v. </em>Philadelphia and Chester Railroad Company, 30 P. F. Smith 370; Kostenbader <em>v. </em>Peters, Id. 438; Graver <em>v. </em>Scott, Id. 94; Lippincott <em>v. </em>Whitman, 2 Norris 244.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b374-9\"><em>M.

F. Smith 459. The evidence offered did not propose to show that anything was omitted from the written agreements. They assume that the parties were fully aware of their contents. The effort was to radically change and modify them. Parol evidence to vary a written instrument was held to be inadmissible in the following cases: Harbold <em>v. </em>Kuster, 8 Wright 392; Lloyd <em>v. </em>Farrel, 12 Id. 73; Collins <em>v. </em>Baumgardner, 2 P. F. Smith 461; Anspach <em>v. </em>Bast, Id. 356; Miller <em>v. </em>Fichthorn, 7 Casey 253; Hill <em>v. </em>Gaw, 4 Barr 493; Woods <em>v. </em>Wallace, 10 Harris 171; Lyon <em>v. </em>Miller, 12 Id. 392; Kennedy <em>v. </em>The Erie and Wattsburgh Plank-road Co., 1 Casey 224.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b375-6\">Mr. Justice Sharswood</author>\n<p id=\"AZP\">delivered the opinion of the court, November 12th 1877.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">We are of opinion that the offers of evidence by the defendant below ought to have been received.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">It is agreed that the English rule excluding parol evidence to vary a written contract has not been adopted in this state in all its stringency. The exceptions, indeed, have in many instances almost eaten out the heart of the rule itself; but it is not altogether abolished, as may be seen in Martin <em>v. </em>Berens, 17 P. F. Smith 459, where, in an elaborate opinion, our late lamented brother, Mr. Justice Williams, exhaustively states the exceptions to the rule. But from Hurst\u2019s Lessee <em>v. </em>Kirkbride, decided in 1773 \u2014 reported by Chief Justice Tilghmah in Wallace <em>v. </em>Baker, 1 Binn. 610\u2014 down to the present time, this court has uniformly held, that where at the execution of a writing a stipulation has been entered into, a condition annexed, or a promise made by word of mouth, upon the faith of which' the writing has been executed, that parol evidence is admissible, though it may vary and materially change the terms of the contract. Mr. Justice Williams recognises this in his opinion in Martin <em>v. </em>Berens, for he says, speaking of the case then before the court: \u201c Here there is no allegation in either affidavit that the defendants were induced to execute the lease on the faith of the alleged parol agreement.\u201d It would be an affectation of learning to cite all the cases which establish this principle, but to those contained in the argument of the counsel of the plaintiff in error, may be added Miller <em>v. </em>Henderson, 10 S. &amp; R. 290, which is <em>instar omnium, </em>but may be noticed as a case on all fours with the one now before the court. There parol evidence was held to be admissible under the plea of payment to a suit on a bond against a surety, to show that he executed the bond under a declaration by the obligee, that his signing was mere matter1 of form, and that he never should be called on for payment. Chief Justice Tilghman says: \u201c The destruction of a written instrument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>by parol evidence may seem dangerous, and, in fact, it is so. But the community would be in a still worse condition if it were established as an inflexible rule, that when a man\u2019s hand was once got to an instrument, no matter by what means, the door should be shut against all inquiry. The encouragement to fraudulent villainy would be so great under such a system that the consequences might be intolerable. The defendant does not deny that he executed these notes, or allege that he was ignorant of their contents ; but declares that he would not have executed them, but for the assurance of the plaintiff that the having two names was no more than matter of form, and that he should not be looked to as payer.\u201d We cannot perceive any ground for the hypothesis of the learned judge below, founded upon the offers of evidence, that it should be regarded as a separate parol contract by the plaintiff below to repurchase, void by the Statute of Frauds, and only to be admissible upon showing fraud at the time. The law may be so. We cannot anticipate, of course, what the evidence may be on another trial. But certainly if the offers are supported by competent and sufficient evidence, it was all one and the same agreement containing concurrent and dependant covenants. It need not be said that a tender of a reconveyance was unnecessary, unless the improvements on the ground were paid for and the other terms of the contract offered to be complied with.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Judgment reversed and <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
