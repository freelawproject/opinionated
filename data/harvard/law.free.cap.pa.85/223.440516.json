A. by her will made her husband her executor, with power to sell certain land. The executor, as such, agreed in writing with B. to sell the same. Gr. had a mortgage for $4000 on the land, and the executor and B. agreed that Gr. should foreclose the mortgage and sell the land at sheriff\u2019s sale, and that Gr. should hold it in his own name, and that it should remain in the hands of B. for sale, and when sold the debt of Gr. should be first paid, and the residue should go to the estate of A. The land was subsequently sold for $8000, and B. refused to account for the difference, on the ground that his agreement with the executor was not <em>qua </em>executor, hut with him for himself and children. Held, that the <em>question </em>whether B. was the agent of the executor, and whether the latter acted as the executor of the estate of his wife in the transaction, was properly left to the jury to determine.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b223-10\">2. During the trial, it appeared that G-. was improperly joined, and plaintiff moved to strike out his name as defendant. The court directed a <em>nol.proo. </em>as to him to be entered. After verdict the amendment asked for was made, <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>as of the date of the <em>not. pros, </em>and in the place thereof.

More than six months after the verdict, the plaintiff amended, by leave of the court, by striking from the \u201c praecipe, declaration and whole record,\u201d the name of Josiah W. Guy, as a substitute for the <em>nolle prosequi. </em>It is true that this was done \u201c <em>nunc pro </em>tunc, as of October 27th 1876 but wo deny that it was either proper or effectual to sustain the judgment entered on the verdict. When thus amended, the declaration is incoherent.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b225-12\"><em>Levi Bird </em>Duff,, for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZu\">\u2014 Beringer was plaintiif\u2019s agent; Guy was trustee. They sold plaintiff\u2019s farm, and received the purchase-money. Both refused to give plaintiff' any explanation of the transaction. There was no alternative but to sue them both. On the trial of the cause, Beringer admitted that after the sheriff\u2019s sale Guy left the farm in his hands for sale, just as it had been before, and offered in evidence \u00e1 written article of agreement, in wdiich Guy agreed to convey the farm to him on the payment of his debt. It was then plain that the joinder of Guy as a defendant was a mistake, and that the action should have been against Beringer alone. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel then moved the court to strike Guy\u2019s name from the record. On the argument of the motion for a new trial it was contended that the entry of a <em>nolle prosequi </em>did not remove Guy\u2019s name from the record. The court, therefore, to remove all doubt, made an order amending it <em>nunc pro tunc. </em>The Act of 12th of April 1858, 1 Purd. Dig., p. 70, \u00a7 4, gives the court authority to make such an amendment at any stage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>of the proceedings. See, also, Ganzer <em>v. </em>Fricke, 7 P. F. Smith 316.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b226-6\">Mr. Justice Mercur</author>\n<p id=\"A2e\">delivered the opinion of the court, January 7th 1878.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">This was an action of assumpsit brought against Beringer and Guy.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">The seventh assignment of error is to the court having permitted the record to be amended by striking therefrom the name of Guy as a defendant, whenever it occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">The Acts of 4th May 1852, and 12th April 1858, Purd. Dig. 70, pi. 3 and 4, give ample power to the court <em>\u201c </em>in any stage of the proceedings\u201d to permit such an amendment to be made: Rangler <em>v. </em>Hummel, 1 Wright 130; Hite <em>v. </em>Kier, 2 Id. 72. So after verdict against three charged on a joint contract, a <em>nol. pros, </em>may be entered as to one, and judgment against the others, on the verdict: Ganzer <em>v. </em>Fricke, 7 P. F. Smith 316; Heemians <em>v. </em>Von Storck <em>et </em>al., not yet reported. The amendment may be permitted when the improper joinder of parties arose from a mistake of law or fact: Druckenmiller <em>v. </em>Young, 3 Casey 97; Cochran <em>v. </em>Arnold, 8 P. F. Smith 399; Pennsylvania Railroad Company <em>v. </em>Keller, 17 Id. 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">On the trial of the cause it appeared that Guy was improperly joined; that the action should have been against Beringer alone. Thereupon the plaintiff below moved to amend by striking out the name of Guy as a defendant. The court then directed a <em>nolle prosequi </em>as to him to be entered. This was clearly irregular and technically an error, nevertheless the case proceeded and went to the jury against Beringer alone. So far as the merits of the case were affected, it was tried as if the proper form of amendment had been entered of record. After verdict it was properly amended <em>nunc pro tune, </em>as of the date of the original application. The whole irregularity was thereby cured. The second assignment therefore falls with the fourth.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">The right of the defendant in error was based on the theory that Beringer acted as agent for the executor, and therefore for the benefit of the estate. There is abundant evidence that Beringer acted under some arrangement made with Davison Meanor, then executor. This is conceded by the plaintiff in error. He contends, however, that it was made with Davison for himself and children, and not with him as executor. If there was any evidence that in this arrangement Davison acted as executor, this question was properly submitted to the jury. We think there was evidence. By the will of the testator Davison was appointed executor, with power to sell the land, the'proceeds of which are in controversy. Before the sheriff\u2019s sale he, as executor, entered into a contract with Beringer to sell the land for a commission on-the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-12\">The evidence is very clear that the property was bid off by Guy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>at less than its value, under an arrangement between him and Beringer and Davison Meanor, that all Guy should have was the amount of his demands. Immediately after it was struck down to Guy, he said to Beringer and Davison Meanor, \u201c I bought it in, now I will put it back into your hands again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">After Guy conveyed to the plaintiff in error he said to Meanor, \u201c I sold it to Mr. Beringer for that money because I knew him to be your agent; that is the reason I sold it to him.\u201d Guy himself testified that at the time of the sheriff\u2019s sale he did give several persons to understand 'that after he got his money the residue for which it might sell \u201cshould go to the benefit of the estate.\u201d It is true he afterwards changed the language, for the \u201c benefit of these children.\u201d Which was the true understanding, was properly left to the jury to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Without further referring to the testimony in detail, it is sufficient to say that it is ample to justify the jury in finding that the plaintiff in error received the conveyance and held the land as agent under Davison Meanor, and that the latter acted in the transaction as executor of Eliza E. Meanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">This disposes of the whole case. We see nothing in the charge of the learned judge, all of which is assigned for error, to call for criticism. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
