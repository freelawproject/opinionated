They were bound to use, in the language of the law, ordinary care and diligence; and that is such care, diligence and vigilance as ordinarily careful and prudent persons would exercise in their own concerns in similar circumstances. You must remember the public character of this institution, what it pretends to do, what it offers to do, what its responsibilities were under its contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-15\">[\u201c So, we instruct you, first, that if you believe that the bonds were not in the box; that the doctor is honestly mistaken; that he might have dropped them on the counter when he was examining them, or carried them away and forgotten them, or in any other w^y they were kept out of the box, then the plaintiff is not entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>to recover. But if the bonds were in the box, as alleged; if the doctor is not mistaken; if the bonds were in the box, and they were missing under the circumstances as detailed by the plaintiff, he had a right then to call on the defendant for an explanation.\u201d]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-6\">The verdict was for the plaintiff for $4154.12, and after judgment the defendant took this writ, assigning for error, inter alia, the answer to the foregoing point, and the portions of the charge above noted in brackets.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b392-7\"><em>M.

The plaintiff\u2019s bonds were not delivered to or received by the company\u2019s employees or agents. The defendant never had actual possession of the bonds. Therefore it was error to charge that the plaintiff 'had a right to call upon the defendant for an explanation of how the loss occurred.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b392-8\">Evidence that the goods are missing, that they are not on hand when called for, does not of itself establish negligence in the bailee: Gilbart <em>v. </em>Dale, 5 Ad. &amp; E. 543; Midland Railway Co. <em>v. </em>Bromley, 33 Eng. Law and Eq. 235; 17 C.

F. Smith 53. The ease of Finucane <em>v. </em>Small, 1 Esp.

Its general business is indicated by its name. It took two classes of risks; in one class it became the absolute guarantor of the safety of the deposit; in the other its liability was qualified. and restricted. The present case arose under the latter class. The defendant in error rented a safe in the burglar-proof vault of the company, subject, inter alia, to the following rules and regulations:</p>\n<p id=\"b392-14\">\u201c Whenever a party rents a safe, and deposits therein at pleasure, contents not being made known to the company, its liability is limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>\u201c1. To the keeping of a constant and adequate guard and watch over and upon the burglar-proof safe.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">\u201c 2. To the prevention of access by any renter to the safe of any other renter.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">\u201c 3. To the protection of safes and contents from any dishonesty on the part of any of the company\u2019s employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">He renewed the lease annually several times and paid the required rent. The safe is closed by an iron door, to which a lock is attached. The valuables are placed in a tin box, made to fit into the safe like a drawer. In this box and safe he placed several thousand dollars in government bonds, and had the exclusive possession of the keys to the safe.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">As the interest fell due on the bonds, he took them out, cut the coupons therefrom, and replaced them in the safe and locked it again. Finally, on taking out the envelope containing the bonds, for the same purpose, he discovered that four bonds, two of $1000 each, and two of $500 each, had disappeared therefrom. The jury have found that ho put them in the safe and did not remove them therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">There was no evidence that the vault or the safe had been broken nor that the lock had been tampered with. These facts being unquestioned, and the bonds having been taken from the s\u00e1fe, it necessarily follows that it had been opened with a key suited to the lock. In order to get access to the safe a person would be obliged to step into the vault. If he entered during business hours one key would enable him to procure the bonds. If at other hours it would require two keys to reach them from the office. The fact that the bonds were taken under these circumstances, was certainly some evidence that the company had not kept \u201c a constant and adequate guard and watch over and upon the safe,\u201d as by its agreement it was bound to do. It further agreed to prevent the access of any other renter to the safe of the defendant in error, and to protect his safe, and its contents from any dishonesty of the company\u2019s employees. If any third persons were given access to the vault under circumstances that would have enabled them to unlock the safe and remove the bonds, and they had so done, although a contingency not provided for in the agreement, yet it cannot be pretended that it would not be evidence of a want of ordinary care. So if the bonds were purloined by either renter or employee it was certainly evidence to go to the jury of an omission on the part of the company to exercise that ordinary care and vigilance which men ordinarily exercise and ought to exercise under such circumstances in the protection of their own property. The vault and the safe were in the possession and under the protection of the company. The manner in which the bonds were most probably taken, shifted the burden of proof. It threw upon the company the necessity of making some explanation to rebut its prima facie negligence. The case is not like Finucane <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number><em>v. </em>Small, 1 Espinasse\u2019s Rep. 315, in which there was no express agreement as to the care to he exercised. Nor is it like Farnham <em>v. </em>Camden and Amboy Railroad Co., 5 P. F. Smith 53, where it was held that proof merely of loss was not sufficient to put the bailee on his defence. The evidence in the present case of the defendant in error did not stop with merely showing the loss. It showed the bonds had been abstracted by some one entering the vault, and' opening the safe by means of a key. The presumption of want of ordinary care was thereby created. All the evidence calculated to rebut that presumption was fairly left to the jury by the learned judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">The other assignments have no merit, and were not urged in the argument. \u2022 Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
