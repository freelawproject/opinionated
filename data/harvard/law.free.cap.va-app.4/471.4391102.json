Musick contends that Code \u00a7 8.01-229(E)(1) tolled the running of the statute of limitations during the time period he had previously filed applications, thus making this application timely. We disagree and find that Musick\u2019s claim is barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">On October 10, 1985, Musick initially filed by certified mail an application for a hearing with the commission. That application, which purportedly alleged pneumoconiosis, apparently never reached the commission, and the postal return receipt card was not returned to Musick\u2019s counsel. A second application was filed with the commission on January 21, 1986, and a hearing was scheduled for May 6, 1986. Prior to that hearing, the Industrial Commission ordered Musick to answer defense interrogatories within fourteen days. Musick failed to timely respond to the interrogatories and, upon defense counsel\u2019s motion, the claim was dismissed without prejudice on May 6, 1986. Musick filed another application for a hearing on May 23, 1986. The employer moved to dismiss on the ground that Musick last worked for Codell Construction Company on March 26, 1981, and therefore the application was not timely because more than five years had elapsed since the last injurious exposure. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.1-52. On review the full commission affirmed the dismissal granted by the deputy commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">Musick contends that the commission erred in dismissing his claim because, applying Code \u00a7 8.01-229(E)(1),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> his January 21, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>1986, application tolled the running of the statute of limitations during the sixty-four days the claim was pending between filing and dismissal. He further alleges that because his May 23, 1986, application was filed within sixty-four days of the dismissal of the previous application it was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The dispositive issue is whether Code \u00a7 8.01-229(E)(1) applies to workers\u2019 compensation cases. We find that it does not and affirm the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">By its terms, Code \u00a7 8.01-229(E)(1) applies to \u201cactions\u201d which abate or are dismissed without prejudice. Code \u00a7 8.01-2 defines \u201caction\u201d as it is used in Title 8.01:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-7\">\u201cAction\u201d and \u201csuit\u201d may be used interchangeably and shall include all civil proceedings whether at law, in equity, or statutory in nature and whether in circuit courts or district courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">A claim under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is not an \u201caction\u201d within the meaning of Title 8.01. \u201cActions,\u201d as defined in Title 8.01, are limited to judicial proceedings in the district or circuit courts and do not include administrative or Industrial Commission proceedings. <em>See Armada, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lucas, 2 </em>Va. App. 414, 417, 345 S.E.2d 14, 16 (1986). Therefore, Code \u00a7 8.01-229(E)(1) does not toll the running of the statute of limitations on claims made under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">Because the filing of a claim within the limitation period of Code \u00a7 65.1-52 is jurisdictional, <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Clinchfield Coal Co., </em>214 Va. 674, 675, 204 S.E.2d 257, 258 (1974), Musick\u2019s failure to file within five years of his last injurious exposure bars his claim. The Industrial Commission\u2019s decision is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">Koontz, C.J., and Benton, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b496-11\"> Code \u00a7 8.01-229(E)(1) reads: Except as provided in subdivision 3 of this subsection, if any action is commenced within the prescribed limitation period and for any cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>abates or is dismissed without determining the merits, the time such action is pending shall not be computed as part of the period within which such action may be brought, and another action may be brought within the remaining period.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
