On appeal, he contends that holding his trial within the confines of the Nottoway Correctional Center was a denial of his constitutional rights to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>public trial, to a fair trial, and to equal protection of the laws. He also contends that the limitation on his <em>voir dire </em>of the jury panel was a denial of the right to an impartial jury. We reverse the conviction because of violations of Vescuso\u2019s constitutional rights to a public trial and to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Vescuso escaped from the Nottoway Correctional Center while a prisoner there. Following his escape, Vescuso went to a house in the vicinity of the prison, identified himself as an escapee, and asked if he could enter to warm himself. The occupant of the house told Vescuso to sit on the porch and said he would get help; the occupant then telephoned the police department. Vescuso did not attempt to enter the house and was sitting on the front porch when the police arrived to return him to the prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Vescuso\u2019s trial on a charge of unlawfully and feloniously escaping from a correctional facility was held in a courtroom located within the Nottoway Correctional Center rather than in a courtroom at the Nottoway County Courthouse.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nottoway Correctional Center is a medium security prison which houses a multitude of individuals who have been convicted of various crimes. It is entirely surrounded by a perimeter wall. The courtroom in which Vescuso was tried is located within the confines of the prison\u2019s perimeter wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">Vescuso was convicted and sentenced by the jury to five years in prison, the maximum penalty allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">The right of one accused of a crime to receive a public trial is secured by the constitutions of the United States and Virginia.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> U.S. Const. amend. VI; Va. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8. The sixth amendment right to a public trial is a fundamental right and is protected through the fourteenth amendment against abrogation by state action. <em>Argersinger </em>v. <em>Hamlin, </em>407 U.S. 25, 27-28 (1972); <em>In Re Oliver, </em>333 U.S. 257, 272-73 (1948); <em>Cumbee </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 1132, 1134, 254 S.E.2d 112, 114 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">A criminal trial should be \u201ca \u2018public trial\u2019 in the ordinary common-sense acceptation of the term.\u201d <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Peyton, </em>208 Va. 378, 381, 158 S.E.2d 179, 181 (1967); <em>see State ex rel. Varney </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>149 W. Va. 522, 523-24, 142 S.E.2d 63, 65 (1965). <em>See generally </em>21A Am. Jur. 2d <em>Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 880 (1981). A public trial entails at least a requirement that attendance \u201cis not limited or restricted to any particular class of the community, but is open to the free observation of all.\u201d <em>Cumbee </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. at 1135, 254 S.E.2d at 115 (quoting <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Peyton, </em>208 Va. at 380, 158 S.E.2d at 181). One measure of whether an accused has been deprived of his constitutional right to a public trial if the trial is held at a place other than an \u201copen courtroom\u201d is whether the public had freedom of access. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Peyton, </em>208 Va. at 380, 158 S.E.2d at 181. When measured against these standards, Vescuso\u2019s trial clearly was not a \u201cpublic trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">We believe it is manifest from the location of the courtroom behind the prison walls that Vescuso\u2019s trial was not \u201cpublic\u201d in the ordinary sense of that word. Persons desiring to enter the prison are subject to the various admittance and clearance precautions necessary to maintain the security of the prison. The very location of the courtroom setting, behind the prison walls, imposes a significant impediment to free public access. Penal institutions are by their very nature closed to the general public and are universally considered to be secure from visitation except by persons on official business or by families of inmates during strictly scheduled time limits. Prisons are not places where citizens are en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>couraged to visit or enter. They are generally considered by the populace to be places where a citizen may not freely enter. By definition, therefore, free and uninhibited access does not exist within the confines of a prison facility. The setting of the courtroom within the perimeter walls of the Nottoway prison is, therefore, rife with impediments to free access and open observation. The conduct of a criminal trial in such a setting unquestionably had the effect, if not the purpose, of discouraging public attendance. Attendance certainly would have been limited to those persons who were stout-hearted enough to endure the anxiety of entering the penal institution and submitting to the tense atmosphere of the custodial environment and to the security necessary to protect the custodial facility. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>60 Ohio St. 2d 112, 120, 397 N.E.2d 1338, 1343 (1978). These factors refute any assertion that the public had free access to Vescuso\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">The Commonwealth argues that, because the record contained no affirmative proof showing that the public was excluded from the trial, it was a public trial. In support of its argument, the Commonwealth cites <em>Caudill </em>v. <em>Peyton, </em>209 Va. 405, 164 S.E.2d 674 (1968). In <em>Caudill, </em>the Supreme Court held that no abrogation of the public trial right occurred when the accused was tried in the judge\u2019s chambers adjoining the courtroom. <em>Id. </em>at 408, 164 S.E.2d at 676. We believe that the court found persuasive the fact that the door between the judge\u2019s chambers and the courtroom remained open during the entire trial. The court focused upon this factor in distinguishing <em>Caudill </em>from <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Peyton, </em>which held that the public trial right had been abridged when trial was held in the judge\u2019s chambers and the door between the chambers and the courtroom was closed. In that situation, there was sufficient evidence to find that the public did not have free access and had been effectively excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">We believe that Vescuso\u2019s trial situation was more akin to that in <em>Jones </em>than <em>Caudill. </em>Like the setting in <em>Jones, </em>there was a barrier separating Vescuso\u2019s trial from free public access. In <em>Jones, </em>the barrier was a closed door; in the present case, the barriers consisted of a perimeter wall, the varied security precautions inherent in a prison, and the factors discussed previously, all of which tend to discourage public attendance. Furthermore, the character of a prison facility is fundamentally different from that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>of an open judge\u2019s chambers adjoining a courtroom at the public courthouse. These differences are sufficient to justify the conclusion that the public was effectively excluded from attending Vescuso\u2019s trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">A public trial is \u201cnot merely a method to assure that nothing untoward is done clandestinely but a guarantee against the very conduct of private hearings.\u201d <em>Rovinsky </em>v. <em>McKaskle, </em>722 F.2d 197, 202 (5th Cir. 1984). The right to a public trial \u201cis a reflection of the notion, deeply rooted in the common law that \u2018justice must satisfy the appearance of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Levine </em>v. <em>United States, </em>362 U.S. 610, 616 (1960) (quoting <em>Offutt v. United States, </em>348 U.S. 11, 14 (1954)). The public courtroom setting is an essential part of the fundamental conception of justice. The courtroom used in the trial of this case, located behind a perimeter wall and in the foreboding atmosphere of a prison, is the very antithesis of a public courtroom. The setting for the trial of this case substantially eroded the possibility that the trial process would be subject to public scrutiny and that the trial would provide a reliable and fair determination of guilt and punishment. <em>See Rovinsky </em>v. <em>McKaskle, </em>722 F.2d at 201-02.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">The defendant\u2019s right to public trial, however, is not absolute and is subject to limitation when sufficient justification exists to close the trial. <em>Waller </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>467 U.S. 39, 45 (1984); <em>Rovinsky v. McKaskle, </em>722 F.2d at 200. To limit the public trial right, \u201cthe party seeking to close the [trial] . . . must advance an overriding interest that is likely to be prejudiced, the closure must be no broader than necessary to protect that interest, the trial court must consider reasonable alternatives to closing the proceeding, and it must make findings adequate to support the closure.\u201d <em>Waller, </em>467 U.S. at 48. The defendant need not prove specific prejudice in order to obtain relief from a violation of his sixth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>amendment rights. <em>Id. </em>at 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">In response to Vescuso\u2019s motion for a public trial, the trial judge ruled: \u201cThe motion for the public trial is not denied, but the premise of the motion is denied by the Court, because this is a public trial.\u201d The trial judge made no findings concerning the need to hold Vescuso\u2019s trial within the confines of the Nottoway prison. The Commonwealth, however, asserts as justification for holding the trial in the penitentiary courtroom the state\u2019s interest in security and maintaining custody over Vescuso. The argument is made that the need for maintaining such close watch over him is apparent from the fact of his prior escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">We do not dispute that the Commonwealth had a weighty interest in retaining custody over Vescuso throughout his trial; however, there was little on this record to substantiate the fear that Vescuso would again attempt escape. Admittedly, Vescuso was being tried for having escaped from prison; however, the charge of escape, standing alone, does not justify the extraordinary procedure of trying Vescuso in prison. The circumstances of his recapture serve to mitigate the magnitude of the security risk that Vescuso posed at the time of trial. The record contains no evidence to support the Commonwealth\u2019s assertion of an unacceptable security risk in trying Vescuso at the county courthouse. <em>See generally United States ex rel. Lloyd </em>v. <em>Vincent, </em>520 F.2d 1272 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 937 (1975). There was no showing that sufficient security could not have been maintained at the county courthouse, and the trial judge made no inquiry to assure that Vescuso\u2019s right to a public trial was not being sacrificed for less than compelling reasons. <em>See State v. Sheppard, </em>438 A.2d 125, 127-28 (Conn. 1980). We therefore conclude, on the basis of this record, that holding the trial in the prison courtroom, a courtroom effectively closed to the public, was not supported by specific findings of an overriding public interest, and therefore, was an infringement of Vescuso\u2019s right to a public trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">Like the right of an accused to receive a public trial, the right of one accused of a crime to receive a fair trial at the hands of an impartial tribunal is also mandated by the sixth amendment, U.S. Const. amend. VI, and is secured to an accused against state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>infringement by the fourteenth amendment. <em>Drope </em>v. <em>Missouri, </em>420 U.S. 162, 172 (1975); <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>391 U.S. 145, 149 (1968). Claims that defects in the trial procedure precluded a fair trial require the reviewing court to scrutinize the entire trial to determine whether the accused has been afforded the requisite due process. <em>See Estes </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>381 U.S. 532, 543 (1965); <em>Minor v. Harris, </em>556 F. Supp. 1371, 1378 (S.D.N.Y.), <em>aff'd, </em>742 F.2d 1430 (2d Cir. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Although there is no hard and fast test by which to evaluate a particular trial practice for compliance with the fair trial mandate, <em>Brown v. Wainwright, </em>459 F. Supp. 244, 246 (M.D. Fla. 1978), the presumption of innocence afforded to a criminal defendant is an integral component of the fair trial right. <em>Estelle </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>425 U.S. 501, 503 (1976) (quoting <em>Coffin </em>v. <em>United States, </em>156 U.S. 432, 453 (1895)); <em>see also Taylor </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>436 U.S. 478, 483 (1978); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>60 Ohio St. 2d 112, 115, 397 N.E.2d 1338, 1340 (1979). In effectuating this presumption, a criminal defendant is entitled to be clothed with indicia of innocence until his guilt is established by the trier of fact from the evidence presented at trial. <em>Harrell </em>v. <em>Israel, </em>672 F.2d 632, 635 (7th Cir. 1982); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Samuel, </em>431 F.2d 610, 614 (4th Cir. 1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>401 U.S. 946 (1971). \u201c[Ojne accused of a crime is entitled to have his guilt or innocence determined solely on the basis of the evidence introduced at trial, and not on grounds of official suspicion, indictment, continued custody, or other circumstances not adduced as proof at trial.\u201d <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>436 U.S. 478, 485 (1978). Thus, when a particular practice employed at trial unnecessarily dilutes the presumption of innocence, that practice is violative of the fair trial right. <em>See Walker v. Butterworth, </em>599 F.2d 1074, 1081 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 937 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">In evaluating the magnitude of the effect a particular practice has on the presumption of innocence, the courts need look to \u201creason and common human experience.\u201d <em>Estelle </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>425 U.S. at 504. The jurors themselves need not articulate a consciousness of prejudicial affect from the practice.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Holbrook v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number><em>Flynn, </em>106 S. Ct. 1340, 1347 (1986).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-5\">\u201cEvery procedure which would offer a <em>possible </em>temptation to the average man * * * to forget the burden of proof required to convict the defendant, or which might lead him not to hold the balance nice, clear, and true between the state and the accused denies the [accused] due process of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-6\"><em>Estes v. Texas, </em>381 U.S. 532, 543 (1965) (quoting <em>Tumey </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>273 U.S. 510, 532 (1927)). The pertinent question then becomes whether the trial within the Nottoway prison presents an unacceptable risk that impermissible factors figured into the jury\u2019s deliberations. <em>See Holbrook </em>v. <em>Flynn, </em>106 S. Ct. at 1347.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Vescuso was tried in a courtroom located within the confines of the penitentiary in which he was then incarcerated. The charge on which he was tried was the unlawful escape from that same institution. We believe that the jury was confronted immediately upon entering the prison with the probable inference that Vescuso, having once escaped, was a threat to escape again, and, therefore, could not be safely tried at the Nottoway County Courthouse. We further believe that this inference was continuously manifest by the conditions inherent in the penal surroundings in which the trial took place. By conducting Vescuso\u2019s escape trial within the secure facilities of the Nottoway prison the Commonwealth constantly suggested to the jury in the most vivid manner that Vescuso was guilty of the crime charged. The pervasive sense of guilt, which obviously permeated this trial setting, was clearly antithetical to the presumption of innocence to which Vescuso was constitutionally entitled. The threat that the secure prison surroundings, and the inference drawn therefrom, would cause impermissible factors to enter into the jury\u2019s deliberations as to guilt and punishment and thereby interfere with their consideration of the valid evidence is apparent. The prejudice engendered by trying an accused person in a penal facility rather than in a public courtroom is clearly at odds with traditional notions of fairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">The Commonwealth looks, in part, to <em>Holbrook </em>v. <em>Flynn </em>in support of its contention that Vescuso\u2019s trial was fair. In <em>Holbrook, </em>the Supreme Court held that no abrogation of the fair trial right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>occurred where four uniformed security guards were deployed in the courtroom during the accused\u2019s trial. The Court distinguished <em>Holbrook </em>from <em>Estelle </em>(compulsory trial in prison attire held unconstitutional) because of the \u201cwider range of inferences that a juror might reasonably draw from the officers\u2019 presence.\u201d 106 S. Ct. at 1346. In further explanation, the Court said that \u201cshackling and prison clothes are unmistakable indications of the need to separate a defendant from the community at large\u201d whereas the presence of guards at trial \u201cneed not be interpreted as a sign that [the defendant] is particularly dangerous or culpable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the Court did not conclude that the presence of the security guards was inherently prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">In contrast, Vescuso\u2019s trial in the prison admits of only one inference \u2014 that he is culpable and dangerous thus necessitating his exclusion from the public courthouse where trials ordinarily occur. Like compulsory trial in prison clothes, mandatory trial of accused persons in penal custody in a courtroom located within the perimeter walls of a prison is a \u201cconstant reminder of the accused\u2019s condition implicit in such distinctive, identifiable\u201d surroundings. <em>See Estelle v. Williams, </em>425 U.S. at 504-05.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">The fair trial issue is not limited to a concern whether the situs of the trial gave rise to the jury\u2019s knowledge of Vescuso\u2019s status as an inmate. If the trial had taken place at the county courthouse the jury may have learned of Vescuso\u2019s incarceration in any event. <em>Compare United States ex rel. Stahl v. Henderson, </em>472 F.2d 556 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>411 U.S. 971 (1973) <em>with People </em>v. <em>Roman, </em>324 N.E.2d 885, 365 N.Y.S.2d 527 (1975). We are persuaded that the situs of this trial had a probable deleterious effect on the jury beyond simply confirming Vescuso\u2019s status as a prison inmate. The situs added an aggravating factor of dangerousness which the jury could not have ignored in assessing Vescuso\u2019s guilt as well as his punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">The sentencing process, as well as the process of guilt determination, must satisfy the requirements of due process. <em>Gardner v. Florida, </em>430 U.S. 349, 358 (1977); <em>Mempa </em>v. <em>Rhay, </em>389 U.S. 128 (1967); <em>Specht v. Patterson, </em>386 U.S. 605 (1967). Vescuso had \u201ca legitimate interest in the character of the procedure which [led] to the imposition of sentence even if he may have no right to object to a particular result of the sentencing process.\u201d <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>430 U.S. at 358. The environs in which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>jury heard the evidence, considered its verdict, and sentenced Vescuso to the maximum incarceration conveyed a sense of predetermined guilt and dangerousness. The inferences of dangerousness and preordained guilt presented a significant abrogation of Vescuso\u2019s right to fair trial which included the jury\u2019s determination of his sentence. We conclude, therefore, that the situs of Vescuso\u2019s trial was inherently prejudicial based on reason, principle, and common experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The right of the accused to retain indicia of innocence throughout his trial is a relative one subject to a weighing of the competing interests involved. <em>See Illinois v. Allen, </em>397 U.S. 337, 344 (1970) (allowing shackling of an unusually contumacious defendant during trial). The accused\u2019s right to be free from security precautions in derogation of the presumption of innocence must be balanced against the rights of others in the courtroom and society at large. <em>See Harrell </em>v. <em>Israel, </em>672 F.2d at 635; <em>United States v. Samuel, </em>431 F.2d at 615. Unusual security precautions are permissible when they further \u201cessential state policy.\u201d <em>See Estelle </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>425 U.S. at 505. Flowever, such measures must be justified by a showing of \u201cextreme need.\u201d <em>Harrell v. Israel, </em>672 F.2d at 635-36; <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Butterworth, </em>599 F.2d at 1080-81 (keeping prisoner segregated in a \u201cdock\u201d located in courtroom during trial not necessary to further state interest and therefore unconstitutional). As previously noted, this record does not support the argument that Vescuso\u2019s trial in the Nottoway prison furthered any essential state interest and that no less restrictive means existed than that chosen to provide trial security.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The same result obtains on adequate and independent grounds of Virginia law where the right to a fair trial is meticulously safeguarded by the Virginia constitution. Va. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8. Our Supreme Court has stated that \u201c[n]othing should be done or permitted to prejudice [the accused\u2019s] case, or to obscure in the minds of the jurors the question, whether the evidence justifies them in a conclusion that [the accused] is guilty of the offense charged.\u201d <em>Harrison v. Commonwealth, </em>183 Va. 394, 402, 32 S.E.2d 136, 140 (1944). \u201cIt is axiomatic that an accused, when placed upon trial for his life or liberty, is to have thrown around him every safeguard known to the law, in order that he may be afforded a fair and impartial trial.\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>138 Va. 807, 816, 122 S.E. 421, 424 (1924). Vescuso\u2019s trial in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>Nottoway prison violated these principles and, consequently, impeded his right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Therefore, we remand the case for a new trial consistent with this opinion, if the Commonwealth be so advised. Because we reverse the conviction and remand for a new trial, we do not decide the issue which Vescuso raises concerning the impartial jury. We also do not decide whether Vescuso was denied his right to equal protection of the laws because that claim was not raised in the trial court with reasonable specificity.
