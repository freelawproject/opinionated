We conclude, therefore, that neither requirement for an <em>en banc </em>hearing has been satisfied. Accordingly, the application for a rehearing <em>en banc </em>is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-10\">\n<em>Denied.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b26-11\">Koontz, C.J., Baker, J., Barrow, J., Benton, J., Cole, J., Coleman, J., Duff, J., Hodges, J., Keenan, J., and Moon, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b26-12\"> Unpublished memorandum opinions of this Court are not to be cited or relied upon as precedent except for the purpose of establishing res judicata, estoppel or the law of the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
