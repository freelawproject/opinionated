Morris (appellant) appeals an order from the Industrial Commission denying him workers\u2019 compensation benefits for a heart attack suffered while working for the employer, James D. Morris (appellee), on December 3, 1984. In this appeal, appellant argues that the Industrial Commission erred in finding that the evidence failed to establish an injury which arose out of his employment. For the reasons stated below, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">At the time of his heart attack, appellant was a sixty-three year old laborer employed by appellee, a manufacturer of fiberglass products. His duties included making fiberglass products, packaging them for shipment, making deliveries and picking up materials for his employer. These duties included light lifting. Appellant customarily used a forklift when loading and unloading shipments.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">On December 3, 1984, appellant drove from his place of employment in Northern Virginia to Richmond to pick up fiberglass materials. When he arrived at the Richmond warehouse, he found that he had been assigned a new loading dock which was not equipped with a forklift. Appellant backed his truck up to the dock which was about eighteen inches higher than the truck. For approximately forty-five minutes he manually loaded ninety-six cartons of fiberglass onto the truck. Each carton, which was about the size of an automobile battery, weighed fifty pounds. Appellant felt no discomfort while loading the truck. After he finished, he got into the truck, \u201cpulled away from the dock and felt a whirling and then a little sickness at the stomach.\u201d Appellant parked beside the warehouse, waiting for the nausea to subside. However, the pain continued and appellant testified it was \u201clike an elephant\u201d standing on his chest. To alleviate the pain, he laid down and then walked around for about thirty minutes. When he realized these measures were not helping, he went to the warehouse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>office for help. He was transported by rescue squad to the Medical College of Virginia about ten minutes later, where an acute anterior myocardial infarction was diagnosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">We review a decision of the Industrial Commission under familiar principles. \u201cIn every worker\u2019s compensation case the claimant must prove: (1) an injury by accident, (2) arising out of and (3) in the course of his employment.\u201d <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>Philip Morris, </em>1 Va. App. 141, 143, 336 S.E.2d 515, 517 (1985); Code \u00a7 65.1-7. To establish an \u201cinjury by accident,\u201d \u201ca claimant must prove both \u2018an identifiable incident that occurs at some reasonably definite time\u2019 and that such incident caused \u2018an obvious sudden mechanical or structural change in the body.\u2019 \u201d <em>Woody </em>v. <em>Mark Winkler Management, Inc., </em>1 Va. App. 147, 150, 336 S.E.2d 518, 520 (1985) (quoting <em>Lane Co. </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>229 Va. 196, 199, 326 S.E.2d 702, 703 (1985)); <em>see also Kraft Dairy Group </em>v. <em>Bernardini, </em>229 Va. 253, 255-56, 329 S.E.2d 46, 47 (1985); <em>Virginia Electric &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Cogbill, </em>223 Va. 354, 356, 288 S.E.2d 485, 486 (1982); <em>Badische Corp. </em>v. <em>Starks, </em>221 Va. 910, 912-13, 275 S.E.2d 605, 606-07 (1981); <em>Pendleton </em>v. <em>Flippo Construction Co., </em>1 Va. App. 381, 382, 339 S.E.2d 210, 211 (1986); <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>Philip Morris, </em>1 Va. App. at 144, 336 S.E.2d at 517. Additionally, the claimant must prove \u201ca causal connection between the incident and the bodily change.\u201d <em>Bradley, </em>1 Va. App. at 144, 336 S.E.2d at 517 (citing <em>Bernardini, </em>229 Va. at 255-56, 329 S.E.2d at 47-48). The injury must occur \u201cwithin the period of employment, at a place where the employee was reasonably expected to be, and while doing something which was reasonably incident to his employment.\u201d <em>Hercules, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stump, 2 </em>Va. App. 77, 79, 341 S.E.2d 394, 395 (1986). Finally, the injury must \u201carise out of\u2019 the employment. Code \u00a7 65.1-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">An injury arises out of the employment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-7\">\u201cwhen there is apparent to the rational mind upon consideration of all the circumstances, a causal connection between the conditions under which the work is required to be performed and the resulting injury. . . . [I]f the injury can be seen to have followed as a natural incident of the work and to have been contemplated by a reasonable person familiar with the whole situation as a result of the exposure occasioned by the nature of the employment, then it arises \u2018out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>of the employment. . . . [I]t must appear to have had its origin in a risk connected with the employment, and to have flowed from that source as a rational consequence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Hercules, 2 Va. App. at 79-80, 341 S.E.2d at 395 (emphasis deleted) (quoting <em>Baggett &amp; Meador Cos. </em>v. <em>Dillon, </em>219 Va. 633, 637, 248 S.E.2d 819, 822 (1978)). An analysis of available medical evidence is necessary to establish the causal connection. <em>Lilly </em>v. <em>Shenandoah\u2019s Pride Dairy, </em>218 Va. 481, 485, 237 S.E.2d 786, 788 (1977); <em>see also D.W. Mallory &amp; Co. v. Phillips, </em>219 Va. 845, 849, 252 S.E.2d 319, 322 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">Appellant requested a hearing before the Industrial Commission when appellee\u2019s insurance company refused to make voluntary medical or disability payments because, in its opinion, the heart attack did not arise out of the course of appellant\u2019s employment. At the hearing before the deputy commissioner, hospital progress notes were introduced to prove a causal connection between the heavy lifting and the heart attack. The notes of the treating physician in Richmond indicated that appellant experienced \u201csudden onset of substernal chest pains which occurred while loading a truck . . . .\u201d Two electrocardiograms were performed on appellant; one on December 18, 1984, and one on December 19, 1984. Both indicated that appellant suffered from a myocardial infarction of \u201cindeterminate age.\u201d Beginning December 28, 1984, appellant was treated in Northern Virginia by Dr. Singh, a cardiologist. His initial office visit notes stated that appellant \u201cdenied specific chest symptoms . . . subsequent to his myocardial infarction.\u201d As to past history, the doctor\u2019s notes stated: \u201cEssentially noncontributory. No history of cardiovascular events, hyperlipidemia, diabetes or hypertension. Family history is noncontributory.\u201d Dr. Singh\u2019s notes indicated that appellant suffered from ischemic heart disease which indicates a circulatory obstruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">Deputy Commissioner Tarr denied appellant\u2019s claim on October 10, 1985, stating that although appellant\u2019s injury had arisen out of his employment, he had not satisfied both prongs of the injury by accident test. While the deputy commissioner found that appellant had suffered a sudden mechanical change in the body, the evidence presented did not point to one identifiable incident that occurred at a reasonably definite time which caused the heart at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>tack. Rather, the deputy commissioner concluded that the heart attack was \u201ccaused by the cumulative trauma of lifting the heavy boxes of fiberglass over a forty-five minute period of time.\u201d As to causal connection, the deputy commissioner noted: \u201cNeither Dr. Singh or (sic) the reports from the hospital <em>specifically </em>state that claimant\u2019s [heart attack was] caused by his work activities on December 3. However, the hospital\u2019s progress notes for December 3 refer to the loading of the truck, and we shall assume the physician relates the infarction to the claimant\u2019s truck loading.\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">At the review before the full commission on December 13, 1985, appellant presented the \u201cattending physician\u2019s report,\u201d prepared by Dr. Singh on October 28, 1985, nearly one month after the hearing before the deputy commissioner. In answer to item number eleven entitled, \u201cEmployee\u2019s account of how injury . . . occurred,\u201d Dr. Singh wrote: \u201cLoading approximately 5,000 pounds from stepdown dock to company truck.\u201d Item number fourteen asked: \u201cIs diagnosed condition due to occurrence described in item eleven?\u201d Dr. Singh answered: \u201cYes.\u201d The commission referred to this report as \u201cmedical evidence regarding causation,\u201d but refused to consider it since it found that it was not after-discovered evidence. <em>See </em>Rule 2:C, Rules of the Industrial Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Relying on <em>Woody </em>v. <em>Mark Winkler Management, Inc., </em>1 Va. App. 147, 336 S.E.2d 518 (1985), the commission held that appellant had proven that he suffered an injury by accident and that appellant was in the course of his employment when stricken. However, the commission denied appellant\u2019s claim, holding that there was insufficient evidence to establish that appellant\u2019s \u201caccident\u201d arose out of his employment. The commission gave three reasons in support of its finding: (1) the appellant experienced no chest pains during the loading activity; (2) the appellant offered no medical evidence to establish a causal connection between his work activities and the heart attack; and (3) the temporal relationship between the loading and the chest pains standing alone was insufficient to establish the requisite causal connection.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">We find that the commission misapplied the law. In its opinion, the commission stated: \u201cThe record clearly establishes that the claimant has suffered injury by accident.\u201d Therefore, appellant necessarily established \u201can identifiable incident that occur [red] at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>some reasonably definite time\u201d which caused \u201can obvious sudden mechanical or structural change in the body.\u201d <em>Woody, </em>1 Va. App. at 150, 336 S.E.2d at 520. Here, the identifiable incident was the forty-five minute period of loading which caused an obvious sudden change in the body which was the chest pain and the myocardial infarction. Despite this, the commission found the evidence insufficient to establish that the heart attack arose out of appellant\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The commission\u2019s finding that \u201cno medical evidence [was] offered at the hearing to establish a causal connection between [appellant\u2019s] work activities and the subsequent heart attack\u201d is factually inaccurate. Appellant presented hospital progress notes from December 3 to December 23, 1984 from the Medical College of Virginia which indicated that appellant had \u201cno prior history of angina\u201d and that he experienced \u201ccrushing\u201d chest pains incident to loading a truck. Dr. Singh\u2019s initial office visit notes were also presented as well as Dr. Singh\u2019s progress notes. Although these notes do not specifically relate the heart attack to appellant\u2019s work activities on December 3, we agree with the deputy commissioner that both the Medical College of Virginia and Dr. Singh attributed appellant\u2019s heart attack to the loading activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">The commission also found it significant that appellant experienced no chest pains during the loading. Apparently, the commission believed that the onset of pain must be contemporaneous with the incident in employment and not immediately afterward in order to establish a compensable identifiable incident which arises out of the employment. We recently addressed this issue in <em>Bradley v. Philip Morris, </em>1 Va. App. 141, 336 S.E.2d 515 (1985) and <em>Woody </em>v. <em>Mark Winkler Management, Inc., </em>1 Va. App. 147, 336 S.E.2d 518 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">In <em>Bradley, </em>the appellant claimed a back injury which allegedly occurred during a three hour period at work. There, we restated that the injury by accident test requires that \u201ca claimant prove \u2018an identifiable incident that occurs at some reasonably definite time\u2019 which causes \u2018an obvious sudden mechanical or structural change in the body.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bradley, </em>1 Va. App. at 144, 336 S.E.2d at 517. We also set forth the following standard: \u201cWe do not understand the term \u2018identifiable incident\u2019 to mean an event or activity bounded with rigid temporal precision. It is, rather, a par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>ticular work activity which takes place within a reasonably discrete time frame.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 145, 336 S.E.2d at 517. We recognized that three hours could constitute a reasonably discrete time frame. Bradley, however, did not recover because he did not show that his injury actually occurred during that three hour time frame. <em>See id. </em>at 145-46, 336 S.E.2d at 517.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">In <em>Woody, </em>we denied workers\u2019 compensation benefits to a heart attack victim under the following circumstances: \u201cThe sources of emotional and physical stress as proved by claimant span[ned] a period of almost three months and encompass [ed] a variety of incidents. We cannot say as a matter of law that he has shown the occurrence of an identifiable incident at some reasonably definite time . . . .\u201d <em>Woody, </em>1 Va. App. at 151, 336 S.E.2d at 521. Further, the claimant could not point to any work activity on the day of his heart attack which caused his injury. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">We believe that in holding appellant\u2019s claim noncompensable because his chest pains were not contemporaneous with the incident in employment, the commission misconstrued our holding in <em>Woody. </em>While it is true that a claimant must show \u201can identifiable incident that occurs at some reasonably definite time,\u201d it is not necessary in establishing causation that the pain or other physical manifestation of injury be contemporaneous with the incident in employment to prove that the injury arose out of the employment. If to the rational mind it appears from the circumstances that the pain is related from cause and effect to a specific incident which occurred, at a reasonably definite and closely related time during the employment, so that \u201cthe injury can be seen to have followed as a natural incident of the work and to have been contemplated by a reasonable person familiar with the whole situation as a result of the exposure occasioned by the nature of the employment, then it arises \u2018out of the employment.\u201d <em>Hercules, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stump, </em>2 Va. App. at 79-80, 341 S.E.2d at 395 (emphasis deleted) (citations omitted). Here, the evidence established that appellant\u2019s heart attack occurred no more than three minutes after he manually loaded ninety-six cartons weighing fifty pounds each from a loading dock onto a truck parked eighteen inches below the dock. Thus, the temporal relationship in the instant case is one of the factors that establishes the requisite \u201creasonably discrete, time frame.\u201d <em>Bradley, </em>1 Va. App. at 145, 336 S.E.2d at 517.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Furthermore, we conclude that under the facts of this case, even if the proper principles of law had been applied, the credible evidence does not support the commission\u2019s conclusion that appellant\u2019s heart attack did not arise out of his employment. To the contrary, appellant presented sufficient credible medical evidence to establish that his heart attack \u201cfollowed as a natural incident of the work.\u201d <em>Hercules, </em>2 Va. App. at 79, 341 S.E.2d at 395 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">Since we hold that appellant established a compensable injury based on the evidence presented to the deputy commissioner, we do not decide whether the attending physician\u2019s report, prepared one month after the deputy commissioner\u2019s hearing, was, in fact, after-discovered evidence and admissible at the review before the full commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">In summary, we hold that the commission misapplied the applicable law. Further, we hold that the credible evidence does not support the commission\u2019s finding. Appellant did indeed prove an injury by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Coleman, J., and Duff, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
