Tie owns four houses, subject to certain encumbrances, but there remains a substantial equity. The evidence shows that in the first three months of 1929 the appellant deposited in his bank, $6,357.96. He explains that some of the money was paid to him as secretary of a building and loan association, but these collections were a small proportion of that amount. The balance appears to be his individual funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">The lower court, after hearing the testimony, concluded that under all the circumstances the amount Of the order was a fair allowance for the wife. In view of his professional income and his outside financial resources, we cannot say that there was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-10\">The assignments of error are overruled and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
