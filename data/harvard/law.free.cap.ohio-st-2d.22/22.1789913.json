Respondent has clearly, repeatedly and flagrantly violated Canon No. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Respondent\u2019s reliance upon his constitutional right to refuse to testify in these proceedings was at all times respected.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Respondent argues that laches is a good defense against charges V and VI. We need not pass up this contention, since his misconduct under the other charges is fully supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Respondent also contends that the burden of proof in disciplinary proceedings necessitates the adduction of either clear and convincing evidence or proof beyond a reasonable doubt. In the case at bar, this question is academic. Respondent\u2019s misconduct has been established beyond any reasonable doubt, irrespective of whether that quantum of evidence was or was not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Pursuant to Section (6) (a), Rule XVIII of this court, respondent is permanently disbarred from the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b152-8\">O\u2019Neill, O.
