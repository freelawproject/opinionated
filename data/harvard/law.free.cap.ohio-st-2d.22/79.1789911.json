C. 5739.01(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-12\">When the taxpayer purchased each of the cars in ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>tion from the manufacturer, there was a \u201csale\u201d within the meaning of that word as defined in R. C. 5739.01(B) <em>(i. e., </em>there was a transaction \u201cby which title or possession, or both, of tangible personal property\u201d was \u201ctransferred * * * for a consideration\u201d). However, this \u201csale\u201d would not be a \u201cretail sale\u201d if the taxpayer\u2019s purpose was either \u201cto resell the\u201d automobile involved \u201cin the form in which\u201d it was \u201creceived by him\u201d or \u201cto use or consume\u201d it \u201cdirectly in making retail sales.\u201d See R. C. 5739.01(E) (1) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The subsequent exchange of the manufacturer\u2019s certificate of origin for an Ohio certificate of title with respect to a particular car would only involve a transfer from the taxpayer to the taxpayer without consideration. It could not come within the definition of \u201csale\u201d in R. C. 5739.01 (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">It is not contended in this case that the sale from the manufacturer to the taxpayer was not an Ohio \u201csale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">In claiming that the sales of these cars were not taxable, the taxpayer and the Board of Tax Appeals in its decision relied upon the portion of R. C. 5739.01(E), which reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">\u201c(E) \u2018Retail sale\u2019 and \u2018sales at retail\u2019 include all sales except those in which the purpose of the consumer is:</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">\u201c(1) To resell the thing transferred in the form in which the same is, or is to be, received by him;</p>\n<p id=\"b209-11\">\u201c(2) * * # to use or consume the thing transferred * * * directly in making retail sales * *</p>\n<p id=\"b209-13\">The categories involved in this appeal are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b209-14\">Category 2. \u201cUnits assigned to personnel who carry licenses, or officers of the corporation (who don\u2019t require sales licenses) who actively solicit sales and/or make sales.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-15\">Category 3. \u201cUnits assigned to retail sales personnel who engage only in selling vehicles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-16\">Category 5. \u201cUnits not assigned directly to anyone but kept at sales department to be available to all sales personnel for demonstration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-17\">Category 6. \u201cUnits that were assigned to other persons for the purpose of exposure to the public,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>It is obvious that the claimed uses made of these cars prevent a reasonable conclusion that thereafter they would be in the same form in which they were received by the taxpayer within the meaning of R. C. 5739.01(E) (1). After such uses, the taxpayer could not offer them for sale as new cars, even though their condition might justify his describing them as like new.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Also, there is insufficient evidence in the record to support a reasonable conclusion that the cars in category 6 were to be used or consumed directly in making retail sales. Hence, to the extent that the board\u2019s decision relieved the sales of cars in that category from sales tax, it must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">However, as to those cars in Categories 2, 3 and 5, there is sufficient evidence to support a reasonable conclusion that the primary use of each, as distinguished from its incidental uses (See <em>Jewell Companies </em>v. <em>Porterfield </em>[1970], 21 Ohio St. 2d 97, and <em>Mead Corp. </em>v. <em>Glander </em>[1950], 153 Ohio St. 539, 93 N. E. 2d 19), was to be a use directly in making retail sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">As pointed out in paragraph one of the syllabus of and the opinion in <em>Ace Steel Bailing </em>v. <em>Porterfield </em>(1969), 19 Ohio St. 2d 137, 249 N. E. 2d 892, this court is no longer required to weigh the evidence on an appeal from a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals since the appellant can now appeal such a decision to the Court of Appeals. Hence, we have not considered whether the decision of the board relative to cars in categories 2, 3 and 5, is against the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">\n<em>Decision reversed in part and affirmed in part.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b210-9\">0\u2019Neill, C.
