The Police and Firemen\u2019s Disability Fund created by Section 742.26, Eevised Code, as of January 1, 1967, is not a fund \u2018established and maintained by a municipal corporation. \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">\u201c2. Section 4123.02, Eevised Code, providing that Sections 4123.01 to 4123.94, inclusive, of the Eevised Code (the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act) do not apply to firemen in municipal corporations where the injured firemen are eligible to participate in any firemen\u2019s pension funds \u2018established and maintained by a municipal corporation,\u2019 does not apply to a fireman injured in the performance of his duties as a municipal employee, rendered and remaining totally disabled, and who is receiving a pension from the fund created by Section 742.26, Eevised Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">In rendering its decision, the Court of Appeals thought it necessary to discuss the constitutionality of E.
