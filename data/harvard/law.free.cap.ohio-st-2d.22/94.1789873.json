When a decision of the board becomes final the commissioner and all officers to whom such decision has been certified shall make the changes in their tax lists or other records which the decision requires.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">Section 5717.04, Revised Code, provides for an appeal from such a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals to this court and states in part that \u201cif the court decides that such decision of the board is unreasonable or unlawful, the court shall reverse and vacate the decision or modify it and enter final judgment in accordance with such modification.\u201d :</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">As hereinbefore stated, this court reversed the April 1, 1968 decision of the Board of Tax Appeals determining the value of the railroad\u2019s property for the tax year 1966 and remanded the cause to that board for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">After that remand, the cause was again before the Board of Tax Appeals as an appeal pursuant to Sections 5717.02 and 5717.03, Revised Code, from a final determination by the Tax Commissioner of that value.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Our statutes require that, on such an appeal, the Board of Tax Appeals must determine that value and cannot remand the cause to the Tax Commissioner for a redetermination of that value by the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">Section 5717.03, Revised Code, specifies that the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals \u201cshall become final and conclusive for the current year unless reversed, vacated, or modified\u201d as provided in Section 5717.04, Revised Code, which is the statute providing for an appeal from a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals. A decision of the Board of Tax Appeals, such as the October 9, 1969 decision, that is complained about in the instant case which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>remanded the cause to the Tax Commissioner, could not possibly have such an effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">In our opinion, our recent decision in <em>Lincoln Properties, Inc., </em>v. <em>Goldslager </em>(1969), 18 Ohio St. 2d 154, 248 N. E. 2d 57, and the syllabus of that case fully support our conclusion that the Board of Tax Appeals erred in its decision of October 9,1968 in remanding the cause to the Tax Commissioner for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">The Tax Commissioner is apparently opposing the contention of the railroad on this appeal because of a fear that he cannot present to the Board of Tax Appeals any evidence in addition to that previously presented to that board. However, the Tax Commissioner is a party to the proceedings before the Board of Tax Appeals and Section 5717.02, Revised Code, provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">\u201c * * * The board may order the appeal to be heard upon the record and the evidence certified to it by the commissioner, but upon the application of any interested party the board shall order the hearing of additional evidence, and it may make such investigation concerning the appeal as it deems proper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">Thus, if the reasons, which this court advanced for its reversal of the April 1, 1968 decision of the Board of Tax Appeals, indicate a necessity for \u201cadditional evidence,\u201d the Tax Commissioner can offer such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">For the foregoing reasons, in Case No. 69-704, the October 9, 1969 decision of the Board of Tax Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded to the Board of Tax Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">Our judgment with regard to the appeal from that decision renders moot the issues raised by the prohibition and mandamus actions. Therefore, the petitions in such cases are dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">In case No. 69-704, <em>decision reversed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-12\">In cases Nos. 69-698 and 69-699, <em>petitions dismissed.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b226-13\">O\u2019Neill, C. J., Leach, Schneider, Herbert, Duncan and Corrigan, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b226-14\">Leach, J., of the Tenth Appellate District, sitting for Matthias, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b224-14\">This opinion was prepared by Taft, C. J., and concurred in by all members of the Court, but Chief Justice Taft\u2019s death intervened before the decision was announced.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
