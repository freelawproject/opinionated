See <em>State, ex rel. Vitoratos, </em>v. <em>Yacobucci </em>(1962), 173 Ohio St. 462. We held therein that there is no requirement that the state \u201cfurnish an indigent prisoner copies of records free of charge, where such prisoner has exhausted his remedy of appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The instant case differs from the 1962 case only to the extent that, at the time of the filing of his petition in this court, relator had pending in the Common Pleas Court of Summit County a petition for vacation of the judgment of conviction. Apparently it was relator\u2019s belief that such a \u201ccertification\u201d would be necessary to bring before the court in the postconviction hearing the records of the prior proceedings. Such \u201ccertification\u201d by the clerk is not required in postconviction proceedings under R. C. 2953.21. This statute, paragraph (C), specifically authorizes the court to consider \u201cin addition to the petition and supporting affidavit, all the files and records pertaining to the proceedings against the petitioner including but not limited to the indictment, the court\u2019s journal entries, the journalized records of the clerk of court, and the court reporter\u2019s transcript.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Since the time of the filing of the petition for mandamus in this court, the Common Pleas Court of Summit County on \u201cexamination of the entire record\u201d has denied postconviction relief. Relator\u2019s remedy, if any, is by way of appeal from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">Moreover, and even assuming some duty on the part of the clerk of courts to \u201ccertify\u201d the prior records to the court hearing the postconviction case (but note that R. C. 2953.03 provides only for delivery by the clerk of court of \u201ca complete certified transcript of the record and docket entries and entries on the journal together with the original papers in the case\u201d to the \u201cclerk of the <em>reviewing court\u201d), </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>there is no requirement that the clerk \u201ccertify\u201d and return or deliver to the person convicted other \u201ccopies\u201d of such records. In another action by this same relator <em>(State, ex rel. Vitoratos, </em>v. <em>Walsh </em>[1962], 173 Ohio St. 467), we stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">\u201c* * * neither the statutes nor the decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Frato, supra </em>[168 Ohio St. 281], requires that the state furnish a copy of such a transcript of testimony to the parties in addition to the one which of necessity must be filed in the Court of Appeals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">As recently as April 1, 1970, this court denied a writ of mandamus, sought by the same relator, on the basis that \u201cThe state is not required to furnish multiple copies of the bill of exceptions to defendant.\u201d <em>State, ex rel. Vitoratos, </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>22 Ohio St. 2d 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">It is axiomatic that, before a writ of mandamus may issue, a relator must establish a clear legal right thereto. Concluding, as a matter of law, that relator has no right to the relief he seeks, the writ is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">\n<em>Writ denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b336-9\">O\u2019Neill, C. J., Leach, Schneider, Herbert, Duncan and Corrigan, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b336-10\">Leach, J., of the Tenth Appellate District, sitting for Matthias, J.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
