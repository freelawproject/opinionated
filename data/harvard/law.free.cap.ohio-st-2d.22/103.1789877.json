The record shows intensive questioning of Thomas by the state, defense counsel, and the court. The questioning shows diametrically opposite answers by Thomas depending upon which person was asking the questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-11\">Defendant properly objected to the state\u2019s challenge for cause under R. C. 2945.25(C), which excuses a juror when \u201chis opinions preclude him from finding the accused guilty of an offense punishable with death.\u201d See <em>State </em>v. <em>Duling, </em>21 Ohio St. 2d 13. The court finally overruled the state\u2019s challenge for cause under R. C. 2945.25(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>The trial judge did excuse Thomas for cause under E. C. 2945.25(B), because he was not satisfied that Thomas could render an impartial verdict on the evidence on account of the prospective juror\u2019s contradictory answers to questions concerning preconceived opinions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> E. C. 2945.25(C) requires that where a juror has a preconceived opinion the court must be satisfied that the juror could render an impartial verdict on the evidence or else the court may excuse the juror for cause. See, also, <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>State, </em>16 Ohio St. 328, paragraph one of the syllabus. The trial judge exercised his sound legal discretion and did not commit reversible error. See <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>State, </em>42 Ohio St. 596. Since the exclusion of Thomas was proper under R. C. 2945.25 (B), <em>supra, </em>the cases emanating from <em>Witherspoon </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>20 L. Ed. 2d 776, are inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The record fails to show any abuse of discretion in admitting rebuttal testimony. Bather it shows that the questioned testimony rebutted earlier testimony of the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>ant. Since we do not find the required patent abuse of discretion in admitting this testimony, the defendant\u2019s objection is not well taken. See <em>Cities Service Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Burkett, </em>176 Ohio St. 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Evidence was presented which tended to show premeditated and deliberate malice on the part of the defendant. There was also evidence to the contrary. The conflicting testimony was sufficient evidence to both warrant submission of the issue to the jury and to support the verdict entered by the jury. Therefore, the trial court did not err in allowing the jury to decide whether the defendant acted with deliberate and premeditated malice. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>176 Ohio St. 156, 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b234-8\">O\u2019Neill, C.
