Stats. Ann. Subject to this question, there is the further one of error in the trial court\u2019s refusal of petitioner\u2019s requested issues as to aggravation of respondent\u2019s silicosis by tuberculosis (Sec. 22 of the same article).</p>\n<p id=\"b16-9\">The mentioned sections and others not clearly irrelevant are for convenience set out at length in the footnote.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the opinion of the Court of Civil Appeals, see 263 S.W. 2d 815.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>Respondent\u2019s employment with Trojan Foundries, which was terminated by his disability around November, 1951, began about eleven months previously, but included only seven or eight months of work with sand molds and cores for metal castings, an avocation of which silicosis is \u201ccharacteristic\u201d (Sec. 25 supra) and which he has pursued for many different employers almost continuously throughout a working life of nearly forty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-4\">He pleaded primarily, and supported with evidence, a claim of industrial accident consisting of a fall in early September 1951, at the Trojan plant, which allegedly caused, or activated a dormant condition of, disabling <em>tuberculosis </em>(not an occupational disease). The jury, however, found that the accident, though occurring, did not produce disability, and this phase of the case is ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-5\">On the alternative claim of occupational silicosis the jury found permanent partial disability to exist therefrom, and also made the necessary findings to satisfy the requirements of Sec. 25, supra, and also those of Sec. 26(b) to the effect that respondent \u201cduring the ten (10) years immediately preceding the date of incapacity the employee has been exposed to the inhalation of silica dust * * over a period of not less than five (5) years * * These findings are not now questioned or questionable. What is questioned, and vigorously, is the finding made pursuant to Sec. 24, supra, that respondent, in his final and relatively brief employment with Trojan, was (to quote from Special Issue No. 12) \u201cinjuriously exposed to silica dust.\u201d In this behalf, there being no statutory explanation of the rele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>vant language of Sec. 24 to the effect that \u201c* * * the employer in whose employ the employee was last <em>injursiously exposed to the hazards of such disease </em>shall be deemed the employer * * the trial court, without objection from either party, instructed the jury that \u201cinjuriously exposed\u201d meant \u201can exposure or contact with the dangers of silicosis which causes silicosis, or excites, accelerates or aggravates a pre-existing condition of silicosis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b18-3\">It was also found that the respondent\u2019s <em>tuberculosis, </em>of which medical evidence of both parties showed him to suffer at least a moderate case, and to which the petitioner\u2019s evidence attributed whatever disability the respondent might have, \u201c* * was aggravated * * \u00f3r * * contributed to <em>by silicosis\u201d; </em>and that \u201cthe percentage * * that such silicosis aggravated * * or * * contributed to such <em>tuberculosis\u201d </em>was <em>\u201c5%\u201d. </em>These findings were treated by the trial court as requiring a deduction, under Sec. 22,. supra, of five per cent of the award otherwise corresponding to the disability found to exist, and that ruling is not questioned by the respondent, although in the same connection the petitioner raises the secondary question first above mentioned and hereinafter treated.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-4\">Before discussing the merits, it should no doubt be observed that the respondent\u2019s contest of our jurisdiction to review the case is plainly without merit. Of the several subdivisions of Art. 1728, Vernon\u2019s Texas Civ. Stats. Ann., invoked by the petitioner, No. 6 is clearly applicable, and the corresponding \u201cstatement of jurisdiction,\u201d which the respondent criticizes for not specifying the alleged error of law committed below, is in the exact wording suggested by Rule 469, Texas R. Civ. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>Proc. The rule thus dispenses with including points of error in the jurisdictional statement \u2014 evidently because its further provisions require the points to be listed in a later portion of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-3\">True, petitioner\u2019s Point 1 (to the effect that the respondent-plaintiff has not \u201cmet the burden of showing that he was INJURIOUSLY exposed to silicosis while in the employ of\u201d the insured employer) does not over-exactly state the law question of \u201cno evidence,\u201d of which we have jurisdiction, as distinguished from the fact question of \u201cagainst the overwhelming weight and preponderance of the evidence\u201d (often referred to as \u201cinsufficiency of the evidence\u201d) which is final in the Court of Civil Appeals. But we have ample discretion and no difficulty to determine from the rest of the petition, including the prayer for rendition of final judgment against the respondent, that the law question is presented. The latter was obviously the subject of the ruling of the Court of Civil Appeals which is complained of, since that court expressly applied the rule of looking only at the evidence favorable to the verdict. This rule, while applicable to the law question, is definitely not applicable to the fact question, which requires the Court of Civil Ape\u00e1is to consider and weigh all of the evidence \u2014 although in a scale quite different from that applicable to the jury. See In Re King\u2019s Estate, 150 Texas 662, 244 S.W. 2d 660; 30 Texas L. Rev. 803.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-4\">Passing now to the merits, Sec. 26, supra, defines silicosis as \u201cthe characteristic fibrotic condition of the lungs caused by the inhalation of silica dust.\u201d Actually it is less a disease than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>a progressive abnormality or injury due to the gradual accumulation in the lungs of tiny particles of silica dioxide (\u201cfree silica\u201d) so small as to be invisible to the naked eye and to defeat nature\u2019s protective devices of hair filters and moisture in the respiratory organs and so numerous as eventually to exceed nature\u2019s power to absorb or tolerate them. They, and the irritation they engender, cause nature to build up corresponding pulmonary areas of hard tissue and to this extent incurably to alter and impair the normal structure and function of the lungs.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-3\">Silicosis differs from tuberculosis in that the latter involves the operation of a germ as distinguished from a mechanical and perhaps chemical irritation, but both involve something in the nature of permanent scars on the lungs, fatigue, shortness of breath and cough, and tuberculosis is far more prevalent among silicotics than among people generally. Respondent\u2019s medical evidence in the main described his condition as a combination of both illnesses, the tuberculosis being of quite recent origin and moderate degree, while as stated, the evidence of petitioner attributed the entire disability to tuberculosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-4\">The character of silicosis as an accumulation, and a mechanical and chemical diffusion, of foreign matter, and the consequently slow process whereby it develops, ordinarily render somewhat speculative the determination of (a) the time of its occurrence as a status properly to be diagnosed as silicosis and (b) the period of employment to which it is properly chargeable. Indeed its actual diagnosis ordinarly must be based in good part upon a history of exposure to silica dust in addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>tion to symptoms afforded by X-ray examination and otherwise. The presence in the lungs of some free silica does not necessarily constitute silicosis or render its occurrence inevitable, because nature can absorb or \u201ctolerate\u201d a certain amount. And, depending upon how much exposure had theretofore occurred, a person with some accumulation of free silica might then and there withdraw from further exposure and either develop silicosis within the ensuing few years or not ever develop it. Evidently even where silicotic scars or areas have developed, the affected party is not necessarily disabled. For various purposes the time element is obviously important. A period of several years freedom from silicosas ensuing upon exposure but without further exposure strongly indicates that the \u201cdisease\u201d will not occur in the absence of additional exposure. A long exposure (5 to 20 years) is far more likely to produce it, or aggravate it if already in existence, than a short one and is generally conceded to be essential to contracting it, although by respondent\u2019s expert testimony it <em>could </em>be contracted in \u201cless than 2 years\u201d in exceptional cases. The time element qualifies, and is itself heavily qualified by, the density of concentration of free silica constituting the exposure. However, according to what may be described as prevailing scientific opinion \u2014 whether agreed to by <em>all </em>experts in the field or fixed beyond possibility of change, we know not \u2014 the concentration of the microscopic particles must be at least as great as 5 million to the cubic foot of air in order that exposure thereto may be harmful.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-4\">All of the foregoing seems rather clear from the expert testimony produced by each party to the suit and much of it is reflected in the statute itself. Sec. 25, supra, denies compensation where the incapacity first arises three years or more after the \u201clast injurious exposure in such employment.\u201d Sec. 26(b) practically amounts to such a denial, unless there has been an exposure \u201cto the inhalation of silica dust\u201d for the 5-out-of-10-year period just preceding disability. Sec. 26(c) permits full compensation only after 5 years from the effective date of the occupational disease portion of the statute (1947) and reduces the compensation for earlier disability by 20 per cent for each year by which the period falls short of 5. Sec. 26 (e) provides for special employment contracts by, and correspondingly reduced compensation risk to, an employer in hiring persons \u201cnot actually incapacitated\u201d by, but already \u201caffected by,\u201d silicosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-5\">The critical Sec. 24, supra, placing the burden of compensation <em>payment </em>according to the last injurious exposure, comes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>into operation, of course, only where disability from the occupational illness in question has been shown (with corresponding proof that the disability occurred (a) within 3 years after the last injurious exposure and (b) at the end of the 10-year period during 5 years of which \u201cthe employee has been exposed to the inhalation of silica dust\u201d). Section 24 obviously does not speak in terms of original or even added <em>disability </em>as related to the work with the employer in question, nor specify any partciular degree or amount of the injury that must be shown to arise from exposure with that employer. To this extent at least, the trial court\u2019s definition of \u201cinjuriously exposed\u201d would have been sustained, had it been attacked. No doubt the mere coincidence of disability with a particular employment period of less than 5 years, in which some exposure exists, is not evidence of injurious exposure. But this is not the same as requiring of the claimant a mathematical or similar \u201cexact\u201d scientific demonstration that conditions appropriate for injury existed. The inference, if any, from 26(b), that an exposure of as much as 5 years with a particular employer, plus symptomatic proof of silicosis, may be evidence that the exposure was injurious, does not throw much light upon the matter of proof required where the exposure period is much shorter. Nor does the statute elsewhere suggest any specific method or requirement of such proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-3\">The petitioner\u2019s argument seems to be that the evidence shows beyond doubt that concentration of more than 5 million dangerous particles per cubic foot of air is a prerequisite to any injury to any person from silica dust, and that, there being no proof in terms of the number of particles per cubic foot at Trojan Foundries, except the evidence for the petitioner indicating the concentration to be far less than that mentioned, there is no evidence of injurious exposure to the respondent at Trojan Foundries. Such proof obviously entails rather elaborate tests conducted by a person of special skill with the use of considerable scientific equipment. (In the instant case the tests were made about a year after occurrence of the respondent\u2019s disability.) The petitioner\u2019s point is, not that its proof of the tests conclusively established the 1951 concentration as being less than 5 million per cubic foot, but that the respondent\u2019s failure to prove a concentration in excess of that density was fatal. Implicit in this contention is the further one that such purported proof as respondent did produce of an injurious exposure was without substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-4\">In brief, the respondent\u2019s critical proof consisted of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>own testimony and that of his medical expert, Dr. Kahn. Respondent testified as a layman but one who evidently occupied a definitely higher place in the plant than the ordinary workman and had a whole life of foundry experience behind him. He told in considerable detail of the large amount of silica type sand and other materials such as fire brick and fire clay used in the plant, the various operations, such as grinding and chipping fire brick, sand blasting, shovelling and conveying sand, cleaning the furnaces, and the great amount of dust produced therefrom, the absence of ventilation devices which are used in certain other foundries, and so on. He testified that he \u201chad never been exposed to so much dust at any other foundry\u201d in the long list of those in which he had worked. It is probably fair to say that he made out as good a case of conditions calculated to cause or abet silicosis as one could do in a brief exposure situation without the use of the abovementioned scientific tests or circumstantial proof such as injury to other Trojan employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-4\">The testimony of Dr. Kahn seems, indeed, to a layman somewhat vague and inconsistent, although the subject hardly lends itself to exactitude. At some points he appears to admit that the allocation of injury to a particular period of exposed employment could not be made without knowledge of the degree of concentration as exceding 5 million particles per square foot, and obviously he had no knowledge of the actual concentration at Trojan Foundries. At other points he testifies that taking the respondent\u2019s testimony as true, he thought the exposure at Trojan simply \u201ccould\u201d have injured him. But he does say clearly at still other points that it was not at all \u201cadvisable for a man who has developed silicosis to return \u2022 to any type of employment where he is exposed to silica dust\u201d because \u201cIt just keeps on adding* damage to an already damaged important organ,\u201d and that he \u201cWould regard work around any foundry as being harmful to a person who had a silicosis that had been developing over the years.\u201d (Even respondent\u2019s witness, Dr. Mendenhall, who was rather absolute in his view that a concentration of less than 5 million particles is quite harmless, advised respondent against returning to foundry work.)</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">There was ample evidence from both Dr. Kahn and Dr. Mendenhall, that respondent\u2019s silicosis \u201chad been developing over the years,\u201d and had reached something at least not far from its present status by the beginning date of his employment with Trojan. We think Dr. Kahn\u2019s testimony can reasonably be interpreted as including an opinion that respondent\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>exposure to silica dust at Trojan, even if the concentration of dangeorus dust were considerably less than the \u201caccepted\u201d density, actually did him some harm. With the legitimate reservation that our decision may well not entail a like result in later cases with different evidence and that our conclusion about the finality of particular scientific \u201cfacts\u201d (so often mere contemporary majority opinion!) will necessarily vary with scientific progress, we conclude that the opinion of Dr. Kahn was, with the other proof, some evidence to sustain the questioned finding of injurious exposure at Trojan Foundries.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\">As indicated, no provision in the statute itself regarding proof makes the abovementioned testimony inadequate, nor does any decision to which we are cited purport to require proof by laboratory-type tests of the number of silica particles. Rather the suggestion in most of the cases is to the contrary, although the citations of both parties are less than persuasive, due to differences in the factual background or other considerations. Other than tests, there is scarcely any way in which the necessary proof might be made except that here followed by respondent. We do not greatly \u201cliberalize\u201d the law, when we hold, in effect, that the inability of an employee to maintain by tests current and detailed scientific knowledge of dust conditions in the plant or plants in which he works so as to reproduce this knowledge later on in support of some possible future claim, ought not for all practical purposes to negative his rights under Sec. 24. True, as before suggested, this impossible situation might not prevail, where the length of the exposure were such as, with the clinical evidence, to create an inference of injury during the period in question. Yet the absence of any minimum period in Sec. 24 certainly suggests intended liability regardless of mere length of exposure and this liability would rarely exist in fact, if the particle-count type of proof should be required. The result is that injurious exposure under Sec. 24 may be established by evidence of the kind produced here, that is, lay evidence of substantial amount of silica dust plus medical opinion connecting it with actual injury. If this be a hardship on insurers such as the petitioner, what of the converse hardship on the claimant in a case wherein disability should develop just under 3 years after a last foundry employment of, say 4 years as the law contemplates might happen? How would a workman be able to procure <em>ex post facto </em>a particle-count for even a little part of the exposure period ?</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">Our holding is, in brief, that the respondent has made out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>a case, even conceding the evidence to establish conclusively that the 5 million particle theory is the controlling scientific view. We proceed to hold further that the evidence does not in fact so establish. Dr. Kahn\u2019s evident conclusion that the exposure to silica dust at Trojan did some harm may be taken as meaning that, however generally accepted the theory in question might be, he did not regard it as applicable to every case, including this one. And while, indeed, his testimony does appear at times to contradict itself, the conflict presents rather a question for the jury (or for the Court of Civil Appeals under a proper assignment of \u201cagainst the great weight of the evidence\u201d) than for us. Pacific Fire Insurance Co. v. Donald, 148 Texas 277, 224 S.W. 2d 204. In Re King\u2019s Estate, supra. By the same token, the conclusions of respondent\u2019s witness Dr. Mendenhall do not as a matter of law destroy the contrary conclusion of his witness Dr. Kahn.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-3\">There remains the point of whether the trial court rightly refused (as the Court of Civil Appeals held that it did) the petitioner\u2019s requested special issues Nos. 1 and 2, under Sec. 22, supra, the former reading:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-4\">\u201cREQUESTED SPECIAL ISSUE NO. 1:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-5\">\u201cIf you have answered Special Issue No. 24 \u2018he did have such tuberculosis,\u2019 then you will answer the following special issues; otherwise, you need not answer same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-6\">\u201cDo you find from a preponderance of the evidence that plaintiff\u2019s tuberculosis, if any, has aggravated, prolonged, accelerated, or in anywise contributed to the disability, if any, of plaintiff naturally resulting from his silicosis, if any.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-7\">\u201cAnswer YES or NO.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b25-8\">No. 2 was conditioned on a \u201cYes\u201d answer to No. 1 and enquired as to the \u201cpercentage\u201d of the mentioned contribution of tuberculosis to <em>disability from silicosis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b25-9\">Respondent\u2019s pleading as to occupational disease made no mention of tuberculosis, petitioner, on the other hand, having pleaded \u201cpre-existing tubercular disease\u201d as the sole cause, or alternatively, \u201ca contributing cause of his present disability, if any he has.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b25-10\">As before indicated, respondent undoubtedly had tuberculosis, the petitioner\u2019s medical witness testifying that he had it and nothing else, while respondent\u2019s proof pointed to a moderate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>case, probably attributable to a rather long standing condition of silicosis, and arrested in its progress at the time of trial. With the possible exception of this latter testimony, there was none purporting to allocate percentage-wise, as between the two illnesses, responsibility for respondent\u2019s disability or to specify the amount of influence, if any, either illness had on the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-3\">The jury submission (on the occupational disease claim) consisted of Special Issues Nos. 11 through 28. Nos. 11 through 21 dealt with whether respondent had silicosis, whether disability resulted therefrom and, if so, whether the latter was permanent or temporary and total or partial. Nos. 22 and 23 dealt with the conditions provided in Sec. 26(b), supra. Nos. 24 through 27 .enquired as to whether respondent had <em>tuberculosis, </em>as to its relationship with his silicosis, if any, and whether tuberculosis was not the sole cause of disability. No. 28 enquired as to exposure prior to his employment with Trojan as the sole cause of his silicosis. Nos. 25 and 26 presented the questions answered by the heretofore quoted finding that respondent\u2019s <em>silicosis </em>contributed to his <em>tuberculosis </em>by 5 percent, although, as indicated, there was no pleading of any such fact by either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">The core of Sec. 22, supra, is its final provision that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-5\">\u201c* * the number of weeks of compensation payable * * * shall be reduced and limited to such proportion only of the total number of weeks * * * that would be payable if the occupational disease were the sole cause of the incapacity or death, as such occupational disease, as a causative factor, bears to all the causes of such incapacity or death * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">This reduction of compensation is said to follow :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-7\">\u201cWhere an <em>occupational disease </em>(e.g. silicosis) is aggravated by any other (sic) noncompensable disease (e.g. tuberculosis) <em>or </em>where <em>incapacity </em>\u2014 from <em>any </em>other noncompensable cause, (e.g. tuberculosis) is aggravated, * * * or in anywise contributed to by an occupational disease\u201d (e.g. silicosis; emphasis and parentheses supplied.).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b26-8\">This section appears to make a deliberate and radical difference between the law applicable to occupational disease and that concerning industrial accident, where the erstwhile compensable event or disability may be affected by a noncompensable factor. There is no comparable provision in the law concerning industrial accident. For example, when the claimant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>suffers an injurious fall while at work he is compensated without regard to the fact that the fall would not have occurred but for an attack of epilepsy. Garcia v. Texas Indemnity Ins. Co., 146 Texas 413, 209 S.W. 2d 333. For another example, where an industrial accident and heart disease together cause the employee\u2019s death, compensation is paid just as if the heart disease had no connection with the matter. Texas Employers Ins. Ass\u2019n v. Smith, 235 S.W. 2d 234, Texas Civ. App., writ of er. refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-3\">The section is somewhat confusing, due to its apparently alternative provision (in the last quotation above) for (a) aggravation of occupational (compensable) <em>disease </em>by noncompensable disease, and for (b) aggravation of <em>disability </em>from noncompensable disease or other source by occupational disease. These seemingly alternative situations are both given the one consequence of calculating compensation on the basis of the relative causal contribution to <em>disability </em>of the two respective types of illness. Evidently the intent is that where both types contribute to whatever disability the claimant suffers, compensation shall be allowed in the degree, but only that degree, in which the occupational disease <em>contributes to the incapacity.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">Submitted issues 25 and 26 were in terms of alternative (a) in that they inquired only as to aggravation of a <em>disease </em>as distinguished from <em>incapacity; </em>and yet the \u201caggravated\u201d disease inquired about was not the occupational one, but the tuberculosis. These issues were not proper respondent\u2019s issues under the pleadings, since respondent\u2019s pleadings were based on silicosis as the sole producing cause of disability, while those of petitioner naturally did not claim an aggravation of tuberculosis by silicosis, but rather the aggravation of disability or of silicosis by tuberculosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">As to petitioner\u2019s refused issues, the subject matter in general was appropriate to its theory of the case, being defensive to a claim of disability from occupational disease and designed to defeat or reduce that claim by attributing at least part of respondent\u2019s disability to a noncompensable disease. The real contribution of each illness to <em>disability </em>is the basic factor, and issues which give the jury a fair chance to settle that question are all that can be required without drawing the lines of the submission so fine as to be confusing to the average man. The petitioner\u2019s tendered issues met this test.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">We accordingly consider also that petitioner\u2019s pleading of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>\u201cpre-existing tubercular disease\u201d as the sole or \u201ca contributing cause\u201d of responednt\u2019s disability was adequate to raise the defense in question.</p>\n<p id=\"Av\">Was the defense raised also by evidence? There was, indeed, none which assigned any particular percentage less than 100 to tuberculosis as a real cause of the disability. On the other hand, we do have respondent\u2019s evidence of the co-existence of both illnesses at the time of disability, and petitioner\u2019s evidence attributing all disability to tuberculosis. In our opinion this was some evidence of probative force from which the jury could draw a reasonable inference that tuberculosis contributed in some degree to respondent\u2019s disability, and the jury should have been permitted to determine the percentage of the contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">The fact that the trial court actually treated findings Nos. 25 and 26 as requiring a 5 percent reduction under Sec. 22, when the true effect of such findings would be rather to increase recovery, does not, of course, render harmless the error of refusing petitioner\u2019s proper issues. These were designed to effect a reduction on a different theory and might well have produced one larger than 5 percent. Nor can we go along with the respondent\u2019s argument that the submission of Nos. 25 and 26, as a matter of logic, forecloses additional issues under Sec. 22. It is enough to say here that the erroneous submission of Nos. 25 and 26 does not deprive the petitioner of its rights to submission of its own proper issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">The judgments below are reversed and the cause is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">Associate Justice Walker not sitting.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">Opinion delivered November 10, 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">Rehearing overruled December 15, 1954.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b16-10\">. \u2014 \u201cSec. 21.
