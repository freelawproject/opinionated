A. King to Chaim Skinner, dated March 29, 1878, and recorded in Vol. 40, page 328, of the Deed Records of Grayson County, Texas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>Noland claims title under a warranty deed which described the property conveyed as follows: \u201cAll that certain tract or parcel of land out of the M. B. Lamar Survey, Abstract No. 704, situated in the County of Grayson, State of Texas. It is the intention of this deed to convey my one-third interest in and to the above described property * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">After the testimony was in the parties agreed that there was no fact issue for the jury, whereupon the court withdrew the case from the jury and entered judgment for respondent. The Court of Civil Appeals affirmed. 277 S.W. 2d 812.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Petitioners contend that the above-described deed from Skinner to Noland does \u201cnot contain within itself an independently sufficient description of any land\u201d and \u201ccontains no reference to any other existing writing for a further description.\u201d This contention recognizes the long-settled rule permitting resort to extraneous evidence to aid in description in an ambiguous deed so as to make it sufficient under Art. 1288, R.S. 1925, of our Statutes of Conveyances. See Matney v. Odom, 147 Texas 26, 210 S.W. 2d 980, and the many cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Petitioners argue that there is no \u201ckey\u201d in the deed here in question to which extraneous evidence may be directly tried to determine the interest of the grantor. In support they cite Carter &amp; Bro. v. Ewers, 133 Texas 616, 131 S.W. 2d 86. In that case the language was \u201can undivided interest in and to be subdivision of 200 acres of a Survey in the name of Swiny situated in the County of Polk, State of Texas.\u201d We held that the language offered no key because it is nowhere indicated what undivided interest was meant and there were no words of ownership in the grantor.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">The language here is different. It plainly says that the land is \u201cout of the M. B. Lamar Survey, Abstract No. 704, situated in the County of Grayson, State of Texas.\u201d In the second sentence, supra, grantor says that he intends to convey his one-third interest in and to the above described property. Thus we are furnished a key in the language of the deed itself, susceptible of explanation by parol evidence, by which the property can be located on the ground. This coupled with the proof that the land in controversy was all the land he owned in Grayson County at the time of the deed, was a sufficient description. Pickett v. Bishop, 148 Texas 207, 223 S.W. 2d 222.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">It seems that the issue here was settled as long ago as 1895, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>in Curdy et al v. Stafford et al, 88 Texas 120, 30 S.W. 551. In that case Chief Justice Gaines said that an instrument which purports to convey that part of a certain tract which is owned and claimed by the grantor is not void upon its face, for it may be shown by extrinsic evidence what particular part grantor so owned and claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-3\">It follows that the judgments below are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">Opinion delivered July 27, 1955.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
