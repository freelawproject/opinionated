R. Maze, </em>Plaintiff and Respondent, v. <em>Arthur B. Langford, </em>as Sheriff of the County of Santa Clara, State of California, and <em>The American Bonding Company, </em>a Corporation, Defendants and Appellants,\u201d <em>[ante, </em>p. 743, 117 Pac. 929], which is an appeal from the same judgment, but taken by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-13\">As will be seen by reference to said opinion, the trial court found that the defendant Langford was not warranted in paying to E. Y. Burke the sum of $500\u2014the subject matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>of the action, and accordingly gave judgment for that sum in favor of plaintiff and against defendants, but refused to give plaintiff judgment for the twenty-five per cent damages and ten per cent per month interest provided for in section 4162 of the Political Code, to which he claimed to be also entitled. Both parties have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">We have this day decided in said ease numbered 826 that the stay bond on appeal was void, and that defendant Lang-ford was justified in paying to Burke the said sum of $500, and have accordingly reversed said judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">It follows that the plaintiff, not being entitled to the principal, has no valid claim to the incident thereto, i. e., the penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">Hall, J., and Lennon, P.
