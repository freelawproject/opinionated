Allstead, then a minor, of the age of about twenty years; that plaintiff paid to said Marshalls the entire consideration supporting the transfer of said property; that, on said thirty-first day of May, 1905, said Van C. Allstead \u201cagreed with and promised plaintiff that he would reconvey to plaintiff said real property at any time upon request of plaintiff\u201d; that on the twentieth day of January, 1906, said Van C. Allstead conveyed said property to the defendant, Elizabeth Laumeister, and it is charged in the complaint that said conveyance was brought about without the knowledge, acquiescence or consent of plaintiff, and through the act of said defendant in fraudulently representing to said Van C. Allstead that \u201cit was the will and desire of plaintiff that said Van C. Allstead transfer and convey said property to said Elizabeth Laumeister to be by her held in trust for said plaintiff, and by her reconveyed to plaintiff on demand. \u2019 \u2019 The complaint further states that said Van C. Allstead, for some six months prior to the date of the transfer of said property to said defendant, had resided with the latter at her home in San Francisco, and that \u201csaid Van C. Allstead and Elizabeth Laumeister during said time bore the relation to each other of foster mother and child; and during all of said time said Van C. Allstead reposed great trust and confidence in said Elizabeth Laumeister\u201d; that by reason of the confidence and trust so reposed in said Laumeister by said Van Allstead, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>and relying upon and believing in \u201csaid false and fraudulent statements of said Elizabeth. Laumeister,\u201d said Van Allstead, on the date heretofore mentioned, conveyed, by grant deed, said property to said Laumeister, without the knowledge, acquiescence or consent of plaintiff. The complaint further charges that the transfer to defendant of said property by said Van Allstead was without any consideration whatever, and that the sole purpose of said defendant in thus fraudulently obtaining a deed and title to said property was to cheat and defraud plaintiff out of his equitable title to the same, and without any intent on her part to reeonvey said property to plaintiff. On the first day of June, 1906, it is alleged, plaintiff demanded of defendant that she reeonvey said property to plaintiff, but that defendant then, and has ever since, refused to convey said property to said plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">The answer specifically denies all the material averments of the complaint, and, additionally, sets up several special defenses, of which, except the one that follows, we deem it unnecessary, under our view of the case, to take special or any notice: \u201cThat at the time said plaintiff caused said William Marshall and wife to execute and deliver to plaintiff a grant deed of the premises in the complaint described to Van C. Allstead said plaintiff was indebted to various persons in divers sums of money, and that said plaintiff caused said deed from said William Marshall and wife to be made to said Van C. Allstead for the purpose and with the intent to hinder, delay and defraud the creditors of said plaintiff, of all which said Van C. Allstead had knowledge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">The court\u2019s findings are in favor of plaintiff on all the material issues, except the one responding to the foregoing allegation of the answer, and except, further, that the court does not find that the defendant, as alleged in. the complaint, procured Van C. Allstead to execute a transfer of the property to her by misrepresentation and fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Several of the important findings of the court, essential to the support of the judgment, if the judgment could be upheld at all, are assailed by the appellant; but an examination of the record will disclose that all the findings derive sufficient support from the evidence, much, it may here be stated,' to the disadvantage of the judgment in favor of the plaintiff; for the court found, upon the testimony of both the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>and Van C. Allstead, as follows: \u201cOn and prior to May 31, 1905, plaintiff was indebted to the Mission Loan and Home Association of San Francisco upon a deficiency judgment made and entered in favor of said association and against said plaintiff; that on said thirty-first day of May, 1905, said plaintiff purchased said real property of and from said William Marshall and Elise Marshall, and thereupon caused said William Marshall and Elise Marshall to execute and deliver to plaintiff a grant deed transferring and conveying the legal title to said property to Van C. Allstead, who was then and there the minor child of said plaintiff, <em>to conceal the fact of Ms ownership of said property from said association.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">In support of the foregoing findings, the record discloses the following testimony given by plaintiff: \u201cI paid $300, cash for the lot. . . . Had a conversation with my son, Van C. Allstead, immediately prior to the purchase of this property, relative to its purchase. ... I told him I had a show to buy a nice, cheap piece of property, and I thought I would take it, but I would make the deed in his name, as I had a little financial difficulty so I couldn\u2019t hold it myself. . . . There was a deficiency judgment lien against me. They had sold my place on a mortgage and didn\u2019t get enough for it, and they had a deficiency judgment against me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Van C. Allstead testified: \u201cHad a conversation with my father relative to the property in 1905, a few days before he purchased it. . . . Well, he said, \u2018Van, I am going to buy a piece of property; I got a good piece of property that I am going to purchase; I am going to have the Marshalls deed it over to you; I can\u2019t keep anything in my own name, as they are apt to take it away from me\u2019; he said, \u2018I am going to make this deed over to you, and I want you to give it back to me any time I want it,\u2019 and I said, \u2018All right, you can have it.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">It is plainly evident, from the foregoing testimony and the findings educed therefrom, that the agreement between the plaintiff and his son, with respect to the property in controversy, comes within the maxim, <em>\u201cEx turpi causa non oritur actio,\u201d </em>and cannot be sustained or executed at the suit of plaintiff, without a clear violation of the fundamental conceptions of equity jurisprudence. (Pomeroy\u2019s Equity Jurisprudence, sec. 397.) That author, in the same section, thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>states the rule as to the application of the equitable maxim, \u201cHe who comes into equity must come with clean hands\u201d: \u201cIt says that whenever a party, who, as <em>actor, </em>seeks to set the judicial machinery in motion and 'obtain some remedy, has violated conscience, or good faith, or other equitable principle, in his prior conduct, then the doors of the court will be shut against him <em>in limine; </em>the court will refuse to interfere on his behalf, to acknowledge his right, or to award him any remedy. \u2019 \u2019 As seen,, the court did not find that the defendant procured the execution of the deed to her by Van Allstead by misrepresentation and fraud, as charged in the complaint, and it may be remarked that, so far as plaintiff is concerned, it would make no difference whether the court had so found. The plaintiff\u2019s conduct in making the arrangement with his son for a conveyance of the property to him whenever he might demand it was conceived and founded in fraud\u2014in an intent to defraud creditors\u2014and there was nothing that either the son or third parties might do with respect to the property or its disposition that could relieve him from the consequences of his unconscientious part in the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">The court, however, found as follows with reference to the transfer of the property by Van Allstead to defendant: \u201cThat thereafter, and on the twentieth day of January, 1906, at said city and county of San Francisco, said Van C. Allstead conveyed said property to Elizabeth Laumeister, to be by her held in trust for said plaintiff, and by her reeonveyed to plaintiff on demand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Thus it will be observed that the transaction between the defendant and Van Allstead merely resulted in transferring to her shoulders the obligations of the trust created by the plaintiff and accepted by his son. The son testified that he well knew and understood the purpose for which the plaintiff had the property put in his name. He knew the purpose of the trust was to defraud the creditors of the trustor, and under those circumstances and to aid the trustor in perpetrating the fraud he accepted the trust. The defendant having assumed the obligations of the trust\u2014that is, having, according to the finding on that proposition, taken the property upon an agreement to execute the terms of the trust according to their original tenor\u2014took the legal title for the purpose of executing such trust with all the infirmities characterizing said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>trust from its very inception. It may be true that, although Van Allstead stood <em>in pari delicto </em>to the fraud, the defendant would not sustain that relation thereto unless she accepted the trust with notice or knowledge of its fraudulent character or that its purpose was to defraud third parties; still, nevertheless, the transaction between plaintiff: and his son was so tainted with corruption that its nature as thus characterized could not be changed, however many times the property might be transferred, except where conveyed to an innocent purchaser for value and without notice or knowledge of the fraud. In other words, it is obviously immaterial, so far as the plaintiff\u2014the <em>actor </em>in this suit\u2014is concerned, whether the defendant stood or did not stand <em>in pari delicto </em>to the fraudulent creation of the trust which she accepted from Van Allstead and promised to execute. The question whether she stood <em>in pari delicto </em>to the fraudulent contract or as a <em>particeps criminis </em>in the fraud giving rise to it could be material only where she was also seeking affirmative relief as to the property, in which case, should she be found, equally with plaintiff, to be a party to the fraud, a court of equity would refuse to interfere in behalf of either.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">But, in the case at bar, the plaintiff, according to his own admissions and the findings- of the court, was a <em>particeps doli </em>in the transaction, and, therefore, regardless of whether the defendant knew of the fraudulent creation of' the trust when the duty of its execution was transferred to her, by her own consent, it may be, he is in no position to ask a court of equity to restore him to rights of which he, <em>ex industria, </em>divested himself in order to defraud others. \u201cIf a contract has been entered into through fraud, or to accomplish any fraudulent purpose, a court of equity will not, at the suit of one of the fraudulent <em>parties\u2014a particeps </em>doli\u2014while the agreement is still executory, either compel its execution or decree its cancellation, nor after it has been executed, set it aside, and thus restore the plaintiff to the property or other interests Which he had fraudulently transferred.\u201d (Pomeroy\u2019s Equity Jurisprudence, sec. 401, and cases cited in footnote thereof.) In other words, as the same author declares, \u201cany really unconscientious conduct, connected with the controversy to which he is a party, will repel him from the forum whose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>very foundation is good conscience.\u201d And, in <em>Alaniz </em>v. <em>Casenave, </em>91 Cal. 47, [27 Pac. 521, 523], Judge Temple said that \u201ccourts will not allow a trust to be proven by a party to the fraud, if the trust was created for a fraudulent purpose.\u201d Many other cases affirming the doctrine as thus stated may be found in the California reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">It is very true that it may be looked upon as a harsh rule that will permit one not entitled to property to maintain a good title thereto by reason of the fraud of the person from whom he has obtained it without having paid any consideration therefor. The practical effect of this decision, unless the plaintiff has some efficacious legal remedy that will relieve him of his dilemma, will be to confirm title in the defendant, unless the claims of the creditors of plaintiff are yet alive, in which event the property may be pursued and seized to satisfy such claims. But, even if, under the circumstances here, the defendant may in effect be sustained in her fraudulent claim to the title to the property in dispute, on the other hand the harshness of such consequence falls upon one who would fraudulently conceal his property so as to escape the just demands of those having a claim upon it. The lien of the deficiency judgment against plaintiff, presumably alive when the fraudulent trust was created, would have attached to this property immediately had the deed from the Marshalls been executed in his name. This proposition he well understood, and now, if a court of equity will not, .as it cannot, lend its aid to the consummation of his fraud, the penalty he must suffer can hardly be said to be unjust, even though one n\u00fat legally entitled to do so may reap the fruits thereof. If the defendant may claim that he has suffered through the perfidy of his trustee, his creditors can likewise say that they have suffered through his perfidy. In any event, as stated, a court of conscience cannot consistently with \"the very principles which have occasioned its existence lend its aid to relieve a party from the results of his own- fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Chipman, P. J., and Burnett, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
