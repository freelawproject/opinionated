The cause came on for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>trial before the court without a jury upon the issues made by. the complaint and the answer thereto. It appears from the bill of exceptions that the plaintiff offered testimony sufficient to support the material allegations of the complaint\u2014showing the execution of the contract, the payment of ten dollars as part payment for the land, a tender of the balance and a demand for a deed. The evidence shows that the contract in question was executed in duplicate, being made out on a printed blank. The printed blank provided that the vendee should have ten days in which to examine the title to the property, but in the plaintiff\u2019s duplicate of the executed contract the word \u201cten\u201d was crossed out and the word \u201csixty\u201d substituted in pencil. Plaintiff testified that the same change had been made in the vendor\u2019s (defendants\u2019) duplicate, the change in both having been made before execution. The vendors produced their contract, which showed no such change, and denied that they had ever agreed with the vendee that he should have more than ten days in which to examine title. Under this state of the evidence the plaintiff requested the court to take an adjournment until the following morning, and in this connection the record shows as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-4\">\u201cMr. Coil (Plaintiff\u2019s Counsel): ... If you will continue the matter until 9:30 to-morrow morning I will have the witnesses here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-5\">\u201cMr. Coghlan (Defendants\u2019 Attorney) : What do you want them to testify?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-6\">\u201cMr. Coil: I want them to testify, that they saw the original contract, that the word \u2018sixty\u2019 was in the original contract at the time it was signed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-7\">\u201cThe Court: If on your side the word \u2018sixty\u2019 was written in there as an after consideration, you lose; if on the other side they erased whatever was in the copy, those sixty days, they lose. That is all I have got to decide in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-8\">\u201cMr. Coil: Well, I contend, if the word \u2018sixty\u2019 was in the original contract at the time the party to be charged signed it, although the copy by inadvertence might have omitted it, that the original contract would be good.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-9\">\u201cThe Court: No, if that is the fact I will resolve it against you, because business men should not do business that way, and if business men cannot be taught in any other way than by a case in court, let them learn the lesson there. If this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>original and the copy contained the word \u2018sixty\u2019 you win; if one did not contain it, and it has not been erased, you lose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">An adjournment was then taken, and the trial resumed on the following morning, when plaintiff introduced evidence tending to show that the word \u201csixty\u201d had been substituted in pencil for the printed word \u201cten\u201d in both duplicates of the contract, and that this pencil change had been subsequently erased in the copy of the contract retained by the vendors.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">In this condition of the evidence, and without any motion or request made by the defendants, the court ordered the action dismissed without costs to either party. No exception was taken to this order, and the order dismissing the action was entered in the minutes of the court November 22, 1908.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">The plaintiff thereafter, on December 10, 1906, moved the court to set aside its order dismissing said action, and to render a decision on the merits and file its written findings of fact, which motibn, after submission by the parties, was denied, and subsequently a judgment of dismissal without costs was duly entered by the clerk of said court.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">Plaintiff appeals from said judgment, and urges in support of his appeal that the decision is against law, and that it was the duty of the court, upon the submission of the cause, to render a judgment upon the merits and file its written findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">Prior to the amendment of section 647, Code of Civil Procedure, in 1909, it was necessary in order to protect the right of appeal to reserve an exception to an order on a motion for nonsuit. <em>(Martin </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Co., </em>150 Cal. 130, 131, [88 Pac. 701]; <em>Hanna </em>v. <em>De Garmo, </em>140 Cal. 172, [73 Pac. 830]; <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Hesperia etc. Co., </em>107 Cal. 675, [40 Pac. 1057]; <em>Warner </em>v. <em>Darrow, </em>91 Cal. 309, [27 Pac. 737].) This case was tried before the enactment of said amendment, and defendant contends that the judgment was a judgment of dismissal authorized by subdivision 5 of section 581, Code of Civil Procedure, and that the defendant having failed to note an exception to the order, waived his right to object thereto and to have the order reviewed on appeal. Said subdivision of section 581 reads as follows: \u201cAn action may be dismissed, or a judgment of nonsuit entered, in the following cases: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>... 5. By the court, upon motion of defendant, when upon the trial the plaintiff fails to prove a sufficient case for the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Here both parties had introduced all their evidence touching the material issues in the case; the evidence introduced by plaintiff was ample to support a judgment in his favor, and as no motion was made by defendant for a judgment of dismissal upon the ground that plaintiff had failed to prove a sufficient ease, or upon any other ground, we think the judgment in this case, irrespective of what it is called, must be regarded as a final decision, and as such, of course, \u201cis deemed excepted to.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 647.) While a nonsuit may, under the provisions of section 581, be granted on motion after the evidence for both sides is closed <em>(Toulouse </em>v. <em>Pare, </em>103 Cal. 251, [37 Pac. 146]), that section does not purport to warrant a nonsuit except <em>upon a motion of the defendant </em>\u201cwhen upon the trial the plaintiff fails to prove a sufficient case.\u201d <em>(Estate of Higgins, </em>156 Cal. 257, 260, [104 Pac. 6]; <em>Hanover Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Shrader et al., 11 </em>Tex. Civ. App. 255, 260, [31 S. W. 1100, 32 S. W. 344]; <em>Burns </em>v. <em>REodefer, </em>15 Nev. 59, 63; 14 Cyc. 458.) And where, as here, a judgment, although it is termed a \u201cdismissal,\u201d is in fact a final decision of the case, and not a mere order of nonsuit or dismissal made in accordance with the provisions of section 581, it will be treated as a final judgment. <em>(Wood, Curtis &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Mo. Pac. Ry. Co., </em>152 Cal. 344, 347, [92 Pac. 868].) .The judgment being on the merits of the case, and no findings having been filed, the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Some suggestion is made that if the judgment should be considered as a final judgment, and regarding it as such, we must presume that findings were waived; and it is contended that the record does not show that they were not waived. In our opinion, the rule does not apply. We have often said, and it is the rule, that where it becomes necessary on an appeal from a judgment on the judgment-roll, or where other questions are raised exclusive of the question as to whether or not the findings support the judgment or the evidence supports the findings, we will, in the absence of a showing to the contrary, presume that findings were waived. But that rule has never been carried to the extent of presuming that findings had been waived where the only reasonable inference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>that can be drawn from the record is directly to the contrary. In this case, while the bill of exceptions does not show whether findings were waived or not, the order of -the court summarily dismissing the action, and the views expressed by the court, show that he acted upon an erroneous idea as to the law and as to his right to dismiss the action. It was dismissed in open court while the parties were present and the court termed it an order dismissing the action, and remarked that neither party would recover posts. Not only this, but the record shows that the plaintiff made a motion for an order vacating \u25a0the order made by the court dismissing said action, and asking the court to render judgment on the merits and file written findings of fact, which motion, as we have seen, the court denied. We do not think that any fair-minded person can say, in the face of this record, and in view of the order made by the court refusing to vacate or set aside the order of dismissal, and refusing to make and file findings, that findings were waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The respondents urge that the court\u2019s order dismissing the action may be upheld for the reason that the description of the real property as contained in the contract is too uncertain to entitle the plaintiff to a decree of specific performance, and that therefore the complaint did not state a cause of action\u2014 which defect may be urged at any time. But in the case of <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Howell, </em>154 Cal. 372, [97 Pac. 885], it was held that in such a case the description may be aided by evidence of extrinsic facts. Such evidence was introduced in the present case, and removed any uncertainty as to the lot of land sought to be recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Lennon, P. J., and Hall, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">A petition to have the cause heard in the supreme court, after judgment in the district court of appeal, was denied by the supreme court on August 25, 1911.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
