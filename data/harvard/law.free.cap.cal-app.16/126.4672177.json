Plaintiff prays for the writ of this court compelling defendant to set aside its order dismissing the appeal of plaintiff her\u00e9in, in a certain action wherein J. J. Smalley is plaintiff and John June, plaintiff herein, is defendant, from an alleged judgment made and entered in the justice\u2019s court of Cloverdale township, Sonoma county, in favor of said Smalley, and directing defendant to proceed to the hearing and trial of said action of <em>Smalley </em>v. <em>June.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">It appears that in said action a trial was had by a jury and, on July 20, 1910, the jury rendered the following verdict: \u201cWe, the jury, find for the plaintiff according to the complaint. J. A. Linde, Foreman. \u2019 \u2019 In the justice\u2019s docket there is an entry of July 20, 1910, reciting that the case was called at 9 o\u2019clock A. M. of that day, a jury impaneled to try the case (naming the members) and, \u201cafter argument by counsel the case was submitted to the jury; after being out a half hour the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff.\u201d No other proceedings were taken by the justice and no other entry was made in his docket except that it appears from defendant\u2019s answer herein that the said justice entered judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>ment on the verdict on December 30, 1910, and it is conceded that the justice neither rendered nor entered any judgment on the verdict except as last above stated. On July 22, 1910, defendant in that action, plaintiff now here, filed his notice of appeal to the superior court, \u201con questions of both law and fact,\u201d and on July 23, 1910, filed with said justice an undertaking, reciting the amount of the alleged judgment, to wit, $110.29, principal, and $53, costs, and claiming a stay of execution and obligating the sureties in the sum of $300 and reciting that said sureties \u201cpromise on the part of the said appellant that the said appellant will pay the amount of said judgment so appealed from and all costs, if the appeal is withdrawn or dismissed, or the amount of any judgment and all costs that may be recorded against him in the action in said superior, court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">On July 26, 1910, the justice transmitted to said superior court a certified copy of his docket in said action, and the pleadings, all notices, motions and other papers in said cause, the notice of appeal and the undertaking filed therein, all of which were received by the clerk of said superior court on said last-named day.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Defendant in the said action having failed to pay the clerk\u2019s fees and having taken no further steps to prosecute his appeal, the plaintiff in that action paid the clerk\u2019s fees, on December 8, 1910, and served and filed his motion in said superior court that he would move to dismiss said appeal \u201cfor failure to prosecute the same, and for unnecessary delay in bringing the said action to hearing. The said motion will be heard on the papers in the case.\u201d On January 4, 1911, the court made an order dismissing the appeal, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">It is claimed by respondent here that at the time defendant in the action, <em>Smalley </em>v. <em>June, </em>took his appeal, no judgment had been entered on the verdict and the attempted appeal was ineffectual for any purpose and the superior court was without jurisdiction to hear and determine the case and rightly dismissed the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">It is also claimed that the undertaking is insufficient, there being no separate bond to cover costs on appeal as required by section 978, Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">Section 974, Code of Civil Procedure, provides that: \u201cAny person dissatisfied with a judgment rendered in a civil action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>in a police or justice\u2019s court, may appeal therefrom to the superior court of the county, at any time within thirty days after the rendition of the judgment.\u201d And the notice must state whether \u201cthe appeal is taken from the whole or a part of the judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Section 891, Code of Civil Procedure, reads: \u201cWhen a'trial by a jury has been had, judgment must be entered by the justice at once, in conformity with the verdict.\u201d And the judgment \u201cmust be entered substantially in the form required in section 667. ... No judgment shall have effect for any purpose until so entered.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 893.)</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">It seems to us that the appeal was prematurely taken and that the superior court did not acquire jurisdiction thereby. <em>Montgomery </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>68 Cal. 407, [9 Pac. 720], is cited by petitioner in support of the claim that the verdict was a judgment within the meaning of the statute. In that case the justice\u2019s docket contained the following entry: \u201cJury fees paid by defendant and judgment entered for the defendant for costs of suit. Defendant\u2019s costs being $25, for witness and jury fees, and also the sum of $1.75 for constable fees; total $26.75. Plaintiff\u2019s costs being $17.\u201d It further appears that the petitioner went to trial in the superior court and, without objection to the regularity of any proceedings, defended the case on its merits. Said the court: \u201cHaving thus taken the chances of obtaining a verdict in his favor, we think his objection now comes too late.\u201d It was also held that the court had jurisdiction because the justice\u2019s record showed \u201cthat a judgment had been entered in conformity with the verdict, and appears to be in all respects regular and sufficient.\u201d We do not think that the justice must formulate a judgment with that particularity required of judgments required to be entered in the superior court, but that, he should make some entry in his docket showing that he has rendered judgment on the verdict we do think is essential to a substantial compliance with the statute. His duty to enter judgment is in a sense ministerial, and its performance could probably be enforced by mandate, but, nevertheless, the statute requires this of him. Until such entry is made there is no judgment from which an appeal may be taken and, if the appeal is taken before the justice enters judgment on the verdict, it confers no jurisdiction on the superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>It follows that, as the superior court acquired no jurisdiction by the attempted appeal, this court cannot give it jurisdiction through the means of the writ prayed for; and this is true although the motion to dismiss was not made on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">It is not necessary to pass upon the sufficiency of the undertaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">The writ is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">Burnett, J., and Hart, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
