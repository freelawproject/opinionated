The cause was upon the calendar of this court for argument last September, and was then continued for the term. It was again called for argument on January 23d of this year. No argument was made on behalf of appellant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>and there being no brief on file, appellant was given twenty days in which to file a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">No brief has since been filed, and no extension of time has been asked.
