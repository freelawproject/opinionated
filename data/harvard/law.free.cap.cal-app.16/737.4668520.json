We do not understand that any duty is placed upon the court to search the transcript for possible errors where the defendant fails to make an appearance by counsel. On the contrary, we feel.at liberty to affirm the judgment and order \u25a0without an examination of the testimony or rulings of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">in the present case, however, we have read the testimony and noted the rulings of the court during the progress of the trial and have also examined the instructions given to the jury. The defendant appears to have had a fair trial; the jury were fully and correctly instructed as to the law and the evidence was sufficient to justify the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">The judgment and order are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">Hart, J., and Burnett, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
