L. c. 200A, and the unclaimed funds law, G. L. c. 175, \u00a7\u00a7 149A-149D.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">The Treasurer is claiming funds represented by uncashed checks issued by John Hancock, covering its obligations for such items as accident and health insurance payments, life insurance proceeds, agent commissions, salaries, and vendor payments.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If a check remained uncashed for six years after its issuance, John Hancock transferred the sum to its general funds as income for the benefit of its policyholders. John Hancock continued to maintain a separate computer record, however, containing information about the transactions for which the checks were written, and continued to honor those checks presented for payment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">Both the Treasurer and John Hancock moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of John Hancock\u2019s obligation to report and remit specified funds, amounting to, $2,975,816.67, under G. L. c. 200A, \u00a7 7, for the years 1969 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>through 1979, and under G. L. c. 175, \u00a7\u00a7 149A-149D, for the years 1963 to 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">The Treasurer asserts that instead of retaining the funds, John Hancock should have turned them over to the Commonwealth, accompanied by descriptive reports, as required by G. L. c. 200A, and G. L. c. 175, \u00a7\u00a7 149A-149D.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> John Hancock denies the Treasurer\u2019s allegations and raises several defenses, including a claim that the Treasurer lacked standing to bring this action, and that this action is barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">The judge ruled that under both statutes the Treasurer has standing to bring the action, and no statute of limitations bars the ability to recover funds from John Hancock. The judge also ruled that John Hancock is not required to report and remit funds under G. L. c. 200A, because, prior to 1980, \u00a7 5 of that statute did not apply to John Hancock. The judge reported the correctness of his rulings on the motions to the Appeals Court. Mass. R. Civ. P. 64, 365 Mass. 831 (1974). Both parties applied for direct appellate review, and we granted their applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">We affirm the judge\u2019s rulings on standing and on the statutes of limitations for both G. L. c. 200A, and G. L. c. 175, \u00a7\u00a7 149A-149D. However, we conclude that since G. L. c. 200A, \u00a7 5, is applicable to John Hancock, it is subject to the reporting and payment requirements of G. L. c. 200A, \u00a7 7. Therefore, the Treasurer\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">1. <em>Background of G. L. c. 200A and G. L. c. 175, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 <em>149A-149D. </em>The abandoned property law was first enacted in St. 1950, c. 801, and codified as G. L. c. 200A. Abandoned property is property whose owner is unknown or had neglected to claim it during a specific number of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>years known as a \u201cdormancy\u201d period.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section 7 requires persons and most other entities holding abandoned property to report and remit it to the Treasurer.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Sections 1 through 6 of G. L. c. 200A define the various types of property presumed abandoned. The remaining sections provide for procedures to reunite missing owners with the surrendered property, and provide for interpretation and enforcement of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">The unclaimed funds law, codified as G. L. c. 175, \u00a7\u00a7 149A-149D, inserted by St. 1946, c. 455, and amended by St. 1950, c. 523, applies only to life insurance companies and, until 1980, was enforced by the Commissioner of Insurance. See St. 1980, c. 130, \u00a7 15. Unclaimed funds are also property whose owner is unknown or has neglected to claim it for a specified dormancy period.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Section 149A specifies the types of unclaimed funds governed by the act; \u00a7 149B requires reports of unclaimed funds; \u00a7 149C requires surrender of reported funds to the Commonwealth; and \u00a7 149D gives custody of those funds to the Commonwealth, while indemnifying the insurance companies. During the years in question, the Commissioner of Insurance made triennial examinations of John Hancock\u2019s books to ensure its compliance with this and other laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">The unclaimed funds and abandoned property laws were consolidated in 1980 by St. 1980, c. 130. That statute places all enforcement responsibility for both laws in the office of the Treasurer.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>2. <em>Standing. </em>John Hancock claims that the Treasurer lacks standing to pursue this action under both G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 149E, and G. L. c. 200A, \u00a7 12 <em>(b). </em>These provisions were added and amended, respectively, when the unclaimed funds and abandoned property laws were revised and consolidated by St. 1980, c. 130. The issue is whether the standing sections now prevent the Treasurer from bringing actions to recover funds not properly reported prior to May 5, 1980, the effective date of the 1980 act. We conclude that the Treasurer has standing to pursue the Commonwealth\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Section 149E,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which was inserted in G. L. c. 175 by St. 1980, c. 130, \u00a7 2, provides that the Treasurer may bring an action to obtain reports of unclaimed funds, as required by G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 149B, and to demand the surrender of the funds detailed within those reports. John Hancock argues that \u00a7 149E has no retroactive effect and, therefore, cannot be used to give the Treasurer standing on claims arising prior to 1980. However, the Legislature provided in \u00a7 16<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> of St. 1980, c. 130, that the earlier \u00a7 149A governs unclaimed funds which were reportable prior to May 5, 1980. Prospective compliance with the unclaimed funds law is governed by G. L. c. 200A, \u00a7 5A. That section incor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>porated the unclaimed funds law into the abandoned property law, effective May 5, 1980. Thus, as we read the statute, the Legislature intended that the new \u00a7 5A would operate prospectively, while \u00a7 149E would operate retrospectively. Retroactive application of \u00a7 149E to G. L. c. 175, \u00a7\u00a7 149A-149D, is therefore the only construction of the statute \u201cin harmony with common sense and sound reason <em>.\u2019\u2019Johnson\u2019s Case, </em>318 Mass. 741, 746 (1945), quoting <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Weymouth, </em>279 Mass. 486, 492 (1932). This construction is consistent with the obvious legislative intent not to permit the forfeiture of the Commonwealth\u2019s claims to unclaimed and abandoned property which should have been, but were not, reported and remitted by holders.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">John Hancock also claims that prior to the 1980 enactment of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 149E, no statute gave the Treasurer the standing to sue for violations of \u00a7 149B, and that, therefore, the Treasurer may not retroactively be given standing to enforce that provision. However, we interpret St. 1980, c. 130, as merely making a housekeeping shift in enforcement responsibility from the Commissioner of Insurance to the Treasurer, through amendments to G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 149B, and insertion of \u00a7 149E. We believe that the change in the official responsible for enforcement does not create a new cause of action, but merely provides for more vigorous enforcement of existing claims. The Legislature makes clear its intention to give the Treasurer retrospective as well as prospective enforcement authority by requiring the Commissioner of Insurance to transfer the records filed pursuant to \u00a7 149B before May 5, 1980, to the Treasurer. See St. 1980, c. 130, \u00a7 15. The words of the statute \u201care to be considered in the light of the obvious aim to be accomplished by the Legislature and as employed by the Legislature as expressing the practical means by which the legislative aim is to be attained.\u201d <em>Sun Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. on the Necessaries of Life, </em>340 Mass. 235, 238 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>Statute 1980, c. 130, also amended G. L. c. 200A, \u00a7 12 (6),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> giving the Treasurer standing to bring an action to collect abandoned property. John Hancock asserts that the amended \u00a7 12 <em>(b) </em>repeals and replaces the former version of that section, thereby preventing the use of the old section to give the Treasurer standing for actions arising before May 5, 1980. The amendment, however, merely removed the requirement that the Treasurer examine the records of the holders of abandoned property, and does not affect his standing to bring actions.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">John Hancock\u2019s argument that retroactive enforcement of \u00a7 12 <em>(b) </em>violates due process principles must also fail. The essence of the defendant\u2019s claim is that there is due process protection for the right to violate a prior law. The cases John Hancock cites do not suport such a contention.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>In addition, to the extent that St. 1980, c. 130, brings new types of abandoned property within its scope, that property need only be reported retrospectively for the seven years prior to the effective date of the act.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, the statute, as we read it, continues retrospective enforcement for all property which was previously within the ambit of the statute. We conclude that the Legislature intended continued enforcement of the abandoned property and unclaimed funds laws prior to the effective date of St. 1980, c. 130, and the Treasurer has standing to effectuate the policies of those statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">3. <em>Statute of limitations. </em>John Hancock claims that the Treasurer\u2019s suit is barred by statutes of limitations, based on its interpretation of G. L. c. 200A, \u00a7 7 (c), as amended through St. 1969, c. 377, \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> At that time \u00a7 7 (c) read, \u201cNo person shall be required to report any property on a presumption of abandonment to the state treasurer if the period of time provided by any statute of limitations applicable to the owner\u2019s right as against a holder has expired unless the court orders him to do so.\u201d John Hancock claims that it need not report its contractual obligations under \u00a7 7 (c), because the six-year statute of limitations governing them under G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2, expired prior to the end of the ten or the fourteen year dormancy period, which was in effect until 1980. See note 4, <em>supra. </em>We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">The Legislature could not have meant to allow statutes of limitations governing the various types of property defined as abandoned in G. L. c. 200A, \u00a7\u00a7 1-6, to determine randomly the scope of the abandoned property law. Most typical statutes of limitations are shorter than the ten- or the fourteen-year dormancy periods in effect under the abandoned property and unclaimed funds laws. If John Hancock\u2019s argument were to prevail, no type of abandoned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>property subject to a typical statute of limitations could ever be collected by the Treasurer. Thus, John Hancock\u2019s construction of the statute would render the statute difficult, if not impossible, to enforce. It also would create a situation in which the purposes of the abandoned property act, to reunite the property with its owners and to employ the property for public purposes in the interim, could not be achieved. \u201cAn intention to enact a barren and ineffective provision is not lightly to be imputed to the Legislature.\u201d <em>Insurance Rating Bd. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>356 Mass. 184, 189 (1969). Therefore, we read \u00a7 7 (c) as applying only to that property for which the statute of limitations had expired as of the effective date of St. 1950, c. 801.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Under this interpretation, the purpose of \u00a7 7 (c) was to require only prospective reporting of abandoned property. In this way, no person or entity who had relied on the use of the funds after expiration of a statute of limitations and before passage of St. 1950, c. 801, would be disadvantaged. This interpretation is further supported by the repeal of this version of \u00a7 7 (c) in 1975, because that section had become an unnecessary anachronism by then. See St. 1975, c. 277, \u00a74.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">John Hancock also claims that this suit is barred by statutes of limitations accruing at the end of the dormancy period, and expiring before the Treasurer filed his complaint on December 23, 1980. John Hancock argues that the Treasurer\u2019s complaint is similar to one in tort for conversion, and therefore it is subject to the two- or three-year statute of limitations set forth in G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2A,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and applicable to the Commonwealth under G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 18. Under this argument, the Treasurer would be barred from recovering most of the funds reportable before 1980. Based on the language of the statute, we think that John Hancock\u2019s decision not to report any property presumed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>abandoned prevents it from using the statute of limitations as a defense.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">General Laws c. 200A, \u00a7 7 <em>(b),</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>as amended through St. 1969, c. 377, \u00a7 2, provides: \u201cAll property contained in said report [filed under \u00a77 <em>(b) </em>\u2018by September first of each year for the preceding July first\u2019] unless earlier claimed by the owner or his legal representative shall be turned over to the state treasurer on or before November first each year.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Thus, pursuant to the statute, the property does not become due until the report is filed. Until the property is owed to the Commonwealth, the statute of limitations does not begin to run.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Cases from other jurisdictions support our interpretation. See <em>Travelers Express Co. </em>v. <em>Cory, </em>664 F.2d 763 (9th Cir. 1981); <em>Blue Cross </em>v. <em>Cory, </em>120 Cal. App. 3d 723 (1981);<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>Sennett </em>v. <em>Insurance Co. of N. Am., </em>432 Pa. 525, 532-533 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>In addition, the concept of a statute of limitations is antithetical to the purposes of the abandoned property act. If we adopted John Hancock\u2019s construction of the statute, we would permit every entity to make a self-serving interpretation of the abandoned property and unclaimed funds laws, and to use that interpretation to its benefit by failing to report such property and barring any later enforcement to action by a statute of limitations. We are unwilling to attribute to the Legislature an intent to grant unfettered discretion to the holders of abandoned property to determine what property must be reported, and therefore what property is owed to the Commonwealth. We affirm the judge\u2019s ruling that no statute of limitations bars the Treasurer\u2019s action against John Hancock.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">4. <em>Liability. </em>The parties also dispute whether John Hancock\u2019s contractual obligations, evidenced by its uncashed checks, are defined to be abandoned property by G. L. c. 200A, \u00a7 5, and are thus subject to the reporting and payment provisions of \u00a7 7.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In 1969, at the time the law originally applied to John Hancock, \u00a7 5, as amended through St. 1962, c. 248, \u00a7 1, stated: \u201cExcept as provided in section six A, all dividends, stocks, bonds, money, credits and claims for money and credits, and all intangible personal property, and the increments of any of them, except deposits and the increments thereon referred to in selections three and four, held by, or in the control of, any person having a residence or principal place of business in this commonwealth, other than a corporation organized under the laws of another state, but including any fiduciary appointed in this commonwealth for such a corporation, for the benefit of any person, or held by, or in the control of, a corporation organized under the laws of another state, but having a place of business in this commonwealth, for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>benefit of any person whose last known residence or place of business was in this commonwealth, shall be presumed abandoned unless claimed by the beneficiary or person entitled thereto within fourteen years after the date prescribed for payment or delivery. Any dividend, distribution, interest or payment on principal declared, set aside, accumulated or owed with respect to property presumed abandoned under the foregoing provisions of this section shall itself be presumed abandoned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">The Treasurer argues that John Hancock\u2019s contractual obligations are \u201cintangible personal property,\u201d and therefore are subject to \u00a7 5 of the statute. We agree. Thus, we reject John Hancock\u2019s claim that, prior to 1980, \u00a7 5 applied only to fiduciaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">To support its interpretation, John Hancock points to language in the section referring to \u201cbeneficiaries\u201d and holding property \u201cfor the benefit of any person,\u201d claiming that this language limits the rest of the section.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> However, as we read the statute, its expressed intent is to include contractual obligations, a type of intangible personal property not typically held by fiduciaries.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>Our construction of the statute is supported by its references to \u201cdividends\u201d and to \u201ccredits and claims for money and credits,\u201d which generally refer to property held in a debtor-creditor relationship rather than in a trustee-beneficiary relationship. \u201c[I]n construing a statute, its words must be given their plain and ordinary meaning according to the approved usage of language.\u201d <em>Johnsons Case, </em>318 Mass. 741, 747 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Moreover the section specifically extends its scope beyond \u201cbeneficiaries\u201d to \u201cpersons entitled\u201d to the abandoned property. Thus, the statute, by its plain terms, encompasses persons other than beneficiaries. \u201cNone of the words of a statute is to be disregarded, for they are the main source for the ascertainment of the legislative purpose.\u201d <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation </em>v. <em>Chilton Club, </em>318 Mass. 285, 288 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Additionally, a 1958 amendment made G. L. c. 200A, \u00a7 5, applicable to nonresident corporate holders of abandoned property. See St. 1958, c. 283.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Had the Legislature intended \u00a7 5 to affect fiduciaries only, then that amendment would apply solely to the \u201cexotic\u201d set of property in trust funds for the benefit of Massachusetts residents held by incorporated fiduciaries from other States. We believe this construction is not consistent with the intent of the Legislature to reach both nonresident holders and beneficiaries, as well as Massachusetts residents and entities, prior to 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">Although there is no formal legislative history, \u201c[w]e have previously relied on [legislative documents and] materials in determining legislative intent.\u201d <em>Kartell </em>v. <em>Blue Shield of Mass. Inc., </em>384 Mass. 409, 420 (1981). A 1958 House document states that the proposed'amendment \u201cwould eliminate the requirement that the record owner of the property be resident of Massachusetts or have a place of business here, before property unclaimed for fourteen years would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>presumed to be abandoned. This change will accomplish two desirable objectives. It will permit corporations and trustees for liquidated corporations to terminate their responsibilty for dividends unclaimed for fourteen years by turning them over to the Commonwealth. By the same token, it will increase the revenue which the Commonwealth derives from the Abandoned Property Law.\u201d 1958 House Doc. No. 99, at 13. Thus, the Legislature did not intend to limit G. L. c. 200A, \u00a7 5, solely to property held in fiduciary capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">In interpreting the statute, we may also look to the original purposes of the act,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> as described in the Governor\u2019s Annual Message to the Legislature. \u201cWe may consider this [message] for any light it might shed on the resulting legislation.\u201d <em>Consolidated Cigar Corp. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>372 Mass. 844, 852 (1977). See <em>Kartell </em>v. <em>Blue Shield of Mass., Inc., </em>384 Mass. 409, 421-422 (1981); <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>373 Mass. 819, 826-827 (1977). In his January 4, 1950, message, Governor Paul A. Dever said: \u201cWe need to adopt a law which will cover the disposition of <em>all kinds </em>of abandoned and unclaimed property; will protect true owners\u2019 rights when and if they appear to substantiate their claims; and provide a smooth and simple procedure for transferring such property into the state treasury and out of the hands of those in unjust possession.\u201d See 1950 Sen. Doc. No. 1, at 22. See also 1958 House Doc. No. 99, at 13. Among the unjust possessors, he named banks, insurers, debtors, companies, and individuals. 1950 Sen. Doc. No. 1, at 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>The Governor\u2019s remarks clearly indicate that non-fiduciaries, such as insurers, were to be included within the scope of the act. The Governor stated that the other major purpose of the act was to bring additional revenues to the treasury. All of the purposes he described are served by G. L. c. 200A, \u00a7\u00a7 9, 10, 11, and 12, and by \u00a7 5, if the statute is read to include insurance companies and other nonfiduciaries. We cannot assume the Legislature ignored the Governor\u2019s request for broad legislation or limited the Governor\u2019s request in a statute passed shortly after his message, without expressing any limitations it imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Further, the magnitude of abandoned contractual obligations is so large, we think it implausible that the Legislature intended to exclude them from the statute, permitting \u201cchance enrichment of particular individuals or organizations,\u201d <em>Standard Oil Co. </em>v. <em>New </em>Jersey, 341 U.S. 428, 436 (1951), at the expense of the citizens of the Commonwealth. This is not consistent with the Legislature\u2019s intent that the Commonwealth benefit from abandoned property.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">John Hancock also attempts to support its interpretation by examining the Uniform Disposition of Unclaimed Property Act (UDUPA), 8 U.L.A. 73-113 (1966). In \u00a7 9, the UDUPA defines that property subject to abandonment as \u201c[a]ll intangible personal property, not otherwise covered by this Act . . . that is held or owing ... in the ordinary course of the holder\u2019s business.\u201d Section 7 of the UDUPA, on the other hand, applies to \u201c[a]ll intangible personal property . . . held in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of another person.\u201d John Hancock points to the absence of the \u201cheld or owing\u201d language of UDUPA \u00a7 9, from G. L. c. 200A, \u00a7 5, until it was amended by St. 1980, c. 130. John Hancock claims that by using \u201cheld by, or in the control of\u201d language in G. L. c. 200A, \u00a7 5, the Legislature intended to limit the section to intangible personal property held in a fiduciary capacity, as in UDUPA \u00a7 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">The short answer to this argument is that G. L. c. 200A, \u00a7 5, does not use the language \u201cin a fiduciary capacity,\u201d which is so essential to the limiting character of UDUPA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>\u00a7 7. Additionally, G. L. c. 200A, \u00a7 5, is similar to UDUPA \u00a7 9, not UDUPA \u00a7 7. The Commissioners\u2019 Note to UDUPA \u00a7 9, 8 U.L.A. at 94, indicates that it applies to stocks, dividends, and money, all of which are expressly subject to G. L. c. 200A, \u00a7 5.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Finally, John Hancock argues that the contractual obligations at issue are not \u201cintangible personal property,\u201d or that it does not \u201chold\u201d that property. John Hancock claims that the property is owned by the creditors or payees of its checks, and that it does not control that property. Relying on <em>Blue Cross </em>v. <em>Cory, </em>120 Cal. App. 3d 723, 736 (1981),<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> which discusses the applicability of the California version of the abandoned property law to uncashed benefit and vendor checks issued by Blue Cross, the Treasurer claims that the uncashed checks are intangible personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">We conclude that contractual obligations are \u201cintangible personal property,\u201d although the checks themselves are not, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>because that term encompasses the rights of a creditor. <em>Herman </em>v. <em>Connecticut Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>218 Mass. 181, 185-186 (1914). See <em>Kane </em>v. <em>Insurance Co. of N. Am., </em>38 Pa. Commw. 42, 44 (1978). The debt is \u201cowned\u201d by the payee of the check, but it is \u201cheld\u201d by John Hancock. The debt \u201cis not property in the hands of the debtor; but it is an obligation of the debtor . . . and power over the debtor at his domicil is control of the ordinary means of enforcement.\u201d <em>Bliss </em>v. <em>Bliss, </em>221 Mass. 201, 208 (1915). The Treasurer can only collect abandoned property by controlling those debtors or other holders. The focus of the statute is to reunite the owners with their property, and therefore it is irrelevant that John Hancock does not own the property. We conclude that G. L. c. 200A, \u00a7 5, applies to John Hancock.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">In light of our conclusion that the Treasurer has standing, and that this case is not barred by any statute of limitations, we affirm those rulings of the trial court. We reverse the ruling that G. L. c. 200A, \u00a7 5, does not apply to John Hancock and remand the case to the Superior Court for entry of a partial summary judgment on the reported questions and for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b427-11\"> The judge found that John Hancock issued the checks in several numbered series, to classify each check by the type of contractual obligation for which it was issued.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b427-12\"> The judge made no finding that John Hancock continued to honor its obligations represented by the uncashed checks, but this fact is undisputed on the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b428-9\"> John Hancock filed reports and remitted some funds to the Commonwealth pursuant to G.

We treat this argument in Part 3, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b432-9\"> The defendant also bases its due process argument on its reliance on past government actions indicating its compliance with the law, such as the triennial examinations of its records by the Commissioner of Insurance and early proposals by the Commissioner to amend the statute to close \u201cloopholes\u201d in the law. This argument must fail. \u201c[Administrative reliance cannot validate that which may be illegal.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Martignetti, </em>374 Mass. 784, 790 (1978).

See St. 1973, c. 777, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b435-6\"> Based on this interpretation, we need not and do not reach any of the arguments concerning John Hancock\u2019s waiver of its rights under the statute or the Treasurer\u2019s claim of fraudulent concealment. We also need not decide whether G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2, referring to contractual obligations, or G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2A, referring to tortious conversion, is the appropriate statute of limitations for an action brought by the Treasurer to obtain abandoned contractual obligations wrongfully withheld by their holder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b435-7\"> Our interpretation of G. L. c. 200A also applies to G. L. c. 175, \u00a7\u00a7 149A-149E, since \u00a7 149B has similar reporting requirements, and \u00a7 149C has similar remitting requirements, to those in G.

We believe this difference is minor. Our abandoned property reporting forms provide for reporting of property even when its status is questioned. Once reported, the Commonwealth and the holder may dispute the status of the property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b436-6\"> Other issues concerning John Hancock\u2019s liability under G. L. c. 175, \u00a7\u00a7 149A-149D, were not decided or reported by the judge. Hence, we reach only those issues decided by the judge and reported to the Appeals Court, pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 64, 365 Mass. 831 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b437-7\"> John Hancock also bolsters its interpretation of \u00a7 5 with its reading of \u00a7 7 (c), as discussed in Part 3, <em>supra </em>at 417-418. It argues that because \u00a7 7 (c) allows statutes of limitations on the underlying claims to bar the Commonwealth from collecting that abandoned property, \u00a7 5 would make more sense if read as applicable only to fiduciaries, for whom statutes of limitations may run less frequently. Since we have rejected John Hancock\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 7 (c), this argument also fails.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b437-8\"> Although here we are discussing \u00a7 5 as amended, our interpretation of the section also applies to the 1950 version of \u00a7 5, inserted by St. 1950, c. 801, which provided: \u201cAll dividends, stocks, bonds, money, credits and claims for money and credits, and all intangible personal property, and the increments of any of them, held by, or in the control of, any person for the benefit of a person residing or having a place of business in this commonwealth shall be presumed abandoned unless claimed by the beneficiary or person entitled thereto within fourteen years from the time the holder, trustee or other responsible person became obligated to return them or their equivalent to the proper owner or claimant.\u201d The amendments to this provision do no more than clarify the meaning of the section. See <em>Turnpike Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Dedham, </em>362 Mass. 221, 228 (1972), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1108 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b438-8\"> Statute 1958, c. 283, also included nonresident beneficiaries within \u00a75.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b439-6\"> The parties also support their arguments with the disputed meaning of the Commonwealth\u2019s past administrative interpretation of the statute, in its actions toward John Hancock, steps it took in enforcement proceedings, and proposals for legislative change. Although \u201c[significance in interpretation may be given to a consistent, long continued administrative application of an ambiguous statute,\u201d <em>Cleary </em>v. <em>Cardullo\u2019s Inc., </em>347 Mass. 337, 343 (1964), \u201c[cjourts are not bound by erroneous adminstrative constructions [if any] of a statute,\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Martignetti, </em>374 Mass. 784,790 (1978). \u201cThe duty of statutory interpretation is for the courts.\u201d <em>Cleary, supra </em>at 344.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b441-7\"> The original version of G.L. c. 200A was passed before the advent of the UDUPA, and therefore the absence of language used in the UDUPA is not relevant. When the Legislature amended \u00a7 5 in St. 1980, c. 130, it retained its coverage of \u201call intangible personal property,\u201d and specified that the \u201cheld or owing\u201d language included \u201cproperty held by any fiduciary.\u201d Thus, we believe that \u00a7 5 was always intended to apply to both fiduciaries and nonfiduciaries. Further, unlike the UDUPA, St. 1980, c. 130, does not contain two sections, one for fiduciaries and one for nonfiduciaries. If \u00a7 5 had been left alone and another section added along the lines of UDUPA \u00a7 9, we might be more inclined to agree with the defendant. But that is not this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b441-8\">The <em>Blue Cross </em>case, <em>supra, </em>determined that the uncashed checks issued by Blue Cross did not fit within the definition of intangible personal property because the checks were not \u201cintangible personal property,\u201d which under the statute could be \u201cheld or owing.\u201d Furthermore, no \u201cproceeds\u201d existed from the uncashed checks to turn over to the State. However, the court decided that the checks were written because the payee had a right to be paid. \u201cThis right was \u2018intangible personal property\u2019 in the form of a \u2018thing in action\u2019 (or \u2018chose in action\u2019), which was transferrable by him as its \u2018owner.\u2019\u201d The court went on to state that the \u201cthing in action\u201d was the intangible personal property which must be paid to the State after seven years by the holder of that property. <em>Id. </em>at 735-736.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
