The defendant\u2019s first trial ended in a mistrial on March 21, 1980, when the jurors were unable to agree on a verdict. The defendant\u2019s second trial began on June 3, 1980, and, on June 5, the jury found him guilty as charged on each indictment. He was sentenced to State prison for concurrent terms of not less than six nor more than ten years for all but the two assault and battery convictions, which were placed on file.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant appealed on two grounds: (1) that the judge\u2019s questions to prospective jurors at voir dire did not sufficiently probe the possibility of racial bias, and (2) that the judge improperly admitted the opinion testimony of an ophthalmologist concerning the victim\u2019s ability to \u201cidentify\u201d people under certain conditions. The Appeals Court affirmed the convictions. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sowers, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 975 (1982). We granted the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review. We find no error and affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">We summarize the facts. Other facts necessary to understand the issues raised appear elsewhere in this opinion. The victim is a white female albino who is \u201clegally blind\u201d (twenty/two hundred vision). She was attacked on a Brighton street shortly after midnight on July 15, 1979. Her assailant asked her for money and threatened to kill her if she screamed. He then dragged her into a nearby alley and beat her when she started to struggle, again threatening to kill her. The assailant then held a knife to the victim\u2019s throat and forced her to a third-floor room of a burned-out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>building beside the alley. He pushed the victim into a corner and ordered her to remove her clothes. When she had done so, he compelled her to submit to acts of fellatio and sodomy. He then went through the victim\u2019s pocketbook and took her wristwatch from her wrist. He left after telling the victim he would return to kill her if she made any noise.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">The victim was with her assailant for about one-half hour, during which time she studied his face so as to be able to identify him. The room in which the rape took place was illuminated by a street light shining through the windows. The victim waited a few minutes, then dressed and screamed for help. A woman living nearby heard the victim and went to her aid. When the police arrived a few minutes later, the victim, crying and very upset, described the assailant as a thin, bemoustached black man, maybe seventeen to twenty years old, \u201ca little taller\u201d than her own height of about five feet three inches, and weighing approximately one hundred ten to one hundred twenty pounds. The height, weight, and age were based on comparisons with the victim\u2019s own height, weight, and age. She described the assailant as wearing a dark blue shirt with a white circle and printing on the front, brown pants, and a beige \u201cfisherman\u2019s cap\u201d with a narrow dark band around the edge. The victim was then taken to a hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">The next morning, a police officer accompanied the victim to the scene. He then took her to the police station in Brighton, where he interviewed her and gave her books of photographs to view. After looking through three or four books, the victim selected a picture of the defendant as the man who attacked her. The picture was four years old and it depicted the defendant as clean shaven. The defendant was arrested the next day, July 16, and a photograph taken at the time of arrest shows the defendant as having a moustache and goatee.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">That evening the victim was informed that the man whose photograph she had selected had been arrested. On the morning of July 17, she went to the Brighton Division of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>the District Court Department and met a police detective who told her to wait in the courtroom. The victim walked to the front of the courtroom where she saw two men in a cell. When she was within four or five feet of the cell, she recognized one of the men, the defendant, as her assailant. The victim also identified the defendant at trial. According to police records, the defendant was five feet, eight inches tall and weighed 135 pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">At trial, the defendant\u2019s mother, sister and girl friend, all of whom lived with the defendant in Brighton, testified that they were with the defendant at home either part or all of the time on the evening of the attack. Another friend testified that she had spoken with the defendant by telephone at his home for some time on that evening. The defendant\u2019s mother testified that the defendant did not own clothing such as that described by the victim. His sister and girl friend stated they had never seen him wearing such clothes. The defendant\u2019s sister also testified that the scene of the attack was about a five minute walk from their apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">1. <em>The Questioning of Prospective Jurors on Racial Prejudice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Prior to the second trial, the defendant moved under G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 28,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that the members of the venire be ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>tioned \u201cindividually and out of the hearing of other prospective jurors.\u201d **<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Included in the questions proposed by the defendant were two questions dealing with racial prejudice.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The motion was \u201callowed to the extent of generalizing most questions.\u201d Although there is no transcript available for the proceedings on the first day of jury empanelment,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> it is apparent from the judge\u2019s later remarks that, on the first day, he had informed the assembled venire at least generally as to the nature of the charges and the races of the defendant and the victim, and that he had asked the members of the venire to make known \u201cany reason that they felt that they could not stand indifferent.\u201d It is also apparent, and undisputed, that on both days the judge asked each juror individually a question designed to discover whether the race of a witness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>would affect the prospective juror\u2019s view of the witness\u2019s credibility (the credibility question).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 7The judge also asked each female prospective juror a question probing the effect of the fact that the case involved the unnatural rape of a white woman by a black man (the sensitivity question) <footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The judge had asked this question of all or most of the prospective male jurors on the first day but he did not, over the defendant\u2019s objection, continue this practice on the second day.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">The defendant contends that the judge\u2019s refusal to examine all prospective male jurors \u201cabout their attitudes towards interracial unnatural rape was \u2018an unconstitutional abuse of discretion\u2019, <em>Rosales-Lopez </em>v. <em>United States, </em>[451 U.S. 182, 190 (1981),] and a violation of his \u2018heavy responsibility\u2019 under G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 28.\u201d As a result of this abuse of discretion, the defendant\u2019s argument continues, the judge was unable to fulfil his duty to discharge jurors for cause, the defendant was unable to exercise intelligently his peremptory challenges against male jurors, and at least three males who had not been asked the sensitivity question participated in the jury\u2019s deliberations. The defendant contends that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>constitutes a violation of his rights under G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 28, and his rights to a fair trial and due process as guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">There is no support in the record for a claim that this defendant was a \u201cspecial target for racial prejudice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>363 Mass. 665, 672, cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1080 (1973) (with dissents), habeas corpus granted sub nom. <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Ristaino, </em>388 F. Supp. 99 (D. Mass.), aff'd, 508 F.2d 754 (1st Cir. 1974), revd, 424 U.S. 589 (1976). See <em>Ham </em>v. <em>South Carolina, </em>409 U.S. 524 (1973). The case of <em>Rosales-Lopez </em>v. <em>United States, </em>451 U.S. 182 (1981), does not eliminate the requirement that a person claiming Federal constitutional error based on the voir dire of prospective jurors must show \u201cspecial circumstances,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Ross, supra. </em>Further, even in cases where the defendant is a special target, the trial judge is not required \u201cto put the question in any particular form, or to ask any particular number of questions on the subject, simply because requested to do so\u201d by the defendant. <em>Ham, supra </em>at 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">We believe that the credibility question, combined with the judge\u2019s comments on the nature of the offense and the races of the defendant and the victim, was sufficient to satisfy his obligation under G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 28. The instant case is similar to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Core,8 </em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>370 Mass. 369 (1976). In that case, we upheld a voir dire where \u201cthe judge called to the attention of the prospective jurors the facts that the defendants were black and that the alleged victim was white, and inquired of them collectively whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>this raised any bias or prejudice in their minds which would prevent them from deciding the case fairly and impartially on the evidence and without regard to the color of either the defendants or the victim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 373. Since we conclude that the judge was <em>not </em>required to ask each potential <em>juror </em>the sensitivity question, his failure to ask three male jurors the sensitivity question is not reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Another short but conclusive answer is found in <em>Commonwealth v. Sanders, </em>383 Mass. 637, 640-641 (1981), where we ruled that in cases tried after that decision it would be \u201ca matter of law [that] interracial rape cases present a substantial risk that extraneous issues will influence the jury and hence are within \u00a7 28, second par.\u201d This holding was based \u201cnot on a constitutional mandate, but on the need for caution and certainty in the application of \u00a7 28.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hobbs, </em>385 Mass. 863, 873 (1982). Since the present case was tried in 1980, the defendant does not benefit from our ruling in <em>Sanders.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">2. <em>The Admission of the Ophthalmologist\u2019s Opinion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">At trial, Dr. Edward B. Murphy, Jr., was qualified as an expert in ophthalmology with a specialty in the field of albinism. On direct examination, Dr. Murphy testified as follows: The victim, whom he had seen as a patient on three occasions, was an albino and legally blind; albinism produces precise and predictable visual disturbances; the victim\u2019s vision, with corrective lenses, was twenty/two hundred, meaning that she could see at twenty feet what a person with normal vision could see at two hundred. The victim suffers from astigmatism, which causes distortion in perception, and from nystagmus, which is a gentle rocking of the eyes resulting in a blurred effect similar to that produced in a picture taken by a camera in motion. The victim is used to the effects of these diseases, and daytime glare affects her vision in such fashion that she sees better at night. Direct examination of Dr. Murphy concluded with the following questions and answers, to which defense counsel objected: The prosecutor: \u201cAnd, Doctor, if [the victim] were looking at a person from this distance, or from this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>distance, would she be able to identify that person?\u201d The witness: \u201cYes.\u201d The prosecutor: \u201cAnd if she were looking at a book of photographs, would she be able to pick out a photograph?\u201d The witness: \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The defendant challenges admission of this testimony on the grounds that it was beyond the scope of the doctor\u2019s area of expertise, based on scientific principles as yet unaccepted as a proper basis for expert testimony, and unnecessary to the jury\u2019s determination whether the victim\u2019s identification was reliable. In light of the fact that the victim\u2019s identification of the defendant was uncorroborated from any other source, and subject to many of the weaknesses making eyewitness identification unreliable, the danger is that the jury may have relied on the apparent trustworthiness of this opinion to erase otherwise reasonable doubts in their minds. We are aware that such a possibility exists. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>350 Mass. 664 (1966), we affirmed a conviction for unnatural and lascivious acts, but reversed the defendant\u2019s rape conviction because we believed that the testimony of a gynecologist, admitted as expert opinion, that he \u201cthought that there was forcible entry\u201d was based on \u201cfactors outside the area of his professional competence\u201d and \u201ccould have substantially influenced the jury\u2019s decision as to whom to believe.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 666-667. However, we think there is no such danger in the present case. The Commonwealth contends, and we agree, that it is clear from the record that the word \u201cidentify,\u201d as used in the passage quoted above, was meant, and could only be understood by the jury, to refer to the victim\u2019s visual capability to distinguish the features of a person whom she viewed at a certain distance rather than to her ability to perform the complex tasks of human perception necessary to make an identification of an individual as a person whom one has seen earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">The prosecutor\u2019s questions on direct examination were all aimed at determining the victim\u2019s visual acuity and the effects that the various diseases she suffered from had on her vision. These were matters well within the doctor\u2019s field of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>knowledge and also matters concerning which, given the nature and variety of the victim\u2019s visual disabilities, the jury were not equally capable of drawing conclusions. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gardner, supra; Lawlor </em>v. <em>Wolff, </em>180 Mass. 448 (1902) (doctor not allowed to testify whether it was possible for a <em>man </em>to have carnal knowledge of a woman of relatively the same strength against her will); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Middleton, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 902 (1978) (upholding trial judge\u2019s ruling that testimony of expert on human memory as to factors affecting the reliability of eyewitness identification was inadmissible as not beyond the scope of the average juror\u2019s knowledge and experience). The prosecutor asked no questions concerning the victim\u2019s ability to retain or recall what she had seen. He apparently emphasized the point of the challenged questions by moving various distances from the witness as he spoke. On cross-examination, defense counsel used the word \u201cidentification\u201d in his effort to impeach the doctor\u2019s testimony, and his questions implicitly recognize that the only issue raised by the doctor\u2019s previous testimony was whether the victim had the visual ability to make out the features of her assailant during the attack.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> After further questioning on redirect examina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>tian, the judge also questioned the doctor, and it appears from the judge\u2019s question and the witness\u2019s answer that the clarity and distinctness of the victim\u2019s vision were the only matters in issue.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">In his closing, the prosecutor again referred to the doctor\u2019s testimony concerning the victim\u2019s ability to make an \u201cidentification,\u201d and the context once again indicates that the term was meant to refer only to the victim\u2019s ability to see despite her eye problems.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Finally, we note that the judge gave a lengthy and correct instruction to the jury on identification testimony, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>emphasized the fact that an \u201cidentification\u201d in the legal sense could take place only after a victim had opportunity to see and observe the person whom she later identified. The judge also pointed out the pertinent factors which might have affected this victim\u2019s opportunity to observe and told the jury it was \u201cabsolutely critical\u201d that they determine whether the victim had adequate opportunity to observe her assailant. He had earlier instructed the jury that they could accept or reject the expert testimony and that an expert was no more or less believable than any other witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">In these circumstances we think it unlikely that the jurors understood Dr. Murphy\u2019s testimony to be anything other than expert medical opinion as to the victim\u2019s visual capabilities. As such, its admission was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">In all, we find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">\n<em>Judgments of the Superior Court affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b224-8\"> Since the defendant consented to placing these indictments on file, there is no appeal on these convictions properly before us. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>367 Mass. 432, 437-438 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b226-8\"> General Laws c. 234, \u00a7 28, as amended through St. 1975, c. 335, provides: \u201cUpon motion of either party, the court shall, or the parties or their attorneys may under the direction of the court, examine on oath a person who is called as a juror therein, to learn whether he is related to either party or has any interest in the case, or has expressed or formed an opinion, or is sensible of any bias or prejudice, therein; and the objecting party may introduce other competent evidence in support of the objection.

Absolutely.\u2019 That is not something that I said or that [the victim] said. That is a doctor who is a specialist in this kind of eye problem.
