Ely, was convicted of murder in the first degree, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 1; assault with intent to commit murder, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15; and burning of a dwelling house (arson), G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">On appeal, the defendant claims error in the denial of his request that the jurors be instructed on involuntary manslaughter. Pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, Ely argues that the judge\u2019s instructions on malice, joint enterprise, intent, and assault with intent to commit murder all were erroneous. He also claims that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. Ely requests that we exercise our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to reduce the verdict to a lesser degree of guilt. We conclude that there is no reversible error, and no substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. Therefore, we affirm Ely\u2019s convictions and decline to exercise our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-10\">We summarize the facts. In September, 1977, Ely, then sixteen years old,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> lived at the home of Albert Schrempf as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>foster child. Also living at the Schrempf home were Schrempfs two natural sons, seventeen year old Alan and thirteen year old David, and David Gosselin, a special needs foster child, age fifteen.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Ely lived with the Schrempfs for nearly five weeks prior to the burning of their house on September 14, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Approximately two weeks before the fire, Ely had a quarrel with David Schrempf. In the course of the argument, he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to burn your stinking house down. . . . I\u2019m going to get you and I\u2019m going to get your brother. ... So you\u2019ll both die. . . . I\u2019ll put a padlock on your brother\u2019s door. . . . Then I\u2019ll go up and put one [on] the bathroom door and climb out through the window and down on the porch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">On September 14, 1977, a flash fire started on the porch of the Schrempf home. As a result of the fire, Alan Schrempf died, and David Schrempf lapsed into a coma from which he has never recovered. Arson experts ruled out accident as the cause of the fire. The experts all were of the opinion that the fire was deliberately set, and that gasoline was used as the incendiary agent. Gosselin said he observed Ely spreading the gasoline in the kitchen and on the porch, and that he saw Ely throw a match \u201con top of the gas.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">Ely admitted that he knew the Schrempfs kept the front door secured with ropes, and that other than the porch, there was no exit to the outside. He knew that the Schrempfs kept gasoline in their garage. However, Ely said that it was Gosselin who deliberately and purposefully set the fire to murder David Schrempf.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">1. <em>Failure to instruct on involuntary manslaughter. </em>The defendant objected to an instruction that if the jurors found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>Ely guilty of arson, and if as a result of that arson Alan Schrempf died, then the jurors could convict Ely of murder in the second degree. Ely claims that his testimony, that he did not know whether Alan Schrempf was in the house at the time of the arson, required an instruction on involuntary manslaughter. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">The undisputed evidence is that the fire was deliberately set at the only exit which was not \u201croped shut,\u201d thereby precluding any person in the house from escaping after the porch was ignited. At trial, Ely claimed that Gosselin, with deliberately premeditated malice aforethought, set fire to the Schrempf home to murder David Schrempf. Although Ely said he was present when the fire was set, he denied setting the fire or aiding or assisting Gosselin in setting the fire. Based on the record, including Ely\u2019s statement that he was merely present when Gosselin committed the criminal acts, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benders, </em>361 Mass. 704, 708 (1972),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cthere is no evidence . . . which would warrant a jury in drawing an inference that the [arson] was unintentional or the consequence of wanton or reckless conduct.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilborne, </em>382 Mass. 241, 246 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">2. <em>Appellate challenges to the jury instructions. </em>Pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, Ely argues that the judge\u2019s instructions on malice, joint enterprise, intent, and assault with intent to commit murder, were flawed, and that therefore a new trial is required. Alternatively, he argues that we should reduce the verdict to a lesser degree of guilt. At trial, Ely\u2019s defense was that it was Gosselin who, with deliberately premeditated malice aforethought, set fire to the Schrempf home to murder David Schrempf. Gosselin, according to Ely, was so motivated because David Schrempf owed Gosselin money. The case was tried on the theory that the sole disputed issue was the identity of the perpetrator.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number><footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In making his appellate claims, he abandons his trial strategy. He focuses on the instructions without consideration of the theory on which the case was tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">\u201cWe look askance when counsel who has tried a case, without success, before a judge and jury on one theory of law, then attempts to obtain appellate review on an entirely different theory which was never advanced or suggested at the trial and which is not based on any objection .... Our view is the same notwithstanding the fact that the defendant is being represented on these appeals by counsel other than the one who represented him at the original trial. Neither the conventional type of appellate review permitted in a criminal case, nor the special type prescribed by G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, for a \u2018capital case,\u2019 is intended to afford an opportunity, from the vantage point of hindsight, to comb the trial record for interesting questions which could have been, but in fact were not, raised at the trial, or to attempt to convert the consequences of unsuccessful trial tactics and strategy into alleged errors by the judge.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>374 Mass. 453, 465 (1978). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>383 Mass. 507, 512-513 (1981). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Underwood, </em>358 Mass. 506, 510-511 (1970). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mandeville, </em>386 Mass. 393, 408 (1982) (a defendant cannot \u201cargue error on the basis of a theory that was not presented at trial\u201d). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gullick, </em>386 Mass. 278, 281 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">\u201cIn support of his conclusions [Ely also] parses the charge and attacks it piecemeal. We, however, view the charge in its entirety since the adequacy of instructions must be determined in light of their over-all impact on the jury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sellon, </em>380 Mass. 220, 231-232 (1980). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cundriff, </em>382 Mass. 137, 153 (1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 973 (1981). Moreover, in determin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>ing whether the instructions create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, we view the absence of any objections to the instructions as relevant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tavares, </em>385 Mass. 140, 148 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">a. <em>Malice. </em>Relying on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Niziolek, </em>380 Mass. 513, 526-527 (1980), Ely claims error because the judge\u2019s instructions failed to define malice. We do not agree. In <em>Niziolek, </em>the judge instructed the jurors that they \u201ccould not rely on the \u2018common English usage\u2019 of malice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 526-527. The judge then told them that the element of malice in arson had its \u201c\u2018ordinary meaning in criminal law\u2019\u201d but he failed to define malice at all. <em>Id. </em>at 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Unlike the instructions in <em>Niziolek, </em>the judge in this case told the jurors that the requirement that the act be wilful eliminated accidental or negligent fires, and that, in order to convict a person of arson, the jurors must find malice. He informed them that \u201cmalice in arson may be inferred from the wilful doing of the act of burning without legal justification.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">We add that \u201c[t]he propriety of the charge as to malice was not in issue. The case was tried and argued by both parties on the theory that [arson] had been committed. The issue contested by the defendant was solely that of the identity of the [arsonist].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>383 Mass. 507, 512 (1981). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pisa, </em>384 Mass. 362, 363-364 (1981). We conclude that the malice instruction did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">b. <em>Joint enterprise. </em>Ely contends that the judge erred in instructing the jurors that they could convict Ely of arson if they found that Gosselin set the fire, and that there was a joint enterprise between Ely and Gosselin. Ely asserts that the jury should not have been instructed on joint enterprise because there was no evidence from which a joint venture could be inferred. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>Although Gosselin and Ely each blamed the other for setting the fire, they were seen fleeing from the Schrempf home together shortly before the fire was discovered. Both admitted that, on the night of the fire, they left the Schrempf house together, went to a wharf and a coffee shop together, and that they talked together before giving the police a statement. Both men falsely stated to the police that they had left the Schrempf home one-half hour prior to the fire. Thus, there was evidence from which the jurors could infer a joint enterprise. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scanlon, </em>373 Mass. 11, 18 (1977).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201c[A] fair reading of the instructions, not treated in isolation but considered in light of the entire charge . . . permitted the jury to determine the purpose and extent of the joint venture.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ambers, </em>370 Mass. 835, 840 (1976).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">c. <em>Instructions that persons ordinarily intend the natural and probable consequences of their acts. </em>Ely also contends that the judge erred in instructing the jurors that \u201c[a]s a general rule, it is reasonable to infer that persons ordinarily intend all of the natural and probable and ordinary consequences of their acts knowingly done or knowingly omitted. So unless the evidence in this case leads you to a different or contrary conclusion, you may infer and find that the defendant intended all of the natural and probable consequences which one standing in like circumstances and possessing like knowledge should reasonably have expected to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>result from any act knowingly done or knowingly omitted.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Ely claims that this instruction by use of the word \u201cinference,\u201d rather than \u201cpresumption,\u201d merely \u201cskirts\u201d the unconstitutionality condemned by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>380 Mass. 821 (1980), and <em>DeJoinville </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>381 Mass. 246 (1980). He claims that in spite of the word \u201cinference,\u201d the instruction is prejudicial because it impermissibly shifted the burden of proof to him. See <em>Sandstrom </em>v. <em>Montana, </em>442 U.S. 510, 523-524 (1979). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\"><em>Sandstrom </em>does not invalidate the use of an \u201centirely per-' missive inference or presumption, which allows \u2014 but does not require \u2014 the trier of fact to infer the elemental fact from proof by the prosecutor of the basic one and which places no burden of any kind on the defendant.\u201d <em>County Court of Ulster County </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>442 U.S. 140, 157 (1979). <em>Sandstrom </em>v. <em>Montana, supra </em>at 517. The instructions at issue clearly permitted, but did not require, the jurors to infer intent. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stillwell, </em>387 Mass. 730, 732 &amp; n.2 (1982).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">d. <em>Assault with intent to murder. </em>The judge correctly instructed the jurors on deliberately premeditated malice aforethought.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Regrettably, the judge on four occasions<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>equated the intent to do serious bodily harm with murder in the first degree. The defendant did not object to this portion of the instructions. Thus, we consider whether the error in the judge\u2019s instructions created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tavares, </em>385 Mass. 140,148 (1982). We conclude that there is no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Ely\u2019s case was tried on the theory that the intent to murder David Schrempf by setting fire to the Schrempf home was murder in the first degree, and that it was Gosselin who, with deliberately premeditated malice aforethought,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> had murdered one of the Schrempfs. The jurors concluded such conduct warrants a conviction of murder in the first degree. They rejected Ely\u2019s claim that it was Gosselin, not Ely, who acted with deliberately premeditated malice aforethought. Viewed in light of Ely\u2019s trial tactics, we conclude that the instructions do not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">3. <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel. </em>On appeal, the defendant asserts that his trial counsel\u2019s performance was \u201cbelow that required, prejudiced the defendant, and thereby constituted a denial of effective assistance of counsel.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Ely bases his claim on the assertion that a person to whom Gosselin allegedly admitted setting the fire was not called as a witness. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">The record shows that defense counsel made numerous efforts to locate the witness, and that defense counsel asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>for and received assistance from the Commonwealth and from the judge to try to secure the witness\u2019s presence.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> There is nothing in the record to indicate that the failure to secure the witness\u2019s presence was a result of \u201cserious incompetency, inefficiency, or inattention of counsel.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">4. <em>Relief pursuant to G. L. c. 278, </em>\u00a7 <em>33E. </em>The defendant requests that we exercise our power under \u00a7 33E, to reduce the conviction of murder in the first degree to a lesser degree of guilt, in the event that we reject his appeal on the specific issues raised. Consistent with our duty under \u00a7 33E, .we have considered the entire case on the law and evidence, and conclude that the verdict on the indictment for murder in the first degree was neither against the law nor against the weight of the evidence, and that the interests of justice do not require either a new trial or entry of a verdict of a lesser degree of guilt than that found by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">On the convictions of arson and assault with intent to murder, the defendant is not entitled as of right to appellate review of alleged errors not based on a timely objection. Citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>386 Mass. 35, 38 (1982), Ely urges this court to consider the arson and assault with intent to murder convictions pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, because these charges were \u201cclosely tied with the murder.\u201d We have considered the errors alleged and conclude that these convictions also should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b86-11\"> On the conviction of murder in the first degree, the defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution, Walpole. On the arson conviction, he was sentenced to a concurrent term of ten to fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment. On the conviction of assault with intent to commit murder, Ely was sentenced to a concurrent term of eight to ten years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b86-12\"> Ely was sixteen at the time he committed the offenses charged. He was not apprehended until he was over eighteen years of age. Pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 72A, a juvenile transfer hearing was held. After the hearing, the judge made findings of fact and determined that the Commonwealth had established that there was probable cause to believe the defendant committed the offenses, and that the public interest required dismissal of the juvenile complaints and the trial of the defendant as an adult. G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 61. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>387 Mass. 619 (1982). On appeal, Ely does not challenge this transfer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b87-9\"> Key Foster Care Program, a community based program under contract with the Commonwealth to place Department of Youth Services \u201cclients,\u201d placed Ely and Gosselin in the Schrempf household.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b87-10\"> In November, 1979, Gosselin pleaded guilty to charges of manslaughter based on the death of Alan Schrempf and arson of the Schrempf home.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b87-11\"> Additional evidence will be set forth in our review of the substantive claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b88-7\"> The judge instructed the jury that Ely could not be found guilty if he \u201cwas [merely] a spectator and not aiding in any way or assisting Gosselin.\u201d He also informed the jury that the defendant was not \u201ccriminally responsible\u201d for Gosselin\u2019s conduct if Ely were present and failed to stop Gosselin from setting the fire.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b89-7\"> At trial, each blamed the other as the \u201conly realistic escape for either [Ely or Gosselin] was to blame the other.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>387 Mass. 644, 659 (1982). The Commonwealth, therefore, did not attempt to join both Gosselin and Ely in a single trial but disposed of Gosselin\u2019s case first.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b90-9\"> The judge also defined malice again in the instructions on malice aforethought required for assault with intent to murder, and murder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b91-6\"> The judge told the jurors that if \u201cthe defendant either did or intentionally assisted another in the commission of this crime of arson, and [he must do it] sharing with that person who set the fire the mental state required for [arson]; that is, the willfulness and maliciousness of deliberately setting the fire without legal justification; he must share that mental state.\u201d The judge also told the jurors that they must find that Ely \u201cintended, by setting or aiding another in setting the fire, to murder David Schrempf.\u201d He then went on to define malice aforethought and deliberately premeditated malice aforethought.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b91-7\"> The judge told the jurors that it was their decision whether to infer a joint enterprise from the evidence: \u201cI am not suggesting anything to you along these lines \u2014 that is entirely up to you.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>10 Mass.
