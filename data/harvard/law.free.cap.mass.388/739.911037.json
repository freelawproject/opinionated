The local assessors in various municipalities denied Tenneco\u2019s applications for abatement. Tenneco appealed to the Appellate Tax Board (board) challenging the assessments, in each instance, on the ground that the assessments were disproportionate in relation to the assessed valuation of other property. Tenneco claimed that the pipeline property was assessed at 100 % of its fair cash value, while the other property in each municipality was assessed at a much lower percentage. The board agreed with Tenneco and ordered abatements.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Among the various municipalities, only Danvers, Sudbury, and Northbridge appealed to this court from the board\u2019s decision. We affirm the decision of the board in each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Under G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 38A, the Commissioner of Revenue (Commissioner) must annually determine and certify to the owner and to the appropriate board of assessors the valuation, as of January first of that year, of certain pipelines subject to taxation. On or before a stated date,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the pipeline owner and the appropriate board of assessors may appeal to the board from the Commissioner\u2019s determination. The local board of assessors is directed to assess every pipeline subject to \u00a7 38A \u201cat the valuation certified by the commissioner.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">The appellant boards of assessors argue that, because Tenneco did not take a seasonable appeal under \u00a7 38A from the Commissioner\u2019s determination of value, Tenneco is barred from appealing to the board from local assessments made in the amounts certified by the Commissioner. They argue that the Commissioner\u2019s determination should reflect any disproportionate assessment practices in the applicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>municipality. This argument fails on two grounds. First, the Commissioner would not be able to determine, in time to fulfil his statutory duty, whether and to what extent a municipality will engage in disproportionate assessment practices in the year for which he makes the pipeline valuation determination. Secondly, and more important, the statutory pattern calls for all assessments to be at 100 % of fair cash value. The Legislature had the right to assume that assessors would comply with their statutory duty (G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 38) and oath (G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 29). The Commissioner must proceed on that assumption as well and is directed by G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 38A, to establish fair cash values. Hence, the Commissioner acted properly in determining the fair cash value of Tenneco\u2019s pipeline in each municipality, without taking into account the possibility that the assessors of a particular municipality might fail to adhere to the requirements of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">We agree, therefore, with the board that, in order to preserve its right to appeal under G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 59, Tenneco was not obliged to challenge the Commissioner\u2019s determinations of fair cash value with which it did not disagree. We further agree with the board that, when the local assessors assessed the pipeline at 100% of its fair cash value and other property at substantially less than 100% of its fair cash value, Tenneco was entitled to seek an abatement from the local assessors and to appeal pursuant to G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 65, to the board from the denial of any requested abatement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A denial of the right to challenge the disproportionate assessments would present a serious constitutional question because the Massachusetts Constitution requires that property be taxed proportionately. Part II, c. 1, \u00a7 1, art. 4, of the Massachusetts Constitution. <em>Tregor </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>377 Mass. 602, 604, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 841 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">The assessors argue that, even if Tenneco was entitled to an abatement based on disproportionate assessments, Ten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>neco failed to present sufficient evidence to permit the board to make the necessary determination of Tenneco\u2019s measure of damages. Under G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 14, inserted by St. 1979, c. 797, \u00a7 10, the board is directed to compute an equalized tax rate when it finds that a taxpayer is assessed disproportionately with respect to other properties within a municipality. See <em>Keniston </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>380 Mass. 888, 890-891 (1980). Section 14 states that the equalized tax rate is to be computed by dividing the total taxes as assessed for a municipality for the appropriate year by the fair cash value of the municipality. This equalized tax rate is then to be applied to the fair cash value of the subject property to determine the taxes that should have been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">In this case, the board did not compute an equalized tax rate. Rather, it used ratios of assessed valuations to estimated full valuations computed by the Commissioner pursuant to G. L. c. 58, \u00a7 10C. The board, under G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 12C, may admit these assessment ratios in evidence. In these cases, the board relied on the Commissioner\u2019s determination of an equalized tax rate for each town for the applicable fiscal year. The Commissioner\u2019s assessment ratios are made prima facie evidence of \u201cthe ratios at which property is assessed\u201d in the appropriate municipality. G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 12C, inserted by St. 1979, c. 383, \u00a7 3. We conclude, therefore, that the board was warranted in relying on the Commissioner\u2019s determinations pursuant to G. L. c. 58, \u00a7 10C, in fulfilling its duty under G. L. c. 58, \u00a7 14, to grant abatements to the municipal average.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">\n<em>Decisions of the Appellate Tax Board affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b756-7\"> The amount of the abatement in the tax assessed in the three appellant towns was $14,027.25 in Sudbury; $5,828.60 in Danvers; and $873.19 in Northbridge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b756-8\">By St. 1981, c. Ill, \u00a7 1, the date set forth in \u00a7 38A for the Commissioner\u2019s determination of value was changed from March 15 to May 15, and the date for timely appeal was changed from April 15 to June 15.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b757-8\"> The assessment ratios that the board determined were approximately 48% for Danvers, 61% for Sudbury, and 70% for Northbridge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b758-7\"> We need not determine whether the board may rely on the Commissioner\u2019s determinations if those determinations are not introduced in evidence, or explicitly taken note of, in the course of the board\u2019s hearing. Here, the Commissioner\u2019s calculations of assessment ratios for all three towns were admitted in evidence. These calculations concerned January 1, 1978, values, and under G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 12C, they are prima facie evidence for each following year until a new determination is made under G. L. c. 58, \u00a7 10C. We reject any suggestion that to prove its case a taxpayer alleging disproportionate assessments must prove, in addition to the Commissioner\u2019s calculation under G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 12C, the fair cash value of all property in the particular municipality.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
