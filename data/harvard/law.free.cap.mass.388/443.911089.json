The town claimed that Melvin Goldstein had (1) instituted improper and frivolous legal proceedings against the town, its officers, employees, boards, commissions, and elected officials; and (2) harassed a substantial number of town employees and officials by calling them repeatedly during working hours at the town\u2019s offices and at their homes during the early morning and late evening, as well as weekends.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">After a hearing, a judge of the Superior Court issued a preliminary injunction restraining Goldstein from commencing any legal proceedings against the town without obtaining that court\u2019s approval, and from communicating with the town or its officials and employees, except for one telephone call per business day to the office of the board of selectmen and by letters sent through the United States mail addressed to the board\u2019s office.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 118, second par., Goldstein appealed from this interlocutory order, arguing that (1) the judge abused his discretion in granting the injunction, and (2) the injunction is overbroad and vague. We transferred the appeal here on our own motion. We vacate the order below and remand the case for entry of a new order in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">The facts are as follows. The defendant is a resident of the town of Brookline, who evidently has become dissatisfied with the course of town government. As a consequence, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>has filed, either individually or as president of Mared Realty Corporation, numerous proceedings against the town, its officers, employees, boards, commissions, and elected officials. These proceedings comprised four civil cases brought in the Superior Court in Norfolk County, two civil cases and three criminal complaints brought in the Brook-line Division of the District Court department. The status of these cases at the time the complaint was filed was as follows: (1) Three of the cases filed in the Superior Court had been dismissed,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and one case was pending; (2) one case in the Brookline District Court had been tried, resulting in a judgment against Goldstein, and one case was pending; and (3) all three criminal complaints had been dismissed. Gold-stein filed an affidavit in this case stating that these suits had been brought in good faith without any intent to harass the town or any of its officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Goldstein has also pressed his grievances directly. Affidavits filed by the town indicate that Goldstein has called town officials repeatedly at their homes, places of business, and at town offices. Many of these calls were made early in the morning and late in the evening. Sample logs of telephone calls made by Goldstein to homes of the chairman of the board of selectmen, Robert M. Stein, and the chief of police are set out in the margin.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Stein\u2019s affidavit also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>alleges that Goldstein called and harassed him, his business associates, and superiors at his place of employment. The town also filed an affidavit alleging that Goldstein has interfered with the work of the town\u2019s police department through constant and repeated telephone calls and personal visits. The affidavits filed by the town also allege that Goldstein has used abusive language during these calls and visits, and that the matters he wished to discuss were frivolous. Goldstein\u2019s affidavit in answer to these allegations is that he resorted to calling town officials at their homes only after they refused to discuss with him certain unspecified municipal matters. The only allegation that he denies specifically is that his visits and calls have interfered with police business. He also alleged that his actions were in good faith, that his legal claims were meritorious, and that he had no intent to harass the town or any of its officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>1. Our task here is simply to pass on the propriety of an injunction pending a full hearing on the merits of the underlying dispute. The record before us consists of the pleadings and affidavits filed by the parties. We may also take judicial notice of the court papers filed in the prior actions brought by Goldstein against the town. <em>Poland </em>v. <em>New Bedford, Woods Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S. Auth., </em>342 Mass. 75, 77 n.2 (1961). <em>Nantucket Conservation Found., Inc. </em>v. <em>Russell Management, Inc., </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 868, 868-869 (1974). <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>Brassard, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 678, 681-682 (1974).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We have no transcript of what transpired at the hearing below and therefore assume that it focused on the allegations contained in the town\u2019s complaint and the affidavits. In these circumstances we may reach our own conclusions, although we give deference to the exercise of discretion by the judge below. <em>Packaging Indus. Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cheney, </em>380 Mass. 609, 614-615 (1980) .</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">To determine whether a preliminary injunction should issue, a judge must evaluate (1) the plaintiff\u2019s claim that he will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is denied; (2) the injury the defendant will suffer if the injunction is granted; and (3) the likelihood of success on the merits. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>County of Suffolk, </em>383 Mass. 286, 288 (1981) . <em>Packaging Indus. Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cheney, supra </em>at 617. In an appropriate case, the risk of harm to the public interest also may be considered. See <em>Bettigole </em>v. <em>Assessors of Springfield, </em>343 Mass. 223, 234, 237 (1961). Where the balance of these risks cuts in favor of the moving party, a preliminary injunction may issue. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>County of Suffolk, supra. Packaging Indus. Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cheney, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>We turn to the town\u2019s claims of harm and consider those rights which may be lost irreparably if immediate relief is not granted. The town argues that there exists a substantial risk that it will be subject to groundless suits, absent an injunction, and that it has no adequate remedy at law. We have said that the ability to defend against groundless suits \u201cis not an adequate remedy, for the plaintiff is entitled to complete and immediate freedom from vexation by the defendant.\u201d <em>Steinberg </em>v. <em>McKay, </em>295 Mass. 139, 143-144 (1936). The town, however, has another remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, inserted by St. 1976, c. 233, \u00a7 1, the town may seek, in any civil action after judgment, its \u201creasonable counsel fees and other costs and expenses incurred in defending against such claims\u201d which \u201cwere wholly insubstantial, frivolous and not advanced in good faith.\u201d This statute is intended to ameliorate the consequences of the \u201cAmerican rule,\u201d which denies a prevailing party the recovery of legal fees incurred in his litigation. <em>Commissioner of Ins. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Accident Co., </em>318 Mass. 238, 241 (1945). Together with G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6G, G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, provides the town with a means of recovering its damages and of discouraging the maintenance of further insubstantial and frivolous actions by the same party. We note that the cases decided under \u00a7 6F have treated the statute\u2019s purposes sympathetically in order that its polices may be effectuated. See <em>Pollack </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>372 Mass. 469, 477 (1977); <em>Miaskiewicz </em>v. <em>LeTourneau, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 880 (1981); <em>Katz </em>v. <em>Savitsky, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 792 (1980). We conclude that the town has not demonstrated on this record that this remedy under G. L. c. 231,</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">\u00a7 6F, would be inadequate if Goldstein persists in bringing actions which are \u201cinsubstantial, frivolous and not advanced in good faith.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">Several other considerations suggest the wisdom of this approach. Access to the courts should not be restricted un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>necessarily. See <em>United Transp. Union </em>v. <em>Michigan Bar, </em>401 U.S. 576, 585 (1971) (collective activity undertaken to obtain meaningful access to the courts is a fundamental right). Moreover, the procedure described in the preliminary injunction for determining whether Goldstein may file an action is, in some degree, cumbersome.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is also not clear against what standard Goldstein\u2019s future pleadings would be measured. Compare <em>Rudnicki </em>v. <em>Department of Mass. Attorney Gen., </em>362 F.2d 337, 338 (1st Cir. 1966) (party obliged to demonstrate meritorious case), with <em>Pavilonis </em>v. <em>King, </em>626 F.2d 1075, 1079 (1st Cir. 1980) (pleadings must be sufficiently plain and definite to satisfy Fed. R. Civ. P. 8 and to warrant a response). Since Gold-stein is not seeking merely to reopen closed cases, each complaint will have to be evaluated on its own merits. The interest of judicial economy and free access to the courts is served better by requiring the town to seek relief first under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">The town next argues that the threat of continued harassment of town officials and employees at their homes and places of employment by telephone calls and personal visits constituted a basis for injunctive relief as to this kind of activity. We agree. The allegations concerning Goldstein\u2019s behavior, which he does not specifically deny, suggest that he has acted beyond all reasonable bounds. Town officials have a legitimate expectation of privacy and freedom from harassment. Cf. <em>Galella </em>v. <em>Onassis, </em>487 F.2d 986, 995 (2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Cir. 1973). This type of conduct intrudes in an intolerable manner on the private lives of town officials. It also threatens the very right Goldstein asks us to uphold. If such behavior is not restrained, town officials will be forced to make themselves less accessible to the public. Moreover, the willingness of private citizens to take a role in town government will be curtailed seriously. Public service should not be an ordeal. The harm here is great, and there is no adequate remedy at law.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The town has also demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We reject the contention that conduct alleged here cannot be restricted consistent with the First Amendment rights to petition the government for a redress of grievances and to free speech. Those rights do not disable the government from taking reasonable steps to ensure that such rights are not exercised in a manner which infringes on the legitimate rights of other citizens. See <em>Erznoznik </em>v. <em>Jacksonville, </em>422 U.S. 205, 209 (1975); <em>Cox v. Louisiana, </em>379 U.S. 536, 554-555 (1965). Cf. <em>Batchelder </em>v. <em>Allied Stores Int'l, Inc., ante </em>83, 93 (1983). This portion of the injunction does no more than restrain a serious abuse of First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">The harm here to Goldstein is minimal. Much of Gold-stein\u2019s complaint is not that he has not had an opportunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>to speak or to petition. Rather, he objects to the town\u2019s rejection of his grievances. But the First Amendment does not impose any affirmative obligation on the government to listen to, and respond to, a citizen\u2019s grievances. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Arkansas State Highway Employees Local 1315, </em>441 U.S. 463, 464-465 (1979). Moreover, Goldstein\u2019s affidavit gives no indication whether the matters he wishes to discuss with town officials are of great concern or are trivial. Given our disposition of the case, Goldstein will be provided with adequate means of petitioning for redress. We conclude that the judge did not abuse his discretion by restraining Gold-stein from communicating with town officials at their homes or places of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">The town\u2019s last claim of irreparable injury is that Gold-stein, if not restrained, will continue to interfere with the normal operation of town government. We agree that the alleged conduct may adversely affect the ability of the town to operate efficiently. An inordinate amount of time may be spent contending with essentially frivolous matters. We are mindful that his behavior has the unfortunate effect of impairing the ability of town officials to respond to the legitimate grievances of other citizens. Thus, Goldstein properly may be restrained from harassing town employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">But the injunction here reaches too far. Goldstein is absolutely prohibited from \u201ccommunicating with the employees, elected and appointed officials of the Town of Brookline\u201d except through mail and one telephone call on any business day to the board of selectmen. On its face, it prohibits Goldstein from attending public meetings, reporting emergencies to the appropriate town officials, or from inquiring as to the hours of town facilities. The injunction should be no broader than is required to protect the town from harassment. See <em>Galella </em>v. <em>Onassis, </em>487 F.2d 986, 998 (2d Cir. 1979). We think it best that the Superior Court determine how the legitimate interest of the town to be free from harassment can be achieved without unduly infringing Goldstein\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>The interlocutory order on the preliminary injunction is vacated, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for the entry of a new order in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b460-12\"> At the hearing, the town withdrew its request for preliminary injunctive relief against Esther Goldstein and Mar\u00e9d Realty Corporation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b461-6\"> Goldstein filed a motion for a rehearing in one of these cases.

The prior actions are specifically identified in the town\u2019s complaint, and we assume that their nature was discussed during the hearing. See <em>Foreign Auto Import, Inc. </em>v. <em>Renault Northeast, Inc., </em>367 Mass. 464, 472-473 (1975). We look to those papers solely to discover the nature of the claims asserted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b464-8\"> If it could be shown that the party filing a frivolous action would be judgment proof or otherwise undeterred by the threat of liability under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, an injunction might become appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b465-6\"> The injunction simply provides that Goldstein is \u201chereby enjoined and restrained from commencing any action or proceeding legal or equitable in any court of the Commonwealth against plaintiff, its employees, elected or appointed officials, without obtaining the prior approval of this court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b465-7\"> The remedy provided by G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, does not extend to criminal proceedings. Thus, the remedy may be incomplete in that Goldstein has pressed criminal complaints against certain town employees. But the relief requested and granted by the injunction does not seem to cover criminal proceedings. Moreover, since Goldstein must file an application for issuance of process in a criminal case, little would be gained by requiring that he also obtain the prior approval of the Superior Court before filing that application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b466-7\"> Much of the harm here cannot be compensated through an action for damages. To the extent that each town official may have an action in tort, a multitude of suits would be required to vindicate their interests. Moreover, the limited extent of potential recovery may not justify the filing of such actions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b466-8\"> Goldstein has denied any intention to harass. But his affidavit is barren of any facts which support his denial. It does not give any indication of the matters he wished to discuss. It does not deny the allegations contained in Stein\u2019s affidavit that he called Stein\u2019s business associates and superiors. \u201cEvidence that goes beyond the unverified allegations of the pleadings and motion papers must be presented to support or oppose a motion for a preliminary injunction.\u201d 11 C.A. Wright &amp; A.R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2949, at 469 (1973). Goldstein\u2019s affidavit is completely deficient in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">In contrast, the town has filed affidavits with specific allegations and supporting facts. While the affidavits were not in every instance made on personal knowledge, that circumstance only goes to their weight. <em>Id. </em>at 470-472.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
