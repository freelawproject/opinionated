G.L. c. 273, \u00a7 15. In the course of the proceedings pursuant to \u00a7 15,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a District-Court judge determined that Galvin was the child\u2019s father, but found him not guilty of wilful or negligent nonsupport.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>The defendant appealed the adjudication of paternity to the jury-of-six session. G.L. c. 218, \u00a7 27A. G.L. c. 278, \u00a7 18. Prior to trial, he filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that he had been found not guilty of wilful or negligent nonsupport under G.L. c. 273, \u00a7 15. The trial judge reported questions to the Appeals Court concerning whether an adjudication of paternity under G.L. c. 273, \u00a7 15, survives the determination that the defendant is not guilty of wilful or negligent nonsupport.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See Mass. R. Crim. P. 34, 378 Mass. 905 (1979). We transferred the case to this court on our own motion. We conclude that the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss should be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">The Commonwealth urges this court to hold that an adjudication of paternity made in the course of G.L. c. 273, \u00a7 15, proceedings survives an acquittal. The Commonwealth argues that we should construe \u00a7 15 as providing for a bifurcated trial and two separate judgments \u2014 a civil judgment of paternity and a criminal conviction of nonsupport. The Commonwealth does not point to any language in \u00a7 15 supporting this assertion, nor to any provision in that section for an appeal of an adjudication of paternity separate from an appeal from conviction of nonsupport. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth advocates that we read into \u00a7 15 the appeal procedure provided for defendants whose paternity is adjudicated in a civil proceeding pursuant to \u00a7 12 of the statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Commonwealth also asserts that a defendant acquitted of nonsupport in a bench trial but found by a judge in the course of the proceedings to be the child\u2019s father has available to him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>the appeal process available to other defendants convicted of misdemeanors. See G.L. c. 278, \u00a7 18; G.L. c. 218, \u00a7 26A; G.L. c. 218, \u00a7 27A.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">\u201c[A] statute must be interpreted according to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u201d <em>Board of Educ. </em>v. <em>Assessor of Worcester, </em>368 Mass. 511, 513 (1975), quoting <em>Industrial Fin. Corp. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>367 Mass. 360, 364 (1975). See <em>James J. Welch </em>&amp; <em>Co. </em>v. <em>Deputy Comm\u2019r of Capital Planning &amp; Operations, </em>387 Mass. 662, 666 (1982). \u201c[W]e think the plain meaning of the statute is that an adjudication of paternity <em>may be part of the same trial </em>which results in a <em>conviction </em>of neglect or refusal to support the child\u201d (emphasis supplied), <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>385 Mass. 461, 466 (1982), but that the adjudication does not survive an acquittal of nonsupport. Had the Commonwealth wanted a separate adjudication of paternity, it should have commenced a proceeding under \u00a7 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">\u201cWhen the meaning of any particular section or clause of a statute is questioned, it is proper, no doubt, to look into the other parts of the statute: otherwise the different sections of the same statute might be so construed as to be repugnant, and the intention of the legislature might be defeated. And if upon examination the general meaning and object of the statute should be found inconsistent with the literal import of any particular clause or section, such clause or section must, if possible, be construed according to the spirit of the act.\u201d <em>Holbrook </em>v. <em>Holbrook, </em>1 Pick. 248, 250 (1823). See <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles </em>v. <em>Board of Ap</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number><em>peal on Motor Vehicle Liab. Policies &amp; Bonds, </em>382 Mass. 580, 584 (1981). See also 2A C. Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 46.05 (4th ed. 1973). We look therefore to the entire statutory scheme to determine whether \u00a7 15 permits an adjudication of paternity to survive an acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The Commonwealth\u2019s assertion that \u00a7 15 authorizes two separate judgments misconceives both the function of a \u00a7 15 proceeding, and the \u201cstatutory plan set forth by G.L. c. 273, \u00a7 \u00a7 12-18, for obtaining support for the children of unwed parents.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>385 Mass. 461, 462-463 (1982). Paternity statutes were enacted in an effort to provide support for children from defaulting fathers. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>MacKenzie, </em>368 Mass. 613, 617 (1975). Sections 12 through 14 of G.L. c. 273 \u201ccontemplate an orderly progression of events, the end result of which is an order for the support of the child.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lobo, </em>385 Mass. 436, 443 n.13 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">General Laws c. 273, \u00a7 12, provides for an adjudication of paternity and for an appeal from such a determination. Section 12A authorizes a judge, on the motion of the alleged father, to order blood grouping tests in any proceeding to determine paternity. Section 13 authorizes a judge, once paternity is determined, to continue the case until the child is born and allows for payment for the mother\u2019s expenses of pregnancy and confinement, and for punishment by contempt of court, with up to two months\u2019 imprisonment, for failure to comply with such payment orders. Section 14 authorizes a judge to make orders for the care and custody of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Pursuant to \u00a7 15, a parent may convicted of neglecting or refusing to provide support. Because \u00a7 15 applies to either parent, it necessarily does not provide for a civil judgment of paternity. Section 16, which establishes the penalties for failure to comply with a support order, provides that the father shall be subject to penalties<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and orders for payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>\u201c[a]fter the adjudication and the birth of the child, in proceedings under section twelve, or after <em>conviction, </em>in proceedings under [section 15]\u201d (emphasis supplied). G. L. c. 273, \u00a7 16, as appearing in St. 1977, c. 848, \u00a7 6. As we read the entire statutory scheme, \u00a7 15 is designed to provide criminal penalties for a parent who neglects or wilfully refuses to support.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">We are supported in our conclusion by the language of \u00a7 15, which does not provide any appeal procedure except that generally available on conviction of a misdemeanor. G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 27A. To reach the result urged by the Commonwealth, we have to read into \u00a7 15 the appeal procedure of \u00a7 12<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the language of that section which makes an adjudication of paternity \u201cfinal and conclusive.\u201d G. L. c. 273, \u00a7 12. \u201cSuch a reading is contrary to the basic structure of the statute and violates the rule that where the Legislature has employed specific language in one paragraph, but not in another, the language should not be implied where it is not present.\u201d <em>Beeler </em>v. <em>Downey, </em>387 Mass. 609, 616 (1982). \u201c[W]hen the statute appears not to provide for an eventuality, there is no justification for judicial legislation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vickey, </em>381 Mass. 762, 767 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Since \u00a7 15 provides for only one finding, and in this case that finding is not guilty,* ****6<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we remand the case to the jury-of-six session of the District Court, where the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss should be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b342-13\"> General Laws c. 273, \u00a7 15, as amended by St. 1979, c. 621, \u00a7 2, provides in pertinent part: \u201cAny parent of an illegitimate child . . . who neglects or refuses to contribute reasonably to its support and maintenance, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. If there has been any final adjudication of the paternity of the child, such adjudication shall be conclusive on all persons in proceedings under this section; otherwise, the question of paternity shall be determined in proceedings hereunder.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b343-6\">We have reframed the issues in an effort to answer the basic questions raised by the report.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b343-7\">General Laws c. 273, \u00a7 12, as appearing in St. 1981, c. 325, governing the adjudication of paternity provides in pertinent part: \u201c[Wjhen such adjudication is made by a district court, if made after a plea of not guilty, the alleged father may appeal therefrom to a jury of six session of the district court department.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b344-7\"> Paternity, however, is not a criminal offense. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>MacKenzie, </em>368 Mass. 613, 615-617 (1975). To the extent that the Commonwealth argues that we should consider the defendant as convicted of the lesser included offense of paternity, we reject that argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b345-8\"> While \u201c[i]t is true that the almost universal practice . . . upon a conviction for nonsupport [is that] the offending parent is placed on condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>tional probation which is linked to compliance with a support order . . . , [t]he fact remains, however, that the failure to support a child continues to be \u2018expressed in a criminal context\u2019 and is punishable as a misdemeanor.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>385 Mass. 461, 463 (1982), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>MacKenzie, </em>368 Mass. 613, 614 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b346-13\"> In 1981, the Legislature amended the appeal provision in G. L. c. 273, \u00a7 12, which governs paternity adjudications. St. 1981, c. 92. The Legislature also could have amended \u00a7 15 to provide for a similar appeal from an adjudication of paternity in the course of a nonsupport proceeding but did not. See <em>Hadley v. Amherst, </em>372 Mass. 46, 51 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b346-14\"> Acquittal on a \u00a7 15 complaint does not bar future adjudication of paternity under \u00a7 12.
