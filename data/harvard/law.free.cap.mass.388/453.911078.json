Borans refused to answer questions at Reinstein\u2019s trial, asserting the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination. See U.S. Const, amend. V; art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. The judge ruled that Borans had waived that privilege, and adjudged Borans guilty of criminal contempt under the summary procedures of Mass. R. Crim. P. 43, 378 Mass. 919 (1979).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant appealed. We transferred the case on our own motion. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">We summarize the facts. William Reinstein took office as mayor of the city of Revere in 1972, and appointed David Borans as the city\u2019s purchasing agent shortly thereafter. In 1976, a Suffolk County grand jury was convened to investigate an alleged kickback scheme involving the construction of Revere High School during Reinstein\u2019s tenure in office. Borans voluntarily testified before the grand jury, denying knowledge of any kickback scheme. The grand jury indicted Reinstein and Borans on counts arising from the kickback scheme, and indicted Borans for perjury before the grand jury. After trial by jury, Borans was convicted on ten indictments. See note 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">After Borans\u2019 trial, the Commonwealth moved for a trial of Reinstein. Reinstein\u2019s first and second trials ended in mistrials. A third began in November, 1981. At that time, the prosecution served a summons on Borans to appear as a witness. Borans filed a motion to dismiss the summons, based on his privilege against self-incrimination, which was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>Pursuant to a subpoena, Borans appeared on February 1, 1982, as a prosecution witness before the judge in the Rein-stein trial. Borans was questioned in the absence of the jury. After stating his name and address, Borans refused to answer any further questions concerning events during his tenure as purchasing agent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although the judge ordered him to answer, Borans refused. The judge found him in contempt. The next day, the judge sentenced Borans to sixty days\u2019 imprisonment for criminal contempt, finding that Borans had waived his Fifth Amendment privilege.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Borans claims that he validly asserted the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, and that his testimony before the grand jury and at his own trial does not constitute a waiver of that privilege. We agree.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">A person\u2019s right to be free from self-incrimination is a fundamental principle of our system of justice, secured by the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and by art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. Accordingly, the privilege is to be construed liberally in favor of the claimant. <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>341 U.S. 479, 486 (1951). <em>In re Brogna, </em>589 F.2d 24, 27 (1st Cir. 1978). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Funches, </em>379 Mass. 283, 289 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>We apply Federal standards to determine whether a claim of privilege is justified. <em>Malloy </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em>378 U.S. 1 (1964). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Francis, </em>375 Mass. 211, 215, cert. denied, 439 U.S. 872 (1978). <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>354 Mass. 81, 84 (1968). Under those standards, a refusal to testify on Fifth Amendment grounds must be upheld unless it is <em>\u2018\u201cperfectly clear, </em>from a careful consideration of all the circumstances in the case, that the witness is mistaken, and that the answer[s] <em>cannot possibly </em>have such tendency\u2019 to incriminate.\u201d <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>341 U.S. 479, 488 (1951), quoting <em>Temple </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>75 Va. 892, 898 (1881), cited with approval in <em>Counselman </em>v. <em>Hitchcock, </em>142 U.S. 547, 579-580 (1892). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Funches, </em>379 Mass. 283, 289 (1979). The privilege \u201cnot only extends to answers that would in themselves support a conviction . . . but likewise embraces those which would furnish a link in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute the claimant.\u201d <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 486. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Francis, supra. </em>Employing these principles, we conclude that Borans has a proper basis upon which to invoke the protection of the Fifth Amendment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">At his trial, Borans was convicted of perjury in his grand jury testimony. The prosecution wanted him to testify at Reinstein\u2019s trial as to the same topics covered by his previous testimony.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Borans suggests that the Commonwealth was again attempting to place him \u201cin a dilemma: either give [self-] incriminating testimony [subjecting him to prosecution for perjury at his own trial] or perjure himself\u201d by incriminating Reinstein. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Borans, </em>379 Mass. 117, 138 (1979).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>Borans responded to this dilemma by using the other \u201coption available to him: the assertion of his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[A] witness may not claim the privilege out of fear that he will be prosecuted for perjury for what he is about to say, although he may claim the privilege if his new testimony might suggest that he had perjured himself in testifying on the same subject at a prior proceeding.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Partin, </em>552 F.2d 621, 632 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 903 (1977). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fortin, </em>685 F.2d 1297, 1298 (11th Cir. 1982); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Housand, </em>550 F.2d 818, 823 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 970 (1977). \u201cThe witness [Borons], consequently, may have had reasonable cause to apprehend danger from a direct answer,\u201d <em>id., </em>to questions at Reinstein\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">The Commonwealth claims that Borans has waived his privilege against self-incrimination by testifying before the grand jury and at his own trial. We disagree. \u201cIt is the majority rule that waiver by testimony is limited to the proceeding in which it is given and does not extend to subsequent proceedings. 8 J. Wigmore, [Evidence] \u00a7 2276 at 458 (1961, Supp. 1975).\u201d <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>369 Mass. 183, 190-191 (1975).

Fed. 793 (1979).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See generally <em>Pillsbury Co. </em>v. <em>Conboy, </em>459 U.S. 248 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">We believe that any waiver of Borans\u2019 privilege at the grand jury proceedings or at his trial does not extend to his testimony as a witness at the Reinstein trial.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Although the Borans trial and the Reinstein trial originated from the same grand jury investigation, the two trials cannot be considered as the same \u201cproceeding.\u201d The fact that the trials originated with the same grand jury is simply not enough to defeat a claim of privilege. These are different proceedings because each has a different defendant.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, we conclude that Borans did not waive his right to Fifth Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>ment protection by voluntarily testifying before the grand jury or by taking the stand in his own defense at his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">The Commonwealth also asserts that, in any event, we should deny Fifth Amendment protection to Borans because he is effectively immunized from further prosecution by his prior convictions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> However, \u201ca witness does not lose his Fifth Amendment right to refuse to testify concerning <em>other </em>matters or transactions not included in his conviction.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pardo, </em>636 F.2d 535, 544 (D.C. Cir. 1980).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See <em>supra </em>at 457-459. \u201cFurthermore, neither a practical unlikelihood of prosecution nor the prosecutor\u2019s denial of an intention to prosecute negates an otherwise proper invocation of the Fifth Amendment.\u201d <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Fair, </em>476 F. Supp. 874, 880 (D. Mass. 1979), vacated and remanded on other grounds, 617 F.2d 7 (1st Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">In light of all these considerations, we conclude that Borans properly could invoke Fifth Amendment protection. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of contempt against Borans.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">\n<em>Finding set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b469-14\"> \u201cBorons was convicted on ten indictments alleging a conflict of interest under G.

He sentenced Borans to terms of two and one-half to three years\u2019 imprisonment for each of Borans\u2019 convictions of violations of G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 2 <em>(b). </em>The eight sentences were to be served concurrently with the perjury and subornation of perjury sentences. In December, 1978, the sentences were reduced by the judge to time served, and Borans was placed on unsupervised probation for the remainder of the terms.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Borans, </em>379 Mass. 117, 119 n.1 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b470-8\"> The judge sentenced the defendant to imprisonment for two months, but stayed execution of the sentence pending this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b471-7\"> The voir dire was conducted as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">The prosecutor: \u201cCould you give us your name, please?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">The witness: \u201cDavid Borans.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">The prosecutor: \u201cSpell your last name?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">The witness: \u201cB-o-r-a-n-s.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-12\">The prosecutor: \u201cAnd where do you live, Mr. Borans?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-13\">The witness: \u201c111 Atlantic Avenue, Revere.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-14\">The prosecutor: \u201cRevere.

R. Crim. P. 43 was improper, because we conclude that Borans correctly asserted his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b472-6\"> Although this issue was not explicitly addressed by the trial judge, a finding that the Fifth Amendment is potentially available to Borans is necessary for a determination of Borans\u2019 claim of privilege.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b472-7\"> It is not clear from the record whether the Commonwealth\u2019s interrogation or Reinstein\u2019s cross-examination of Borans, in fact, would have stayed within the scope of Borans\u2019 testimony to the grand jury and at his trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b472-8\"> Borans had denied any knowledge of a kickback scheme. Borans\u2019 testimony at his trial paralleled his testimony before the grand jury, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>which he was convicted of perjury. In his last appeal, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Borans, supra, </em>Borans did not challenge the falsity of some of his grand jury testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b474-6\"> The rule in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is unclear. In <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>416 F.2d 791, 805 (D.C. Cir. 1969), the court stated that \u201cwhere a non-indicted witness has waived his Fifth Amendment privilege by testifying before a grand jury voluntarily and with knowledge of his privilege, his waiver extends to a subsequent trial based on an indictment returned by the grand jury that heard his testimony,\u201d unless new conditions or new issues present the danger of further incrimination. However, that court subsequently stated that \u201ca waiver of the privilege against self-incrimination is effective only in the proceedings at which the accused testifies.\u201d <em>Black Panther Party </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>661 F.2d 1243, 1273 (D.C. Cir. 1981), summarily vacated and remanded on other grounds, 458 U.S. 1118 (1982). See Note, The Impact of Ellis v. United States on the Privilege Against Self-Incriminatian, 15 How. L.J. 686 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b474-7\"> Relying on dicta in <em>Matter of DeSaulnier (No. 2), </em>360 Mass. 761, 766 (1971), the Commonwealth challenges the general rule. <em>DeSaulnier, supra, </em>indicated that a waiver of privilege could be found when a witness testifies in a proceeding that is the \u201cprobable, logical, or natural continuation or outgrowth of the proceeding or inquiry,\u201d in which the witness waived the privilege by giving previously recorded testimony on the same subjects. Unlike the <em>Borans </em>case, the testimony at issue in <em>DeSaulnier </em>was part of a continuing inquiry into judicial misconduct with the same witness, the same defendants, and the same offenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b474-8\"> It is not even clear that the charges against Reinstein and Borans are identical. Nor is it clear that the witnesses called at Reinstein\u2019s trial were the same as those who testified against Borans.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b475-10\"><em> </em>The Commonwealth also claims that Borans was required to answer additional questions at Reinstein\u2019s trial before he was entitled to assert his privilege. However, we have said that \u201cthe witness must claim his privilege in the outset, when the testimony he is about to give, will, if he answers fully all that appertains to it, expose him to a criminal charge, and if he does not, he waives it altogether.\u201d <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>11 Cush. 437, 439 (1853), quoted in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Funches, </em>379 Mass. 283, 289 (1979). <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Eisenstadt, </em>456 F.2d 382, 394 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 846 (1972). Even assuming that Borans claimed the privilege too early, it was clear to the Commonwealth and the judge that Borans\u2019 refusal to testify extended to all of the areas of intended inquiry described by the prosecution in its response to Borans\u2019 motion to dismiss his summons.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b475-11\"> At oral argument, Borans claimed that he had not yet been tried on one count of an indictment. However, the record is not clear on this point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b475-12\"> Relying on <em>Ottomano </em>v. <em>United States, </em>468 F.2d 269 (1st Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1128 (1973), Borans also asserts that he could incriminate himself in light of his motion for a new trial. We need not reach this issue, as we conclude that the possibility of prosecution for perjury is sufficient to support his claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
