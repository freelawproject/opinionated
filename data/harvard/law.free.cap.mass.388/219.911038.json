L. c. 231A, seeking a declaration of his right under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 111F, to receive leave without loss of pay as a police officer incapacitated due to an injury sustained in the course of duty.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A judge of the Superior Court declared that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s right to receive benefits ended on April 24, 1978, the date on which the board of selectmen sent him a termination notice. The plaintiff appealed to the Appeals Court, which issued a summary disposition reversing the Superior Court judgment and remanding for \u201c(1) a determination (preceded by an evidentiary hearing, if necessary) of the amount of any recovery by the plaintiff for any claim arising out of the occurrence which caused his disability and (2) the entry of a new judgment declaring the plaintiff to be entitled to benefits under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 111F, reduced by the amount of recovery by him as so determined.\u201d 13 Mass. App. Ct. 1106 (1982). We granted the defendants\u2019 application for further appellate review. We affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The trial judge found the following material facts. The plaintiff was permanently appointed as a regular police officer on May 22, 1977, by the board of selectmen of Bridge-water. At all times relevant to this action, the plaintiff was a probationary, nontenured police officer.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On March 16, 1978, the plaintiff responded to a call to assist emergency medical technicians assigned to the fire department. The plaintiff helped the technicians to carry a stretcher, and later complained to one of them of a pain in his right hand. The plaintiff made no report of the incident to the police department at that time. The following day, March 17, the plaintiff injured his right hand when he fell in a parking lot while alighting from a police cruiser. He was on duty at the time, and had been about to enter C &amp; C Liquors to purchase cigarettes. The plaintiff reported this injury to the chief of police (chief), and on his advice, went to Bridge-water Medical Center for treatment, after typing an employee accident report form on which he referred to both the March 16 and the March 17 incidents. The plaintiff was entered on departmental records as having been injured in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>the line of duty. Effective March 17, he was granted leave without loss of pay pursuant to G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 111F. From March 20, 1978, until the time of trial the plaintiff was treated by Dr. Richard Greenberg of the Brockton Orthopedic Association, who diagnosed his condition as tenosynovitis of the right palm. Dr. Greenberg informed the chief in a letter of April 20, 1978, that the plaintiff\u2019s hand was not responding to therapy and required a splint. The plaintiff ultimately underwent exploratory surgery in November, 1978, and at the time of trial the loss of feeling in his right index finger had diminished and in addition he had a fifteen degree loss of extension, with limited lateral movement, of the middle and index fingers. The judge found that the plaintiff was incapacitated from March 17, 1978, and continuing thereafter, by an injury sustained without fault of his own while in the performance of his duty, and that while he was able to perform 95 % of the functions of a police officer, he was \u201cunable to perform the full duties of a regular police officer including that of being able to effectively operate a firearm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Approximately one month prior to the plaintiff\u2019s injury, the chief initiated an investigation of certain police officers relating to their alleged purchase of or smoking of marihuana or observing such conduct by fellow officers and failing to report those engaged in such activities. On March 30, the plaintiff appeared with his attorney at the chief\u2019s office in response to an order \u201cto report... to answer questions as to an investigation which is presently pending concerning the use by members of the Bridgewater Police Department whether past or present of marijuana while on duty or off.\u201d On April 24, 1978, the board of selectmen notified the plaintiff that he was terminated; the reasons enumerated by the board for the discharge are set forth below.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiff\u2019s compen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>sation under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 11 IF, was terminated on the same date. The judge ruled that \u201cthe plaintiff\u2019s right to receive benefits pursuant to G. L. c. 41, [\u00a7] 11 IF ended on April 24, 1978, as a result of his termination as a police officer by the appointing authority as said termination was made for reasons independent of and not related to the plaintiff\u2019s incapacity.\u201d The sole issue before us is whether the town\u2019s discharge of the plaintiff was legally effective to terminate his benefits under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 111F.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">During the twelve-month probationary period, a police officer may be terminated pursuant to G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 20D, for reasons relating to his \u201cconduct or capacity\u201d or to \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>character or quality\u201d of his work performance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Since the plaintiff has raised no question with respect to the substance of the charges made against him or the validity of the termination procedure, we need only note that the rights of nontenured employees to challenge a termination under G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 20D, are limited. See <em>Costa </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Billerica, </em>377 Mass. 853, 859-861 (1979). The town\u2019s reasons for discharging the plaintiff imputed illegal conduct as well as breach of duty, and were thus properly particularized. See <em>Costa </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Billerica, supra </em>at 859 n.9, 861. See also <em>McSweeney </em>v. <em>Town Manager of Lexington, </em>379 Mass. 794, 797 n.5, 796 n.6 (1980). At the most, the plaintiff might have been afforded, under certain conditions, a hearing for the opportunity to clear his name. See <em>Stetson </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Carlisle, </em>369 Mass. 755, 762-764 (1976).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The judge found the plaintiff\u2019s termination was lawfully predicated on his conduct, capacity, character, or quality of work. She further found \u201cbased upon the reasons stated in the April 24, 1978 notice of termination and viewed in the light of the case law on the termination of tenured police officers, it can be reasonably inferred that the plaintiff would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>have been terminated irrespective of his incapacity due to his injury and his status as a probationary police officer. While the standard for termination of probationary employees is less than that of \u2018just cause\u2019, the reasons for the plaintiff\u2019s termination were equivalent to the \u2018just cause\u2019 standard required for the termination of a tenured officer, thus making his expulsion inevitable.\u201d This finding is supported by the evidence and is not clearly erroneous. Mass. R. Civ. P. 52 (a), 365 Mass. 816 (1974). See <em>Broderick </em>v. <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, </em>368 Mass. 33, 38 (1975), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1048 (1976), quoting <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Broderick, </em>392 U.S. 273, 278 (1968) (\u201cIf appellant, a policeman, had refused to answer questions specifically, directly, and narrowly relating to the performance of his official duties, without being required to waive his immunity with respect to the use of his answers or the fruits thereof in a criminal prosecution of himself, . . . the privilege against self-incrimination would not have been a bar to his dismissal\u201d); <em>Silverio </em>v. <em>Municipal Court of the City of Boston, </em>355 Mass. 623, 629-630, cert. denied, 396 U.S. 878 (1969) (\u201cWe deem [a police officer\u2019s] discharge to have been on the broad ground that he failed to answer any questions [posed by his superior and in the presence of his attorney] concerning his conduct as a police officer. The inquiry was in two parts: [1] questions reasonably designed to inform his superior whether he had failed to report matters which he should have reported, in particular, his knowledge of an auto theft ring involving three other policemen; and [2] questions as to his conduct before the grand jury in their investigation of the matter. The ground of discharge was his complete failure to perform his duty in this interrogation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The plaintiff argues that, irrespective of the basis of his termination, his right to benefits under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 11 IF, cannot be cut off by a notice of termination pursuant to G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 20D, but can only be extinguished through one of the methods set forth in \u00a7 111F, i.e., upon his retirement, or upon his being pensioned in accordance with law, or upon a medical determination that his incapacity no longer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>exists. The plaintiff urges that this case is controlled by our decision in <em>Thibeault </em>v. <em>New Bedford, </em>342 Mass. 552 (1961), where we held that a notice terminating the employment of a probationary police officer, rendered during the period of his incapacity and based solely upon that incapacity, could not become effective \u201cuntil the end of that period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 557. We do not agree that the <em>Thibeault </em>holding requires a judgment for the plaintiff in the present circumstances. In <em>Thibeault, </em>the petitioner was deemed unsuitable for permanent appointment as a police officer on two grounds: \u201c(1) the failure to complete the . . . probationary period and (2) the heart attack [suffered during the probationary period] and the consequent absence from work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 558. We said that \u201c[t]he chief was not obliged to find that a person [subject to injury of the kind sustained] was a satisfactory person for permanent employment,\u201d <em>id., </em>but we held that a termination notice under G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 20D, \u201ccannot cut off an accrued right to a leave of absence with pay under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 111F.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 557. Our holding precluded the city from using the officer\u2019s incapacity and resultant absence as reasons, under one statute, to withhold benefits provided by another statute to compensate for that very incapacity. By contrast, the present plaintiff was terminated under G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 20D, for reasons not causally connected, indeed not related in any way, to the provisions of G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 111F. The judge correctly declined to apply the <em>Thibeault </em>decision to these circumstances, where the plaintiff\u2019s termination was for breach of duty and illegal conduct and was the equivalent of a discharge for \u201cjust cause\u201d under then G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Nor do we agree with the plaintiff that the language of G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 111F, \u201cspecifically provides that the benefits payable thereunder shall cease only if such recipient is \u2018retired or pensioned in accordance with law or for any period after a physician designated by the board or officer authorized to appoint police officers . . . determines that such incapacity no longer exists.\u2019 \u201d Although the occurrence of any of these three events will require a termination of benefits under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>\u00a7 11 IF, we do not consider them conditions precedent to termination. The statute itself does not mandate the continuation of payment of benefits until one of these three events has occurred; rather, the statute prohibits continuation of benefits <em>after </em>one of the events has occurred. See note 2, <em>supra. </em>We think that the Legislature, in proscribing benefits after the occurrence of retirement, pensioning, or a medical determination of fitness, evinced the natural and reasonable intention that an employee should not receive double benefits or be granted a windfall. Cf. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Wayland, </em>380 Mass. 110, 119-120 (1980). We do not believe that it was the Legislature\u2019s intention, in seeking to avoid such a result, to bind cities and towns to indefinite payment of wages to persons lawfully separated from employment by methods other than those delineated in \u00a7 11 IF.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">We have previously held that a police officer\u2019s self-declaration of fitness for \u201clight duty,\u201d <em>Thibeault </em>v. <em>New Bedford, </em>342 Mass. 552, 554-556 (1961), and voluntary resignation of his position, <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Wayland, </em>374 Mass. 249, 260 (1978), were effective to trigger a termination of rights under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 111F. We perceive no reason founded on legislative policy or on logic to hold otherwise in this case. The statute clearly contemplates, in instances not resulting in retirement or pensioning, a return to duty. See <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Wayland, </em>380 Mass. 110, 121-122 (1980), S.C., 374 Mass. 249, 260 (1978). Here, the plaintiff was lawfully separated from employment under G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 20D, negating \u201cany thought that duties will be resumed.\u201d 374 Mass. at 260. As we have said, \u201cthe legislative scheme [of G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 111F] is designed to afford some protection to a disabled officer pending recovery or pending a severance from employment due to factors beyond the officer\u2019s personal control, i.e., retirement or pension.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In these circumstances, where the unchallenged reasons for termination charge illegal conduct as well as breach of duty, we think the plaintiff has forfeited any claim to the continuation of wages which are incident to employment. <em>Id. </em>See <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Treasurer of Cambridge, </em>310 Mass. 484, 489 (1941), and cases cited. To reach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>a contrary result would be to adopt a construction of the statute leading to an \u201cunreasonable conclusion,\u201d which we need not do \u201cwhere its language is fairly susceptible to a construction that would lead to a logical and sensible result.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">\n<em>Judgment of the Superior Court affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b235-18\"> General Laws c. 41, \u00a7 111F, as amended through St. 1977, c. 646, \u00a7 2, provides in material part: \u201cWhenever a police officer ... of a city [or] town ... is incapacitated for duty because of injury sustained in the performance of his duty without fault of his own ... he shall be granted leave without loss of pay for the period of such incapacity; provided, that no such leave shall be granted for any period after such police officer . . . has been retired or pensioned in accordance with law or for any period after a physician designated by the board or officer authorized to appoint police officers ... in such city [or] town . . . determines that such incapacity no longer exists.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b236-6\"> General Laws c. 31, \u00a7 20D, then in effect, required a probationary, nontenured police officer to serve a term of twelve months before attaining tenure.
