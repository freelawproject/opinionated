On June 12, 2006, around 5 p.m. or 6 p.m., a Stoneham police officer in a marked cruiser commenced pursuit of two juveniles in a car. He followed the car on several back roads, and when the driver went onto Route 28, the officer turned on his sirens and lights in an effort to cause the driver to stop. The driver failed to pull over and began weaving through traffic, traveling at certain times at speeds of up to forty to fifty miles per hour. This initial chase lasted five to six minutes. A second officer joined in the chase in the last one-eighth mile in his own marked cruiser with the lights and sirens on. The car finally turned into an apartment complex, where it crashed into bushes at a \u201cdead end.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">The first officer stopped his cruiser and stepped out of his vehicle, following the juveniles who were now running through four- to five-foot tall \u201cvery full\u201d bushes; the officer was required either to jump over or go through the bushes. He tripped and fell onto the sidewalk behind a bush and sprained his wrist, after which he lost sight of the two juveniles. He returned to his cruiser. The second officer, upon seeing the first officer return, drove his cruiser to a different location in the complex. He saw the juveniles come out of the bushes and run through the parking area. The officer commenced chase on foot, yelling, \u201cStop, police. Stop, police.\u201d The officer climbed a three- to five-foot high stone wall in pursuit of the juvenile here. The juvenile (who had been the passenger in the car) now found himself trapped between a building with a locked door, a fence, and the officer. The juvenile offered no resistance when he was finally cornered, handcuffed, and placed in the cruiser.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">1. <em>Resisting arrest </em>charge.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We review the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the resisting arrest charge under the familiar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number><em>Latimore </em>standard. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-678 (1979). The charge of resisting arrest requires the Commonwealth to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the juvenile \u201cknowingly prevent[ed] or attempted] to prevent a police officer, acting under color of his official authority, from effecting an arrest of the actor or another, by: (1) using or threatening to use physical force or violence against the police officer or another; or (2) using any other means which create[d] a substantial risk of causing bodily injury to such police officer or another.\u201d G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 326(a), inserted by St. 1995, c. 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">Because the juvenile, after being cornered, offered no resistance and did not exhibit any noncooperation when being handcuffed and placed in the cruiser, there was no physical force or resistance which would implicate G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 32B(a)(l). See and compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maylott, </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 466, 467, 469-470 (2006). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Katykhin, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 261, 262-263 (2003). Thus, only \u00a7 326(a)(2) is in question here.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">We have recently decided two cases discussing \u00a7 32B(a)(2): <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 205, 208-210 (2008), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montoya, ante </em>125 (2008). We think the factual scenario here more closely resembles that in <em>Grant </em>than the scenario in <em>Montoya.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">It is well known that \u201cthe crime [of resisting arrest] is committed, if at all, at the time of the \u2018effecting\u2019 of an arrest.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grandison, </em>433 Mass. 135, 145 (2001). An arrest is effected when there is \u201c(1) \u2018an actual or constructive seizure or detention of the person, [2] performed with the intention to effect an arrest and [3] so understood by the person detained.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>419 Mass. 192, 198 (1994). In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. at 209-210, this court held that where a pursuit and the question of a constructive seizure or detention are involved, in order to bring a defendant\u2019s conduct within the purview of the resisting arrest statute, the words or actions of the officers must have \u201cobjectively communicated [the intent to arrest] to the defendant prior to, or during the pursuit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 209. The Commonwealth relies on the fact that the police cruiser had its lights and sirens on as it pursued the car in which the juvenile was a passenger as indicative of the offi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>cers\u2019 intent to arrest the occupants.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We disagree, as there was no way for the occupants of the car to know that the police were trying to stop the car for something other than a traffic violation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Even if the police officers had \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d of criminal activity, providing a basis to stop the vehicle, an intent to stop for questioning is not identical to an intent to effectuate an arrest; the flashing lights could not objectively communicate that there was an intent to arrest rather than an intent to stop and question. Moreover, it is to be noted that ordinarily \u201cpursuit of a vehicle for a traffic violation does not constitute, without more, pursuit of a passenger for these purposes.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 411, 413 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\">The Commonwealth argues, relying on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, supra, </em>that pursuit of the juvenile in the instant circumstances began when he left the car. However, even if we assume this to be the case, there was no objective communication to the juvenile that the officers were attempting to effect an arrest of him, nor was there evidence proving that the juvenile understood that the officers had such an intent. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. at 209. The juvenile was simply running away. Even when the second officer commenced his pursuit of the juvenile and yelled, \u201cStop, police. Stop, police,\u201d there was no indication that the command was \u201cso understood [as an arrest] by the person [pursued],\u201d particularly since there were two juveniles, the driver and the passenger. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>419 Mass, at 198. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montoya, supra </em>at 128 (\u201cverbal notification to an individual that he is being arrested is not conclusive on the question when an arrest occurs\u201d). \u201cFleeing from, or even resisting, a stop or patfrisk does not constitute the crime of resisting arrest.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grant, supra </em>at 209. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 569, 574-575 (2002) (stop for purpose of making threshold inquiry is not arrest, and statute does not apply); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pagan, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 780, 784 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>(2005) (statute does not apply to patfrisks). Accord <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lender, 66 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 303, 305-306 (2006). As the recent <em>Montoya </em>case reiterates, \u201c[t]he crime [of resisting arrest] is committed ... at the time of the \u2018effecting\u2019 of an arrest.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montoya, supra </em>at 127, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grant, supra </em>at 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">The <em>Montoya </em>case is distinguishable from the instant case because in <em>Montoya </em>the evidence showed that the defendant\u2019s flight began after the police, with guns drawn, surrounded the defendant and ordered him to stop. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montoya, supra </em>at 132. Moreover, the evidence in the present case of \u201cthe <em>circumstances </em>[emphasis in original] of [the juvenile\u2019s] flight [did not] expose his pursuers to a \u2018substantial risk of bodily injury,\u2019 \u201d as contemplated by \u00a7 32B(ti)(2). <em>Id. </em>at 130. There has been no showing that the juvenile used physical force or violence or any other means contemplated by \u00a7 32B to counter the police officers\u2019 efforts to capture him. Thus, the evidence is insufficient to support the conviction of resisting arrest. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grant, supra </em>at 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">2. <em>Judge\u2019s instructions. </em>Deciding as we do that the adjudication of delinquency is reversible error, we have no need to address the juvenile\u2019s claim that the judge did not apply the correct standard for a finding of delinquency (see note 3, <em>supra). </em>We reiterate, however, the familiar principle that in reviewing a jury-waived proceeding, \u201c[a] trial judge sitting without a jury is presumed, absent contrary indication, to have correctly instructed himself as to the manner in which evidence is to be considered in his role as factfinder.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Batista, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 642, 648 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the adjudication of delinquency on the charge of resisting arrest; the finding of delinquency is set aside; and judgment is to enter for the juvenile.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b864-17\">The Commonwealth also charged the juvenile with receiving a stolen motor vehicle, for which he was tried in a separate proceeding and committed to the Department of Youth Services.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b865-8\">The juvenile also claims that the trial judge found delinquency based merely on \u201csufficient evidence\u201d rather than the well-established \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b865-9\">The resisting arrest charge, on which the juvenile was found delinquent, was tried four months after the incident. The juvenile\u2019s counsel asserts that the Commonwealth pursued this action so as to be able to order the juvenile to pay restitution for the property damage resulting from the crash of the vehicle into some landscaping in the parking lot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b867-5\">The Commonwealth also claims that this was not a routine traffic stop. However, the record lacks any facts that show this was communicated to the occupants of the car.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b867-6\">At best, these facts would tend to support a charge against the driver for failure to stop for a police officer. See G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 25.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
