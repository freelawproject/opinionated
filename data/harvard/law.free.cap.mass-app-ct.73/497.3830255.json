The papers filed in the Superior Court, where the case was tried, bubble with sulphurous acrimony that, though cooled somewhat, has spilled over to the papers filed here, threatening on occasion to obscure the essential questions the appeal presents. Those questions center on the appropriateness of the initial judgment and of the trial judge\u2019s serial modifications of that judgment. Our review of the record leads us to conclude that the judge was correct in some respects and incorrect in others. We therefore affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">1. <em>Background, </em>a. <em>The underlying dispute. </em>To understand the significant twists and turns that produced the appellate issues, it is necessary to discuss the substantive and procedural history of the case in a little more detail than is customary. The dispute originated in a commercial relationship that began in the 1980\u2019s. Stanley Ross (Stanley), one of the original plaintiffs, was then a principal in a company called Docunet Corporation (Docunet). Docunet leased computer equipment from the defendants, Continental Resources, Inc., and Continental Leasing Co., Inc. (collectively Continental).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">In 1987, Docunet fell substantially behind on its lease payments, so Continental, Docunet, and Stanley entered into a new lease agreement restructuring Docunet\u2019s obligations. Stanley <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>personally guaranteed Docunet\u2019s performance under the new agreement, securing that guarantee with a second mortgage on the Ross home. Although Stanley owned the home as a tenant by the entirety with his wife, plaintiff Francine Ross (Francine), he did not tell Francine about the guarantee.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Docunet soon encountered serious financial problems and, as a result, failed to honor the obligations it had assumed under the new lease agreement. As a consequence, Docunet returned to Continental all the leased equipment and, in 1991, filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, listing Continental as a creditor to which it owed $7,500. The bankruptcy proceedings led to a fifty percent plan of reorganization. Although some creditors received payment under that plan, Continental was not among them.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Ultimately, the reorganization was unsuccessful, and in 1994, Docunet again filed for bankruptcy, this time under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. Continental was aware of both bankruptcy actions but, believing that the debts were uncollectible, wrote them off in 1991 and made no contemporaneous effort to collect on Stanley\u2019s guarantee.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">b. <em>Early stages of litigation. </em>In 1999, however, Continental apparently decided that it was worthwhile to pursue Stanley\u2019s guarantee and so began foreclosure proceedings against the Ross house in the Land Court, where it received a judgment under the Soldiers\u2019 and Sailors\u2019 Civil Relief Act of 1940, 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 510 (2000), authorizing entry and sale.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Negotiations between Continental and Stanley then ensued but ended without resolution. At some point between 1989 and the time it started the 1999 litigation, Continental had destroyed its Docunet billing records in the ordinary course of business. Summaries of at least some of those records, however, were available, albeit without any documentary support or backup.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">By the summer of 2000, Stanley was suffering from cancer and he and Francine decided to sell their house. It was then that Francine first learned of Continental\u2019s second mortgage and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>impediment to a sale the mortgage posed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> More negotiations ensued, during which Francine and Stanley told Continental of Stanley\u2019s health problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The negotiations failed. Thereafter, Stanley and Francine brought an action against Continental in Superior Court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent foreclosure and damages for violation of G. L. c. 93A, breach of contract, fraud, interference with advantageous relations, \u201cfraudulent inducement,\u201d and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Continental counterclaimed against Stanley on his guarantee of the Docunet/Continental agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">After initial skirmishes, the case was set for trial on an expedited basis. The parties then agreed that Continental would discharge its mortgage in return for creation of an escrow fund into which Stanley and Francine would place $50,000 to be held until entry of final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">c. <em>Trial and decision. </em>Escrow agreement in place, the case was tried, jury-waived, before a judge of the Superior Court, who dismissed all of Stanley\u2019s and Francine\u2019s claims except their claim under G. L. c. 93A. With respect to that claim, the judge found that, although Continental asserted that Stanley owed approximately $15,000 in principal and approximately $17,000 in interest on the guarantee, Continental\u2019s own records were insufficient to prove that Stanley owed that or any other amount. In addition, the judge found that Continental never told Stanley or Francine about destruction of its records and resulting inability to provide any \u201cbackup\u201d for its claim. Continental hid information about its record destruction from Stanley and Francine, the judge found, \u201cin order to, and solely as a way to, leverage [Stanley\u2019s and Francine\u2019s] interest in selling their house into a willingness on [their] part ... to pay money to Continental, even though it could not document or back up the actual monies owed\u201d and even though it knew that Stanley \u201cwas suffering from cancer and that as a result of his illness, the Rosses intended to sell their home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">Insofar as Continental\u2019s counterclaim was concerned, however, the judge stated that she disbelieved Stanley\u2019s trial testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>mony that Docunet had paid Continental everything Continental was owed. More specifically, she disbelieved Stanley\u2019s testimony that he, himself, had sent checks directly to Continental as well as his testimony that canceled checks confirming those payments had been destroyed by a basement flood that had left all other basement contents intact.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Based on the list of creditors Stanley filed in the 1991 bankruptcy proceedings, the judge found that Docunet owed Continental \u201cat least\u201d $7,500 and therefore ordered entry of judgment for Continental in that amount plus interest. With respect to Continental\u2019s violation of G. L. c. 93A, the judge determined that Stanley\u2019s and Francine\u2019s damages were the attorney\u2019s fees of $10,773.36 they had incurred defending against Continental\u2019s foreclosure efforts. Based on a finding that Continental\u2019s actions were knowing and wilful, she trebled those damages to $32,321.88 and awarded Stanley and Francine $57,696.31 in attorney\u2019s fees for prosecution of the c. 93A claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">d. <em>The first judgment. </em>Stanley died a few days after the trial ended, and his estate was substituted as a plaintiff. Francine and the estate (collectively Francine) and Continental promptly filed motions for reconsideration of the order for entry of judgment, each focusing on components of the order that were adverse to their interests. Continental, arguing that it had received an insufficient damages award, supported its motion with an affidavit from its attorney that took aim at the reliability of Docunet\u2019s bankruptcy creditor list, which the judge had used as a basis for her damages award. In his affidavit, Continental\u2019s attorney said that he had never offered the list in evidence because it was \u201cunreliable, unsupported, and false.\u201d Instead, counsel explained, he had simply used the list while cross-examining Stanley to impeach his testimony that all of Docunet\u2019s debts to Continental had been paid before the bankruptcy filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">The judge denied Continental\u2019s motion for reconsideration but allowed Francine\u2019s motion, saying in part that, after reading the affidavit of Continental\u2019s counsel, she was \u201cno longer satisfied that the $7,500 amount [she] initially credited has any credible factual basis.\u201d Continuing, she said that it was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-8\">\u201cnot disputed that, by the time of trial, Continental knew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>of the absence of a credible factual basis for this $7500.00 debt at the time. When it asked this court to find facts #57 and #58[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] in its Amended and Supplemental Request for Findings of Fact, Continental then believed that the $7500.00 figure lacked a credible factual basis as Ross and Docunet\u2019s debt to them. I am no longer satisfied that Continental has met its burden of establishing the amount of money owed to them by Ross and Docunet. Accordingly, this court vacates so much of its July 15, 2002, [order for] Judgment as awarded Continental $7500.00 on Counts I and II of its Counterclaim. Judgment is to enter for Continental on Counts I and II of the Counterclaim in the amount of $1.00 plus interest since June 27, 1990.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">e. <em>The September 20, 2005, orders dismissing Continental\u2019s appeal and requiring \u201cexpedited\u201d transcripts. </em>Judgment pursuant to the order just quoted was entered on July 8, 2003, and Continental filed its notice of appeal three days later. About two weeks after that, on July 28, 2003, Continental filed a certificate stating that on July 15, 2003, it had ordered from the court reporters a transcript of all proceedings. We shall have more to say about that certificate, and the judge\u2019s treatment of it, later in our discussion. Of importance to the general narrative, though, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>is that no events whatsoever are reflected on the docket for the two-year period after Continental filed its certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">Eventually, the apparent lack of progress in the case led Francine to write a letter to the trial judge bringing to her attention the case\u2019s stalled progress. The judge treated Francine\u2019s letter as a motion and conducted a series of hearings that culminated in two orders, both dated September 20, 2005, and both docketed on September 29, 2005. Because the hearings revealed that the court reporters had prepared no trial transcript, the first order required them to do so within ninety days. At Francine\u2019s request, the order also vacated the escrow agreement, thereby permitting the escrow agent to give Francine the more than $50,000 that that account held. The second order dismissed Continental\u2019s appeal on grounds that Continental had not been diligent about pursuing the transcripts from the reporters.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">f. <em>The second judgment containing additional attorney\u2019s fees. </em>Continental promptly filed a notice of appeal from the September 20, 2005, orders.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On May 3, 2006, seven and one-half months later, Continental filed a motion to vacate the order dismissing its appeal, arguing that the delay in obtaining transcripts was the product of trial court institutional problems, not fault on its part. As evidence of the institutional problems, Continental observed that it had paid the reporters for the transcripts before entry of the judge\u2019s order requiring transcript production in ninety days, but six months later, no transcripts had yet materialized.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Francine responded with a motion for sanctions and a motion to dismiss the appeal from the order dismissing the appeal. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>the former, she argued that Continental\u2019s motion to vacate contained no issue or argument Continental had not advanced earlier. In the latter, Francine asserted that Continental had not moved quickly enough to obtain the transcripts necessary to perfect their appeal from the order dismissing the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">After the hearings,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the judge denied Continental\u2019s motion to vacate the dismissal order as well as Francine\u2019s motion to dismiss Continental\u2019s appeal from that same order. The judge allowed, however, Francine\u2019s motion for sanctions because, in her view, Continental had provided no new grounds for questioning the correctness of her order dismissing the appeal. Purporting to act under the authority of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and G. L. c. 93A, she also awarded Francine $40,890.03 in additional fees and costs, but she did not articulate the manner in which she calculated that award. An \u201camended judgment\u201d incorporating the additional fees and costs was entered on September 28, 2006 (hereinafter referred to as the second judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">g. <em>The third judgment also containing additional attorney\u2019s fees. </em>Continental again appealed, filing a general notice of appeal from the second judgment and a notice of appeal to a single justice of this court pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6G, to the extent that the trial judge had purported to act pursuant to G. L. c. 231, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>\u00a7 6F.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On October 4, 2006, however, Continental also served a motion to, inter alia, alter the second judgment by reducing or eliminating the new attorney\u2019s fees contained in the second judgment and by vacating the portion of the first judgment, entered four years earlier, that had reduced its recovery from $7,500 to one dollar. Continental accompanied its motion with documents from the United States Bankruptcy Court showing, it urged, that it had accurately represented the course of the bankruptcy proceeding throughout.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Francine again responded with a motion for sanctions, based partly on what she asserted was the untimeliness of Continental\u2019s motion and partly on Continental\u2019s appeal to the single justice, which she claimed was contrary to Continental\u2019s promise at various hearings to \u201cmove forward\u201d with its appeal from the order dismissing the initial appeal. After hearing,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the judge ruled that Continental\u2019s motion was untimely and allowed, again under both G. L. c. 93A and G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, Francine\u2019s motion for sanctions, this time adding $4,510 in fees and costs to the judgment. Once more, the judge did not accompany her award with an explanation of her calculation of the amount she awarded. Another \u201camended judgment\u201d was entered on November 3, 2006, incorporating the added fees (hereinafter referred to as third judgment). As before, appeals by Continental to this court and to the single justice followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">2. <em>Analysis and discussion. </em>Sensible unpacking of the appellate issues Continental has extracted from the tortured history just recited requires us to proceed chronologically from back to front, for early issues are moot unless later issues are resolved in Continental\u2019s favor. In functional order, therefore, the issues are these: (a) those raised by Continental\u2019s appeal from the third judgment, namely, whether the judge properly dismissed as untimely Continental\u2019s motion to alter the second judgment, properly imposed sanctions and fees on Continental for filing that motion, and properly calculated those fees and sanctions; (b) those raised by Continental\u2019s appeal from the second judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>ment, namely, whether the judge properly denied Continental\u2019s May 3, 2006, motion to vacate the order dismissing the appeal, properly assessed sanctions and fees against Continental for filing that motion, and properly calculated the fees and sanctions; (c) those raised by the appeal from the judge\u2019s order dismissing Continental\u2019s appeal from the first judgment, namely, whether Continental failed to pursue transcripts with appropriate diligence; and (d) those raised by the first judgment, namely (i) whether the judge properly reduced Continental\u2019s judgment from $7,500 plus interest to one dollar plus interest, (ii) whether the judge properly found that Continental had committed unfair and deceptive debt collection practices, and (iii) whether the judge properly calculated attorney\u2019s fees. We turn, therefore, to those issues in that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">a. <em>Continental\u2019s appeal from the third judgment. </em>As noted earlier in the narrative, the second judgment was entered on September 28, 2006. In that judgment, the judge increased the plaintiff\u2019s recovery by $40,890.03, or about forty-five percent, by adding additional attorney\u2019s fees under both G. L. 93A and G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F. Continental served its motion to alter that judgment on October 4, 2006, and, in the motion, also sought alteration of the first judgment, which had been entered on July 8, 2003, more than three years earlier. The judge denied Continental\u2019s motion as untimely and, without saying why, awarded Francine $4,510 in additional fees and sanctions. That award was embodied in the third judgment and is the only difference between the third and second judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Continental\u2019s motion was not untimely and should not have been denied on that ground. The motion targeted the second judgment, which contained two components, one old and one new. The new component was the additional $40,890.03 in attorney\u2019s fees. The old component was the damages award contained in the three year old first judgment that had simply migrated without change into the second judgment. Insofar as Continental\u2019s motion sought alteration of the new component, the motion, served six days after the second judgment was entered, fell well within the time permitted by the applicable rule. See Mass.R.Civ.P 59(e), 365 Mass. 827 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">We need not decide whether the motion was also timely as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>the judgment\u2019s old component,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> because our conclusion that it was timely as to the new component is sufficient to resolve the single issue uniquely arising out of the third judgment, namely, whether it was an unfair and deceptive practice meriting an award of attorney\u2019s fees for Continental to file a motion seeking, in part, reduction of fees and sanctions that first appeared in the second judgment. We think it self-evident that filing a timely motion of arguable merit<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> to obtain relief from a judgment imposing significant adverse consequences is not an act G. L. c. 93A prohibits. Accordingly, the third judgment is vacated.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">b. <em>Continental\u2019s appeal from the second judgment. </em>Vacation of the third judgment means that the second judgment is the operative judgment in the case. The second judgment, like the third, contains an old and a new component. The old component is the award of damages, costs, and fees embodied in the first judgment. The new component was the award of $40,890.03 in additional costs and fees against Continental for filing a motion to vacate the judge\u2019s September 20, 2005, order dismissing Continental\u2019s appeal from the first judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The judge\u2019s September 20,2005, dismissal order was grounded on her conclusions that Continental had not acted with sufficient dispatch and diligence in ordering the transcripts necessary for the appeal. Continental\u2019s motion to vacate that order, filed on May 3, 2006, seven and one-half months after entry of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>the dismissal order, consisted of five pages plus some exhibits. In the exhibits, Continental summarized its efforts to obtain the transcripts, noted that the transcripts remained unavailable seven and one-half months after the judge entered an order requiring the court reporters to prepare them within ninety days, and pointed to an article in the February 27, 2006, issue of Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly detailing the difficulties many lawyers were having in obtaining timely delivery of trial transcripts and the steps court administrators were taking to remedy the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">By marginal notation after two days of hearings, during one of which the judge orally denied Continental\u2019s motion, the judge allowed Francine\u2019s motion for sanctions, finding that Continental \u201cfiled a baseless . . . motion as they provided no new or additional information as to the correctness of this court\u2019s [order dismissing the appeal]. This court determines that, for this reason, fees are appropriate under both c. 93A and c. 231, \u00a7 6F [in the amount of $40,890.03] .... This court finds that the time charges and rates and work done by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel to be fair and reasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Continental\u2019s motion was not \u201cbaseless.\u201d Indeed, as the next section of this opinion reveals, see part 2.c, <em>infra, </em>we think the dismissal order was error. From the outset, Continental had argued, at least in part, that its transcript difficulties were due to court reporters\u2019 workloads and resulting inability to produce transcripts in anything resembling reasonable amounts of time, not to its lackadaisical approach to ordering transcripts and following up on their production. To amplify those arguments, Continental\u2019s May 3, 2006, motion invited the judge\u2019s attention to the fact that even her order for \u201cexpedited\u201d transcript production had no apparent effect on the reporters\u2019 production effort. If the reporters failed to respond to the judge\u2019s command, Continental argued, how could it fairly be penalized for the reporters\u2019 failure to respond to its request?</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">While we think that the fee award cannot be justified on the ground that Continental\u2019s motion was \u201cbaseless,\u201d some part of that award may be justified on a ground discussed at the hearing but not mentioned in the judge\u2019s order, i.e., the appropriateness of awarding attorney\u2019s fees to a prevailing party in a case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>brought under G. L. c. 93A for all trial and appellate efforts reasonably expended in bringing the claim to a final resolution. In <em>Yorke Mgmt. </em>v. <em>Castro, </em>406 Mass. 17, 19 (1989), the Supreme Judicial Court said that a prevailing plaintiff was entitled to appellate attorney\u2019s fees in an action under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9, because \u201cstatutory provisions for a \u2018reasonable attorney\u2019s fee\u2019 would ring hollow if it did not necessarily include a fee for the appeal.\u201d The court has taken the same approach to claims under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11. See <em>Twin Fires Inv., LLC </em>v. <em>Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &amp; Co., </em>445 Mass. 411, 432-433 (2005). See generally <em>Bonofiglio </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>412 Mass. 612, 613 (1992). For the same reason, a prevailing party is entitled to a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee for all other trial court actions reasonably necessary to obtain a final judgment. Accordingly, some part of Francine\u2019s fee request may be appropriate on the theory that some of her attorney\u2019s actions were reasonably necessary to move the case toward a final judgment. The second judgment is, therefore, vacated, and on remand, the judge may consider Francine\u2019s fee request anew in light of the principles just articulated.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">c. <em>Allowance of the motion to dismiss the appeal from the original judgment. </em>The next question becomes whether the judge properly dismissed Continental\u2019s appeal from the first judgment because of her conclusion that Continental had not been diligent in ordering transcripts from the court reporters. For the following reasons, we think that order was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">The original judgment was entered on July 8, 2003. On July 11, 2003, Continental filed its notice of appeal. Continental\u2019s counsel believed that a full transcript of the trial and related proceedings was necessary for the appeal. One court reporter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>Robert Jacques, had recorded the testimony over the eight days of trial and another, John Lynch, had recorded a nonevidentiary hearing following the trial. Accordingly, on July 14,2003, counsel contacted both reporters by telephone and discussed with them his need for transcripts. The next day, counsel sent a letter to Jacques saying that he was \u201cwriting to make arrangements to order the transcript of the trial.\u201d In the letter, he asked Jacques to contact him \u201cto advise what deposit is required to arrange for preparation of the transcript.\u201d The same day, counsel sent a letter of similar tenor to Lynch. Two weeks later, on July 28, 2003, counsel filed a certificate in accordance with Mass.R.A.R 9(c)(2)(ii), as amended, 437 Mass. 1602 (2002), saying that he had ordered transcripts from the reporters.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Counsel heard nothing from either reporter. Accordingly, a paralegal from his office telephoned them on January 9, 2004, and January 26,2004, to inquire about the status of the transcripts. One of the reporters replied that he had a substantial \u201cbacklog . . . and that it would be some time before a transcript of this case would be prepared.\u201d On February 5, 2004, the paralegal followed up with a letter to Jacques in which she said, among other things, \u201c[w]ould you kindly forward an invoice by telefax to my attention or contact me by telephone regarding the cost of [the transcript] as soon as possible so that I may send payment via [Fjederal [E]xpress.\u201d In a letter she sent the same day to Lynch, the paralegal said, \u201cPlease contact the undersigned at your earliest convenience to advise what is required in way of a deposit in order to begin the preparation of the transcript.\u201d The paralegal followed the letters with telephone calls on February 11 and 13, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Again, nothing happened, this time for about fifteen months. On May 16, 2005, another paralegal from counsel\u2019s office contacted someone at the Superior Court in Middlesex County, where the case had been tried, to determine whether anything could be done to expedite the trial transcript. He was directed to contact Jacques. This he did on May 26, 2005, and Jacques advised him \u201cin general terms\u201d of the transcript costs but said that \u201cit would take multiple months for him to transcribe all of the proceedings requested.\u201d On May 31, 2005, the paralegal left a message for Jacques asking him to prepare the entire transcript. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>Not until a telephone conversation on July 21, 2005, however, did Jacques inform the paralegal of the amount of the deposit required for preparation of the transcript ($5,400) and of the mailing address to which the deposit should be sent. The paralegal sent that deposit to Jacques four days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Meanwhile, Francine, without the knowledge of her attorney, sent a letter dated June 3, 2005, to the trial judge asking about the status of the record assembly.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The judge treated that letter as a motion to vacate the escrow account and expedite preparation of the transcripts. On September 2, 2005, Francine\u2019s attorney filed a motion to dismiss the appeal on grounds that Continental had not pursued transcript preparation with sufficient diligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The judge held hearings on the motions on September 6, 2005, and September 9, 2005, by which time counsel for Continental had been unable to learn anything from Jacques about the status of the transcript he had paid Jacques to prepare. Moreover, at that time counsel had not received from Lynch any information about the deposit Lynch required before he would begin preparing the transcript for which he was responsible.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">On September 20, 2005, the judge issued an order vacating the escrow account and ordering that the transcripts be prepared on an \u201cexpedite[dj\u201d basis within ninety days. On the same day, she issued a memorandum and order dismissing the appeal. In her memorandum, the judge found that Continental\u2019s attorney had failed to comply with Mass.RA.P. 8(b)(1), as amended, 430 Mass. 1603 (1999), which requires an appellant to \u201cmake satisfactory arrangements with the court reporter for payment of the cost of the transcript\u201d at the time the transcript is ordered. Because counsel failed to make those arrangements, the judge concluded, counsel failed in an unspecified way to comply with Mass.R.A.P. 9(c)(2). Counsel\u2019s failure to comply with rule 9(c)(2), the judge also mled, was the product of \u201cinexcusable neglect\u201d for which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>dismissal of the appeal was an appropriate remedy under the terms of Mass.R.A.P. 10(c), as amended, 417 Mass. 1602 (1994). As for the provision of Mass.R.A.P. 10(c) that states that \u201c[i]f, prior to the lower court\u2019s hearing [a motion to dismiss the appeal] for noncompliance with Rule 9(c), the appellant shall have cured the noncompliance, the appellant\u2019s compliance shall be deemed timely,\u201d the judge said this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-5\">\u201cBy the date of the hearings on [the motion to dismiss], on September 6, 2005 and again on September 9, 2005, [Continental] had, only recently, made payment to Mr. Jacques for his portion of the transcript but had not received a copy of the transcript. By the dates of these two hearings, [Continental] had not yet made payment to Mr. Lynch for his portion of the transcript. Consequently this court concludes that the defendants had not fully cured their noncompliance as of the last hearing date, September 9, 2005.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">One can surely understand the judge\u2019s frustration at the pace with which transcript preparation meandered toward an apparently indeterminate destination. She was correct in stating that \u201cthe principal function of Rule 9(c)(2) is to put the responsibility for expediting the appeal squarely on the appellant,\u201d quoting from <em>Mailer </em>v. <em>Mailer, </em>387 Mass. 401, 407 (1982). Moreover, she correctly noted that the requirement to arrange payment found in rule 8(b)(1) is designed to ensure that an appellant\u2019s order of a transcript is not an empty gesture designed simply for delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">At the same time, an appellant cannot make \u201csatisfactory arrangements\u201d for payment without knowledge of what payment is required. In this case, both reporters failed to respond to repeated requests for information about the required deposit for more than two years. When they finally did respond, counsel for Continental made the requisite payments immediately. On this record, therefore, we think the judge\u2019s conclusion that Continental violated Mass.R.A.P. 8(b)(1) was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">We also think that the judge\u2019s rulings with respect to Mass. R.A.P. 9(c) and with respect to the curative provisions of Mass. R.A.P. 10(c) were erroneous. With respect to the former, a violation of rule 8(b)(1) is not automatically a violation of Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>R.A.P. 9(c), as amended, 437 Mass. 1602 (2002). Rule 9(c) has only two components. Rule 9(c)(1) requires that the appellant perform, upon request by the clerk, acts \u201creasonably necessary to enable the clerk to assemble the record.\u201d See <em>Maurice Callahan &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Outdoor Advertising Bd., </em>376 Mass. 135, 136 (1978); <em>Spivey </em>v. <em>Neitlich, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 742, 745-746 (2003). Nothing in the record suggests that any clerk made any requests of anyone in this case. Rule 9(c)(2) requires an appellant who desires a transcript to deliver to the clerk either the transcript itself or a signed statement certifying that a transcript has been ordered from the reporter. As noted earlier, Continental filed the requisite certificate in timely fashion.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Finally, insofar as rule 10(c) is concerned, the quoted passage from the judge\u2019s memorandum suggests that she thought Continental could only invoke the rule\u2019s \u201ccurative\u201d provisions if it actually filed a transcript before the hearing on Francine\u2019s motion to dismiss. However, the \u201ccure\u201d of which rule 10(c) speaks is a cure of noncompliance with rule 9(c), and as just stated, compliance with rule 9(c) is achieved by doing what a clerk asks, by filing a transcript, <em>or </em>by filing a certificate that a transcript has been ordered. See <em>Russell </em>v. <em>McOwen-Hanelt, </em>413 Mass. 106, 110 (1992), cert, denied, 506 U.S. 1051 (1993). As Continental had already completed the last of those three tasks, there was nothing to cure.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">In the last analysis, although the burden is on the appellant to take all steps reasonably necessary to keep the appeal on track, the appellant cannot force a court reporter to do what the reporter is unable or unwilling to do. Indeed, this case shows that even after entry of a court order requiring Jacques and Lynch to produce the transcripts in ninety days, Lynch\u2019s transcript did not materialize for eight months and Jacques took nearly fifteen months to prepare his. See note 7, <em>supra. </em>Remedies for those kinds of systemic delays ultimately must come from the court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>for they lie beyond any remedial powers the parties possess.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> On this record, the appeal should not have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">d. <em>The first judgment. </em>Finally, then, we arrive at the merits, where three principal issues are tendered for resolution: (i) whether the judge properly reduced Continental\u2019s judgment from $7,500 plus interest to one dollar plus interest; (ii) whether the judge properly found that Continental had committed unfair and deceptive debt collection practices; and (iii) whether the judge properly calculated attorney\u2019s fees. We think the answers to the first two of those questions are yes, and the answer to the third is no.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">\u2022 i. <em>Reduction of the judgment. </em>The judge initially awarded Continental $7,500 plus interest on its counterclaim. The award was based on a bankruptcy document in which Ross stated that Docunet owed Continental $7,500. Continental sought reconsideration of that award on grounds that the bankruptcy document, which Continental had not offered in evidence, was unreliable. Then followed some wrangling among the parties as to how accurate the bankruptcy document was and why. The wrangling led to the judge\u2019s review of the document and the setting in which it was filed. After that review, the judge stated that she was \u201cno longer satisfied that the $7,500.00 amount [she] initially credited ha[d] any credible factual basis.\u201d At the time she reached that conclusion, no final judgment had entered and she was entitled to reconsider both the order she had entered and the weight she had given the bankruptcy document in fashioning that order. \u201cThough there is no duty to reconsider a case, an issue, or a question of fact or law, once decided, the power to do so remains in the court until final judgment.\u201d <em>King </em>v. <em>Globe Newspaper Co., </em>400 Mass. 705, 707 (1987), cert, denied, 485 U.S. 940 and 485 U.S. 962 (1988), quoting from <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Hopson, </em>306 Mass. 597, 601 (1940). We discern no error in her revision.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">ii. <em>Unfair and deceptive acts. </em>As noted, the essence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>judge\u2019s findings regarding unfair and deceptive acts violative of G. L. c. 93A was that Continental, knowing that it could not prove the amount Stanley owed on his guarantee, commenced foreclosure proceedings \u201cintentionally and solely to scare [Stanley] into paying money [and thereby] sought to profit through intimidation.\u201d Continental argues that the finding of a c. 93A violation was unwarranted because, although Continental\u2019s underlying business records showing the source of Stanley\u2019s debt had been destroyed, summary records showed the amount Stanley owed, and the judge disbelieved Stanley\u2019s testimony that he had paid it all.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">Continental\u2019s view of the judge\u2019s findings unduly favors its own view of the case. The essence of the judge\u2019s findings is that Continental pushed forward a claim it had once written off, knowing, but concealing, that it could not prove to a reasonable certainty any amount Stanley owed, and thus was likely to recover only nominal damages, see <em>Spring </em>v. <em>Geriatric Authy. of Holyoke, </em>394 Mass. 274, 290-291 (1985); <em>Our Lady of the Sea Corp. </em>v. <em>Borges, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 484, 489 (1996); Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 236 comment a, 346(2) (1981), because Continental had destroyed material records documenting what it claimed Docunet owed. While concealing its destruction of the records, Continental continued to push its claim in the hope that it might collect more than it could prove because it knew Stanley had cancer and that, as a consequence, the Rosses were trying to sell their home. Conduct like that \u201chas an extortionate quality [with a] rancid flavor of unfairness,\u201d <em>Atkinson </em>v. <em>Rosenthal, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 219, 226 (1992), and warranted the judge\u2019s conclusion that the conduct violated G. L. c. 93A.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">iii. <em>Attorney\u2019s fees. </em>General Laws c. 93A entitles the prevailing party to recover his or her attorney\u2019s fees. Those fees are to be determined by the so-called \u201clodestar\u201d method, which focuses initially on fair market rate for the time reasonably spent in prosecuting the case. <em>Killeen </em>v. <em>Westban Hotel Venture, LP, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 784, 790 (2007). In calculating the lodestar, no amount should be awarded for the time spent on unsuccessful claims unless that time was so inextricably intertwined with the time spent on successful claims that the two cannot be separated. <em>Id. </em>at 792.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>In this case, counsel for Francine sought a total of $63,674.75 in fees and $4,795.52 in costs, an amount covering the time he had spent \u201cin defending the Plaintiffs in this lawsuit and pursuing the case against the Defendants.\u201d In other words, the fees he sought covered his entire effort in the case. Counsel accompanied his fee request with a three-page affidavit and twenty-seven pages of bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The judge awarded fees in the amount of $57,696.31, ninety percent of what counsel had requested, and did not award costs. She did not make any findings indicating how and why she made the award. She also dismissed on the merits seven of the eight counts of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, labeling one of them, a claim for fraudulent inducement, as \u201crather preposterous.\u201d The judge also repeatedly stated that she disbelieved testimony Stanley gave on the witness stand about his payments to Continental and rejected Stanley\u2019s claim that the amounts he owed Continental were capped by the liquidated damages provision of the settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">The amount of a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee is a fact that should be supported by some statement of reasons illuminating the judge\u2019s fact-finding process. Particularly is that so when the judge manifestly rejected much of the case the plaintiffs had brought. Without a statement of reasons, neither the parties nor a reviewing court has any basis for determining whether the judge put to one side the claims on which the plaintiffs failed or declined to do so on the ground that the tight nexus between the successful and the unsuccessful claims made separation of fees impossible. In addition, where a judge disbelieves substantial portions of a prevailing party\u2019s case, the judge must consider whether the rejected portions of the case increased the over-all fees the prevailing party incurred, and, if it did, should remove the increased portion from the ultimate fee award.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The third judgment, entered on November 3, 2006, is vacated. The order of September 29, 2005, dismissing Continental\u2019s appeal is vacated. The attorney\u2019s fee awarded in the second judgment, entered on September 28, 2006, is vacated, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for reconsideration of attorney\u2019s fees in accordance with the principles contained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>in parts 2.b and 2.d.iii of this opinion. In all other respects, the second judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b535-9\">At most, a foreclosure would have given Continental a right to Stanley\u2019s interest in property that was wholly defeasible if, as actually happened here, Francine outlived Stanley. See <em>Coraccio </em>v. <em>Lowell Five Cents Sav. Bank, </em>415 Mass. 145, 151-152 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b536-9\">By that time, the first mortgage was held by Francine\u2019s brother and presumably was no obstacle to a sale.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b538-6\">throughout the proceedings, the judge, urgently prodded by Francine\u2019s counsel, appears to have attached unduly sinister motivations to the manner in which Continental\u2019s attorney used the bankruptcy creditor list. Continental\u2019s counsel never introduced that list in evidence and, instead, consistently used it to impeach Stanley\u2019s testimony that Docunet had paid Continental everything it owed. In keeping with that approach, the two requested findings on which the judge focused appeared in a section of Continental\u2019s request entitled \u201c[Stanley\u2019s] claims for credits.\u201d The first request in that section said, \u201c54. There is no credible evidence to support [Stanley\u2019s] claim that Docunet paid Continental for all invoices outstanding in 1989.\u201d The two requests on which the judge focused, part of a series of requests supporting request 54, said simply:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-7\">\u201c57. At the time that Docunet filed for bankruptcy in February 1991, it listed Continental as one of its twenty largest creditors, having a claim of $7,500.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-8\">\u201c58. There was no evidence of any distributions being made to Continental as a result of Docunet\u2019s bankruptcy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">Nothing in the record suggests that the factual statements in those requests were untrue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b539-7\">The hearings that preceded entry of the September 20, 2005, orders took place on August 17, 2005; September 6, 2005; and September 9, 2005. After entry of the orders, Continental promptly ordered transcripts of those three hearings, and those transcripts were filed on May 15, 2006.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b539-8\">In all, seven volumes of trial transcript were at issue. Four volumes were filed on January 24, 2007, and the remaining three were filed seriatim on February 1, 20, and 28, 2007. When the transcripts were filed, the parties were haggling over the extent to which they were properly a part of the record on appeal from the order dismissing Continental\u2019s appeal, Francine arguing that they were not and Continental arguing that they were because Francine maintained, among other things, that Continental\u2019s dismissed appeal was frivolous and, thus, that even an erroneous dismissal of that appeal caused no harm. The transcripts finally were docketed on May 2, 2007, after an order from a single justice of this court permitted their provisional inclusion as a part of the record of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b540-7\">The hearings were held on September 21 and 22, 2006.

Continental ordered a transcript of the hearing, which was filed on October 27, 2006.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b543-6\">No decided Massachusetts case discusses in any detail the circumstances in which entry of an amended judgment adding attorney\u2019s fees creates new deadlines for motions and appeals that focus on the underlying relief the amended judgment incorporates. The lively debate that once existed on that subject in Federal circles, see, e.g., <em>Crossman </em>v. <em>Maccoccio, </em>792 F.2d 1, 4-7 (1st Cir. 1986), seems to have been resolved in <em>Budinich </em>v. <em>Becton Dickinson &amp; Co., </em>486 U.S. 196, 202-203 (1988), where the United States Supreme Court said that \u201c[cjourts and litigants are best served by the bright-line rule, which accords with traditional understanding, that a decision on the merits is a \u2018final decision\u2019 for purposes of [appealability] whether or not there remains for adjudication a request for attorney\u2019s fees attributable to the case.\u201d Our resolution of the issue arising out the of third judgment in this case makes it unnecessary to determine whether the <em>Budinich </em>approach should be followed in Massachusetts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b543-7\">See the discussion in part 2.b, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b543-8\">The third judgment is also an order awarding the same $4,510 in attorney\u2019s fees as a sanction under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F. The propriety of that award is pending before the single justice and has been stayed pending a decision in this appeal. While our decision here may foreshadow the result there, we have no power now to vacate the \u00a7 6F award.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Again, the second judgment was both a judgment and an order awarding sanctions under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F. Continental\u2019s appeal from the latter is pending before the single justice and has been stayed pending a decision in this appeal. Our ruling on the \u201cbaseless\u201d issue may foreshadow the single justice\u2019s ruling on that appeal, but in the event that it does not, we note that the amount of the fee award has absolutely no relation to the effort Francine\u2019s attorney expended in resisting Continental\u2019s motion. Instead, the award provides reimbursement for the cost of virtually every action her attorney took between entry of the first judgment and entry of the second. If there are to be any sanctions under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, those sanctions should bear a reasonable relationship to the harm caused by the sanctioned conduct. See note 9, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b547-8\">Francine\u2019s letter is actually dated May 23, 2005, but the judge used the June 3, 2005, date in her memorandum and order dated September 20, 2005, dismissing the appeal. Nothing turns on this discrepancy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b547-9\">After the September 9, 2005, hearing, counsel apparently received from Lynch the requisite information and, under letter dated September 12, 2005, provided Lynch with a requested deposit of $100 so Lynch could begin preparation of his portion of the transcript.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b549-7\">The judge ruled that the certificate was defective because counsel\u2019s letters to the reporters said that he would like to \u201cmake arrangements to order\u201d a transcript, not that he \u201cwas\u201d ordering a transcript.

After a period of exploration, the committee issued a report and a series of recommendations, many of which are now in various stages of implementation.

App. Ct. 692, 698 (1986) (Brown, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). This is another example in which a marginal claim of $15,000 spawned more than a decade of litigation \u2014 at times, both sides could see or should have perceived the futility of further efforts \u2014 and mushroomed into an award of over $100,000 in damages (an apparently problematical amount at this stage) and attorney\u2019s fees. In brief, the teaching point here is that a litigant in pursuit of $15,000 may well end up paying out over $100,000.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <em>Cruz Mgmt.
