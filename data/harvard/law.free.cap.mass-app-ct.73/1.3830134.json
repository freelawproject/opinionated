Bone, an employee of J.P. Noonan Transportation, Inc. (Noonan), who was injured while loading oil at an oil terminal operated by Global Companies, LLC (Global). Although vehicles were loaded from the top, which was ten feet from the ground, the terminal did not have a protective guardrail for the passenger\u2019s side of a vehicle being loaded, and there was evidence that Global\u2019s equipment was defective. Noonan had agreed to indemnify Global against claims made on account of injuries such as those incurred by Bone. A judge of the Superior Court, in a declaratory judgment action brought by Noonan\u2019s commercial automobile insurer, American Home Assurance Company (American), declared, on cross motions for summary judgment, that American, rather than Noonan\u2019s general liability insurer, First Specialty Insurance Corporation (First Specialty), \u201cwas obligated to defend and indemnify Global in the underlying lawsuit.\u201d This is an appeal by American from the allowance of First Specialty\u2019s motion for summary judgment and the denial of its own. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-10\">1. <em>Facts. </em>The relevant facts are not in dispute. Noonan, a company operating trucks transporting oil, entered into a contract with Global, the operator of an oil loading terminal, granting Noonan \u201cthe right and privilege\u201d to use Global\u2019s facilities \u201cfor the purpose [of] receiving petroleum products into [Noonan\u2019s] trucks.\u201d The contract included an indemnification provision whereby Noonan agreed to indemnify and hold Global harmless from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>all claims \u201carising out of or in any way connected with the exercise\u201d by Noonan or its representatives of the privileges granted under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">On September 6, 2002, Bone, one of Noonan\u2019s oil delivery drivers, while loading oil into Noonan\u2019s trailer, fell from the top of the trailer, sustaining serious injuries. Bone had little memory of what happened, but there was evidence from others that Bone had difficulty with one of the pipes and slipped and fell backward to the ground on the passenger\u2019s side of the trailer. Other drivers also had difficulties with the pipes. The top of the trailer was approximately ten feet from the ground and had a two-and-one-half-foot wide walking surface. The terminal had a guardrail for the driver\u2019s side of the trailer, but not for the passenger\u2019s side. After Bone\u2019s fall, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration investigated Global\u2019s terminal and cited Global for a \u201cserious violation\u201d for not adequately protecting employees from fall injuries while \u201ctoploading\u201d oil tank trailers.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">Recognizing that Bone would file an action against Global, Steadfast Insurance Company, Global\u2019s general liability insurer, sent a demand letter to Noonan demanding that it have the appropriate insurer handle the Bone lawsuit on Global\u2019s behalf. Soon thereafter, Bone (joined by his wife, seeking compensation for loss of consortium) brought an action against Global<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> alleging negligence, inter alia, in failing to provide adequate fall protection and in having a filler pipe that was not working properly. Global filed a third-party complaint against Noonan for contractual indemnity and also asserted violation of G. L. c. 93A. In a letter dated February 28, 2005, American agreed to assume the defense and indemnity of Global, subject to a full reservation of rights. Soon thereafter, American brought this declaratory judgment action seeking a declaration that First Specialty and not American was obligated to defend and indemnify Global. In April, 2006, American agreed to pay its policy limit ($1 million) toward the settlement of the underlying liability claim, subject to its reservation of rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>2. <em>Policy provisions. </em>American\u2019s policy provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-5\">\u201cWe will pay all sums an \u2018insured\u2019 legally must pay as damages because of \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 to which this insurance applies, caused by an \u2018accident\u2019 and resulting from the ownership, maintenance or use of a covered \u2018auto.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">American does not dispute that the vehicle involved was a covered automobile, and although the policy does not expressly refer to loading or unloading except in a tangential way in an exclusion relating to handling of property, American does not dispute that the term \u201cuse\u201d includes loading and unloading. See <em>Metropolitan Property &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Santos, 55 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 789, 796-797 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">The First Specialty policy provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-8\">\u201cWe will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay, as damages because of \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 to which this insurance applies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">The First Specialty policy also contained the following exclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-10\">\u201cAircraft, Auto or Watercraft</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-11\">\u201c \u2018Bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 arising out of the ownership, maintenance, use or entrustment to others of any aircraft, \u2018auto\u2019 or watercraft owned or operated by or rented or loaned to any insured. Use includes operation and \u2018loading or unloading.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-12\">Both policies had an exclusion for liability assumed by contract, except for an \u201cinsured contract.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Both insurers agree that the indemnification agreement constitutes an \u201cinsured contract\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>under each of their respective policies and that the indemnification agreement obligates Noonan to pay Global\u2019s litigation expenses and its share of any settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">3. <em>Discussion. </em>American claims that the cause of the accident was Global\u2019s negligence in failing to have a protective guardrail and a properly working pipe. There is therefore, in its view, not the requisite causal connection between Bone\u2019s injury and the loading of the vehicle sufficient to hold American responsible; the accident was not \u201cresulting from\u201d the \u201cuse\u201d of a covered automobile. See <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Agrippino, </em>375 Mass. 108, 114 (1978); <em>Ruggerio Ambulance Serv., Inc. </em>v. <em>National Grange Mut. Ins. Co., </em>430 Mass. 794, 798 (2000). These cases cited by American do not support its narrow view of causality.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Our cases indicate that the expression \u201carising out of,\u201d both in coverage and exclusionary clauses,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-6\">\u201cmust be read expansively, incorporating a greater range of causation than that encompassed by proximate cause under tort law. Indeed, cases interpreting the phrase . . . suggest a causation more analogous to \u2018but for\u2019 causation, in which the court examining the exclusion inquires whether there would have been personal injuries, and a basis for the plaintiff\u2019s suit, in the absence of the objectionable underlying conduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-7\"><em>Bagley </em>v. <em>Monticello Ins. Co., </em>430 Mass. 454, 457 (1999), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">The statement in <em>Ruggerio, supra </em>at 797, that \u201cthe expression [\u2018arising out of\u2019] does not refer to all circumstances in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>the injury would not have occurred \u2018but for\u2019 the involvement of a motor vehicle,\u201d does not weaken the broad standard of <em>Bagley, </em>and that standard has been quoted by the Supreme Judicial Court with approval. See <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>First Financial Ins. Co., </em>448 Mass. 1, 6-7 (2006). Put another way, what is required for injuries to \u201carise out of\u201d the loading of a vehicle is a reasonably apparent causal connection between the loading of the vehicle and the injury. See <em>Ruggerio, supra </em>at 798; <em>Metropolitan Property &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Santos, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. at 795.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">That other causes for an injury also may exist does not preclude a determination that the injury arises out of activities excluded from coverage under the policy. Thus in <em>Monticello Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Dion, </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 46, 48-49 (2005), in holding that the death arose out of operations performed for the insured, a determination that precluded coverage because of an exclusion in the policy, we considered it irrelevant that the death could be said to have been proximately caused by the insured\u2019s negligence. Accord <em>Commerce Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Theodore, </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 471, 472-473 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">\u201cThe responsibility of construing the language of an insurance contract is a question of law for the trial judge, and then for the reviewing court.\u201d <em>Ruggerio, supra </em>at 797, quoting from <em>Cody </em>v. <em>Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co., </em>387 Mass. 142, 146 (1982). A judgment call then must be made as to where the facts of the case fall along a continuum of causation. <em>Ibid., </em>citing <em>Carrigan </em>v. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto Ins., </em>140 Or. App. 359, 366 (1996), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 326 Or. 97 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Bone, while loading his tanker truck, was in the process of trying to make a loading pipe work properly when he fell. He thus was engaged in the very activity for which the tanker truck was present at Global\u2019s terminal. These facts provide a sufficient causal connection between the loading of the tanker truck and Bone\u2019s resulting injury. See <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Cos. Co., </em>410 Mass. 1002, 1003-1004 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">Although we find in our cases sufficient causal connection, based on a reading of the term \u201carising out of,\u201d to affirm the judgment, we note that cases elsewhere in similar circumstances also find coverage under automobile policies, rather than general liability policies. This is so despite a defect in the loading <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>equipment or negligence by employees other than those\" of the vehicle owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">Coverage by the automobile insurer is, however, usually found on a different basis.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That basis is connected to the rule of \u201ccomplete operation,\u201d a rule also applicable in Massachusetts. The term \u201cuse\u201d of vehicles been expanded to include loading and unloading in automobile insurance policies, but the rule of complete operation construes \u201cuse\u201d broadly to encompass \u201cnot only removing goods from the motor vehicle but [also] their delivery to the purchaser or consignee rather than the more restricted doctrine that the unloading has ended when the goods have come to rest.\u201d <em>August A. Busch &amp; Co. of Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>339 Mass. 239, 242 (1959). Where the automobile policy contains a provision that persons using the vehicle with the consent of the insured are covered as additional insured persons,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the complete operation rule has been invoked to hold that the negligence of persons or entities not connected to the automobile constitutes part of the complete operation of loading. Under that doctrine, if their acts are necessary to the loading process, such persons or entities are often held to be using the vehicle and are additional unnamed insureds under the policy. See, e.g., <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Jefferson Smurfit Co., </em>147 N.J. 394, 401, 403 (1997)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>; <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Employers\u2019 Liab. Assur. Corp., 361 </em>F.2d 205, 207 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>(4th Cir. 1966).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See also <em>Improved Mach. Inc. </em>v. <em>Merchants Mut. Ins. Co., </em>349 Mass. 461, 463 (1965) (forklift fell over while operator was loading machinery onto insured\u2019s truck, killing employee of insured; although no employee of insured had anything to do with loading the machine, forklift operator was held to be using truck and to be additional unnamed insured under insured\u2019s automobile policy).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">As indicated in note 8, <em>supra, </em>the New Jersey court, as do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>many other courts, distinguishes between the cases where there is negligence in an essential part of the loading and unloading operation and those cases where the negligence is not so related and there is a dangerous condition on the premises. The cases relied on by American fall in the latter category. In contrast, in the present case, at least one of the claims of negligence \u2014 the defective pipe \u2014 was certainly essential to the loading process.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">We have not analyzed the clauses of American\u2019s policy or the statutory requirements to ascertain whether Global could be considered an additional insured and do not rest our decision on that ground, but merely note that holding the automobile insurer responsible in this case is consistent with cases elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b39-7\">The action also was brought against Chelsea Sandwich, LLC, the owner of the premises. As the claims involving Chelsea are not pertinent to this appeal, we omit any description of pleadings and other matters that refer to any claims brought by or against Chelsea.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b40-13\">We agree with the judge that there is no meaningful distinction between the words \u201cresulting from\u201d in American\u2019s coverage provision and the words \u201carising out of\u201d in First Specialty\u2019s exclusion provision. As observed by the judge, the two policies were intended to \u201cfit together like two pieces of a jigsaw puzzle,\u201d one covering injuries arising from the use of an automobile, while the other excluding such coverage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b40-14\">Under First Specialty\u2019s policy, \u201cInsured contract means: . . . That part of any other contract or agreement pertaining to your business . . . under which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>you assume the tort liability of another party to pay for \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 to a third person or organization. Tort liability means a liability that would be imposed by law in the absence of any contract or agreement.\u201d There were certain exclusions not here relevant. American\u2019s definition of an \u201cinsured contract\u201d was similar, and any differences are immaterial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b41-10\">In <em>Ruggerio, supra </em>at 797-798, the court held that the delay of an ambulance because of a traffic accident was too attenuated from the decedent\u2019s death for coverage under Ruggerio\u2019s automobile policy. The decedent was not present at the accident and did not receive injuries from it. <em>Ibid. </em>In <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., supra </em>at 114-115, there was no causal relationship between the death of a lifeguard and the insured\u2019s use of a boat trailer, when the insured only had supplied a pulley and shackles to pull a boat. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Although the parties have not urged this different basis, a discussion of those cases sheds light on why the cases from other jurisdictions American has urged us to follow are not here applicable. The cases also indicate that our conclusion that there is coverage under the automobile policy is consistent with authorities elsewhere. See, e.g., 6B Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice \u00a7 4322, at 396-397 (rev. ed. 1979) (\u201c[I]f the unloading process was going on at the very time the accident occurred, the courts are prone to allow recovery\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b43-6\">Such clauses often are referred to as \u201comnibus\" clauses. See 8 Couch, Insurance \u00a7 111:1 (3d ed. 2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b43-7\">In <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Jefferson Smurfit Co., supra </em>at 401, the Supreme Court of New Jersey held that the insurer of the owner\u2019s vehicle was liable for injuries sustained by the owner while his vehicle was being unloaded due to the negligence of the shipper who had selected defective pallets for the loading process. The court determined that the selection of the pallets fell within the complete operation of the loading because the act that resulted in injury was necessary to carry out the loading. The shipper was made an additional insured under the vehicle owner\u2019s policy. The court distinguished between cases where there is negligence in the actual loading and unloading operation and cases where the negligence is not directly related to the loading and unloading process such as where there is a dangerous condition on the premises of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>warehouse. In its discussion, the court, <em>id. </em>at 402-403, distinguished one of the main cases relied on by American, <em>Atlantic Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>100 N.J. Super. 180, 183 (1968), affd, 105 N.J. Super. 48 (1969), a case in which the premises owner, prior to the arrival of a truck, failed to remove dunnage near an open stairwell and also failed to provide the stairwell with a guardrail.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b44-7\">In <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Employers\u2019 Liab. Assur. Corp., supra </em>at 206, an employee was on top of a tanker truck loading oil at a distributor\u2019s facility when he pulled a defective wire cord necessary to carry out the loading process. The wire snapped, and the employee fell backward, sustaining severe injuries. <em>Ibid. </em>Construing Maryland law, the court held the truck owner\u2019s automobile insurer liable and that the distributor was an additional insured. <em>Id. </em>at 207.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b44-8\">Some additional cases holding the automobile insurer responsible and treating the negligent party as a participant in the loading process and an additional insured are, e.g., <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins.

Co., </em>411 F.2d 265, 269-270 (5th Cir. 1969) (applying Florida law; premises employee\u2019s negligence in loading truck with ice caused injury to truck driver); <em>Bituminous Cas.
