A Superior Court jury returned guilty verdicts on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the judge erroneously instructed the jury that to prove that the defendant \u201cadministered\u201d drugs pursuant to G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 3, the Commonwealth only had to prove that the defendant \u201cprovided\u201d drugs and alcohol which the complainant voluntarily consumed. He further claims that the evidence was insufficient to prove that the defendant drugged the complainant with the intent to have sexual intercourse with her. The defendant also argues that the rape and indecent assault and battery convictions must be reversed because there was insufficient evidence to prove that the complainant did not consent to sexual relations with the defendant. Finally, the defendant contends that the distribution of cocaine and school zone convictions must be reversed because the defendant may have been convicted of an offense for which he was not indicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\"><em>Background. </em>It was the Commonwealth\u2019s theory at trial that the complainant was so intoxicated and under the influence of cocaine, that she was incapable of consenting to sexual intercourse.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">The Commonwealth introduced the following evidence in support of that theory. On February 1, 2004, the complainant was eighteen years old and a senior at a local high school. The defendant, a lawyer, was approximately fifty years old and engaged in the practice of law out of his home in Gardner. The complainant and the defendant had been acquainted through friends and family for six years. The two saw each other approximately five times in late 2003, often at the complainant\u2019s aunt\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">In the months prior to the assault in February of 2004, the complainant had been drinking alcohol frequently and had used cocaine five or six times. She obtained the cocaine from friends, her aunt, a cousin, and the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">In December of 2003, the complainant attended the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>Christmas party with her aunt. At the party, the complainant, the defendant, and several others went upstairs to the defendant\u2019s bedroom to use cocaine provided by the defendant. In the bedroom, the defendant tried to put his arm around the complainant, but she pulled away. The defendant had previously made the complainant aware that he was attracted to her and wanted to date her, but the complainant told him that she had a boyfriend. Shortly after the Christmas party, while at the complainant\u2019s aunt\u2019s house, the defendant joked to the complainant and her aunt that he should pull down his pants so the complainant could give him oral sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">On Sunday, February 1, 2004, the complainant and her boyfriend attended a \u201cSuper Bowl\u201d party at her father\u2019s house where she consumed two beers. Before the party ended, the complainant left and dropped her boyfriend off at their shared apartment. She then went to her aunt\u2019s house where there was a small gathering of people, including the defendant. At her aunt\u2019s house, the complainant consumed two \u201cstrong\u201d alcoholic drinks. At some point, the defendant offered cocaine to the complainant, and the two used it together. The defendant again expressed his interest in going on a date with the complainant, but she again declined. Later that evening, the defendant, the complainant, and others ingested more of the defendant\u2019s cocaine. The defendant invited the complainant to his house for a party, but she declined.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">After the aunt\u2019s party ended, the complainant drove herself home at approximately 11:30 p.m., but after finding her boyfriend asleep, she drove around for over one hour. At 1 a.m. on February 2, the complainant arrived at the defendant\u2019s home and went up to the defendant\u2019s bedroom, where she drank several more alcoholic drinks, ingested more cocaine, and smoked marijuana, all offered to the complainant by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">At 6 a.m. on February 2, the complainant left the defendant\u2019s home and returned to her apartment to get ready to go to school for an appointment with her guidance counselor. The complainant\u2019s boyfriend drove her to school, but because the complainant did not want her guidance counselor to know that she had been drinking, she broke the appointment and went back to the defendant\u2019s home. Once there, the complainant resumed drink<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>ing and also ingested more cocaine. The complainant left the house to return to school for two periods in the early afternoon; the defendant picked her up later, and the two returned to his house. Once there, the defendant continued to make advances toward the complainant, which she rebuffed. Sometime later that day, the defendant left the house to buy wine and groceries, then returned to make dinner. Although the complainant did not eat much of her dinner, she consumed several glasses of wine. The two then returned to the bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">At some point, the complainant realized that she was on the defendant\u2019s bed and that her clothes had \u201cc[o]me off.\u201d The defendant kissed the complainant; when the complainant pulled away he told her, \u201cNo. Go do more coke.\u201d The complainant ingested another line of cocaine and returned to the bed where she put her clothes back on, but they kept \u201ccoming off.\u201d The defendant kissed her breasts and vagina and penetrated her vagina with his finger. The complainant kept telling him, \u201cNo. We\u2019re just friends.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">At approximately 9 a.m. on February 3, three of the complainant\u2019s female friends knocked on the door to the defendant\u2019s bedroom. When the complainant did not answer, one of the friends pushed the door open, and the defendant told them to get out of the house because they were trespassing. He said that the complainant was an adult and could do as she pleased. The complainant\u2019s friends observed that the complainant was trying to put on her shirt and doing \u201cweird things\u201d with her mouth. The complainant appeared disheveled, and her pupils were enlarged. The women helped the complainant dress, walked her downstairs, and drove her to her father\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">The complainant\u2019s father was not home when the girls arrived. However, when he returned he saw the complainant and testified that she appeared to be \u201czombie\u201d like, \u201cbobbing and weaving,\u201d and unable to speak. The complainant\u2019s father brought the complainant to the police station where she was interviewed by a police officer. The officer described the complainant as \u201cintoxicated,\u201d \u201ccrying,\u201d \u201cvery upset,\u201d and \u201ctired.\u201d The officer also testified that he asked the complainant \u201cif [the defendant] forced her to do something that she didn\u2019t want to do.\u201d The complainant answered, \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Drugging for sexual intercourse. </em>The defendant challenges the judge\u2019s charge to the jury on the drugging for sexual intercourse charge. The defendant contends that the judge erroneously instructed the jury that, to prove that the defendant \u201cadministered\u201d drugs to the complainant, the Commonwealth only had to prove that the defendant \u201cprovided\u201d drugs or alcohol which the complainant voluntarily consumed. The defendant objected to the jury instruction; therefore, we assess whether there was error in the charge, and if so, whether the error was prejudicial to the defendant. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>445 Mass. 589, 591 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">\u201cWe view the charge to the jury in its entirety \u2018since the adequacy of instructions must be determined in light of their over-all impact on the jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferreira, </em>417 Mass. 592, 595 (1994), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sellon, </em>380 Mass. 220, 231-232 (1980). The judge began his instructions by reading in large part the statutory language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-6\">\u201cWhoever applies, administers to or causes to be taken by a person any drug, matter or thing with the intent to stupefy or overpower such person so as to thereby enable \u2014 so as to thereby enable any person to have sexual intercourse or unnatural sexual intercourse with such person shall be punished.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">See G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 3, as amended through St. 1998, c. 232, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">The judge continued, stating the first element of the offense \u201cadministers or causes to be taken\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-9\">\u201crequires the Commonwealth to prove that the defendant gave or provided a drug or substance to [the complainant] either directly or by offering it to her and requesting her to take it. It is not necessary for the Commonwealth to prove that the defendant directly put the drug or substance into her by injection, nor into her food or drink. Also, it\u2019s not necessary for the Commonwealth to prove that the defendant forced her to consume it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 3, does not define the word \u201cadministers\u201d and it does not appear to have been defined in any Mas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>sachusetts appellate court decisions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Where there is no definition in the statute, we interpret terms according to their \u201cusual and accepted meanings .... We derive the words\u2019 usual and accepted meanings from sources presumably known to the statute\u2019s enactors, such as their use in other legal contexts and dictionary definitions.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>444 Mass. 102, 105 (2005), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zone Book, Inc., </em>372 Mass. 366, 369 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">The relevant dictionary definition for \u201cadminister\u201d is \u201cto direct or superintend the execution, use or conduct of ... to mete out . . . dispense ... to give ritually ... to give remedially.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Inti. Dictionary 27 (2002).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">The judge\u2019s instruction to the jury was erroneous because the dictionary definition of \u201cadminister\u201d does not include the word \u201cprovide,\u201d and \u201cprovide\u201d is not the usual or common meaning of the word \u201cadminister.\u201d In regard to the latter point, we agree with defense counsel\u2019s language that he used in arguing to the judge to adopt the dictionary language, i.e., \u201cWe don\u2019t administer iced tea to one another; we give it. We don\u2019t administer food; we give it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">Further, if the Legislature had intended for G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 3, to include the providing, or delivery, of a drug to another, then the Legislature would have used the words \u201cprovide,\u201d \u201cgive,\u201d \u201cprocure,\u201d \u201cdeliver,\u201d or \u201cfurnish,\u201d words that the legislature chose to use in G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 34, a statute that prohibits the sale or delivery of alcohol to minors.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">Finally, the phrase \u201cadministered to\u201d is inserted in G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 3, between the words \u201capplies\u201d and \u201ccauses to be taken.\u201d Read in context, the words of the statute require some forceful action or deceit or trickery on the part of the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>that amount to more than merely supplying drugs or alcohol to a willing individual. Therefore, we hold that while the words of the statute encompass the conduct of a person who, for example, by trickery slips a \u201cMickey Finn\u201d or \u201cdate rape pill\u201d into a drink, the words \u201cadminister to\u201d do not extend to a defendant who merely shares drugs or alcohol with a person who knowingly and voluntarily accepts the drugs or alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Here, the complainant testified that at no time did the defendant force her to take cocaine or force her to drink. In fact, she testified that she voluntarily shared the defendant\u2019s cocaine and alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Thus, the judge committed error in his instructions to the jury that in order to prove that the defendant administered cocaine and alcohol to the complainant the Commonwealth merely had to establish that the defendant provided cocaine and alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">The error was prejudicial because the instruction was in regard to the central point of the drugging a person for sexual intercourse statute. It misinterpreted the key words \u201cadministered to\u201d which are the basis of criminal liability under the statute. In these circumstances, we cannot say with confidence that the error was unlikely to have affected the jury\u2019s deliberations on whether the defendant violated G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 3.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">2. <em>Rape and indecent assault and battery. </em>The defendant also claims that his convictions for rape and indecent assault and battery must be reversed because the Commonwealth failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that, because of her consumption of drugs and alcohol, the complainant was incapable of consenting to sexual intercourse and sexual battery, a required element of both charges where there is no allegation of physical force. The burden of proof on lack of consent is the same for rape and indecent assault and battery. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simcock, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 184, 188 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>\u201cFirst, where drugs or alcohol are concerned, it is important to emphasize that . . . consumption or even intoxication by itself is not the issue. . . . The question instead is whether, as a result of the complainant\u2019s consumption of drugs, alcohol, or both, she was unable to give or refuse consent.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blache, </em>450 Mass. 583, 590 (2008). We summarize the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677-678 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Here, the Commonwealth presented evidence that earlier in the day the complainant consumed alcohol and ingested cocaine on numerous occasions. Hours before the incident, the complainant consumed three or four glasses of wine with little or no food. The complainant additionally ingested cocaine multiple times that evening, including immediately before the assault. She testified that while on the defendant\u2019s bed her clothes kept coming off, but she did not remember how they were removed. When her friends arrived in the defendant\u2019s bedroom that morning, they noticed that the complainant appeared disheveled and was \u201cdoing weird things with her mouth\u201d even though she was not speaking. Later that morning, the complainant\u2019s father observed that she appeared \u201czombie\u201d like, was unable to speak, and moved erratically. Based on the above evidence, a rational trier of fact could find beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant was so incapacitated by drugs and alcohol that she was unable to consent to sexual activity and intercourse.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">3. <em>Amendment to the school zone indictment. </em>The defendant was indicted for distribution of cocaine on February 1, 2004, in Gardner. He also was indicted for a narcotic violation in a school zone on February 2, 2004, in Gardner. In a response to a question from the jury, and over the defendant\u2019s objections, the judge allowed the indictment charging distribution of cocaine to be changed from February 1, 2004, to February 2, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>The defendant argues that the judge improperly amended the indictment when he changed the date of the offense from February 1, 2004, to February 2, 2004, and claims that both the distribution and school zone convictions should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">The grand jury heard evidence regarding the defendant\u2019s alleged distribution of cocaine at the complainant\u2019s aunt\u2019s home in Westminster on February 1. The grand jury also heard evidence regarding the defendant\u2019s distribution of cocaine on February 2 in Gardner. The grand jury also heard evidence relating to the school zone violation on February 2 in connection with the distribution of drugs in Gardner.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Under Mass.R.Crim.P. 4(d), 378 Mass. 849-850 (1979), \u201ca judge may allow amendment of the form of a[n] . . . indictment if such amendment would not prejudice the defendant or the Commonwealth.\u201d In order for an amendment to be proper, it must be a matter of form and not a matter of substance, and, if a matter of form, it must not result in prejudice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knight, </em>437 Mass. 487, 491 (2002). Further, art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights requires that \u201cno one may be convicted of a crime punishable by a term in the State prison without first being indicted for that crime by a grand jury.\u201d An amendment cannot change the work of the grand jury. <em>Id. </em>at 492, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barbosa, </em>421 Mass. 547, 549 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">First, we address whether the amendment of the indictment was a matter of form or matter of substance. \u201cThe time alleged for an offense is ordinarily treated as a matter of detail rather than substance.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Campiti, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 43, 50 (1996). In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knight, supra </em>at 491-494, the court ruled that the judge did not commit error when he amended a murder indictment by changing the date of the death of the victim, where the change did not involve an essential element of the crime, did not result in prejudice to the defendant, and did not materially change the work of the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">Here, the change was a matter of form. The defendant was not prejudiced. The defense acknowledged that the complainant was in the defendant\u2019s home on February 2 but disputed the complainant\u2019s credibility. Therefore, the change in the date did not prejudice the defendant in any respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>The amendment also did not materially change the work of the grand jury because that body heard sufficient evidence for a finding of probable cause that the defendant did distribute cocaine on February 2, in Gardner. Further, the grand jury heard evidence that only on February 2 in Gardner did the defendant distribute cocaine in a school zone, which indicates to us that the grand jury intended to indict the defendant for distribution of cocaine on February 2 in Gardner and not February 1. In sum, there was no error in the amendment of the distribution indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>We affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions of rape (two counts), indecent assault and battery, furnishing alcohol to a minor, distribution of cocaine, and distribution of cocaine in a school zone. We vacate the defendant\u2019s conviction of drugging a person for the purpose of sexual intercourse, and order judgment in favor of the defendant on that indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Because the defendant\u2019s sentence for dragging a person for the purpose of sexual intercourse was the lead sentence, with other sentences concurrent with that sentence, we remand the matter to the Superior Court for resentencing on the rape (two counts), indecent assault and battery, and furnishing alcohol to a minor convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b661-9\">The complainant testified that there was no physical force or threat associated with any of the sexual activity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b665-9\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Odell, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 100, 104 (1993), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tatro, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 918, 921 (1997), the defendants were convicted of violating G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 3, but in neither decision did the defendants argue that their actions did not constitute administering a drug. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Helfant, </em>398 Mass. 214, 218-220 (1985), there was no issue of administering a drug as the defendant admitted that he had injected Valium into the victim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b665-10\">The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 22 (Fourth Edition 2006) defines \u201cadminister\u201d similarly: \u201cTo have charge of; manage. ... To give or apply in a formal way .... To apply as a remedy .... To direct the taking of (an oath) .... To mete out; dispense . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b666-9\">In addition, the defendant filed a motion for a required finding of not guilty as to the drugging of a person for sexual intercourse indictment that was denied first at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case and also at the end of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">Because of our interpretation of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 3, we hold that the Commonwealth presented insufficient evidence to prove that the defendant administered or caused the victim to take drugs, and therefore, judgment must be entered in favor of the defendant on that indictment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b667-7\">The complainant admitted that she performed oral sex on the defendant at some time during the episode in the defendant\u2019s bedroom. The defendant argues, therefore, that the evidence was insufficient to warrant an instruction on incapacity to consent to sexual activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">The fact that she performed oral sex on the defendant does not negate the other evidence introduced by the Commonwealth that demonstrates the complainant\u2019s incapacity to consent to the acts that are the subjects of the indictment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
