The 2006 amendment permits the development of Lovejoy Wharf (which abuts the plaintiffs\u2019 property) and authorizes two buildings of a height which the plaintiffs claim will directly block the light, air, and visual benefits of their property; will reduce their access to the waterfront; and will create traffic problems, noise, and pollution on their property. In addition, the plaintiffs claim they were entitled to rely on the 1999 plan, which they urge entitles them to standing. A judge of the Superior Court held that the plaintiffs lack standing to challenge the Secretary\u2019s approval and allowed the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">In determining whether standing exists, we look to the considerations set forth in <em>Enos </em>v. <em>Secretary of Envtl. Affairs, </em>432 Mass. 132, 135-136 (2000): the language of the statute [or regulations]; its or their intent and purpose; \u201cthe nature of the administrative scheme; decisions on standing; any adverse effects that might occur, if standing is recognized; and the availability of other, more definite, remedies to the plaintiffs. In making [the] inquiry, . . . special attention [is to be given] to the requirement that standing usually is not present unless the governmental official or agency can be found to owe a duty directly to the plaintiffs.\u201d Applying these considerations, we conclude that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim of standing fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">Both the regulations governing approval of municipal harbor plans<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the State regulations governing trust lands<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> have as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>their objective the management of coastlines and waterways in the public interest, including an emphasis on water-dependent uses. See, e.g., \u00a7 23.05 of the municipal harbor plan regulations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>In addition, the municipal harbor plan regulations set forth that the Commonwealth and its municipalities are to act in partnership in carrying out the State policies governing stewardship of trust lands.* <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">In considering the plaintiffs\u2019 standing under the municipal harbor plan regulations, we look to our recent decision in <em>Higgins </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. Protection, </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. 754 (2005), where we analyzed the closely related tmst lands regulations. There, we held that the plaintiffs lacked standing despite their claims that they were abutters, that their office views of the tideland would be blocked by a hotel licensed by the defendant-department, and that the project would create severe traffic and parking problems, particularly to their property. We held that the regulations do not provide abutters with a special status or presumption for purposes of standing, and that the interests claimed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>are not protected under the trust lands regulations. <em>Id. </em>at 756-757. We also held that the administrative judge could reject the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that their more frequent travel in the area caused them injuries which differed in kind or magnitude from those of the general public. <em>Id. </em>at 758.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">To the extent that the plaintiffs in the present case make similar claims, namely the blocking of their private views, traffic and parking problems, and their special status as abutters, those claims fail for the same reasons as in <em>Higgins, supra. </em>The municipal harbor plan regulations do not provide greater protection for these interests than the trust lands regulations in <em>Higgins. </em>See notes 6 and 7, <em>supra. </em>We also conclude that the plaintiffs\u2019 other claims such as their diminished use of and access to the waterfront and their being subject to increased noise and pollution are not within the area of concern of the harbor plan regulations, \u201cor, stated another way,\u201d the regulations do not create \u201ca right in the particular plaintiff[s] to redress those injuries.\u201d <em>Enos </em>v. <em>Secretary of Envtl. Affairs, </em>432 Mass, at 139 n.6.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The purpose stated in the municipal harbor plan regulations, see note 7, <em>supra, </em>which also appears in the trust lands regulations,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> does not create in the plaintiffs a protected interest in clean air and water, nor does art. 49 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution, as amended by art. 97 of the Amendments, confer standing on the plaintiffs in this action to protect the aesthetic qualities of their environment. See <em>Enos, supra </em>at 142 &amp; n.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">Moreover, unlike \u00a7 9.02 of the trust lands regulations, which contains a definition of \u201caggrieved person\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and a provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>for an adjudicatory hearing for such persons, the municipal harbor plan regulations in \u00a7 23.04 provide only for a public hearing, public comments, and a reconsideration process. What was said in <em>Enos, supra, </em>with reference to the Massachusetts Environmental Protection Act (MEPA), is equally applicable to the provisions for approval of municipal harbor plans. As with MEPA, the harbor plan regulations</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-5\">\u201ccontemplate[] that persons such as the plaintiffs may play a role in the process, by submitting written comments or participating in . . . public or informational hearings .... An agency\u2019s . . . findings, presumably, will reflect public concerns and, hopefully, result in agency action that avoids or minimizes adverse . . . consequences. It is through this somewhat democratic process that full disclosure of the environmental impact of a project may be made, to ensure a thorough environmental review of a project during its early planning stages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-6\">\u201cWe discern nothing in the [regulations\u2019] language, purpose, or administrative scheme, however, to suggest a legislative intent that persons such as the plaintiffs should be able to seek judicial review of the Secretary\u2019s determination of what constitutes a proper [approval].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-7\"><em>Enos, </em>432 Mass, at 137-138.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">That the plaintiffs may not challenge the Secretary\u2019s approval does not mean that they may not have other avenues to challenge that approval. As pointed out in the Secretary\u2019s written decision, \u201c[T]he only content of [the 2006 amendment to the municipal harbor plan] that I determine to be binding are the proposed substitute provisions and associated offsetting benefits, as modified herein. Accordingly, all other plan content shall be regarded as background material for Mass. [Department of Environmental Protection] licensing purposes, and thus subject to change in the due course of further MEPA and [G. L.] c. 91 review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b812-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>Granting the plaintiffs standing in this case would also, we believe, have adverse effects contrary to the purposes of the administrative scheme of the municipal harbor plan regulations. In <em>Enos, supra </em>at 138, the court considered that the effect of granting standing based on the goal of environmental protection would allow suit with the attending delay in almost every project within the jurisdiction of MEPA \u201cbased on generalized claims by plaintiffs of injury such as loss of use and enjoyment of [their private] property.\u201d Similarly here, granting standing to the plaintiffs to assert claims of harm to their private property, compare <em>Higgins, </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. at 758 n.11, based on the goal of protecting clean air and aesthetic interests would subject almost all municipal harbor projects to litigation and confer rights beyond those of comment and public hearing envisioned by the harbor plan regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">The plaintiffs\u2019 additional claim that their reliance on the 1999 plan and certain representations of unknown employees of the Boston Redevelopment Authority permits them to challenge the Secretary\u2019s approval is without merit. The 1999 plan envisioned ongoing changes to Lovejoy Wharf although not the particular plan now approved. Moreover, estoppel generally does not apply to governmental entities. See <em>Weston Forest &amp; Trail Assn. </em>v. <em>Fishman, </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 654, 660 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">Because the Superior Court judge correctly found that the plaintiffs have no standing, the judgment of dismissal is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b807-9\">See 301 Code Mass.
