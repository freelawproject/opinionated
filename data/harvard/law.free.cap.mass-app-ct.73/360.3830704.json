Macero, Paul D. Macero, and Patrice L. Ambrosia, as trustees of the SPD Investment Trust (collectively, SPD), contend that a Superior Court judge, in SPD\u2019s certiorari appeal pursuant to G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4, erroneously upheld a decision of the board of health (board) of the town of Falmouth, which granted variances to Paul MacDonald, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>as trustee of the Cardan Realty Trust, and Thomas Soviero (collectively, Soviero) from the State and local sewage disposal regulations. Soviero proposed the construction of a new, enlarged septic system to serve an enlarged home on its oceanfront lot, which is adjacent to the dwelling and lot owned by SPD. The specific variances requested were from 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 15.213(2) (1995) of the State environmental code (Title 5) and \u00a7 15.2(1)(1.0) of the Falmouth health regulations (FHR), both of which prohibit the construction of a septic system in a coastal dune, a protected resource area.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">In a decision dated September 8, 2004, the board<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> *granted the variances, and SPD appealed to Superior Court. On motions for judgment on the pleadings,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and after hearing,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> a judge affirmed the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">1. <em>Facts. </em>The Soviero lot contains an existing single-family, two-story house; a deck; a patio; a driveway; a garage; and a septic system. In July, 2004, Soviero applied for the variances to permit the new, enlarged septic system in order to reconstruct the home on the property.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The SPD lot directly abuts the Soviero lot, both of which are in an environmentally sensitive area adjacent to Buzzard\u2019s Bay. The Soviero property is dominated by various wetland resource areas, including coastal dunes, land subject to coastal storm flowage, and the velocity zone of coastal storm waves, all of which are protected resources and subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>the Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act (G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 40), and the Falmouth wetlands by-laws. The new septic system would be located within a coastal dune.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">2. <em>The regulations, </em>a. <em>FHR protection of coastal dune. </em>Section 15.2(1)(1.0) of the FHR provides that no septic system leaching facility<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> shall be located in a coastal dune. Section 15.1(3) of the FHR states that the board may vary \u201cthe application of any provisions of this Regulation with respect to any particular case when, in its opinion, (1) the enforcement thereof would do manifest injustice; and (2) the applicant has proved that the same degree of health and environmental protection required under this title can be achieved without strict application of the particular provision.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">b. <em>Title 5 protection of coastal dune. </em>Title 5 prohibits the installation of a soil absorption system<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> in a coastal dune unless an applicant complies with seven specific siting criteria, see 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 15.213(2):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-7\">\u201cNo soil absorption system shall be constructed in a velocity zone on a coastal beach, barrier beach, or dune, or in a regulatory floodway, unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-8\">\u201c(a) the system is to serve a building or buildings that were in existence on March 31, 1995 or reconstruction of such building or buildings where allowed in accordance with the wetlands protection act and [its implementing regulations] 310 [Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7] 10.00;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-9\">\u201c(b) there is no increase in design flow from such building or buildings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>\u201c(c) no connection to a public sewer or shared system is available;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-5\">\u201c(d) the owner or applicant cannot site the system elsewhere;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-6\">\u201c(e) the septic tank or humus/composting toilet is sited outside of the velocity zone or regulatory flood-way, either horizontally or vertically;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-7\">\u201c(f) the system achieves required separation from high groundwater elevation required by 310 [Code Mass.

Regs. \u00a7 15.410 (1995), which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-10\">\u201c(1) . . .

Regs. \u00a7\u00a7] 15.000 from which a variance is sought.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-13\">\u201c(2) With regard to variances for new construction, enforcement of the provision from which a variance is sought must be shown to deprive the applicant of substantially all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>beneficial use of the subject property in order to be manifestly unjust.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">3. <em>Prior proceedings, </em>a. <em>The administrative record. </em>The administrative record indicates that Soviero\u2019s existing septic system was installed in approximately 1974 and consists of a 1,000-gallon tank and a 400-square-foot leaching field to service an existing four-bedroom home and that the existing leaching field is in the northeast corner of the lot, ten feet from the adjoining lot line and twenty feet from the foundation of the house. The board\u2019s minutes indicate that on July 26, 2004, the variance requests were on the board\u2019s agenda proposing, among other things, \u201cexisting house to be demolished and reconstructed.\u201d A professional<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> appeared for Soviero, identified the specific variance requests, and represented that the existing house has four bedrooms and the reconstructed house also would have four bedrooms, but that the \u201creconstruction\u201d would include \u201cthe placement of a 2,500 gallon septic tank and pump chamber with a pressure dosed leaching bed soil absorption system (SAS) for 4 bedrooms.\u201d Soviero\u2019s professional also represented that the square footage of the building would be increased by 400 square feet, but that no additional space would be used to create more than four bedrooms in total.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">An attorney for SPD spoke and identified its principal concern as the placement of the new septic system. Then SPD\u2019s professional spokesperson<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> emphasized that appropriate legal authority (the conservation commission) had not yet confirmed delineations of protected resource boundaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>A few weeks later, Soviero\u2019s professional submitted revised plans to the board. He also reported his inspection of the existing building, represented that the new house is and would be a four-bedroom building, and offered his opinion that \u201cthere is not an increase in flow and that the variance should be allowed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">SPD\u2019s professional spokesperson noted the ambiguity as to whether Soviero proposed <em>demolition </em>and new construction of the dwelling or <em>reconstruction </em>of the existing dwelling, drawing the board\u2019s attention to enhanced Title 5 requirements for new construction. He also opined that the proposed system increased the design flow above the approved capacity and that Soviero\u2019s variance requests and plans did not comply with the applicable regulations. Specifically, he argued that the proposed plans showed an increase in bedrooms, which would calculate to a fifty percent increase in design flow to the septic system, and that the proposed elevations of the new system would create a hazard to SPD\u2019s adjacent property. He also unequivocally asserted that the proposed system is within a sand dune and, hence, prohibited by the FHR, and that removal of sand dune material significantly would reduce the ability of that dune to buffer flood waters, increasing the potential for storm damage to the SPD property.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">b. <em>Board decision. </em>The board identifies its approval as a \u201clocal upgrade variance approval\u201d under Title 5, and \u201clocal regulation variance approval\u201d under the FHR, \u201cto allow an upgrade to the existing subsurface sewage disposal facilities.\u201d The decision stated that the variances from both regulations were to \u201callow a soil absorption system to be located in a dune.\u201d The decision detailed the board\u2019s implicit finding that the existing dwelling contained four bedrooms, and explicitly prohibited an \u201cincrease [in] the number of bedrooms above four as a matter of right.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The decision did not address the seven siting criteria in 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 15.213(2), nor did the board address the two-part variance test required under 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 15.410(1) and (2). The board did not reference its own regulation under \u00a7 15.2(1)(1.0) which prohibits a septic system <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>in a dune. Additionally, the decision failed accurately to describe the proposed system as totally new and in a different location.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">4. <em>Standards for appellate review. </em>SPD appealed pursuant to the certiorari statute, G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4, which is attendant to errors in proceedings where, as here, no other appeal route is provided. A Superior Court judge has authority to \u201ccorrect only a substantial error of law, evidenced by the record, which adversely affects a material right of the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Carney </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>403 Mass. 604, 605 (1988). The judge in this case was to determine if the board committed error of law that \u201cresulted in manifest injustice to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Second Dist. Ct. of E. Middlesex, </em>389 Mass. 508, 511 (1983). Our role in this appeal is to decide whether the judge correctly determined that the administrative record showed no error of law that adversely affected SPD\u2019s material rights. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Because the judge\u2019s decision is a ruling of law, and not a finding of fact or one that in some way involves evidence or credibility determinations, we give it no special deference. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Superintendent of Schs. of Stoughton, </em>437 Mass. 1, 5 (2002). See <em>Fieldstone Meadows Dev. Corp. </em>v. <em>Conservation Commn. of Andover, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 265, 267 (2004) (appellate court gives no special weight to view of Superior Court judge in review under G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4). See also <em>Southern Worcester County Regional Vocational Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>377 Mass. 897, 903 (1979). In this case the judge\u2019s decision was based upon questions of law, and as in summary judgment, we review the same record that was before the judge. Our review is essentially de novo.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">5. <em>Discussion. </em>SPD principally argues that the judge erred in ruling that the board was not required to specify any reasons or make findings in its decision. SPD also asserts error in the judge\u2019s conclusion that there was substantial evidence in the record for the board\u2019s decision. We will not consider the substantial evidence issue. Any such evaluation is premature because the board\u2019s decision does not permit competent judicial review, and the case must be remanded to the board for further proceedings or, at the very least, further explanation of its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">The board\u2019s decision is inadequate in several respects. First, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>the board did not determine, as matter of fact, whether Soviero proposed a remodeling (reconstruction) of his home, as opposed to a demolition and new construction. That fact is pertinent to judicial review whether failure to grant the variance would \u201cdeprive the applicant of substantially all beneficial use.\u201d See 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 15.410(2). Second, the delineation of relevant resource area on Soviero\u2019s lot (including, but not limited to, coastal dune) is not clear<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and there is no finding by the board in this regard. The board\u2019s decision fails to include an analysis of design flow, or whether Soviero can site the new system other than where proposed (for example, in the location of the old system).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Third, the groundwater siting criterion in 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 15.213(2)(f) is not addressed, nor is that in subsection (g), applicable to the construction of a soil absorption system within a velocity zone or regulatory floodway. Fourth, the board does not recite that Soviero has established that enforcement of 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 15.213(2) would be manifestly unjust and that a level of environmental protection at least equivalent to a fully compliant system, without variance, would be achieved. See 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 15.410(1). These regulations instruct sophisticated siting criteria, and these criteria are relevant to SPD\u2019s interests, as is evident here from the statements and the preamble of both State and local regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">We are persuaded by SPD\u2019s argument that it was error of law for the judge to excuse the board\u2019s failure to make additional findings or sufficiently to explain itself.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The authority of the board is broad. See <em>American Lithuanian Naturalization Club, Athol, Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Athol, </em>446 Mass. 310, 317 (2006). However, competent judicial review of such decisions is often, as here, rendered difficult if not impossible by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>the lack of specific findings and rationale for the agency decision. See <em>Oyster Creek Preservation, Inc. </em>v. <em>Conservation Commn. of Harwich, </em>449 Mass. 859, 866 n.12 (2007). In this case the board\u2019s decision is insulated from scrutiny.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">6. <em>Disposition. </em>We vacate the judgment of the Superior Court. A new judgment is to enter annulling the board\u2019s granting of the variances and remanding the matter to the board for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The board is the municipal body charged with implementing and enforcing Title 5 as well as the FHR.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b397-7\">See Superior Court Standing Order 1-96.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b397-8\">The board did not file a pleading in the Superior Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b397-9\">The record is unclear as to what exactly Soviero proposed to do with the property: completely demolish the existing building and construct a new one, or remodel only. However, it is apparent from the record that the existing, functioning septic system, suitable for four bedrooms, was to be totally abandoned and removed, and a new system with a 2,500-gallon capacity was to be installed in a completely different location on the lot. The new system would be functionally capable of servicing more than four bedrooms.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">According to Title 5, the existing septic system was required to have been inspected and certified as Title 5 compliant at the time of Soviero\u2019s purchase of the house in 2002. See 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 15.301(1) (1995). Title 5 also contains specific provisions to determine whether a septic system fails to comply with Title 5. See 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 15.303 (1995). There is no credible evidence in the record that the existing septic system ever had failed or that the new system was required by the board or by any State or local regulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b398-10\">The FHR supplied in the record contain no definition of \u201cseptic system leaching facility.\u201d We assume that the definition of \u201csoil absorption system\u201d in the State regulations is sufficient for purposes of analysis in this case of both the State and the local regulations.
