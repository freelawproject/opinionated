When the defendant failed to answer, the officer attempted to pat frisk him. The defendant pushed the officer\u2019s hands away, but the officer continued with the frisk and discovered a loaded handgun. The defendant was convicted in a jury-waived trial of unlawful possession of a firearm in violation of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(a); possession of a loaded firearm in violation of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(n); and assault and battery on a police officer in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13D.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, he challenges his convictions on the ground that the motion judge improperly denied his motion to suppress evidence that he claims was the fruit of an illegal patfrisk. He also contends that the trial judge (who was not the motion judge) erred by admitting ballistics certificates at trial and excluding exculpatory evidence to rebut them. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">1. <em>Motion to suppress. </em>The motion judge made the following relevant findings of fact. On October 8, 2006, around 10:30 a.m., Boston police Officer Ismael Henriquez and his partner were patrolling the Woodrow Avenue area of the Dorchester section of Boston, a high crime area where Officer Henriquez had previously participated in drug and firearm arrests. The officers, who were wearing plain clothes and driving an unmarked car, were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>attempting to execute a warrant for the arrest of a juvenile who lived in the neighborhood. In the process, they saw a young man, the defendant, wearing a sweatshirt, with a hood pulled up around his face. The defendant was walking toward Woodrow Avenue. While they could not see his face, the officers thought that the defendant might be the juvenile they were looking for.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">They made a U-turn and drove next to the defendant, who ignored them. At this point, the officers still could not see his face. They rolled down the window, identified themselves as police officers, and asked the defendant his name. After some hesitation he replied, \u201cJamal Daly,\u201d which was not the name of the juvenile they were seeking. Also, the defendant was taller and stockier than that juvenile.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 3The officers asked the defendant for his birth date. He told them it was \u201cSeptember, 1987.\u201d They then asked him how old he was and he replied, \u201cSeventeen.\u201d Because the age and date did not match,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the officers believed the defendant was lying about at least one of his answers.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">At that point, Officer Henriquez stepped out of the vehicle and approached the defendant while his partner remained in the car. The defendant was nervous and took a few steps backward. Officer Henriquez could now see the defendant\u2019s face and knew he was not the wanted juvenile. The officer then asked the defendant if he had any weapons. When the defendant did not answer, Officer Henriquez attempted to pat frisk him.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> **The defendant pushed the officer\u2019s hands away. Officer Henriquez told the defendant to calm down and continued with the frisk, during which he felt a hard object that turned out to be a loaded gun. Officer Henriquez handcuffed the defendant and arrested him. While booking him, the police allowed the defendant to make a telephone call, during which they overheard him say that he had \u201cjust been locked up for the gun I found.\u201d Additional facts from the record will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">The defendant argues on appeal that the judge improperly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>denied his motion to suppress evidence that he claims was the fruit of an illegal patfrisk. Prior to trial, the defendant made a motion to suppress the gun and bullets seized by the police and the statement he made during booking. The defendant argued that the police had no constitutional basis to search him. After an evidentiary hearing on December 11, 2006, a Boston Municipal Court judge denied the motion. The judge determined that the police had no constitutional basis to search the defendant prior to the defendant\u2019s pushing Officer Henriquez\u2019s hands away, but concluded that the push \u201cprovided probable cause to arrest the defendant for the crime of assault and battery.\u201d The judge observed that \u201c [i]f suspects were legally permitted to resist searches or arrests they believed illegal, chaos and violence would supplant the rule of law.\u201d The judge further observed that, once there is probable cause to arrest, the police \u201cmay search a suspect for weapons or for evidence of the crime for which the arrest is made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">In reviewing a motion to suppress, the judge\u2019s findings of fact are \u201cbinding in the absence of clear error.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alvarado, </em>420 Mass. 542, 544 (1995). However, we \u201cindependently review[] the correctness of the judge\u2019s application of constitutional principles to the facts found.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gentile, </em>437 Mass. 569, 573 (2002), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eckert, </em>431 Mass. 591, 593 (2000). While we affirm the judge\u2019s ruling, we do so on different grounds.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Va Meng Joe, </em>425 Mass. 99, 102 (1997) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>(\u201cAn appellate court is free to affirm a ruling on grounds different from those relied on by the motion judge if the correct or preferred basis for affirmance is supported by the record and the findings\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">Based on the judge\u2019s factual findings we conclude that the defendant was not seized until the officer attempted the patfnsk. At that point the officer had a legitimate reason for being in the immediate proximity of the defendant and a reasonable belief that the defendant was armed and dangerous. Therefore, the motion to suppress the gun and ammunition found pursuant to the patfnsk was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">\u201cA person is seized by the police only when, in light of all of the attending circumstances, a reasonable person in that situation would not feel free to leave.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DePeiza, </em>449 Mass. 367, 369 (2007). In the instant case, the officers approached in an unmarked vehicle, without activating blue lights or sirens. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smigliano, </em>427 Mass. 490, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>491-492 (1998) (\u201ca reasonable person, on the activation of a police car\u2019s blue lights, would believe that he or she is not free to leave\u201d). While there were two officers present, only Officer Henriquez stepped out of the vehicle, and he did not obstruct the defendant\u2019s movement. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DePeiza, </em>449 Mass, at 370 (no seizure even where two officers stepped out of the car and stood on each side of the defendant). Also, neither officer ordered the defendant to stop or to answer the questions he posed. See <em>ibid, </em>(relying in part on the fact that the officers did not order the defendant to stop or to answer their questions in concluding there was no seizure). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barros, </em>435 Mass. 171, 172, 176 (2001) (defendant was seized when an officer approached the defendant after he ignored a request to talk and then said, \u201cHey you. I wanna talk to you. Come here\u201d). Nor did the officers draw their weapons or touch the defendant prior to the patfrisk. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pimentel, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 557, 560 (1989) (explaining that \u201cthe display of a weapon by an officer [and] some physical touching of the person of the citizen\u201d are examples of additional circumstances that support a finding of a seizure).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">In this context, the questions that followed the officers\u2019 approach regarding name, age, and date of birth did not constitute a seizure. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thinh Van Cao, </em>419 Mass. 383, 388, cert, denied, 515 U.S. 1146 (1995) (no seizure where an officer approached the defendant in a public parking lot and asked questions about his identity); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DePeiza, </em>449 Mass, at 370 (no seizure when officers asked for identification and held it during a \u201cbrief conversation\u201d). The Supreme Judicial Court has recognized that \u201cthe police do not effect a seizure merely by asking questions unless the circumstances of the encounter are sufficiently intimidating that a reasonable person would believe he was not free to turn his back on his interrogator and walk away.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fraser, </em>410 Mass. 541, 544 (1991). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murdough, </em>428 Mass. 760, 763 (1999) (\u201cofficers may make inquiry of anyone they wish ... so long as they do not implicitly or explicitly assert that the person inquired of is not free to ignore their inquiries\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Although more significant, the additional question whether the defendant had a weapon is likewise not enough in these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>circumstances to seize the defendant. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fletcher, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 166, 170 (2001), after observing \u201cthree men who were engaging in the disorderly and unorthodox conduct of pounding on the side of a stopped bus in a public transit station crowded with people during the evening rush hour commute,\u201d an officer called the men over to talk to him, and as they approached he asked them if they had any weapons. When they did not answer, he pat frisked them. <em>Id. </em>at 167. In that case, we concluded that \u201cstopping and stepping out of a cruiser that was properly patrolling a public transit station, calling over to the men, approaching them, and asking about a weapon . . . did not constitute a stop or seizure.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 170. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lockett, </em>406 F.3d 207, 209, 211 (3d Cir. 2005) (no seizure where officers told the defendant they were \u201clooking for contraband including narcotics, large sums of money, <em>guns, and other weapons </em>[and] asked [him] if he had any of these items in his possession\u201d [emphasis supplied]).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">The decision to pat frisk a defendant, however, transforms the encounter. At that point, there must be at a minimum \u201csome legitimate basis for the officer being in immediate proximity to the person,\u201d and the officer must reasonably believe that the individual is armed and dangerous. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fraser, </em>410 Mass, at 544 n.4. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Isaiah I., </em>450 Mass. 818, 824 (2008); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knowles, </em>451 Mass. 91, 97 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">We conclude that Officer Henriquez had a legitimate reason for being in the immediate proximity of the defendant because the officer was attempting to apprehend a wanted juvenile who lived nearby, and he stopped the defendant to see if he was that individual. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fraser, supra </em>at 545 n.4 (officer was legitimately in the immediate proximity of the defendant when he came into contact with him while investigating a report of an armed man at that location). Although the officer had realized that the defendant was not the juvenile immediately before he asked the question about weapons, the defendant had in the meantime given the officer inconsistent answers and behaved nervously.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>The only issue that remains is whether Officer Henriquez had a reasonable belief that the defendant was armed and dangerous after the defendant did not respond to the question about weapons. We consider this a close question, but conclude that the officer did have a reasonable belief in these circumstances. The Supreme Judicial Court has observed that \u201cit does not take much for a police officer to establish a reasonable basis to justify ... [a] search based on safety concerns.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Gonsalves, 429 Mass. 658, 664 (1999). Also, \u201cin applying hindsight to an officer\u2019s actions, an appellate court is mindful that, as shown by many tragic endings to threshold police inquiries, \u2018the answer might be a bullet.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 362, 365 (2006), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>366 Mass. 402, 407 (1974). See <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 33 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">The combination of the following four factors produced the necessary reasonable belief that the defendant was armed and dangerous.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fraser, </em>410 Mass, at 545 (\u201ca combination of factors that are each innocent of themselves may, when taken together, amount to the requisite reasonable belief\u201d). First, the officers approached the defendant in a high-crime area where Officer Henriquez had previously participated in firearm arrests. See <em>ibid. </em>Second, the defendant hesitated before telling the officers his name and appeared nervous when Officer Henriquez stepped out of the car and approached him. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DePeiza, </em>449 Mass, at 371 (nervous behavior is a factor that can contribute to a reasonable belief that an individual is \u201ccommitting the crime of carrying an illegal firearm\u201d). Third, the age and date of birth that the defendant gave the officers were two years off, thereby demonstrating the defendant was lying to the officers. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Narcisse, ante </em>406, 410 (2008) (defendant\u2019s statement that he was from the town where a murder had occurred the previous night, together with his \u201capparently false statement that he was coming from \u2018the store,\u2019 \u201d raised the officer\u2019s suspicion).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>Fourth, the defendant\u2019s silence in response to Officer Henriquez\u2019s asking him if he had any weapons contributed to the officer\u2019s reasonable belief that the defendant was armed and dangerous. The ambiguity left by the defendant\u2019s silence in response to this question, particularly when he had answered the previous questions, may be considered a factor by the police in determining whether the defendant is in fact armed and dangerous.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knowles, </em>451 Mass, at 100 (\u201cIf the officer had asked rather than ordered [the defendant] to step away from the area to speak to him about the matter, and if [the defendant] had declined to do so, that fact would have legitimately heightened the officer\u2019s concern that [the defendant] posed a danger to his safety\u201d). See also 2 LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 3.6(f), at 364 (4th ed. 2004) (\u201cthe better view is that refusal to answer is one factor which an officer may consider, together with the evidence that gave rise to his prior suspicion, in determining whether there are grounds for an arrest\u201d). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barros, </em>435 Mass, at 178 (defendant\u2019s \u201cbreaking eye contact with the officer and his refusing to answer the officer\u2019s initial questions . . . cannot provide reasonable suspicion . . . [as] [i]t was the defendant\u2019s right to ignore the officer\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">In sum, in these circumstances, the patfrisk was justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">2. <em>Admission of the notarized ballistics certificates. </em>The defendant next claims that the trial judge erred by admitting the notarized ballistics certificates in evidence. At trial, the Commonwealth offered the firearm and ammunition certificates as exhibits. The certificates stated that, in the ballistics expert\u2019s opinion, the weapon and the bullets found on the defendant met the statutory definitions of \u201cfirearm\u201d and \u201cammunition.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Both of these certificates were executed and notarized in accordance with the provisions of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 121A. The defendant objected to the admission of this evidence because the copies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>that the Commonwealth had provided to him during discovery were not notarized.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The defendant, however, did not mark the discovery copies for identification or offer them in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">On appeal, the defendant argues that the certificates should have been excluded because the Commonwealth failed to provide him with notarized copies during discovery and because the unnotarized copies he did receive during discovery called into question the authenticity of the certificates admitted at trial.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We conclude that the judge did not abuse her discretion in admitting the notarized certificates.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">The ballistics certificates entered in evidence at trial were properly attested to and were therefore correctly admitted by the judge. To whatever extent the unnotarized discovery copies may have undermined the authenticity of these certificates, any deficiency went to the weight of the evidence and not its admissibility. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Westerman, </em>414 Mass. 688, 700 (1993) (concluding that \u201cany procedural or administrative errors [in a drag analysis certificate] affect only the weight of the evidence\u201d and not its admissibility). Furthermore, we agree with the Commonwealth that it disclosed the substance of the certificates to the defendant in a timely manner and that the delay in providing the notarized copies had no adverse consequences on the defendant\u2019s ability to prepare his case; the defendant does not argue that there is any substantive difference between the notarized and unnotarized certificates, nor do we observe any such difference. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Emerson, </em>430 Mass. 378, 380-381 (1999), cert, denied, 529 U.S. 1030 (2000), quoting from <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>385 Mass. 165, 175 (1982) (\u201cEven where there has been insufficient disclosure, we look to see \u2018whether, given a timely disclosure, the defense would have been able to prepare and present its case in such a manner as to create a reasonable doubt that would not otherwise have existed\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">3. <em>The ballistics case notes. </em>The defendant\u2019s final claim of error concerns the ballistician\u2019s case notes that accompanied the ballistics certificates. During the defendant\u2019s cross-examination of Officer Henriquez, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-6\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cWere you there present when [the firearm] was tested?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-7\">A.: \u201cNo, I was not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-8\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cDid you read the ballistician\u2019s report?\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-9\">A.: \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-10\"><em>Q.\\ </em>\u201cThe way that gun was found that day it could not be operated, correct; it could not fire those bullets, correct?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-11\">A.: \u201cIf that\u2019s what it says \u2022 \u2014 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-12\">Prosecutor: \u201cObjection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-13\">The court: \u201cOverruled.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-14\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cThe way the gun was found that day it couldn\u2019t be fired according to the ballistician\u2019s report, correct?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-15\">Prosecutor: \u201cObjection. It doesn\u2019t say that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-16\">The court: \u201cNo. He can testify as to what he knows. Does it say that or not, or do you know?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-17\">A.: \u201cWell, there\u2019s another certification in there.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-18\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about the certification. I\u2019m talking about his written report?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>A.: \u201cCorrect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-5\">Defense counsel: \u201cI have no further questions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">The defendant, however, did not seek to admit the case notes in evidence, nor did he present any expert witnesses on the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">During the defendant\u2019s closing argument, counsel argued, \u201cWe know from the police officer\u2019s testimony that the ballistician himself admitted that the gun was not fireable in the condition it was found on the defendant.\u201d At that point, the judge interrupted him because the judge did not believe the police officer had given this testimony. The judge also correctly pointed out that the case notes were not in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">On appeal, the defendant argues that the case notes should have been admitted under the doctrine of curative admissibility. \u201cThe curative admissibility doctrine allows a party harmed by incompetent evidence to rebut that evidence ... if the original evidence created significant prejudice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ruffen, </em>399 Mass. 811, 813-814 (1987). The defendant claims that the notarized ballistics certificates were incompetent evidence, and therefore, he should have been allowed to rebut them by entering the ballistician\u2019s case notes, which he claims contain exculpatory evidence. Because, as discussed <em>supra, </em>the ballistics certificates were competent and properly admitted in evidence, the curative admissibility doctrine does not apply.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Moreover, even if the doctrine had applied, the defendant did not properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>offer the notes into evidence.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The trial judge could not consider something that was never properly before her. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>423 Mass. 841, 848-849 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b563-10\">The assault and battery conviction was placed on file with the defendant\u2019s consent, and is not before us. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Delgado, 367 Mass. 432, 438 (1975). The defendant was also charged with unlawful possession of ammunition in violation of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(A), but this charge was dismissed voluntarily by the Commonwealth at the conclusion of trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b564-8\">It is not clear from the findings how much taller or stockier the defendant was than the juvenile, nor when the officers realized the discrepancy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b564-9\">If the defendant had been bom on the date he gave the officers, he would have been nineteen, not seventeen.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b564-11\">The officer testified at the suppression hearing that he told the defendant that for safety, he (the officer) was going to pat frisk him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b565-6\">The motion judge concluded that there was no basis to justify a search of the defendant until he pushed the officer\u2019s hands away. Because we conclude that the patfrisk was justified on other grounds, we need not consider, as the motion judge did, whether the defendant\u2019s pushing away Officer Henriquez\u2019s hands provided probable cause to arrest justifying the subsequent patfrisk. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moreira, </em>388 Mass. 596, 601 (1983) (\u201cin the absence of excessive or unnecessary force by an arresting officer, a person may not use force to resist an arrest by one who he knows ... is an authorized police officer, engaged in the performance of his duties, regardless of whether the arrest was unlawful in the circumstances\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gomes, 59 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 332, 341-343 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">The defendant argues that the \u201cdeflective movement of pushing Officer Henriquez\u2019s hands away\u201d was not sufficiently separate from what he claims was an illegal patfrisk to dissipate the taint of that alleged illegality. The Supreme Judicial Court has held that \u201cthe commission of a new, \u2018unrelated\u2019 crime after an illegal [search or] arrest may provide the basis for a valid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>arrest,\" and therefore a search incident to that arrest. <em>Commonwealth </em>v.

Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Borges, supra </em>(motion to suppress allowed where, although intervening acts occurred, they were not \u201csufficiently independent, in nature and temporal proximity\u201d to justify the subsequent arrest; the defendant fled on foot, struggled with officers, and attempted to dispose of evidence); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>State, </em>745 A.2d 856, 872 (Del. 1999) (\u201c[T]he crime of resisting an illegal arrest does not necessarily carry with it the right to justify any search incident to an actual arrest for the crime of resisting an illegal arrest. Otherwise there would be significant potential for official abuse\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Beauchesne, </em>151 N.H. 803, 818 (2005) (\u201cin order to protect important State constitutional rights, it is \u2018logical and necessary\u2019 to apply the exclusionary rule to situations where the initial seizure is unlawful and the defendant then violates [the law by resisting arrest]\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>157 Vt. 60, 63-64 (1991) (not all intervening crimes will remove the taint of an illegal stop, only ones sufficiently serious to be \u201cdistinct\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b568-7\">We did not reach the question in <em>Fletcher </em>regarding whether the patfrisk was constitutionally justified. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fletcher, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. at 171-172.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b569-6\">We recognize that there were also factors that weighed against a reasonable belief that the defendant was armed and dangerous. For example, the time of day, which was in the morning, the absence of a furtive movement such as reaching for his waist, and the absence of flight. However, the factors that were present, when taken together, were nevertheless sufficient.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b570-7\">We also note that both of the ages provided by the defendant rendered him too young to own a firearm legally. General Laws c. 140, \u00a7 131(\u00e1)(iv), prohibits an individual under age twenty-one from obtaining a firearm license.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b570-8\">The expert therefore certified that the gun was capable of discharging a shot or bullet and the bullets were \u201cdesigned for use in any firearm, rifle or shotgun.\u201d See definitions of \u201c[a]mmunition\u201d and \u201c[fjirearm\u201d in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 121, as appearing in St. 1998, c. 180, \u00a7 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b571-7\">The defendant also argued that a typographical error in the certificates, stating that the ammunition and firearm were submitted to be tested on \u201cJanuary 1st in the year of 1900,\u201d called into question \u201cthe entire nature of the certificate[s] [themselves].\u201d The defendant has abandoned this argument on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b571-8\">The defendant also argues in his brief that \u201c[e]ven if there is no error in the judge\u2019s discretion on this issue, the actual ballistic tests\u2019 findings were never specified at trial and thus proof of the defendant\u2019s guilt was incomplete.\u201d The defendant did not raise this claim below, but even if he had, it is without merit because the certificates were admitted into evidence and their contents need not be additionally read into the record or otherwise admitted through live testimony. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nieves, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 4 (1997) (admission of the ballistics certificates is an alternative to the testimony of persons familiar with the guns or persons who handled the gun).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b572-19\">Defense counsel is presumably referring to the document entitled \u201cBallistic Unit Case Notes\u201d prepared by the ballistician who prepared the ballistics certificates.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b573-9\">We are also unconvinced that the ballistician\u2019s case notes would establish that the gun found on the defendant was not a \u201cloaded\u201d firearm. Officer Henriquez testified that the ammunition described in the ballistician\u2019s certificate was found in the gun taken from the defendant. The ballistician\u2019s certificates opined that the weapon found on the defendant was a firearm and that the \u201ctwo rounds of 7.65 ammunition\u201d met the definition of \u201cammunition\u201d in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 121. While it appears from the ballistician\u2019s notes that the bullets and gun seized from the defendant were not capable of firing together, the expert concluded that they nevertheless individually met the statutory definitions of \u201cfirearm\u201d and \u201cammunition.\u201d We note that when the Legislature defined the term \u201cloaded\u201d firearm in 2006, it adopted the same definition of \u201cammunition\u201d as that found in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 121. See G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(c), inserted by St. 2006, c. 48, \u00a7 7 (a firearm is \u201cloaded\u201d when \u201cammunition is contained in the weapon or within a feeding device attached thereto,\u201d and the ammunition need only be \u201cdesigned for use in <em>any </em>firearm\u201d [emphasis added]). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bartholomew, </em>326 Mass. 218, 220 (1950) (\u201cWhile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>it may be conceded that a weapon designed for firing projectiles may be so defective or damaged that it has lost its initial character as a firearm, . . . this character is not lost when a relatively slight repair, replacement, or adjustment will make it an effective weapon\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b574-8\">We reject the defendant\u2019s argument that the notes were in evidence because they came in through Officer Henriquez\u2019s testimony. It was defense counsel who sought, through his questions, to interject the notes into the trial without actually introducing the notes. The officer\u2019s testimony was minimal and unclear in relation to the notes.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b574-5\">Brown, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7a\">(dissenting). I respectfully dissent, as there is, in my view, an unclear line between <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barros, </em>435 Mass. 171 (2001), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DePeiza, </em>449 Mass. 367 (2007), and, in any event, the factual circumstances in the case before us exceed even the dictates of the <em>DePeiza </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">In the factual scenario here we have a young man walking down the street at 10:30 in the morning, who is nervous upon being questioned by the police. His inconsistent answers were not germane to any crime being investigated, nor were there any visible signs that he was carrying a weapon, such as an unusually heavy pocket, or an odd gait. He did not make any furtive movement. Only <em>after </em>the police had ascertained that he was not the person they were seeking to apprehend was he asked whether he had a gun.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, even under the teachings of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fraser, </em>410 Mass. 541 (1991); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DePeiza, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fletcher, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 166 (2001); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Narcisse, ante </em>406 (2008); and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, ante </em>411 (2008), there simply was not enough here to question the defendant further after the police realized he was not the person they were looking for. This is a case where \u201cthe police . . . tum[ed] a hunch into a reasonable suspicion by inducing the conduct justifying the suspicion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barros, </em>435 Mass, at 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>I am compelled to add an admonition about the current state of the law. The resolution of this category of cases apparently turns on the question whether the citizen had a gun. That may not be the only factor, but it certainly seems to be the controlling one. If it is not, we should pat frisk all travelers <em>walking </em>(or stopping) on the street, or at any intersection in a so-called high crime area (which I suspect is an area situated in most cities and towns). We already know even under <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1 (1968), that \u201crunning\u201d and \u201cstraight-arm\u201d walking are sufficiently indicative of reasonably suspicious behavior to justify a patfrisk. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DePeiza, </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 408-409 (2006) (Brown, J., concurring), <em>S.C., </em>449 Mass. 367 (2007). In sum, we have here another example of the troubling tension that exists between the responses of law enforcement personnel to the dangers of illegal weapons on the streets of our cities and towns and respect for and adherence to the commands of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. My hope, however, is that the Fourth Amendment does not become \u201can inconvenient truth.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b574-9\">I note that requiring an individual to respond to a specific question may in certain circumstances precipitate self-incrimination problems.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
