The juvenile was found guilty on an indictment charging assault with intent to rape a child under age sixteen in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 24B<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>; on an indictment charging rape of a child with force, the juvenile was found guilty of the lesser included offense of assault and battery in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13A. Lastly, the juvenile was found delinquent on a complaint charging indecent assault and battery on a child under age fourteen in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-11\">On appeal, the juvenile claims that the adjudications were duplicative because (a) assault and battery was a lesser included offense of indecent assault and battery on a child, and (b) the acts underlying the charges of indecent assault and battery on a child and assault with intent to rape a child were so closely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>related in fact as to constitute a single crime.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We agree that the adjudications are duplicative, and as a result set aside the assault and battery and indecent assault and battery adjudications. We affirm the juvenile\u2019s adjudication of delinquency by reason of assault with intent to rape a child under age sixteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\"><em>Background. </em>Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the jury could have found the following facts. On January 18, 2005, the juvenile, then age sixteen, sexually assaulted his seven year old half sister, Norma.2 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Norma, who had gone to the juvenile\u2019s bedroom to look for her doll, was pushed by the juvenile so that her knees were on the floor and her face on the bed. He pulled down her pants as well as his own,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and then climbed atop her and began \u201chumping her\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>from behind. The juvenile\u2019s eleven year old stepbrother, Kevin, arrived by coincidence while the incident was occurring and saw \u25a0\u2014 through a crack between the locked bedroom door and the jamb \u2014 Norma face down on the bed and the juvenile on top of her with his pants down.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>Additional facts are set out in the sections of the discussion, <em>infra, </em>to which they pertain.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Duplicative convictions.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The case rested on only three acts, all closely related in time, place, and intent. The Commonwealth presented no theory as to how these three acts related to the charged offenses, or to the elements of any of the crimes. Because of this, and the absence of a unanimity instruction,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we do not and cannot know on which act or acts the jury predicated the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">On appeal, the Commonwealth contends that the removal of Norma\u2019s pants constituted indecent assault and battery, pushing her onto the bed constituted a separate assault and battery, and getting on top of her supported the separate crime of assault with intent to rape. Neither this theory nor any other was advanced during the trial, either to the judge or to the jury. The prosecutor at no point articulated the Commonwealth\u2019s position as to which of the three acts (singly or in combination) satisfied which of the charges, the lesser included offenses that were also submitted to the jury for consideration,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> or the elements of either. In both its opening statement and its closing argument, the Commonwealth said merely that the case was not complicated and that the conduct consisted of: \u201c[Norma] went down to the Defendant\u2019s room, he pushed her onto the bed, he pulled down his pants, he pulled down her pants and he got on top of her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">Nor did the jury receive guidance from any other source as to how they were to view the evidence in relation to the charges. The indictments and the delinquency complaint consisted only of a recitation of the elements of each applicable crime and the date on which the offense was charged to have occurred; they did not identify the Commonwealth\u2019s theory as to how the juvenile com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>mitted each crime. The jury instructions, too, were silent, containing no reference to any of the evidence in the case, or to how the evidence related to any of the offenses or their elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">In short, the jury received no guidance \u2014 whether from the charges, the Commonwealth\u2019s case, or the trial judge \u2014 as to what conduct could form the predicate for which offense(s) and which offenses needed to be predicated on separate and distinct acts. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>445 Mass. 217, 225-226 (2005), cert, denied, 546 U.S. 1216 (2006) (convictions of indecent assault and battery and rape were not duplicative where the judge instructed the jury that separate and distinct acts were needed and explained the Commonwealth\u2019s theory as to which acts constituted which offenses). In these circumstances, it is impossible to know which of the three acts, singly or in combination, was relied upon by the jury in finding the juvenile guilty of any of the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">a. <em>Assault and battery and indecent assault and battery on a child. </em>The juvenile argues that his adjudications of delinquency by reason of assault and battery and indecent assault and battery on a child are duplicative because assault and battery is a lesser included offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">The juvenile was convicted of indecent assault and battery of a child under the age of fourteen, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B, which, unlike simple assault and battery, does not require proof of lack of consent. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Farrell, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 267, 268 (1991) (\u201c[b]y St. 1986, c. 187, the Legislature amended \u00a7 13B to exclude lack of consent as an element of the crime of indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen\u201d). Therefore, under a proper jury charge, \u201ca simple assault and battery ... is not a lesser included offense within the statutory offense of indecent assault and battery of a child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 268-269.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">In the case at bar, however, the judge did not instruct the jury that lack of consent was required to prove assault and battery, even though such an instruction was required. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 358, 359 (2002) (assault and battery requires proof of lack of consent where the touching is offensive). Moreover, the judge (in charging the elements of rape) instructed the jury, \u201c[A]nd of course the law, for a child of seven years old, they\u2019re not old enough to give consent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>so consent is not a factor.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As part of the instructions concerning indecent assault and battery on a child, the judge similarly (correctly) informed the jury: \u201cBecause of the age of the alleged victim you are not to consider, as I mentioned earlier, whether or not, in this case the alleged victim, she consented to any touching. If the victim is under fourteen years of age it is irrelevant whether or not she consented.\u201d In short, not only were the jury not instructed that proof of lack of consent was required in order to convict the juvenile of assault and battery on a theory of an offensive touching,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the only information they received at all concerning consent was that it was irrelevant. In effect, then \u2014 through an erroneous jury charge that omitted the element of nonconsent \u2014 the assault and battery in this case became a lesser included offense of indecent assault and battery on a child under age fourteen.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cThis instruction became the law of the case.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pinero, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 397, 399 (2000), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Because the assault and battery charge was submitted to the jury as a lesser included offense of indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen, the jury should have been instructed that the offenses were required to rest on separate and distinct acts.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This is our well-established rule regarding lesser included offenses. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>445 Mass, at 225 (convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>tions of the greater and lesser included offenses must \u201crest on separate and distinct acts\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maldonado, </em>429 Mass. 502, 509 (1999) (jury properly instructed that the Commonwealth had the burden to prove that the acts constituting the lesser included offense of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon were separate and distinct from those constituting murder). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>439 Mass. 482, 489 (2003) (dismissing a lesser included offense where the judge failed to instruct that the convictions had to be predicated on separate and distinct acts). And the failure to provide such an instruction in this case resulted in a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice such that the adjudication of delinquency by reason of assault and battery must be vacated. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Juzba, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 319, 325 &amp; n.1 (1999) (dismissing an indictment for a lesser included offense, noting that \u201cwe need not determine whether there was . . . evidence which would support two distinct acts, since the judge did not instruct the jury that the conviction[s of indecent assault and battery and rape] must be based on separate acts\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>400 Mass. 676, 681-682 (1987) (vacating judgments on convictions of indecent assault and battery where the judge failed to instruct that the convictions needed to rest on facts separate from those constituting aggravated rape); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>405 Mass. 369, 381-382 (1989) (same with respect to convictions of indecent assault and battery and rape of a child); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Howze, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 147, 151-152 (2003) (same with respect to convictions of indecent assault and battery on a child and statutory rape).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">b. <em>Indecent assault and battery and assault with intent to rape. </em>The juvenile argues that, although indecent assault and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>battery on a child is not a lesser included offense of assault with intent to rape a child, the adjudications were duplicative because the factual basis for each was the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Our established rule is that, when tried in a single proceeding, a defendant may be convicted of and punished for multiple crimes based on the same act or on a single course of conduct \u201cprovided that each [crime] requires proof of an element that the other does not.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arriaga, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 382, 385 (1998). Thus, if a defendant is charged with two offenses and neither is a lesser included offense of the other, \u201cconvictions on both are deemed to have been authorized by the Legislature and hence not duplic[ative].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 386, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>382 Mass. 387, 393 (1981). However, in some limited circumstances, even where a lesser included offense is not involved, convictions may be duplicative if it \u201ccan be said with certainty that [the defendant\u2019s] actions were \u2018so closely related in fact as to constitute in substance but a single crime.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>441 Mass. 73, 76 (2004), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>St. Pierre, </em>377 Mass. 650, 662-663 (1979). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cabrera, </em>449 Mass. 825, 828 (2007). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>382 Mass, at 394 (even where one crime is not a lesser included of another, punishment on both is precluded where, on the facts, \u201cthe two offenses are sufficiently closely related\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">In order to determine whether a defendant\u2019s actions are \u201cso closely related,\u201d we are to look at such factors as whether the acts were separate in time, the form of conduct, and the defendant\u2019s intent. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wolinski, </em>431 Mass. 228, 239 (2000) (examining the characteristics of each of the defendant\u2019s acts to determine whether they were so closely related as to result in duplicative convictions). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cabrera, </em>449 Mass, at 828 (defendant\u2019s acts were not so related because \u201cthey were separated in time and by different forms of conduct. Moreover, he had separate intents\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">When we look at those factors here, it is clear that the juvenile\u2019s actions were so closely related as to constitute a single crime. The Commonwealth presented no evidence that the three acts in this case were separated in any way, whether temporally,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> physi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>cally, or otherwise. There was no evidence whatsoever of pause, interruption, delay, or discontinuity from one act to the next. Moreover, the Commonwealth introduced no evidence to show or suggest that the juvenile\u2019s intent in pulling down the pants or pushing Norma\u2019s face onto the bed was anything other than to effectuate his goal of getting on top of her. Indeed, there was no direct or indirect evidence of the juvenile\u2019s intent to rape other than his pulling down of Norma\u2019s pants \u2014 the same act that the Commonwealth now claims supported the indecent assault and battery conviction rather than the conviction of assault with intent to rape. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morin, 52 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 780, 787-788 (2001).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Where offenses are so closely related in fact that they in substance constitute a single crime, the jury are to be instructed that convictions on those offenses must rest on separate and distinct acts. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santos, </em>440 Mass. 281, 293-294 (2003) (vacating a conviction of assault by means of a dangerous weapon as duplicative of a conviction of armed robbery, even though one was not a lesser included offense of the other, because no separate and distinct act instruction was given); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morin, 52 </em>Mass. App. Ct. at 786 n.6 (separate and distinct act instruction required on the retrial of offenses that were so closely related as to constitute a single crime). Just as with lesser included offenses, the error occurs not simply because there were multiple convictions resting on facts so related that they constituted a single crime, but because the jury were not instructed that the convictions needed to rest on separate and distinct acts. See <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Santos, supra. </em>Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>439 Mass, at 489 (jury should have been instructed that convictions of indecent assault and battery and simple assault and battery needed to be predicated on separate and distinct acts); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Black, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 477, 478-479 (2000) (absent proper jury instruction, a conviction of a lesser included offense will be vacated if the record does not indicate there is only an insubstantial possibility of duplicative convictions based on the same act); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Howze, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. at 151 (failure to give instruction regarding separate and distinct acts resulted in the possibility of jury confusion and convictions resting on the same facts). Where no separate and distinct act instruction is given, and the actions underlying the offenses \u2014 here, assault with intent to rape a child and indecent assault and battery on a child \u2014 are so closely related in fact as to constitute a single crime, the error creates a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice requiring that the conviction of the lesser offense be vacated. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Black, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">2. <em>\u201cFirst complaint\u201d testimony. </em>The juvenile argues that there was error in permitting multiple witnesses to testify as to actions they took or reactions they had after they had spoken with the victim. The juvenile claims that this evidence amounted to impermissible multiple complaint testimony and should not have been admitted. Because the juvenile did not object at trial, we review to determine whether there was error and, if so, whether the error created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alphas, </em>430 Mass. 8, 13 (1999). Here, there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">A designated \u201cfirst complaint witness\u201d (generally the person who the victim first told of the assault) \u201cmay testify to the details of the alleged victim\u2019s first complaint of sexual assault and the circumstances surrounding that first complaint.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>445 Mass, at 243. The \u201cfirst complaint\u201d rule \u201cis not an exception to the rule against hearsay but rather \u2018an exception to the usual rule that a prior statement . . . that is consistent with the witness\u2019s trial testimony may only be admitted on redirect examination.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 241 n.21, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>429 Mass. 22, 27 n.6 (1999). Testimony from multiple complaint witnesses is not permitted. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, supra </em>at 242-243.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>The nonverbal conduct at issue here does not qualify as a statement under our principles of evidence. Although the definition of a statement is usually discussed in the context of hearsay, we consider the definition equally applicable in the context of first or multiple complaints. \u201cBoth Proposed Mass.R.Evid. 801(a) and Fed.R.Evid. 801(a) define a \u2018statement\u2019 as \u2018(1) an oral or written assertion or (2) nonverbal conduct of a person, if it is intended by him as an assertion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 926, 928 n.3 (1985). See <em>ibid, </em>(nonverbal conduct by the person amounts to a \u201cstatement\u201d if offered for the purpose of an inadmissible extrajudicial statement). \u201cAt common law out-of-court conduct, which by intent or inference expresses an assertion, has been regarded as a statement.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>412 Mass. 1201, 1209 (1992), citing <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Emerson, </em>7 Gray 174 (1856). See Reporter\u2019s Note to Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 801 (2008-2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">To determine whether the nonverbal conduct was intended as an assertion, we look to the person\u2019s intention as of the time of the conduct. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baker, supra </em>(failure to identify suspect from a photographic array was intended at the time by the eyewitness as an assertion that he was not one of the culprits). Thus, in order to prevail on his argument, the juvenile must show that at the time of the nonverbal conduct, either the conduct was intended by the person as an assertion about a \u201ccomplaint\u201d statement by Norma, or such an assertion can be reasonably inferred. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ashman, </em>430 Mass. 736, 742-743 (2000) (witnesses\u2019 testimony that they had telephoned the police after speaking with the victim created possible inference that the \u201cdefendant had abused\u201d the victim; the testimony was therefore \u201cno more than the equivalent of repeating statements of the victim\u201d). The juvenile argues that the impermissibly introduced testimony as to the witnesses\u2019 nonverbal conduct implied that \u201cNorma alleged a sexual assault and identified the juvenile as the perpetrator.\u201d This argument fails for the reasons set out <em>infra.</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">a. <em>Kevin. </em>After having observed the assault through the crack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>by the door, Kevin left and, about three minutes later, so did Norma. Kevin then confronted Norma, who denied that the incident had occurred. He concluded, however, that she was lying and he left, crying.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">The juvenile contends that the testimony concerning the fact that Kevin was crying after he spoke with Norma and additional testimony that Kevin told the father that he did not want the juvenile to go to jail violates the first complaint rale by implying that Norma told Kevin that the juvenile had assaulted her.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> No such inference can reasonably be drawn from the record because Kevin\u2019s direct \u2014 and uncontradicted \u2014 testimony at trial was that Norma denied to him that an assault had occurred. Given the testimony that Norma denied the incident to him, Kevin\u2019s crying was a reflection of what he had seen, rather than something intended to relay anything Norma had said to him. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cordle, </em>404 Mass. 733, 743-744 (1989) (police officer\u2019s testimony regarding actions taken after speaking to the victim were based not only on that conversation, but also the officer\u2019s observations).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">b. <em>Mother. </em>After she arrived home from work later on the evening of the assault, Norma\u2019s mother spoke to her husband, Norma, Kevin, and the juvenile. She did not testify as to the content of any of these conversations. However, she did testify that, after the conversations occurred, she and her husband decided to take the juvenile that evening to stay at his grandmother\u2019s house. The juvenile contends that testimony concerning the decision to send him to his grandmother\u2019s house violated the first complaint rule by impliedly revealing what Norma said to her mother before the decision was made. No statement by Norma can be reasonably inferred from the mother\u2019s actions because they took place after the mother had spoken to several people, not just to Norma. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cordle, supra. </em>Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arana, </em>453 Mass. 214, 227 n.21 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>c. <em>The nurse. </em>On the morning following the assault, Norma\u2019s parents took her to her pediatrician and then to Baystate Medical Center. At trial, the nurse testified that she examined Norma using a sexual assault kit; she also described in detail the various components of the kit and the samples that were taken as part of its administration. Contrary to the juvenile\u2019s contention, the nurse\u2019s testimony did not violate the first complaint rule, because it was not offered to corroborate Norma\u2019s complaint. Rather, the nurse\u2019s testimony merely described the steps she took in performing the sexual assault examination, and the test did not conclusively show that an assault had taken place. In these circumstances, the testimony was neither corroborative of any statement by Norma nor prejudicial to the juvenile. We do not understand <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stuckich, </em>450 Mass. 449, 456-457 (2008), to prohibit such testimony. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arana, </em>453 Mass, at 230-232.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">3. <em>Absence of interview videotape. </em>The day after the incident, a forensic interviewer conducted a multidisciplinary team (MIT) interview of Norma while a social worker, doctor, Department of Social Services worker, and police officer listened and observed from another room. Although the interview was not transcribed, recorded, or videotaped, several of the participants kept notes, which were produced in discovery to the juvenile. On appeal, the juvenile argues that Federal and State due process principles required the Commonwealth to videotape the MIT interview of Norma, and that it was error to deny his motion to dismiss. We disagree. Although we have acknowledged that the electronic recording of sexual abuse intervention network (SAIN) interviews (comparable to MIT interviews) is \u201cgood practice,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Upton U., </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 252, 255 (2003), neither we nor the Supreme Judicial Court has \u201crequired that such recordings be made.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>446 Mass. 563, 565 n.1 (2006). Moreover, the juvenile has neither argued nor shown any cognizable harm from the absence of a recording.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">4. <em>Inconsistent statements. </em>The trial judge did not abuse his discretion in excluding portions of the medical record in which the nurse recorded that Norma was unsure whether there had been penetration, whether the juvenile had ejaculated, whether the juvenile had caused her to bleed, or whether he had attacked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>her in the presence of others.

I respectfully dissent from so much of the opinion as concludes that the adjudications of delinquency by reason of indecent assault and battery on a child and assault with intent to rape a child are duplicative.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">The juvenile was indicted as a youthful offender for rape of a child with force (G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22A) and assault with intent to rape a child under the age of sixteen (G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 24B).

The jury found the juvenile guilty on the indictment charging assault with intent to rape a child under the age of sixteen.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The jury also found the juvenile \u201cdelinquent\u201d on the complaint charging indecent assault and battery on a child under the age of fourteen. The juvenile was adjudicated delinquent on all three convictions<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and was \u201ccommitted to the DYS\u201d (Department of Youth Services).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">With respect to the juvenile\u2019s delinquency adjudication by reason of assault and battery, the majority concludes that the offense, as described in the jury charge, constituted a lesser included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>offense of indecent assault and battery on a child and, therefore, if convictions of both offenses are to be upheld, they must be based on separate and distinct acts. I agree with the majority that because, as charged, the assault and battery was a lesser included offense, and the jury were not provided a separate and distinct act instruction, the adjudication of delinquency by reason of assault and battery must be vacated. See <em>ante </em>at 694-696.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">However, the same reasoning does not apply to the adjudication of delinquency by reason of indecent assault and battery on a child under the age of fourteen. As the majority acknowledges, indecent assault and battery on a child under the age of fourteen (G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B) and assault with intent to rape a child under the age of sixteen (G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 24B) are not cognate offenses,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as each requires proof of an element that the other does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">1. <em>Procedural context. </em>The juvenile argues, for the first time on appeal, that he was deprived of Federal constitutional and State common-law protection against double jeopardy because his delinquency adjudications were duplicative; specifically, that the adjudication of delinquency by reason of indecent assault and battery on a child under the age of fourteen was duplicative of the adjudication by reason of assault with intent to rape a child under the age of sixteen. Thus, according to the juvenile, the complaint on the lesser charge, indecent assault and battery on a child, must be dismissed. The juvenile bases this claim on the argument that the Commonwealth failed to identify separate factual grounds for the crimes, and the judge did not instruct the jury, sua sponte, that they had to find that each crime was supported by separate and distinct acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">The juvenile did not raise the issue of duplicative convictions at trial. The juvenile also did not request a jury instruction that the verdicts had to be based on separate and distinct acts and did not object to the lack of such an instruction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In the absence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>of an objection, we review to determine whether there is a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Freeman, 352 Mass. 556, 564 (1967). As this case raises the important issue whether proof of conduct is relevant to double jeopardy analysis (specifically, duplicative convictions), it is necessary to examine both Federal and State double jeopardy principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">2. <em>Double jeopardy analysis under the Federal framework. </em>The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that no one shall \u201cbe subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy . . . .\u201d The provision is applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Benton </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>395 U.S. 784, 794 (1969). The United States Supreme Court has interpreted the provision as prohibiting the imposition of multiple punishments for the same offense in a single proceeding. See <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 717 (1969). Compare <em>Blockburger </em>v. <em>United States, </em>284 U.S. 299 (1932), with <em>Morey </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>108 Mass. 433, 434 (1871).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">The Supreme Court has adopted the <em>Morey </em>test to determine what constitutes the same offense. See <em>Blockburger, supra </em>at 304, quoting from <em>Gavieres </em>v. <em>United States, 220 </em>U.S. 338, 342 (1911), quoting from <em>Morey </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>108 Mass, at 434:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-7\">\u201cA single act may be an offense against two statutes; and if each statute requires proof of an additional fact which the other does not, an acquittal or conviction under either statute does not exempt the defendant from prosecution and punishment under the other.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">While the language \u201cproof of an additional fact\u201d has been the source of some confusion for courts applying the <em>Blockburger </em>test, the Supreme Court has since explained that \u201c[t]he same-elements test, sometimes referred to as the <em>\u2018Blockburger\u2019 </em>test, inquires whether each offense contains an <em>element </em>not contained in the other\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dixon, </em>509 U.S. 688, 696 (1993). In <em>Dixon, </em>Justice Scalia, in a plurality opinion, expressly rejected a conduct-based approach for analyzing the meaning of \u201csame offence,\u201d criticizing the approach as inconsistent with Supreme Court precedent, \u201cwrong in principle,\u201d \u201cunstable in application,\u201d \u201ca continuing source of con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>fusion,\u201d and \u201ca mistake.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 709-711. Compare <em>Grady </em>v.

This reasoning is consistent with the proposition that the Legislature\u2019s freedom to define crimes and fix punishments is deeply rooted in our jurisprudence. See <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>432 U.S. 161, 165 (1977). The <em>Blockburger </em>test is thus a means of discerning legislative intent, or \u201ccongressional purpose.\u201d <em>Albernaz </em>v. <em>United States, supra. </em>See <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>United States, </em>445 U.S. 684, 693-694 (1980) (explaining that when the Legislature enacts statutes that contain different elements of proof, it may be inferred that the Legislature intended to authorize separate application of each statute). In contrast, when one statute contains all the elements of another, we may infer, absent a \u201cclear indication of contrary . . . intent,\u201d that the Legislature created a single offense for which multiple punishments are prohibited. <em>Id. </em>at 692-694. When the Legislature does explicitly authorize multiple punishments for the same conduct, these punishments are not violative of the Fifth Amendment even if they do not pass the <em>Blockburger </em>test. See <em>id. </em>at 695.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">3. <em>Double jeopardy analysis under the Massachusetts framework. </em>a. <em>Historical development. </em>Although not derived from the Declaration of Rights, Massachusetts has \u201clong recognized a State common-law and statutory prohibition against double jeopardy.\u201d <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>426 Mass. 534, 537 n.5 (1998). See <em>Thames </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>365 Mass. 477, 479 (1974). \u201cThe standard in Massachusetts for determining whether multiple convictions stemming from a single event are duplicative was first articulated over a century ago, in <em>Morey </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>108 Mass, [at] 434.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cabrera, </em>449 Mass. 825, 827 (2007). Under <em>Morey </em>and its progeny, \u201ca defendant may properly be punished for two crimes arising out of the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>course of conduct provided that each crime requires proof of an element that the other does not.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Valliere, </em>437 Mass. 366, 371 (2002). Thus, \u201c[i]n this analysis, \u2018[t]he actual criminal acts alleged are wholly irrelevant to the application of [the rule]; rather, the elements of the crimes charged are considered objectively, abstracted from the facts . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cabrera, </em>449 Mass, at 827, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>441 Mass. 73, 76 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Catania, </em>377 Mass. 186, 191 (1979), the Supreme Judicial Court, resting on the fact that the evidence presented at trial to support each of two statutory offenses was the same, concluded that one was a lesser included offense of the other, notwithstanding the fact that the two offenses contained discrete elements. The court later overruled the reasoning in <em>Catania, </em>stating that it was error to \u201clook[] beyond the required <em>elements </em>of the statutory offenses ... to the actual evidence introduced at the defendant\u2019s trial\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crocker, </em>384 Mass. 353, 359, 361 (1981). \u201cThe error in <em>Catania </em>was important; it demonstrated that a departure from the elements-based <em>Morey </em>test in favor of a judicial assessment of the evidence at a trial of multiple offenses (the so-called \u2018conduct-based\u2019 test) . . . \u2018runs the risk of unnecessary intrusion into the legislative prerogative to define crimes and fix punishments.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Oliveira, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 480, 484 (2002), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crocker, supra </em>at 359.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Perhaps the best explanation comes from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alvarez, </em>413 Mass. 224 (1992), in which the Supreme Judicial Court characterized the <em>Morey </em>rule as subservient to legislative intent. The court explained that the <em>Morey </em>rule</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-6\">\u201cis a principle of statutory construction designed to aid in the judicial interpretation of criminal statutes where the Legislature has not expressed an intent as to consecutive punishments.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 232. This view of <em>Morey </em>is consistent with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s view of <em>Blockburger. </em>As the <em>Morey </em>rule is merely a guide to statutory construction and a method of discerning legislative intent, it gives the judiciary no authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>to second-guess the Legislature or to reverse convictions of non-cognate offenses, even if the predicate conduct is unitary. See <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>United States, </em>445 U.S. at 692-695. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Oliveira, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. at 484-485. The framework can be summarized as follows: generally, convictions of two cognate offenses must be based on separate and distinct acts unless the Legislature has explicitly authorized cumulative punishments. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alvarez, </em>413 Mass, at 232. In contrast, under the <em>Morey </em>rule, convictions of two noncognate offenses are permitted, even where the convictions are based on a single predicate act. See <em>Morey, </em>108 Mass, at 434.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">b. <em>The </em>St. Pierre <em>line of cases. </em>In spite of the principles articulated in <em>Crocker, Alvarez, </em>and <em>Oliveira, </em>both this court and the Supreme Judicial Court have, at times, departed from that line of cases. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Valliere, </em>437 Mass, at 371; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>441 Mass, at 76; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cabrera, </em>449 Mass. 825 (2007); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morin, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 780 (2001). Rather than applying an elements-based test and focusing on legislative intent, we have issued decisions that succumbed to the <em>Catania </em>error by conducting a fact-based examination. In so doing, a line of cases has developed that is incompatible with the doctrinal principles of <em>Morey </em>and <em>Blockburger.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">The source of the misdirection in our case law as to double jeopardy principles appears to be dictum in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>St. Pierre, </em>377 Mass. 650 (1979). There, the court commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-7\">\u201cThis court recognized in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallarelli, </em>372 Mass. 573, 578-579 (1977), that the <em>[Morey] </em>rule could be manipulated by a prosecutor so as to harass and oppress. That was said in the context of successive prosecutions, but there may be an element of harassment in the use of multiple charges in the same prosecution when they open up a prospect of \u2018double\u2019 punishment for crimes not duplicative in a technical sense, but so closely related in fact as to constitute in substance but a single crime.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 662-663.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>While the <em>St. Pierre </em>court suggested, in dictum, that the <em>Morey </em>rule is not perfect, it never indicated that the rule should be changed. Nor did it indicate that a separate acts analysis is warranted. In warning that it might be possible for a prosecutor to circumvent the <em>Morey </em>rule when charging defendants, the court did not suggest that the existence of such a possibility justified adoption of a conduct-based analysis. Nowhere in <em>St. Pierre </em>did the court reason that a fact-based test could or should supersede a legal elements-based test. See <em>St. Pierre, </em>377 Mass, at 662-663.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>401 Mass. 109, 119-120 (1987), in its own dictum, was the first case in which the Supreme Judicial Court incorporated <em>St. Pierre\u2019s </em>dictum, by referring to it after determining, by an elements-based test, that the defendant\u2019s convictions of both indecent assault and battery and rape were duplicative because the former is a lesser included offense of the latter. It is important to note that the <em>Thomas </em>court applied the conduct-based analysis to cognate offenses, where one was typically a lesser included offense of the other, and offered no guidance as to how a conduct-based analysis should be conducted. Nor did the court discuss whether such an analysis would be proper when a defendant is convicted of two noncognate offenses.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The dictum in <em>Thomas, </em>joined with that of <em>St. Pierre, </em>created a detour.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">It is implausible that the Supreme Judicial Court intended to erode, through the casual use of language, our well-established and historic scheme for analyzing double jeopardy principles in the duplicative convictions context. After <em>Thomas, </em>cases began to appear which assumed that a conduct-based approach may be used to determine whether convictions are duplicative, even for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>noncognate offenses. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Valliere, 437 </em>Mass, at 371; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keohane, </em>444 Mass. 563, 574-575 (2005); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cabrera, </em>449 Mass, at 828; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morin, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. at 787.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallant, </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 409 (2006), we noted that \u201cit is difficult to see how such a conduct-based test could ever possibly mesh with the <em>Morey </em>standard\u201d and, further, that since the <em>Morey </em>rule <em>\u201conly </em>applies to situations in which two or more convictions arise out of precisely the same act, let alone acts \u2018closely related in fact,\u2019 \u201d a conduct-based analysis would render the <em>Morey </em>standard \u201cwholly superfluous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 414-415.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">In <em>Gallant, </em>we attempted to foreclose future misreliance on the <em>St. Pierre </em>dictum by stating the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-6\">\u201c[T]he Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s approach [to determining whether convictions are duplicative] appears to indicate that the <em>Morey </em>rule, with its strict focus on elements, <em>renders any conduct-based inquiry irrelevant', </em>that is to say, provided the <em>Morey </em>test is satisfied, no inquiry into a defendant\u2019s conduct is required. Such an interpretation conforms to the . . . admonition in <em>Jones'. </em>\u2018[In determining whether convictions are duplicative,] the elements of the crimes charged are considered objectively, abstracted from the facts.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-7\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallant, supra </em>at 415, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>441 Mass, at 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">I agree with the reasoning in <em>Gallant. </em>Cases such as <em>Valliere, Keohane, </em>and <em>Cabrera </em>suggest that a conduct-based inquiry is sometimes proper in cases where a defendant is convicted of two noncognate offenses. This suggestion, in itself, belies traditional double jeopardy principles. To perpetuate this trend seriously separates our jurisprudential principles from that of the Federal courts and the courts of the other States.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">4. <em>Indecent assault and battery on a child and assault with </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number><em>intent to rape a child. </em>\u201cIt is the prerogative of the Legislature, in the course of defining offenses and fixing punishments, and in furtherance of public policy goals, to punish related offenses separately.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cabrera, </em>449 Mass, at 828, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>441 Mass, at 75. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>382 Mass. 387, 394 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">The statutes defining the crimes at issue in this case fulfil different legislative policy goals. The crime of indecent assault and battery on a child under the age of fourteen reinforces the Legislature\u2019s (and, therefore, society\u2019s) goal that children not be molested in a sexual way and fulfils the policy goal of protecting against and punishing the actual indecent touching of a child. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Oliveira, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. at 486 (indecent assault and battery on a person over age fourteen). The charge of assault with intent to rape a child under the age of sixteen fulfils the policy goal of protecting against and punishing \u201cthe threat of a violent, unwanted invasion of a [child\u2019s] body.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486-487. Compare <em>id. </em>at 487 (\u201cEach of these crimes has distinct, independent importance, and we see no basis for the conclusion that the Legislature intended the courts to disregard an unwanted, indecent touching of the victim simply because, in one episode, the defendant also assaulted the same person, intending to rape her. The battery \u2014 the indecent touching which is not an element of [assault with intent to rape] \u2014 cannot be overlooked\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Thus, the omission of a charge on separate and distinct acts did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mamay, </em>407 Mass. 412, 418-419 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Black, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 477, 478-479 (2000). Accordingly, I would affirm the adjudications of delinquency by reason of both indecent assault and battery on a child and assault with intent to rape a child.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b740-10\">though the juvenile was charged as a youthful offender, the jury did not find that the offense involved the infliction or threat of serious bodily harm, and he was thus adjudicated a delinquent child.

See <em>Albernaz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>450 U.S. 333, 340 (1981). Whether a defendant\u2019s actions constitute separate and distinct acts or are part of a single episode is a question of fact for the jury. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maldonado, </em>429 Mass. 502, 509 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b745-9\">It is noteworthy that in <em>St. Pierre, </em>377 Mass, at 662-663, the Supreme Judicial Court did not cite authority for this dictum.

In <em>Gallarelli, </em>however, the court majority noted that, as opposed to <em>Morey\u2019s </em>\u201csame evidence\u201d rule, the \u201csame transaction\u201d rule does not have broad support among other States; the court further commented that it was not \u201cinclined as a matter of policy to modify [its] approval of the \u2018same evidence\u2019 rule as first clearly enunciated in <em>Morey.\u201d Gallarelli, supra </em>at 578.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b746-8\">furthermore, the reference to conduct-based analysis was not relevant to the <em>Thomas </em>court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant\u2019s convictions were duplicative.

Rather, the brief mention of <em>St. Pierre </em>reflects a common convention in appellate writing \u2014 that of employing a \u201cbelt and suspenders\u201d approach, by providing alternative grounds for the court\u2019s holding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b747-10\">A majority of States have adopted the <em>Blockburger </em>test.

See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>441 Mass, at 76, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>St. Pierre, </em>377 Mass, at 662-663 (defendant can be sentenced for violation of two noncognate criminal statutes \u201cunless it can be said with certainty that [the defendant\u2019s] actions were \u2018so closely related in fact as to constitute in substance but a single crime\u2019 \u201d). Although the actions shared a point in time, they were different in form and intent. By itself, a close temporal nexus between discrete acts does not automatically blend those acts into a single crime. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mamay, </em>407 Mass. 412, 418-419 (1990) (defendant\u2019s inserting his tongue into the victim\u2019s mouth constituted indecent assault and battery, while his tearing down her pants, together with anal and vaginal penetration, constituted \u201ctwo distinct acts of rape\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>445 Mass. 217, 225-226 (2005), cert, denied, 546 U.S. 1216 (2006) (scratching of the defendant\u2019s penis underlay the indecent assault and battery conviction, while licking of the defendant\u2019s penis underlay the rape conviction); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitzpatrick, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 1001, 1003 (1982) (affirming judgments as to both indecent assault and battery and rape, observing that \u201c[a]n indecent contact which is separate from and not incidental to the act of penetration does not merge with the crime of rape to constitute but a single offense any more than a second penetration of the same victim during the same criminal episode constitutes but one rape\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lord, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 265, 272-273 (2002) (separate convictions of assault and battery, assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, and indecent assault and battery affirmed where the defendant sprayed the victim with mace, threw her against a wall and battered her with his hands and feet, and then attempted to remove her underwear); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kopsala, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 387, 393 (2003) (convictions of rape and indecent assault and battery not duplicative where the evidence that the defendant \u201cpulled up the victim\u2019s shirt, exposing her breasts, unbuttoned her jeans and pulled them off, and removed her panties\u201d constituted a \u201cseparate and distinct act from the penetration\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnston, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 13, 22 (2003) (pulling the victim\u2019s hair constituted assault and battery, and was distinct from the act of rape). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morin, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. at 787-788 (defendant could not be sentenced on both assault with intent to rape and indecent assault and battery).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">Indeed, the possibility of duplicative convictions here is minimal in view of the evidence that three acts occurred: (1) the victim was pushed to the bed and buried her face in the bed; (2) her pants were taken down; and (3) the juvenile got on top of her and \u201chumpfed]\u201d her. Where the jury were properly instructed on the elements of each crime, the verdict slips reinforced the distinctions, and the jury found the juvenile not guilty of rape, the conviction of indecent assault and battery on a child is not duplicative of that of assault with intent to rape a child.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
