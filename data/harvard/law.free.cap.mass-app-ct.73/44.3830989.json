L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 l(r)(2), received by the employee, Steven Mike, from the computation of his average weekly wages pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(1), in determining his workers\u2019 compensation benefits under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-13\">The employee was injured in the course of his employment with Zebra Striping and Sealcoat Co., on July 30, 2005. He received temporary total incapacity workers\u2019 compensation benefits from the insurer from that date through October 4, 2005. The employee had been employed on a seasonal basis from 1992 through 2004 as a line stripe painter of highways and parking lots. He typically applied for, and received, unemployment benefits during the winter months. Before his injury, he was employed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>from April 1, 2004, to November 29, 2004, and then received unemployment benefits until resuming work in April, 2005. He sought to have the amount of unemployment benefits received during the one year prior to the date of his injury included in the calculation of his average weekly wages in determining the amount of his workers\u2019 compensation award.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">On November 22, 2006, an administrative judge denied the employee\u2019s request to include his unemployment benefits in computing his average weekly wages. On October 17, 2007, the reviewing board affirmed, ruling that long-standing principles do not permit unemployment benefits to be included as previous \u201cearnings\u201d of the injured employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">On appeal, the employee argues that G. L. c. 152 does not specifically exclude unemployment benefits as previous earnings and advances several arguments to support the proposition that such benefits ought to be considered earnings in computing his average weekly wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>Workers\u2019 compensation under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34, is based on the injured employee\u2019s average weekly wages prior to the injury. \u201cAverage weekly wages\u201d are defined in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(1), as appearing in St. 1943, c. 529, as the \u201cearnings of the injured employee during the period of twelve calendar months immediately preceding the date of injury, divided by fifty-two.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Here, because the employee\u2019s work was seasonal and because his injury occurred near the beginning of his work season, computing his average weekly wages over the period of the preceding twelve calendar months necessarily would result in lower average weekly wages if his unemployment benefits are excluded from the calculation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">The sections of the workers\u2019 compensation statutes in issue in this case do not refer to unemployment compensation. There is no Massachusetts appellate authority that directly addresses the question whether unemployment benefits should be included in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>the computation of average weekly wages under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(1), although as we discuss, <em>infra, </em>the reviewing board has previously considered the issue. Because both the workers\u2019 compensation and <em>the </em>unemployment compensation statutes have extensive histories, we look to that background to determine whether and how the two systems of benefits may intersect. As explained in a leading treatise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-5\">\u201cAlthough often a worker may be out of work in circumstances which would entitle him to benefits under the workers\u2019 compensation act and the employment security act [G. L. c. 151A], until the 1985 Reform Act there was no provision dealing with coordination of benefits in the workers\u2019 compensation act. Provisions in the employment security act were construed to bar compensation for the same period during which the claimant had received unemployment benefits.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Nason, Koziol &amp; Wall, Workers\u2019 Compensation \u00a7 18.27 at 98 (3d ed. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">In providing for the coordination of benefits between both systems in the 1985 Reform Act, the Legislature added c. 152, \u00a7 36B,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and also amended \u00a7 <em>25(d) of </em>the unemployment insurance law, G. L. c. 151 A.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is clear that the long-standing prohibition against the simultaneous receipt of unemployment benefits and workers\u2019 compensation benefits was explicitly set forth in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>both statutes and is subject only to a narrow exception not relevant here.* <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">We now turn to consideration of the computation of the employee\u2019s average weekly wages in conjunction with his seasonal employment and receipt of unemployment benefits. Our review takes place in the context of \u201cgrant[ing] substantial deference to the reviewing board\u2019s interpretation of G. L. c. 152.\u201d <em>McCarty\u2019s Case, </em>445 Mass. 361, 366-367 (2005). The reviewing board in this case observed that <em>Bunnell </em>v. <em>Wequasset Inn, </em>12 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rptr. 152, 155 (1998), \u201cprovides the foundation for the analysis of unemployment benefits paid during the off-season in this case.\u201d In <em>Bunnell, </em>the average weekly wages for a seasonally employed worker were determined not to include \u201coff season time,\u201d which was not \u201cwithin the employment relationship and therefore could not be \u2018time lost\u2019 from the employment,\u201d as required for a divisor of fewer than fifty-two weeks pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(1).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See note 1, <em>supra. </em>The reviewing board in <em>Bunnell </em>v. <em>Wequasset Inn, supra, </em>distinguished <em>Bartoni\u2019s Case, </em>225 Mass. 349, 352 (1916), where time was lost by the employee, a granite worker, because of inclement weather. The reviewing board concluded that the employee in <em>Bartoni\u2019s Case </em>\u201cmight have worked but was prevented,\u201d and the time lost was properly excluded, so that the average weekly wages were calculated as total wages received divided by the actual number of weeks worked, rather than fifty-two weeks. See <em>Herbst\u2019s Case, </em>416 Mass. 648, 650 (1993) (teacher\u2019s summer vacation period not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>\u201ctime lost\u201d because the teacher \u201cwas not prevented from working\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">The reviewing board\u2019s decision here was in the context that the employee was not entitled to a deduction for time lost where the off-season time was not part of the employment relationship and therefore was not time lost within the meaning of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(1). Instead, the time when the employee did not work was the result of the cyclical nature of the work, and the employee was free to seek other employment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">In this context, we consider the employee\u2019s assertion that because unemployment compensation is not expressly excluded from G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(1),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that compensation may be treated as earnings and should be included in the computation of his average weekly wages. There is no merit in the employee\u2019s attempt to analogize unemployment benefits to earnings. \u201cThe average weekly wages is throughout [c. 152] ascertainable only by reference to the wages actually paid at the expense of the industry at which the employee is working. Save in carefully specified exceptions, it is to be ascertained only by reference to the wages paid by the particular employer to the injured employee.\u201d <em>Gagnon\u2019s Case, </em>228 Mass. 334, 337 (1917). See <em>Borofsky\u2019s Case, </em>411 Mass. 379 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">The employee similarly asserts that unemployment benefits are closely analogous to wages and that he used those benefits as substitute earnings. The employee\u2019s characterizations do not change the fundamental nature of unemployment benefits. These benefits are provided under G. L. c. 151 A, a different statute with a different purpose from G. L. c. 152.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cOur workers\u2019 com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>pensation act explicitly states that \u2018[e]xcept as expressly provided elsewhere in this chapter, no savings or insurance of the injured employee <em>independent of this chapter </em>shall be considered in determining compensation payable thereunder, nor shall benefits derived from any other source than the insurer be considered in such determination\u2019 (emphasis supplied). G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 38.\u201d <em>Louis\u2019s Case, </em>424 Mass. 136, 141 n.7 (1997). Here, the unemployment insurance benefits are clearly \u201cbenefits\u201d paid from a different source.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">The reviewing board in the case before us noted that it had previously decided this issue in <em>Defelice </em>v. <em>Derbes Bros., Inc., </em>16 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rptr. 422, 424 (2002). We defer to and agree with its conclusion both in this case and in <em>Defelice </em>that unemployment benefits cannot be used in determining compensation under G. L. c. 152, because \u201calthough a form of \u2018substitute earnings,\u2019 they are simply not \u2018created\u2019 and \u2018contemplated\u2019 by G. L. c. 152.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Louis\u2019s Case, supra. </em>Moreover, the reviewing board in <em>Defelice </em>properly relied on the principle expressed in <em>Pierce\u2019s Case, </em>325 Mass. 649, 658 (1950): \u201cBoth [unemployment] benefits and [workers\u2019] compensation are charges on industry, but, with the exception covering specific injuries under c. 152, \u00a7 36, as amended, it was not intended that industry should be saddled with the double burden of paying benefits and compensation during the same period in which an employee is not earning wages.\u201d See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36B(1), at note 3, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Contrary to the employee\u2019s assertions, no ambiguity or doubt concerning the Legislature\u2019s intent exists in view of the clarity of the statutes construed according to their plain and ordinary meaning. <em>Taylor\u2019s Case, </em>44 Mass.
