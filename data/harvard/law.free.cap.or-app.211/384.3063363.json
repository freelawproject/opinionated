In exchange for the guilty pleas, the state and defendant agreed that the total determinate sentence imposed on defendant would be a 180-month term of incarceration. The parties appeared in corut and presented the agreement. The court agreed to be bound by the terms of the agreement. After the hearing, however, the court entered a judgment imposing a sentence of 206 months of imprisonment. Defendant twice filed motions to correct the judgment, and the court twice entered corrected judgments. Defendant appeals, arguing that neither of the corrected judgments imposes a 180-month term of imprisonment. The state concedes the error and agrees that the sentence should be vacated and that the case should be remanded for resentencing. We agree and accept the concession.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">Sentences vacated; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
