J.</author>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">In this dissolution of marriage action, husband has appealed from (1) a Limited Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage, (2) a General Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage and Money Judgments, and (3) a Corrected/Amended Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage and Money Judgments. On our own motion, we consider whether husband timely appealed from the limited judgment. ORS 19.255(1). We conclude that he did not and dismiss the appeal as to the limited judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">On July 12, 2006, the limited judgment, which dissolved the parties\u2019 marriage and decided other ancillary matters, was entered. No notice of appeal was filed within 30 days. On November 15, 2006, the general judgment, which determined child support, parenting time, and insurance matters, was entered. On December 7, 2006, the corrected/ amended judgment, which changed the amount of child support, was entered. On December 8, 2006, husband filed a notice of appeal stating that he was appealing all three judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">ORS 18.082(l)(c) provides that a judgment that has been entered in the register \u201c[m]ay be appealed in the manner provided by law[.]\u201d ORS 19.205(1) provides that \u201c[ujnless otherwise provided by law, a limited judgment * * * may be appealed as provided in this chapter.\u201d Finally, ORS 19.255(1) provides that the notice of appeal must be served and filed within 30 days after the judgment is entered in the register.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">The question in this case is whether the limited judgment was appealable. If the limited judgment was appealable, then husband\u2019s appeal of that judgment is untimely, because ORS 19.255(1) requires that the appellant serve and file a notice of appeal within 30 days of entry of the judgment, and there is no question that husband failed to meet that statutory deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">A judgment is the concluding decision of the court \u201con one or more requests for relief in one or more actions, as reflected\u201d in the written judgment. ORS 18.005(8). In turn, ORS 18.005(16) defines a \u201crequest for relief,\u201d in part, as \u201ca claim * * * or any other request for a determination of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>rights and liabilities of one or more parties in an action that a legal authority allows the court to decide * *</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">In <em>Bogart and Bogart, </em>104 Or App 325, 801 P2d 849 (1990), we considered whether a document that only awarded permanent custody of the parties\u2019 children, but did not dissolve the parties\u2019 marriage, was appealable. We held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-5\">\u201c[t]he relief sought in a dissolution case is dissolution of the marriage. The various issues enumerated in ORS 107.105 are not distinct, separate claims. Until dissolution is adjudged, the court\u2019s decisions respecting those issues are interlocutory and cannot be made separately appealable under ORCP 67B [(1989)].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 328.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">Here, by contrast, the limited judgment dissolved the parties\u2019 marriage. That was the \u201crequest for relief\u2019 requested in the petition for dissolution of marriage. The fact that there remained important ancillary matters for resolution did not preclude the entry of a judgment that dissolved the parties\u2019 marriage. Oregon law allows bifurcation of other issues. ORCP 53 B allows the trial court to bifurcate issues. ORS 107.105(1) allows the trial court to determine custody prior to deciding other issues. The judgment was appealable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> No appeal was filed within the time limits provided in ORS 19.255(1). The December 8, 2006, notice of appeal from the July 12, 2006, limited judgment was therefore untimely.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">Appeal dismissed as to limited judgment entered on July 12, 2006; appeal to proceed as to judgments entered on November 15 and December 7, 2006.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b762-9\"> We do not reach the issue of whether any ancillary matters addressed in the limited judgment were properly reviewable only in an appeal from that judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b762-10\"> The limited judgment was mislabeled in that a limited judgment is one that is entered before the entry of a general judgment and that resolves one, but fewer than all, requests for relief. ORS 18.005(13)(d). As discussed above, the limited judgment resolved the \u201crequest for relief\u2019 \u2014 dissolution of the parties\u2019 marriage. A general judgment should have been entered because a general judgment decides all requests for relief, subject to certain exceptions. ORS 18.005(7). However, the mislabeling of a judgment does not mean that the mislabeled judgment is not appeal-able. <em>See Galfano v. KTVL-TV, </em>196 Or App 425, 438, 102 P3d 766 (2004) (a judgment is appealable if it satisfies the definition of a judgment in ORS 18.005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
