He argues that the trial court erred in concluding that he was not in \u201cfear of imminent bodily injury\u201d and that FAPA does not provide relief for his and respondent\u2019s son. On <em>de novo </em>review, <em>Rosiles-Flores v. Browning, </em>208 Or App 600, 602, 145 P3d 328 (2006), we find that petitioner has shown, by a preponderance of the evidence, that respondent has placed petitioner in fear of imminent bodily injury and that petitioner is in imminent danger of further abuse.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We therefore reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Petitioner and respondent were married in 2000. The parties and their five-year-old son live in the same household. On one occasion in 2006, petitioner planned to have dinner at a restaurant with respondent. When petitioner arrived at the restaurant, he knew that respondent had been drinking by the \u201clook on her face.\u201d Petitioner asked respondent not to drink any more, which upset her. Respondent grabbed their son and drove away from the restaurant. When petitioner returned home, respondent started to yell and scream at him. Petitioner reiterated that he wanted respondent to stop drinking. Petitioner then noticed some empty wine bottles in the trash. When he retrieved them, respondent became more upset and began to kick and punch petitioner to provoke a fight. Petitioner testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-6\">\u201c[PETITIONER]: [S]he then started doing the kicking and hitting routine with me, which she\u2019s done in the past, and provoking a fight with me. And I just gathered my things and left the house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-8\">\u201c[PETITIONER\u2019S COUNSEL]: Did any of her blows with fists or feet hit you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-9\">\u201c[PETITIONER]: Well, I just block them. * * * [She hits] me, but I would block them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-10\">Petitioner then gathered his things and left.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>The day after the 2006 incident, petitioner filed a petition for a FAPA restraining order, which alleged that, within the preceding 180 days, respondent had attempted to cause him bodily injury by hurting or threatening him with punches and kicks. Petitioner also alleged that he was in imminent danger of further abuse by respondent, that she was a threat to the physical safety of their son because respondent drank and drove with their son, and that she used abusive language while on the phone in their son\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">The trial court issued an <em>ex parte </em>restraining order, and respondent requested a hearing. Petitioner was the only witness to testify. At the hearing, petitioner testified that respondent\u2019s drinking was a recurring problem. Additionally, petitioner was afraid for their son\u2019s safety when respondent drank and drove with their son in the car. Those problems prompted petitioner to file a petition for a dissolution of marriage in 2005. A custody hearing was scheduled, but petitioner withdrew his motion for a hearing regarding respondent\u2019s drinking because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-5\">\u201cShe basically had told me that she would stop drinking and would curb her behavior as far as being \u2014 getting upset as much. And it just \u2014 that lasted for about two weeks, and then it was just back to the same old thing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Petitioner believed that, due to respondent\u2019s history of drinking, \u201cthings [were] just going to get worse at home for [him] and [his] son.\u201d In particular, he had concerns about their safety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-7\">\u201c[PETITIONER]: We have always had this kind of relationship where when she does start drinking it just \u2014 things just automatically get out of control. And the way that I\u2019ve handled it is I just grab a few things and leave; or if she calls me at work and I know that she\u2019s been drinking I just won\u2019t go home until after she goes to bed. * * * And that\u2019s the way I\u2019ve been doing that * ** for a long time, at least two or three years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-8\">\u201c[PETITIONER\u2019S COUNSEL]: Can you do that anymore?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_u\">\u201c[PETITIONER]: No, I can\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-9\">\u201c [PETITIONER\u2019S COUNSEL]: Why is that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>\u201c[PETITIONER]: I\u2019m really afraid of what\u2019s going to happen with [our son]. To this point, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s not uncommon for her to jump in the car and go somewhere. And I know that if I\u2019m not there and she\u2019s been drinking she\u2019ll jump in the car with [our son] and go maybe to get some more wine, I don\u2019t know. Or, you know, * * * she\u2019ll get in the car and leave somewhere with [our son] * * * when she\u2019s been drinking.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">Petitioner testified that respondent had previously sought alcohol treatment for about a month. However, after about two years of sobriety, respondent started drinking again when taking pain medication. Petitioner also stated that, prior to the 2006 incident, she had punched and kicked him, and had given him a black eye.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">After the close of petitioner\u2019s case, the court questioned petitioner\u2019s counsel about the requirements of a FAPA restraining order, emphasizing petitioner\u2019s lack of fear of respondent and the abuse:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: What I\u2019m trying to do is see how * * * this can work under this statute. * * * So, that\u2019s what I\u2019m asking you to tell me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-7\">\u201c[PETITIONER\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Under [the FAPA petition, the question was:] How did she hurt or threaten you? [Petitioner answered:] \u2018Punches and kicking.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: And what he said was, T just block it. She\u2019s done it for a long time.\u2019 It\u2019s clear he\u2019s not afraid of that. His testimony is just clear on that. And so * * * it would take me finding that her kicking or hitting at him placed him in fear of imminent bodily danger for me to uphold the restraining order; * * * is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-9\">\u201c[PETITIONER\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: * * * The allegation is, \u2018She hits and kicks at me, I just block it. She\u2019s done that for a long time. I just avoid it.\u2019 No fear there. No fear of imminent bodily injury on [petitioner\u2019s] part. It\u2019s not good conduct, but * * * [it] doesn\u2019t bring it within the statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-12\">After ruling that petitioner had failed to produce sufficient evidence to sustain the restraining order under ORS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>107.705, the court also stated that respondent\u2019s drinking and driving with their son was not an independent basis for continuing the FAPA restraining order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-4\">\u201c[THE COURT:] If she does drink and drive with [their son] in the car that\u2019s a serious problem, but it\u2019s not a basis either for a restraining order under the statute.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">The court dismissed petitioner\u2019s FAPA restraining order. On appeal, petitioner challenges the court\u2019s determinations that, under the totality of the circumstances, petitioner was not in \u201cfear\u201d of imminent bodily injury. Petitioner also assigns as error the court\u2019s subsequent dismissal of the FAPA restraining order.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We agree with petitioner that the trial court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">A court may issue a FAPA restraining order when the petitioner</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-7\">\u201c[(1)] has been the victim of abuse committed by the respondent within 180 days preceding the filing of the petition, that [(2)] there is an imminent danger of further abuse to the petitioner and that [(3)] the respondent represents a credible threat to the physical safety of the petitioner or the petitioner\u2019s child * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">ORS 107.718(1). A petitioner must meet each of those requirements to obtain a FAPA restraining order. We begin by determining whether petitioner is a \u201cvictim of abuse.\u201d \u201cAbuse\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-9\">\u201c(1) * * * the occurrence of one or more of the following acts between family and household members:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-10\">\u201c(a) Attempting to cause or intentionally, knowingly or recklessly causing bodily injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-11\">\u201c(b) <em>Intentionally, knowingly or recklessly placing another in fear of imminent bodily injury.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>\u201c(c) Causing another to engage in involuntary sexual relations by force or threat of force.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">ORS 107.705(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Establishing \u201cfear of imminent bodily injur/\u2019 does not require overt threats, <em>Lefebvre v. Lefebvre, </em>165 Or App 297, 301-02, 996 P2d 518 (2000); behavior that is \u201cerratic, intrusive, volatile and persistent conduct\u201d combined with an \u201cobsess [ion] with the idea of killing another person\u201d may place a petitioner in \u201cfear of imminent serious bodily injury and immediate danger of further abuse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nor does the statute require a subjective component to prove the existence of a petitioner\u2019s fear. <em>See Cottongim v. Woods, </em>145 Or App 40, 45, 928 P2d 361 (1996) (conduct that \u201cdeviated considerably from that which a reasonable person would exhibit under similar circumstances\u201d constituted abuse when \u201ca reasonable person faced with such behavior would be placed in fear of imminent serious bodily harm\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">To determine whether \u201cfear of imminent bodily injur/\u2019 has been established also requires an examination of the totality of the circumstances. For example, in <em>Cottongim, </em>we upheld the issuance of a FAPA restraining order based on the respondent\u2019s verbal and physical abuse of the petitioner. 145 Or App at 44. During the relationship, the respondent was verbally abusive to the petitioner when the respondent consumed alcohol. After their \u201cbreak up,\u201d the respondent caused the petitioner bodily injury \u201cwhen he entered her home against her expressed wishes, sat next to her on a couch, held her down so hard she could not move away, tried to kiss her and left bruises on her arms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The respondent called the petitioner repeatedly and told her that \u201che could not live without her[,]\u201d would \u201cdo anything he could to make [her] life hell\u201d and wished her \u201ca long, slow painful death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). We upheld the FAPA restraining order on those facts, finding that they provided \u201ca more-than-sufficient basis for [the petitioner\u2019s] allegation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>that [the respondent] had intentionally, knowingly or recklessly placed her in fear of imminent serious bodily injury\u201d and that there was \u201can immediate and present danger of further abuse [.]\u201d 145 Or App at 45 (internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">Here, direct physical abuse in the home establishes petitioner\u2019s fear of imminent bodily injury, especially when the abuse continues to coincide with respondent\u2019s alcohol consumption. The 2006 incident and respondent\u2019s past abuse of striking petitioner sufficiently to cause a black eye meet the thresholds articulated in <em>Cottongim </em>and <em>Lefebvre </em>by providing a \u201cmore-than-sufficient basis\u201d for \u201cintentionally, knowingly or recklessly\u201d placing petitioner in \u201cfear of imminent bodily injury.\u201d The .fact that petitioner \u201cblocked\u201d the physical attacks or decided to leave the home when respondent was under the influence of alcohol does not in any way negate his fear.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Respondent\u2019s abusive behavior continues to correlate with her alcohol consumption, and she has not been able to successfully control that behavior. Under the totality of these circumstances, we find that respondent placed petitioner in fear of imminent bodily injury and that petitioner is a \u201cvictim of abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">Next, under ORS 107.718(1), petitioner must show that he is in imminent danger of further abuse. An overt threat of physical violence is not required to support such a finding. <em>See Lefebvre, </em>165 Or App at 301. To make such a finding, a trial court may consider testimony regarding events outside the 180-day window to satisfy ORS 107.718(1). <em>Lefebvre, </em>165 Or App at 303. The record before us reflects a continuing pattern of respondent\u2019s abusive behavior. As long as he resides with respondent, petitioner faces the choice of returning home to verbal and physical abuse or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>avoiding such circumstances. Here, the pattern of direct and ongoing physical abuse meets the benchmarks of <em>Cottongim </em>and <em>Lefebvre. </em>Petitioner is in imminent danger of further abuse by respondent. <em>Cf. Roshto v. McVein, </em>207 Or App 700, 704-05, 143 P3d 241 (2006) (petitioner failed to establish imminent danger of further abuse or credible threat to petitioner\u2019s safety).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">We find that petitioner has met the requirements set out in ORS 107.718(1) to support issuance of a FAPA restraining order. Petitioner has established that (1) he is a victim of abuse as defined in ORS 107.705(l)(b); (2) there is an imminent danger of future abuse by respondent; and (3) respondent represents a credible threat to his physical safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Reversed and remanded for reinstatement of restraining order.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b746-11\"> Petitioner also assigns error to the trial court\u2019s decision that FAPA does not reach a concern about the physical safety of the parties\u2019 child. Because we agree with petitioner\u2019s other assignment of error, we do not consider this assignment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b749-12\"> The trial court found petitioner\u2019s testimony credible and we defer to that determination. <em>See Kempke and Kempke, </em>151 Or App 434, 440, 949 P2d 1239 (1997) (deferring to the trial court\u2019s assessment of credibility in the absence of reason to do otherwise).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b749-13\"> In the FAPA petition, petitioner alleged that respondent \u201cattempted to cause [petitioner] bodily injury.\u201d However, during the FAPA hearing and on appeal, petitioner has presented the issue of whether respondent placed him in fear of imminent bodily injury and that is the issue we address here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b750-7\"> Neither the trial court nor either party questioned whether (1) petitioner was a family or household member, (2) respondent committed the abuse, or (3) the abuse occurred within 180 days of filing of the petition. Accordingly, those facts are not at issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b751-7\"> ORS 107.705(l)(b)was amended by Oregon Laws 1999, chapter 1052, section 12(l)(b), to change the phrase \"serious bodily injury\u201d to simply \u201cbodily injury.\u201d The same amendment also changed the requirement of \u201cimmediate and present danger of further abuse\u201d to require \u201cimminent danger of further abuse\u201d in ORS 107.718(1). Or Laws 1999, ch 1052, \u00a7 9(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b751-8\"><em> See </em>ORS 107.710(3) (stating, in part, that the right to relief under PAPA \u201cshall not be affected by the fact that the person left the residence or household to avoid abuse\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b752-6\"> The initial restraining order provided that respondent was restrained from interfering with the parties\u2019 child. No issue regarding child custody was raised at the hearing, <em>see </em>ORS 107.710(5). Therefore, the issue of child custody is not an issue on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
