On the convictions for assaulting a public safety officer, the court imposed concurrent durational departure sentences of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment, based on its own findings that defendant had been persistently involved in similar offenses, was not a probationary candidate, and had exhibited a \u201cdeep contempt for legal authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">On appeal, defendant makes several assignments of error related to his convictions, all of which we reject without discussion. With respect to his sentencing, defendant argues that the departure sentences violated his rights under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution based on the principles articulated in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 US 296, 124 S Ct 2531, 159 L Ed 2d 403 (2004), because the sentences were based on facts that were not admitted by defendant or found by a jury. Although defendant did not advance such a challenge below, he argues that the sentences should be reviewed as plain error. The state concedes that under <em>State v. Ramirez, </em>205 Or App 113, 133 P3d 343, <em>adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>207 Or App 1, 139 P3d 981 (2006), <em>rev allowed, </em>342 Or 256 (2007), defendant\u2019s sentencing was plainly erroneous. We agree and accept the concession.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Sentences vacated; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
