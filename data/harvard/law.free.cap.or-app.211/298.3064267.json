J.</author>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Defendants, a driver (Guinto) and his passenger (Ry), appeal their convictions for delivery of a controlled substance, <em>former </em>ORS 475.992 (2003), <em>renumbered as </em>ORS 475.840 (2005), challenging the trial court\u2019s denial of their motions to suppress evidence discovered during a search following a traffic stop. Or Const, Art I, \u00a7 9; US Const, Amend IV. They contend that the search was unlawful because the predicate consent to search was not voluntary. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">In reviewing a denial of a motion to suppress, we are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical facts as long as there is constitutionally sufficient evidence in the record to support those findings. <em>State v. Ehly, </em>317 Or 66, 74-75, 854 P2d 421 (1993). For purposes of Oregon constitutional analysis, whether consent to a search was voluntary is a conclusion of law rather than a question of fact. <em>State v. Stevens, </em>311 Or 119, 135, 806 P2d 92 (1991). \u201cIn analyzing whether consent to a search is voluntary, the relevant inquiry is whether, under the totality of the circumstances, the consent was the product of the defendant\u2019s free will or, conversely, was the result of express or implied coercion.\u201d <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Stephens, </em>175 Or App 220, 225, 27 P3d 170 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">We summarize the facts as found by the trial court and as supported by evidence in the record.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On the morning of June 29, 2004, Trooper Bennett of the Oregon State Police stopped a car traveling on Interstate 5 near Roseburg for exceeding the speed limit. Defendant Guinto was the driver; defendant Ry was the only passenger. As he approached the car on the passenger side, Bennett noted that Ry\u2019s seat belt was not positioned properly. Bennett spoke with Guinto about exceeding the speed limit and with Ry about the seat belt violation. Bennett asked Ry for his identification twice, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>and Ry produced identification after asking why he needed to show it. Bennett inquired about who owned the car, but the name given by defendants did not match the name on the car\u2019s registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">Bennett noted that both defendants appeared nervous and, particularly, that Ry was shaking and his pulse was visible in his neck. Based on defendants\u2019 nervousness, their inability to satisfactorily identify the car\u2019s owner, and Ry\u2019s hesitancy in providing his identification, Bennett became suspicious that defendants were involved in criminal activity and became concerned that they had a weapon in the car. Over the course of approximately one minute, as shown on the videotape of the stop, 211 Or App at 300 n 2, Bennett made the following statements to defendants as he stood beside the passenger door of the car:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-5\">\u201cDo you have any weapons in the vehicle? I\u2019d like to search your vehicle for weapons. Will you give me permission to search your vehicle for weapons? I want to search your vehicle. I know, I\u2019d like to search it though. I\u2019d, you\u2019re extremely nervous, his heartbeat\u2019s visible in the back of his throat, and you\u2019re making me suspicious that you have weapons. That\u2019s why I\u2019d like to check your vehicle \u2014 search your vehicle for weapons. Do you have a weapon in the vehicle? Okay, I\u2019d like to search it. Okay? So I\u2019d like you to step out if you would please and let me search your vehicle for a weapon. What do you have in the vehicle? Okay, what kind of luggage do you have? Okay, don\u2019t be reaching around too much, alright? Okay, so do you have a weapon in the vehicle? You need to tell me if you do. Okay, well, I\u2019d like to search it for a weapon, all right? Well, I\u2019d like to search it for a weapon to make sure you don\u2019t have a weapon in the vehicle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">Although the videotape of the incident did not record with clarity defendants\u2019 statements to Bennett during that time, Bennett testified at the suppression hearing that Guinto said multiple times in response to Bennett\u2019s inquiries about weapons, \u201cI told you there wasn\u2019t a gun\u201d or \u201cI told you we don\u2019t have any.\u201d After making the statements quoted above, Bennett radioed, in code, for a backup officer. At virtually the same time as Bennett was using his radio to call in the backup request, Guinto consented to a search of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>Bennett had defendants get out of the car, then frisked them for weapons but found none. After the backup officer arrived, Bennett searched the passenger compartment of the car but found nothing suspicious. He then asked Guinto to open the trunk of the car, which Guinto did. Bennett asked questions of defendants about several articles in the trunk, then removed a bag, asking, \u201cWhose is this? Will you open it for me please? What do you have in there? Can you show me please?\u201d Guinto then opened the bag, and Bennett reached into the bag and examined its contents. Bennett then removed a second bag, again asked to whom it belonged, and, when Ry responded that it was his, Bennett asked Ry to open it for him. Ry did so, and Bennett examined its contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Bennett then reached for a third bag and asked to whom it belonged. Ry identified the bag as his. As Bennett picked up the third bag, he felt that it was heavy and smelled strongly of marijuana. Bennett immediately arrested both defendants. Further examination of the third bag revealed approximately five pounds of marijuana. The trun k of the car also contained more than $50,000 in cash.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Before trial, both defendants sought to suppress the evidence found in the trunk of the car, contending, as pertinent here, that the consent to search the car was not given voluntarily. Defendants contend, particularly, that Bennett\u2019s repeated \u201cdemands\u201d to search the vehicle for weapons notwithstanding defendants\u2019 \u201crefusal\u201d were so persistent, aggressive, and ultimately coercive as to render Guinto\u2019s consent at most mere \u201cacquiescence\u201d to Bennett\u2019s manifest determination to search. Bennett, in defendants\u2019 view, simply was not going to take \u201cno\u201d for an answer. Defendants further contend that the opening of the car trunk, with the consequent \u201cplain smell\u201d observation as Bennett lifted the third bag, was the unattenuated product of Guinto\u2019s alleged involuntary consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>The trial court denied the motion. With respect to the interchange between Bennett and defendants that culminated in Guinto\u2019s consent, the court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-4\">\u201cTrooper Bennett asked if there were weapons in the vehicle, and asked for permission to search the vehicle. Mr. Guinto responded that they did not have any weapons. The same general question and answer were repeated several times, and the driver then appeared to comply with the request to search. Mr. Ry began to reach for his right ankle, and was told to not reach around. Trooper Bennett again asked for consent to search for a weapon and Mr. Guinto responded that they did not have one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-6\">\u201cTrooper Bennett radioed in code for a backup officer, and very shortly after, Mr. Guinto spontaneously told Trooper Bennett that he could search the vehicle. Trooper Bennett confirmed this, and then asked them to step out.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">The court\u2019s conclusion as to consent was unadorned: \u201cStanley Guinto voluntarily consented to a search of the vehicle.\u201d Thereafter, both defendants entered conditional guilty pleas pursuant to ORS 135.335(3), thus reserving their rights to appeal the denial of their suppression motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">On appeal, defendants reiterate their arguments, invoking both Article I, section 9, and the Fourth Amendment. They assert that, because of Bennett\u2019s persistence in seeking permission to search the car, by asking to search nine times in a little over one minute, Guinto\u2019s consent to the search was not given voluntarily. Defendants further assert that the consent in this case was not the product of free will because Guinto \u201cconsented only after the trooper refused to honor\u201d repeated refusals of consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">The state counters that Guinto\u2019s consent to search the car was voluntary. The state contends, principally, that Bennett \u201crequested\u201d \u2014 rather than demanded \u2014 consent, that his tone remained \u201cconversational\u201d throughout, and that his multiple \u201crequests\u201d were necessitated both by Guinto\u2019s non-responsiveness and by defendants\u2019 movements that contributed to Bennett\u2019s concerns about whether there was a weapon in the car.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>As noted above, the standard for analyzing voluntariness of consent under Article I, section 9, is whether, \u201cunder the totality of the circumstances, the consent was the product of the defendant\u2019s free will or, conversely, was the result of express or implied coercion.\u201d <em>Stephens, </em>175 Or App at 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">As an initial matter, we reject defendants\u2019 characterization of the encounter as involving \u201crepeated refusals\u201d of consent to search. When viewed consistently with the standard prescribed in <em>Ball v. Gladden, </em>250 Or 485, 487, 443 P2d 621 (1968), the record demonstrates that, although Guinto answered Bennett\u2019s questions concerning whether a weapon was in the car by repeatedly denying that a weapon was in the car, Guinto never specifically answered Bennett\u2019s repeated requests for permission to search the car until after the final request \u2014 at which point Guinto consented. Thus, contrary to defendants\u2019 premise, we must assume that defendants, and Guinto particularly, never explicitly refused to consent in response to Bennett\u2019s requests. Rather, under the controlling standard of review, the record shows only that Bennett repeatedly sought consent to search the car for weapons, despite the driver\u2019s, Guinto\u2019s, repeated statements that there were no weapons in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Defendants primarily invoke <em>State v. Freund, </em>102 Or App 647, 796 P2d 656 (1990), for the proposition that, in the totality of the circumstances, Bennett\u2019s persistent efforts to obtain consent to search were impermissibly coercive. In <em>Freund, </em>police officers, who had received an anonymous tip that the defendant was growing marijuana, approached the defendant, who was standing outside of her home. One officer, Hepp, told the defendant that the officers were there \u201c \u2018to pick up the marijuana plants that she was growing.\u2019 \u201d 102 Or App at 649. When the defendant did not respond, Hepp repeated that he was there to pick up the marijuana plants and that he \u201c \u2018wanted to do it as calmly [and] efficiently as possible.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(brackets in original). The defendant then told the officers where the plants were located, and Hepp asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>her \u201c \u2018if she would take us to them to show us where they were and she agreed [.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, and we reversed. In so holding, we concluded that the consent was not voluntarily given:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-5\">\u201cHepp\u2019s initial statement cannot be characterized as a request for consent. The officer stated that \u2018he was there\u2019 to pick up the marijuana and he wanted\u2019 to do it calmly. <em>The words used in the first phrase are unconditional; they do not invite a response other than acquiescence. </em>In contrast, the words in the second phrase are supplicatory and do invite a response. <em>Read together, the officer\u2019s statement told defendant that she had no choice whether a search would occur; her only option was whether the search and seizure was to be \u2018calm and efficient.\u2019 \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 652 (emphasis added). We further held that the \u201cdefendant\u2019s acquiescence in Hepp\u2019s request that she show them where the plants were did not constitute a voluntary consent, given the events that preceded it. Hepp did not ask, \u2018May we search?\u2019 but Will you show us?\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. See also State v. Will, </em>131 Or App 498, 506, 885 P2d 715 (1994) (following <em>Freund, </em>holding that the defendant\u2019s mother\u2019s failure to object to officer\u2019s reentry into premises, after the officer \u201cinformed her that * * * he would be seizing the narcotic paraphernalia,\u201d was mere \u201cacquiescence\u201d that \u201ccannot be held to be voluntary consent\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Defendants contend that the situation here was analogous to that in <em>Freund. </em>In a very brief time \u2014 roughly a minute \u2014 Bennett repeatedly expressed his desire to search the car for weapons and sought to obtain defendants\u2019 consent to do so. Seven times Bennett told defendants either that he would \u201clike to\u201d or \u201cwant[ed] to\u201d search the car. Once Bennett explicitly asked defendants if they \u201cwould give me permission to search your vehicle.\u201d Once, in the midst of the exchange, Bennett\u2019s phrasing became directive: \u201cI\u2019d like you to step out if you would please and let me search your vehicle for a weapon\u201d \u2014 but then he immediately returned (twice) to his \u201cI\u2019d like to search\u201d phrasing.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Defendants suggest that at least one of Bennett\u2019s statements \u2014 \u201cI\u2019d like you to step out,\u201d etc. \u2014 was so imperative in context that it did \u201cnot invite a response other than acquiescence.\u201d <em>Freund, </em>102 Or App at 652. Further, and more broadly, defendants contend that, even if Bennett\u2019s words are viewed simply as requests for consent to search, such persistent and insistent repetition of those requests over such a short period of time rendered the consent involuntary because a reasonable person in defendants\u2019 position would have understood that he or she \u201chad no choice whether a search would occur,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u2014 the only question was how it would occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\"><em>Freund </em>is materially distinguishable. In <em>Freund </em>(and <em>Will), </em>officers baldly and unconditionally announced their intent to seize items. There was no effort to request, and obtain, consent. Here, by contrast, Bennett did seek consent to search the car. Although most of the requests were not framed as questions, Bennett\u2019s <em>phrasing </em>\u2014 e.g., <em>\u201cI\u2019d like </em>to search it\u201d (emphasis added) \u2014 expressed both his desire to receive consent to search the vehicle and his understanding that he would not, and could not, search without consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">There is, in ordinary social intercourse, a world of difference between saying \u201cI\u2019d like to come in,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m coming in.\u201d Ultimately, that is the difference between this case and Freund.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">To be sure, in one instance during the colloquy, Bennett briefly crossed over the line into the imperative: \u201cSo I\u2019d like you to step out if you would please and let me search your vehicle for a weapon.\u201d In isolation \u2014 and notwithstanding the qualifying \u201cif you would please\u201d \u2014 that statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>could reasonably be understood as a command. However, in context, it was preceded by a request to search the car and was followed by a question about the luggage in the car and then two final \u201cI\u2019d like to search\u201d requests. Further, and significantly, defendants did not respond to Bennett\u2019s statement by getting out of the car \u2014 that is, they did not \u201cacquiesce\u201d at that point. Rather, it was only after Bennett radioed to summon backup that Guinto consented to a search of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">Defendants contend, in related fashion, that Guinto\u2019s consent was coerced unlawfully because the sheer repetition of Bennett\u2019s request made it apparent that \u201cthis particular trooper did not intend to relent with his request or release the car or the defendants until the trooper had searched the car to his satisfaction.\u201d Certainly, Bennett showed dogged persistence in trying to obtain consent, and his testimony shows that he intended to remain at the door of the vehicle until defendants consented to a search or a backup officer arrived. Thus, the consent to search was obtained at a time when defendants were not free to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">That, however, is hardly dispositive of the voluntariness of consent, given that consent was obtained during the course of a <em>lawful </em>stop.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., State v. Charlesworth/Parks, </em>151 Or App 100, 114, 951 P2d 153 (1997), <em>rev den, </em>327 Or 82 (1998); <em>State v. White, </em>130 Or App 289, 291, 881 P2d 169 (1994). In <em>Charlesworth/Parks, </em>we reversed a trial court\u2019s determination that the defendant\u2019s consent had been involuntary. There, the defendant consented to a search of his car after his car had been lawfully blocked in by a police car and he had been ordered from the car at gunpoint and handcuffed. In holding that the consent to search was voluntary, we noted that the defendant \u201chad had considerable experience with the criminal justice system\u201d and that \u201che knew he had the right to refuse to consent to the search.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Similarly, in <em>White, </em>at the time that the defendant consented to search, he had been lawfully detained, asked to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>step out of his car, and handcuffed. We agreed with the state that the consent was voluntary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-4\">\u201cDefendant was confronted by one officer on a public street. No weapons were displayed during the encounter, and there was no testimony that the officer threatened defendant or used physical force in any way. The trial court found that the entire contact was low-key and without hostility, and there is evidence to support that finding. The fact that defendant was in handcuffs when he consented does not render the consent involuntary <em>per se. </em>There is nothing in the record to indicate that the officer intimidated or coerced defendant into consenting in any way.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 293 (citation omitted). <em>See also State v. Bea, </em>318 Or 220, 230, 864 P2d 854 (1993) (consent given after the defendant had been lawfully arrested and handcuffed was voluntary, where encounter was in daylight hours on a public street, no weapons were displayed, and there was no use of physical force against the defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Here, the circumstances, when viewed in their totality, were considerably less \u201ccoercive\u201d than those in <em>Charlesworth/Parks </em>(where weapons were displayed and the defendant was in handcuffs), <em>White </em>(where the defendant was in handcuffs), and <em>Bea </em>(where the defendant was handcuffed and arrested). In contrast, Guinto consented to the search while sitting, unrestrained, in the car, less than five minutes into a lawful, albeit somewhat stressful, traffic stop. The encounter was beside a public highway during daylight hours, and Bennett\u2019s interaction with defendants was polite \u2014 he did not raise his voice, draw a weapon, or employ any threats or promises.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He simply requested consent \u2014 and then radioed for backup.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>Under the totality of the circumstances, Bennett\u2019s words \u2014 however persistent \u2014 and actions were not so coercive as to render Guinto\u2019s consent involuntary. We thus affirm the trial court\u2019s determination that the warrantless search of the car and its contents, including the luggage, did not violate Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"> Defendants also argue that the consent to search the car was not voluntary and the evidence should have been suppressed pursuant to the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The federal test, as articulated by the Court in <em>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, </em>412 US 218, 248-49, 93 S Ct 2041, 36 L Ed 2d 854 (1973), is essentially the same as the test under the Oregon Constitution, and requires the state to prove that \u201cthe consent was in fact voluntarily given, and not the result of duress or coercion, express or implied. Voluntariness is a question of fact to be determined from all the circumstances [.]\u201d Because voluntariness of consent is a question of fact under the Fourth Amendment, we will not disturb the trial court\u2019s finding unless it is unsupported by the record or clearly erroneous. <em>State v. Bowen, </em>137 Or App 327, 331, 904 P2d 1076 (1995), <em>rev den, </em>323 Or 74 (1996) (citing <em>Schneckloth, </em>412 US at 227).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Defendants\u2019 arguments under the Fourth Amendment, which they support by brief reference to persuasive authorities from other jurisdictions, depend on the premise that Bennett repeatedly sought consent to search <em>after consent had been explicitly refused. </em>As noted above, however, the record does not support that assertion. <em>See </em>211 Or App at 304. Again, when viewed under <em>Ball v. Gladden, </em>the record establishes that Guinto never responded to Bennett\u2019s requests for consent by refusing consent. Rather, the record shows only that Guinto, in response to Bennett\u2019s questions about the presence of weapons, repeatedly denied that there were any weapons in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">A detailed deconstruction of the authorities that defendants invoke would not benefit the bench and bar.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>Suffice it to say that the cases do not involve facts analogous to those presented here. Nothing in the Fourth Amendment case law cited by defendants leads us to believe that the issue presented should be resolved differently under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution than under Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b334-8\"> These cases were consolidated for oral argument and, after argument, the court, on its own motion, consolidated them for decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b334-9\"> The record contains a videotape of the entire traffic stop that recorded what was said by Trooper Bennett. However, the videotape did not clearly record all statements made by defendants when they were inside the car.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b336-6\"> Later that day, while in custody on the present charges, Ry had a telephone conversation that was tape-recorded by jail personnel. During that conversation, Ry told the woman to whom he was speaking that Guinto had consented to the search of the car because of R/s outstanding warrants. Given our analysis and disposition, we need not address the significance, if any, of Rjfs statements regarding Guinto\u2019s reasons for consenting to the search.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b337-10\"> The state also asserts, apparently as a \u201cright for the wrong reason\u201d alternative basis for affirmance, that, even if Guinto\u2019s rights were violated when his initial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>consent was obtained to search the car, Ry separately consented to a search of his luggage in the trunk, which ultimately resulted in the discovery of the marijuana. Again, given our analysis and disposition, we do not address that contention.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b340-7\"> We acknowledge that the dynamics of encounters between law enforcement officers and citizens, particularly in the context of stops and arrests, do not always, or even necessarily, comport with the conventions of \u201cordinary social intercourse.\u201d <em>Cf. State v. Holmes, </em>311 Or 400, 813 P2d 28 (1991) (seizure occurs if an officer engages in conduct significantly beyond that accepted in ordinary social intercourse). We also acknowledge that the particular phrasing of a purported request is not necessarily dispositive: A grade school bully\u2019s \u201crequest\u201d to a puny classmate that he \u201cwould <em>really </em>like some of his ice cream\u201d is, contextually, coercive. Still, in the absence of compelling circumstances to the contrary, an officer\u2019s particular choice of language is highly significant in assessing whether a reasonable person would understand the officer\u2019s remarks to be so coercive as to render refusal to consent futile.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b341-7\"> Of course, a very different analysis applies when consent is obtained after an unlawful stop. <em>See generally State v.
