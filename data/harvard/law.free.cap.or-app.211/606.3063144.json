For each conviction, the trial court imposed the mandatory minimum sentence pursuant to ORS 137.700. The court also ordered that the sentences be served consecutively, based on its determination that the crimes of conviction did not arise from the same continuous and uninterrupted course of conduct. ORS 137.123(2). Defendant\u2019s total term of imprisonment was 275 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erred under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 US 466, 120 S Ct 2348, 147 L Ed 2d 435 (2000), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 US 296, 124 S Ct 2531, 159 L Ed 2d 403 (2004), by imposing consecutive sentences based on facts that he did not admit and that were not found by a jury. In <em>State v. Tanner, </em>210 Or App 70, 150 P3d 31 (2006), we held that the imposition of consecutive sentences pursuant to ORS 137.123(5) based on facts found by the trial court does not run afoul of the Sixth Amendment principles articulated in <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely. </em>Although <em>Tanner </em>involved a challenge to consecutive sentences imposed pursuant to ORS 137.123(5), the reasoning of that case applies with equal force in the context of a challenge to sentences imposed pursuant ORS 137.123(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
