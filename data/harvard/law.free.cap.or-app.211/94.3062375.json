On the burglary conviction, the court imposed an upward departure sentence of 75 months\u2019 imprisonment based on its finding that defendant was on supervision at the time of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">On appeal, defendant argues that the departure sentence violates the Sixth Amendment under the principles articulated in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 US 296, 124 S Ct 2531, 159 L Ed 2d 403 (2004), and <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 US 466, 120 S Ct 2348, 147 L Ed 2d 435 (2000), because it was based on facts that were not admitted by defendant or found by a jury. Although defendant did not advance such a challenge below, he argues that the sentence should be reviewed as plain error. Under our decision in <em>State v. Ramirez, </em>205 Or App 113, 133 P3d 343, <em>adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>207 Or App 1, 139 P3d 981 (2006), <em>rev allowed, </em>342 Or 256 (2007), the sentence is plainly erroneous. For the reason set forth in <em>Ramirez, </em>we exercise our discretion to correct the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Sentences vacated; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
