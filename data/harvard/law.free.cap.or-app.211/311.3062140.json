J.</author>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">Defendant, who was convicted of first-degree criminal mischief, ORS 164.365, appeals, challenging the trial court\u2019s imposition of restitution in an amount greater than $1,000. Defendant raises two arguments: (1) The trial court, in awarding restitution of $1,665.99, impermissibly \u201cre-examined\u201d a \u201cfact tried by a jury,\u201d violating Article VII (Amended), section 3, of the Oregon Constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, defendant contends that, because the jury had previously found, for purposes of determining the crime seriousness of defendant\u2019s offense, that the \u201cvalue of the damage\u201d caused by defendant\u2019s conduct was not \u201cmore than $1,000,\u201d the court was constitutionally precluded from awarding restitution in a greater amount. (2) Under the principles announced in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 US 466, 120 S Ct 2348,147 L Ed 2d 435 (2000), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 US 296, 124 S Ct 2531, 159 L Ed 2d 403 (2004), the determination of the amount of the victim\u2019s \u201ceconomic damages\u201d for purposes of restitution, ORS 137.106(1), should have been submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>As amplified below, we reject both arguments. First, whatever the precise scope of the first sentence of Article VII (Amended), section 3, it is apparent, at least, that a court does not impermissibly \u201cre-examine [ ]\u201d a \u201cfact tried by a jury\u201d where the court <em>neither </em>abrogates the jury\u2019s finding <em>nor </em>determines the same fact inconsistently with the jury\u2019s finding. Here, the trial court did not abrogate the jury\u2019s finding for purposes of crime seriousness classification; rather, the court imposed sentence in accordance with that finding. Further, because the jury and the court applied different standards of persuasion \u2014 beyond a reasonable doubt and by a preponderance of the evidence, respectively \u2014 the latter\u2019s determination of the amount of damages was not inconsistent with the former\u2019s. Thus, there was no violation of Article VII (Amended), section 3. For the reasons stated in <em>State v. McMillan (A112613), </em>199 Or App 398, 402-03, 111 P3d 1136 (2005), we also reject defendant\u2019s second, Blakely-based challenge without further discussion. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">The facts material to our review are undisputed. On September 26,2003, Price, who was driving a van, and defendant, who was a passenger in a truck, had an unpleasant interchange in a Wal-Mart parking lot in Springfield. Defendant and the driver of the truck took issue with Price\u2019s driving and began cursing her. After she got out of her van and walked toward the store, Price, concerned, kept an eye on the van. She saw defendant, with a key in her hand, approach the side of the van. Price called 9-1-1 and, after police and store security guards responded, she returned to the van. Running from the front left quarter panel, across both the driver\u2019s and passenger\u2019s doors, to the back left quarter panel was a fresh, \u201creally deep scratch\u201d \u2014 \u201cthe paint was gone.\u201d According to one of the investigating officers, Parrish, the scratch was not merely a \u201csurface marking\u201d; instead, \u201c[i]t penetrated all the way through to the paint, down to the primer. And in spots it had hit metal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Defendant was charged, by indictment, with criminal mischief in the first degree, ORS 164.365.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>indictment further alleged that \u201cthe amount of loss caused by the defendant was more than One Thousand dollars ($1,000).\u201d <em>See </em>ORS 135.711 (accusatory instrument \u201cshall allege facts sufficient to constitute * * * a specific subcategory of a crime in the Crime Seriousness Scale established by the rules of the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission\u201d). The significance of that additional allegation is that, if proved, it would increase the crime seriousness classification for defendant\u2019s offense from \u201c2\u201d to \u201c3\u201d for sentencing guidelines purposes. <em>See </em>OAR 213-017-0010(11) (if \u201cvalue of the property stolen or destroyed\u201d was $750 or more but less than $1,000, first-degree criminal mischief is a category \u201c2\u201d offense); OAR 213-017-0009(18) (damage of $1,000 or more but less than $5,000 yields a crime seriousness classification of \u201c3\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">At trial, both Price and Parrish testified concerning the extent of damage. Price testified that, based on her \u201cpersonal experience,\u201d the damage to the van was \u201cmore than $1,000.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Parrish testified, from his \u201clife experience [with] cars that are keyed,\u201d that the process to repair such damage is \u201cquite expensive\u201d and \u201cjust a door itself could be about 650 to 700 dollars\u201d and \u201ca scratch that went from the driver\u2019s side door all the way to the rear of the car would be more than $750 worth of damage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Because the amount of damage was determinative of the crime seriousness rating, that question was submitted to the jury. <em>See State v. Casavan, </em>139 Or App 544, 546, 912 P2d 946, <em>rev den, </em>323 Or 265 (1996) (crime seriousness category must be determined beyond a reasonable doubt); <em>State v. Moeller, </em>105 Or App 434, 439, 806 P2d 130, <em>rev dismissed, </em>312 Or 76 (1991) (same). Specifically, the court instructed the jury, <em>inter alia, </em>that, if it found that defendant was guilty of first-degree criminal mischief, it must then determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>whether the state had proved the \u201cadditional allegation that the damages were $1,000 or greater\u201d and that the state bore the burden of proving that allegation \u201cto be true beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d The court also submitted a special verdict form to the jury, which included the question, \u201cWas the value of the damage more than One Thousand Dollars ($1,000)\u201d? The jury convicted defendant of first-degree criminal mischief but answered the additional interrogatory in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">The court subsequently sentenced defendant to 18 months\u2019 probation, in accordance with the jury\u2019s response to the special interrogatory.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That is, the court sentenced defendant consistently with the determination that the crime seriousness classification of her offense was \u201c2,\u201d not \u201c3.\u201d <em>See </em>211 Or App at 315 n 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">With respect to restitution, the state filed a restitution schedule, ORS 137.106(1), asserting a \u201c[t]otal loss\u201d of $1,665.99, including Price\u2019s insurance deductible, her rental car expense, and the cost of repair incurred by her insurer. Following trial, defendant lodged objections, arguing, in part, that (1) under <em>Blakely andApprendi, </em>the court was precluded from awarding restitution in excess of $750; and (2) imposition of restitution of more than $750 would constitute an impermissible \u201cre-examin[ation]\u201d of a \u201cfact tried by a jury,\u201d violating Article VII (Amended), section 3.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Defendant did not dispute the accuracy of the damages, as represented in the \u201crestitution schedule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The court ultimately ordered defendant to pay restitution of $1,665.99. In rejecting defendant\u2019s argument under Article VII (Amended), section 3, the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-7\">\u201c3. [T]he only evidence at trial in the case now before the court was that the damages exceeded $1,000 notwithstanding that the jury\u2019s verdict was that the state had not proved the \u2018over $1,000\u2019 allegation and that, consequently, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>the Court can affirmatively say and find that there is no evidence to support the verdict on the issue regarding limiting the damages to less than $1,000;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-4\">\u201c4. ORS 137.106(1) requires the Court, not the jury, to set the amount of restitution and requires the Court to \u2018include in the judgment a requirement that the defendant pay the victim restitution in a specific amount that equals the full amount of the victim\u2019s pecuniary damages as determined by the Court.\u2019 (Emphasis added.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">On appeal, defendant reiterates her challenges under Article VII (Amended), section 3. Specifically, she argues that, because the jury explicitly determined, as a matter of fact, that the amount of damages caused by her criminal conduct was not \u201cmore than $1,000,\u201d the court, in imposing restitution in a greater amount, impermissibly \u201cre-examined\u201d that fact. The state responds first, that, as the trial court concluded, there was \u201cno evidence to support the [jury\u2019s] verdict,\u201d because the only evidence presented to the jury established that the damages caused by defendant\u2019s conduct exceeded $1,000 \u2014 and, thus, any \u201cre-examin[ation]\u201d was constitutionally permitted. Alternatively, the state contends that the jury\u2019s and court\u2019s functions, in determining crime seriousness and imposing restitution respectively, are so qualitatively distinct that the latter does not implicate \u201cre-examin[ation]\u201d of any fact found in relation to the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">We reject, at the outset, the state\u2019s first argument. Contrary to the trial court\u2019s observation, there was evidence in the record \u2014 Parrish\u2019s testimony \u2014 from which the jury could find that damages from the \u201ckeying\u201d incident were greater than $750 but less than $1,000. Again, Parrish testified that a scratch of this sort \u201cwould be [worth] more than $750\u201d \u2014 not $1,000 \u2014 in damage. <em>See </em>211 Or App at 315. Nor would Parrish\u2019s testimony that it would cost $650 to $700 to repair the damage to one door compel the conclusion that repairing two doors would double the expense. Similarly, the jury was not obligated to accept Price\u2019s uncorroborated assertion that, in her \u201cpersonal experience,\u201d the damages exceeded $1,000. We are unaware of any authority that a finder of fact, when confronted with such amorphous evidence of damages, is not permitted to discount (literally) that testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>The issue thus reduces to whether the court impermissibly \u201cre-examined\u201d a \u201cfact tried by [the] jury.\u201d In answering that question, we must construe the operative first sentence of Article VII (Amended), section 3, applying the methodology for provisions adopted by initiative, as prescribed in <em>Ecumenical Ministries v. Oregon State Lottery Comm., </em>318 Or 551, 560, 871 P2d 106 (1994), which mirrors that of <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610-12, 859 P2d 1143 (1993).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We begin with the text of Article VII (Amended), section 3:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-4\">\u201cIn actions at law, where the value in controversy shall exceed $750, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise re-examined in any court of this state, unless the court can affirmatively say there is no evidence to support the verdict.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Several aspects of the text are significant for present purposes. First, it applies only to \u201cactions at law,\u201d and criminal actions are \u201cactions at law\u201d for purposes of Article VII (Amended), section 3. <em>See State v. Wagner, </em>305 Or 115, 168-69, 752 P2d 1136 (1988), <em>vac\u2019d and rem\u2019d on other grounds, </em>492 US 914, 109 S Ct 3235,106 L Ed 2d 583 (1989).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Second, in 1910 \u2014 as today \u2014 \u201cfact\u201d could have variable meanings. A contemporaneous dictionary offered the following definition of \u201cfact\u201d in the legal context:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-7\">\u201cAny of the circumstances or matters of a case as they are alleged to be ; also, that which is of actual occurrence ; reality as an event or events. In this latter sense <em>fact </em>is often distinguished, in legal usage, from <em>law </em>; the distinction being between the reality of events or things the actual occurrence or existence of which is to be determined by evidence, and the legal effect of the occurrence or existence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>such events or things as determined by the judicious application of the rules and principles of law. In general, questions of fact are for the jury, questions of law for the court. A fact, or matter, in issue, in legal procedure, is one raised by the pleadings and directly and necessary to be determined by the decision, so that it will become res adjudicata ; and it is distinguished from a fact, or matter, in controversy, which is any other fact collateral to the issue and controverted between the parties, such as evidential facts merely furnishing a basis for the verdict.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-4\"><em>Webster\u2019s New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>782 (unabridged ed 1909) (italics and boldface in original). Thus, \u201cfact\u201d could mean either (a) the \u201coccurrence or existence\u201d of \u201cevents or things\u201d or (b) more broadly, a disputed \u201cmatter\u201d to be determined from the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Third, \u201cre-examine [ ]\u201d in contemporaneous common usage meant \u201cto subject to reexamination,\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>1792 (unabridged ed 1909), and \u201creexamination,\u201d in turn, meant \u201ca second examination.\u201d <em>Id. Accord Tenold v. Weyerhaeuser Co., </em>127 Or App 511, 520, 873 P2d 413 (1994), <em>rev dismissed, </em>321 Or 561 (1995) (relying on 1976 dictionary definition of \u201creexamine\u201d as \u201cto subject to \u2018a second <em>or new </em>examination\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>1907 (unabridged ed 1976) (emphasis added))). \u201cExamine\u201d circa 1910 was defined, as pertinent, as \u201c[t]o test by any appropriate method ; to inspect carefully with a view to discover the real character or state of[J\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>762 (unabridged ed 1909). Again, there is, at least, a reasonable ambiguity: Does \u201creexamine\u201d \u2014 to subject to a \u201csecond examination\u201d \u2014 connote (a) a review (and possible alteration or correction) of a prior determination, or (b) any subsequent and independent determination of the same \u201cfact,\u201d or both?<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">Those textual features render the constitutional text susceptible to more than one reasonable understanding, depending on whether \u201cfact\u201d and \u201cre-examine[ ]\u201d are construed broadly or narrowly. In particular, the citizens of Oregon, in approving Article VII (Amended), section 3, may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>have intended to preclude judicial review and \u201ccorrection\u201d of legally proper verdicts, so long as there was any evidence to support the result. Or, more broadly, they may have intended to preclude courts in actions at law from determining any matter not submitted to a jury inconsistently with a jury\u2019s prior or concurrent determination of operative \u201ccommon facts.\u201d The balance of Article VII (Amended), section 3, affords no contextual guidance, so we proceed to the measure\u2019s history. <em>See Ecumenical Ministries, </em>318 Or at 560.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">The content of the November 1910 General Election Voters\u2019 Pamphlet is unenlightening. There was only one statement submitted in favor of the measure, and none in opposition. Official Voters\u2019 Pamphlet, General Election, Nov 1910, 166-77. The sole reference that may relate to the purpose of the first sentence of the measure was that the measure was intended to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-5\">\u201cremove the pretext for new trials in which substantial justice is done by the verdict and judgment, but in which the trial court may have made a technical mistake.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Voters\u2019 Pamphlet at 177. That statement is enigmatic \u2014 and, in all events, may relate more closely to the measure\u2019s third sentence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It is, however, indicative of a general purpose of precluding judicial abrogation of \u201cjust\u201d jury verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">Subsequent decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court and of this court shed further light on the circumstances surrounding the measure\u2019s adoption \u2014 and, at least, one of its intended purposes. <em>See Van Lom v. Schneiderman, </em>187 Or 89, 97-99, 210 P2d 461 (1949); <em>Tenold, </em>127 Or App at 520-24; <em>see also </em>Hall S. Lusk, <em>Forty-Five Years of Article VII, Section 3, Constitution of Oregon, </em>35 Or L Rev 1, 3-9 (1955). The gist of those discussions is that, at common law, a court could set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>aside a jury\u2019s damages award as \u201cexcessive,\u201d and grant a new trial, if it concluded that the verdict was \u201cclearly against the weight of the evidence,\u201d <em>see Van Lom, </em>187 Or at 112, or was the product of \u201cpassion or prejudice,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 97. <em>See also Tenold, </em>127 Or App at 521. The first sentence of Article VII (Amended), section 3, was intended \u2014 at least in part \u2014 to deprive the courts of that authority:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-4\">\u201cWhen [the framers of Article VII (Amended), section 3] substituted in the place of that exception the words, \u2018unless the court can affirmatively say there is no evidence to support the verdict\u2019, they in effect declared their purpose to eliminate, as an incident of jury trial in this state, the common law power of a trial court to re-examine the evidence and set aside a verdict because it was excessive or in any other respect opposed to the weight of the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-5\"><em>Van Lom, </em>187 Or at 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">That description in <em>Van Lom </em>comported with earlier decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court, which described the court\u2019s contemporaneous understanding of the provision\u2019s purpose:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-7\">\u201cIn order to inhibit such practice and to uphold verdicts, the Constitution was amended so as to preclude a court from re-examining any fact that had been tried by a jury, when the verdict returned was based on any legal evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-8\">\u201cThat part of Article VII of Section 3 of the fundamental law, which prohibits a court from re-examining any fact tried by a jury, when the verdict is based on legal evidence properly admitted, should be so construed as to effectuate the purposes and objects that evidently induced the amendment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-9\"><em>Buchanan v. Lewis A. Hicks Co., </em>66 Or 503, 510, 134 P 1191 (1913) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">In sum, the primary \u2014 and, perhaps, exclusive \u2014 purpose of the first sentence of Article VII (Amended), section 3, was to preclude courts from reexamining and setting aside jury verdicts based on a judicial assessment of the weight and persuasiveness of the evidence. Nevertheless, the fact that such judicial abrogation may have been the focus of the provision does not necessarily preclude the possibility that the provision might have broader preclusive application. That is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>Article VII (Amended), section 3, <em>might </em>also operate to constitutionally prohibit courts, in determining other matters in actions at law, from independently finding \u201ccommon facts\u201d inconsistently with a jury\u2019s determination of the same \u201cfacts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">Textual ambiguity aside, there is no indication that the electorate in 1910 contemplated \u2014 much less intended\u2014 such a result. \u201cActions at law\u201d in which the jury and the court act concurrently or sequentially as independent triers of common facts are rare.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Certainly, in the world before <em>Blakely, </em>Oregon voters would have understood the court and the jury to have distinct functions with respect to facts pertaining to sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">In all events, we need not proceed to the third level of the <em>Ecumenical Ministries/PGE </em>inquiry to resolve any even arguable ambiguity that remains after our review of the circumstances attending the measure\u2019s enactment. That is so because here, the court, in imposing restitution, did not either abrogate the jury\u2019s verdict, specifically including its finding of the amount of damage for purposes of crime seriousness classification, or determine the amount of damage inconsistently with the jury\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">As noted, the court imposed sentence under the guidelines based on a crime seriousness rating of \u201c2.\u201d 211 Or App at 316. That accorded with the jury\u2019s finding that the amount of damage resulting from defendant\u2019s crime was less than $1,000. Thus, the court did not review and set aside the jury\u2019s finding in that regard based on its own assessment of the evidence. Rather, the jury\u2019s determination was given full force and effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">Nor was the court\u2019s finding inconsistent with the jury\u2019s. Each independently determined the amount of damage applying a different standard of proof.
