We review the board\u2019s legal conclusions for errors of law and its findings of fact for substantial evidence, ORS 183.482(7), (8). Because we need the board to clarify one of its findings, we remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">The following facts were found or adopted by the board and are supported by substantial evidence. Claimant, a 17-year-old, worked in one of employer\u2019s restaurants as a pizza maker. On the day of the accident giving rise to this case, his shift began at 4:00 p.m. At approximately 9:30 p.m., he had his \u201clunch\u201d break. As instructed by Newby, the supervisor and manager of the restaurant, he clocked out. However, when he told Newby that he planned to drive to a nearby grocery store to buy a bottle of water \u2014 employer sold some drinks, but claimant preferred others \u2014 Newby told him, as the administrative law judge (ALJ) found and the board accepted, \u201cthat he did not have enough time and that Mr. Newby needed claimant at the employer\u2019s premises. Newby then directed claimant to go to the store across the street and get back to the employer\u2019s premises.\u201d Specifically, Newby testified, \u201cI\u2019m like, Dude, just run across the street.\u201d Claimant then took off his apron, walked across the street, and bought a drink. Returning, he attempted to cross the street midblock and was struck by an automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Based on those facts, the board concluded that claimant\u2019s injuries arose out of and in the course of employment and were therefore compensable. ORS 656.005(7)(a). To determine whether an injury meets the statutory criteria, the Supreme Court has articulated a two-part, but ultimately unitary, \u201cwork-connection\u201d test, asking whether the relationship between the injury and the employment is sufficient to merit compensation. <em>Fred Meyer, Inc. v. Hayes, </em>325 Or 592, 596, 943 P2d 197 (1997). The \u201carising out of\u2019 part requires some causal link between claimant\u2019s employment and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>injury. <em>Norpac Foods, Inc. v. Gilmore, </em>318 Or 363, 366, 867 P2d 1373 (1994). To satisfy the \u201cin the course of employment\u201d part, a claimant must show that the time, place, and circumstances of the injury are connected to the claimant\u2019s employment. <em>Robinson v. Nabisco, Inc., </em>331 Or 178, 186, 11 P3d 1286 (2000). Each part must be supported by some evidence, but satisfaction of one part may be minimal if the other has strong support. <em>Krushwitz v. McDonald\u2019s Restaurants, </em>323 Or 520, 531, 919 P2d 465 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">Generally, injuries sustained by an employee while traveling to or from work are not considered to be in the course of employment and are therefore not compensable. <em>Cope v. West American Ins. Co., </em>309 Or 232, 237, 785 P2d 1050 (1990); <em>Heide / Parker v. T.C.I. Incorporated, </em>264 Or 535, 539, 506 P2d 486 (1973). The purpose of this \u201cgoing and coming\u201d rule is that \u201cthe relationship of employer and employee is ordinarily suspended from the time the employee leaves his work to go home until he resumes his work, since the employee, during the time that he is going to or coming from work, is rendering no service for the employer.\u201d <em>Krushwitz, </em>323 Or at 526-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\"> Further, an unpaid break during which an employee leaves the employer\u2019s premises is generally noncompensable under the going and coming rule. <em>White v. S.I.A.C., </em>236 Or 444, 447, 389 P2d 310 (1964); <em>Barker v. Wagner Mining Equip., </em>6 Or App 275, 278, 487 P2d 1162 (1971). However, a \u201cspecial errand\u201d exception applies to situations in which <em>\u201ceither </em>the employee was acting in the furtherance of the employer\u2019s business at the time of the injury <em>or </em>the employer had a right to control the employee\u2019s travel in some respect.\u201d <em>Krushwitz, </em>323 Or at 528 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">The parties appear to agree on those legal principles. The disagreement arises with respect to the board\u2019s application of them. The board explicitly concluded that \u201cemployer did not have the right to control claimant during his unpaid lunch break.\u201d That conclusion is supported by substantial evidence and claimant does not dispute it. In upholding the compensability of the claim, the board therefore must have concluded that claimant\u2019s errand to the convenience store <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>across the street was \u201cin furtherance of the employer\u2019s business.\u201d <em>Krushwitz, </em>323 Or at 528. The board explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-4\">\u201cNewby expressly directed claimant to perform a certain act during his lunch break; <em>i.e., </em>going across the street to buy a beverage, because Newby was concerned that claimant may not be back by the end of his break. Although he disagreed, claimant complied with Newby\u2019s directive. Claimant attempted to return to the work site as quickly as possible with the specific intention of being available to work as needed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">According to employer, that paragraph and the facts underlying it do not amount to substantial evidence that claimant\u2019s errand was in furtherance of the employer\u2019s business. Employer points out that, although Newby \u201cdirected\u201d claimant to buy his drink at the store across the street instead of at a more distant grocery store, the choice to leave the workplace in the first place was claimant\u2019s. Newby, according to employer, did not direct claimant to go across the street; claimant had the option of going across the street or not buying water, and he freely chose to go across the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">To the extent that claimant chose the route that he did in order to avoid overextending his lunch break, he cannot claim to have done so for employer\u2019s benefit under the \u201cspecial errand\u201d rule; such a conclusion would render the \u201cgoing and coming\u201d rule inapplicable whenever a worker incurred an injury due to his or her hurry to get to work on time. On the other hand, if claimant chose to follow employer\u2019s instruction regarding how he should accomplish his personal errand because he reasonably understood that employer had directed him to return to work <em>before the end </em>of his lunch break so that he could be available as a stand-by in the event that a surge in customers occurred, then the errand was in furtherance of employer\u2019s business, was a \u201cspecial errand,\u201d and gave rise to a compensable injury. In that latter case, we would conclude that, with respect to the \u201cin the course of employment\u201d aspect of the statute, \u201cthe time, place, and circumstances of the injury justify connecting the injury to the <em>employment.\u201dRobinson, </em>331 Or at 186. Specifically, we would conclude that claimant was where he was, when he was there, because of the unforeseen and special imperative of his employment, and that, further, with respect to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>\u201carising out of employment\u201d aspect, there was a clear \u201ccausal connection between claimant\u2019s injury and a risk connected with [his] employment.\u201d <em>Fred Meyer, Inc., </em>325 Or at 601. Employer\u2019s need for claimant\u2019s hasty return was connected to the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">We are unable to discern from the record whether the board found that Newby directed claimant not to exceed his allotted lunch break, or not to take the entire break and return early. In light of the testimony, the findings are ambiguous. When employer\u2019s attorney asked Newby if he expected claimant to take his full 30-minute break, Newby replied, \u201cYes, I did, <em>unless something unforeseen happened and I needed him to come hack early. </em>\u201d Newby also agreed that it would be fair to characterize his instructions to claimant that he should return to the restaurant \u201cas soon as you can.\u201d Claimant himself testified that he understood Newby wanted him to \u201cget back as soon as possible, so that I\u2019d be there in case he need[ed] me.\u201d Newby\u2019s wife testified that it was her understanding that Newby told claimant to buy his drink across the street because, \u201cif he needed [claimant\u2019s] help, [claimant] would be right there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Based on that testimony, the ALJ found that \u201cMr. Newby informed claimant that he did not have enough time and that Mr. Newby needed claimant at the employer\u2019s premises. Mr. Newby then directed claimant to go to the store across the street and get back to the employer\u2019s premises.\u201d On review, the board \u201cadopt [ed] and affirm [ed] the ALJ\u2019s order with the following supplementation regarding the course and scope issue.\u201d It then characterized the events as quoted above:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-6\">\u201cNewby expressly directed claimant to perform a certain act during his lunch break; <em>i.e., </em>going across the street to buy a beverage, because Newby was concerned that claimant may not be back <em>by the end of his break. </em>Although he disagreed, claimant complied with Newby\u2019s directive. Claimant attempted to return to the work site as quickly as possible with the specific intention of <em>being available to work as needed.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">(Emphasis added.) In light of the testimony and the ALJ\u2019s findings \u2014 which, we note, are \u201csupplemented\u201d but not contradicted or changed \u2014 the italicized language might mean <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>that Newby wanted claimant already to have returned before the time that claimant\u2019s break ended. We therefore remand to the board for clarification. <em>See Labor Force v. Frierson, </em>169 Or App 573, 578, 9 P3d 128 (2000) (remanding case because order was not clear).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">Should the board find that Newby did not direct claimant to return from lunch early in order to be on standby, then the board should address an issue that the AL J did not reach due to its decision in claimant\u2019s favor on the \u201cspecial errand\u201d theory: that claimant\u2019s break cannot be considered \u201cunpaid\u201d because employer was legally required to pay him for it and that, therefore, it arose out of and in the course of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Reversed and remanded for reconsideration.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
