Defendant responds that plaintiffs assignment of error is not subject to meaningful review because there is no record of the parties\u2019 arguments regarding the motions. Alternatively, defendant argues that the trial court properly exercised its discretion in denying the motions. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">We state the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiff. <em>Bolt v. Influence, Inc., </em>333 Or 572, 578, 43 P3d 425 (2002). Plaintiff went into a Fred Meyer store and bought a half-case of beer at the U-scan machine. A check-out clerk at the machine saw plaintiff make the purchase. Plaintiff noticed that the cardboard carton was damp and that the handle was ripping. He asked the check-out clerk if he could exchange the carton. She replied that he could. Plaintiff retrieved a replacement carton, took it to the U-scan checkout area, and showed it to the clerk, who told him to \u201cgo ahead.\u201d Outside the store, plaintiff was approached by Smith, Fred Meyer\u2019s security agent. Smith apprehended plaintiff and led him back toward the store. Plaintiff asked Smith what he had done, but Smith ignored him. Plaintiff explained that he had paid for the beer, that the receipt was in the machine, and that Smith should talk to the check-out clerk. Plaintiff told Smith that, \u201cYou\u2019re going to be very embarrassed. I paid for the beer. I work right across the street at Value Village, and I\u2019m over here all the time. I\u2019m a good customer.\u201d Smith then began mocking plaintiff, asking, \u201cOk, Mr. Value Village, where were you bom? Ok, Mr. Value Village, have you ever been arrested before?\u201d Plaintiff responded, \u201cFuck you.\u201d Smith then shoved plaintiff against a wall, cocked plaintiffs wrist, and handcuffed him. Once plaintiff was inside the store\u2019s detention room, Smith began \u201capplying a good amount of pressure\u201d to plaintiffs wrist. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>Plaintiff protested, and Smith released him and then rehandcuffed him to the wall. Thereafter, someone checked with the clerk and confirmed that plaintiff had paid for the beer. Plaintiff was released, and Smith apologized to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Plaintiff filed an action for false arrest against defendant on January 10, 2003. Defendant filed its responsive pleading on February 11, 2003. On March 26, 2004, plaintiff filed a motion to amend his complaint to add a claim for punitive damages pursuant to ORCP 23 and <em>former </em>ORS 18.535 (2001), <em>renumbered as </em>ORS 31.725 (2003). Trial was scheduled for September 2004. In support of the motion, plaintiff submitted an affidavit by his attorney, a memorandum of law outlining the above facts, and a transcript from the deposition of plaintiff conducted by defendant. In response, defendant filed a memorandum in which it raised plaintiff s failure to file a motion <em>praecipe </em>according to local court procedural rules<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and in which defendant asked the court to strike the motion to amend.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Defendant also responded to the merits of plaintiffs proposed claim, asserting that plaintiffs evidence was legally insufficient to support an award of punitive damages. Defendant averred that Smith\u2019s stop of plaintiff was handled professionally and appropriately, and was reasonable because plaintiff had been observed taking the beer and leaving the store without paying for it. In defendant\u2019s view, Smith\u2019s use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>of force was caused by plaintiffs \u201cescalation\u201d of the situation by yelling and cursing at Smith and sticking his finger in Smith\u2019s face. Defendant also argued that it was necessary to return plaintiff to the store in order to confirm his story, and that once it was confirmed that he had paid for the beer, he was immediately released and given an apology. In addition, defendant argued that the entire episode took no more than 20 minutes, and that calling someone \u201cMr. Value Village,\u201d if that occurred, did not rise to the level of displaying a \u201cparticularly aggravated disregard\u201d of personal rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">On March 26, 2004, plaintiff submitted a motion <em>praecipe, </em>and the motion was set for hearing on April 9,2004. Initially, the trial court refused to strike plaintiffs motion under UTCR 1.090. The parties did not request that the hearing on the motion be reported, and neither party submitted a transcript of the hearing on appeal. The court ruled on plaintiffs motion on April 9, 2004. The court\u2019s order of that date does not reflect the basis of its decision, but states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-5\">\u201cAfter reviewing the written submissions of counsel and considering the oral argument presented during the hearing, the court has determined that the Motion should be denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">On the morning of trial on September 7, 2004, plaintiff renewed his motion to amend his complaint to add punitive damages. The trial court denied the motion but, because the recording equipment used in the hearing was faulty, there is no transcript of that proceeding either.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Defendant argues on appeal that, pursuant to ORCP 23 A, the denial of a motion to amend the pleadings is reviewed for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It follows, according to defendant, that because there is no record of the parties\u2019 arguments regarding the motions, nor of the trial court\u2019s reason for denying the motions, plaintiffs assignment of error is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>not reviewable. Plaintiff responds that, pursuant to <em>former </em>ORS 18.535, the trial court was authorized to deny the motion <em>only </em>if there was insufficient evidence to support a claim for punitive damages, and, therefore, the lack of a record of the hearing is irrelevant to our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\"> ORS 19.365(5) provides, \u201cIf the record on appeal is not sufficient to allow the appellate court to review an assignment of error, the court may decline to review the assignment of error and may dismiss the appeal if there are no other assignments of error that may be reviewed.\u201d It is axiomatic that an appellant has the responsibility of providing a sufficient record for review of the claims of error. <em>H.N.M. Enterprises, Inc. v. Hamilton, </em>49 Or App 613, 617, 621 P2d 57 (1980), <em>rev den, </em>290 Or 449 (1981). If the record is insufficient for review, a claim of error will be disregarded. <em>Id. </em>Necessarily, under these rules, our inquiry is fact specific to the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Plaintiffs motion to amend his pleading to add a claim for punitive damages is governed by <em>former </em>ORS 18.535, which provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-6\">\u201c(1) A pleading in a civil action may not contain a request for an award of punitive damages except as provided in this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">\u201c(2) At the time of filing a pleading with the court, the pleading may not contain a request for an award of punitive damages. At any time after the pleading is filed, a party may move the court to allow the party to amend the pleading to assert a claim for punitive damages. The party making the motion may submit affidavits and documentation supporting the claim for punitive damages. The party or parties opposing the motion may submit opposing affidavits and documentation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-8\">\u201c(3) The court shall deny a motion to amend a pleading made under the provisions of this section if the court determines that the affidavits and supporting documentation submitted by the party seeking punitive damages fail to set forth specific facts supported by admissible evidence adequate to avoid the granting of a motion for a directed verdict to the party opposing the motion on the issue of punitive damages in a trial of the matter.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>In <em>Foust v. American Standard Ins. Co., </em>189 Or App 125, 74 P3d 1111 (2003), we considered a similar issue that informs our analysis here. In that case, the plaintiff appealed a judgment in which the trial court ruled that an arbitrator\u2019s denial of the plaintiffs request for attorney fees incurred in an arbitration proceeding was not subject to review. The plaintiff argued that the trial court\u2019s judgment was inadequate for appellate review because it failed to describe the relevant facts and legal criteria on which it relied in denying her request for attorney fees and that we must remand the case for the trial court to state the rationale for its conclusion. We concluded that, under the relevant statute, ORS 36.425(6), the trial court was authorized to decline review for only two reasons. We explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-4\">\u201cIn substance, the statute provides that the trial court <em>\u2018shall </em>decide the issue\u2019 (emphasis added) unless the exceptions are not timely filed or are not directed to the legal grounds for the award or denial of attorney fees or costs or to the amount of the award. Judicial review is mandatory unless one or both of those requirements is not met. <em>Cf. Monroe v. Harmon, </em>158 Or App 196, 201-03, 973 P2d 392, <em>rev den, </em>329 Or 126 (1999) (holding that the provision in ORS 36.425(2)(a) that, after written notice of appeal and request for trial <em>de novo </em>of the action is filed, \u2018trial <em>de novo </em>shall be held\u2019 is mandatory, even though the appealing party failed to participate in arbitration). The record before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>us is sufficient to allow us to determine whether plaintiff met the requirements of ORS 36.425(6) and, thus, whether the trial court erred in declining to consider her exceptions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-4\"><em>Foust, </em>189 Or App at 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The threshold issue in this case is one of legislative intent.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Did the legislature intend to limit a trial court\u2019s discretion in deciding whether to allow an amended complaint alleging punitive damages to deciding only whether there was any evidence to support the punitive damage claim, or did the legislature intend that a trial court retain its discretion to deny such an amendment on grounds other than the sufficiency of the evidence? As with any other issue of statutory interpretation, in order to discern the legislature\u2019s intent, the first level of analysis requires us to examine the text and context of the statutes. <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610-12, 859 P2d 1143 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">When the provisions of ORCP 23 A are considered in conjunction with the provisions <em>offormer </em>ORS 18.535, the following becomes evident. The first sentence of ORCP 23 A permits a pleading to be amended by a party once as a matter of course before a responsive pleading is served. However, under <em>former </em>ORS 18.535, a pleading could not contain a request for an award of punitive damages. Rather, \u201c[a]t any time after the pleading is filed, a party may move the court to allow the party to amend the pleading to assert a claim for punitive damages.\u201d Although under ORCP 23 A, a party could plead as a matter of course an amended pleading, <em>former </em>ORS 18.535 required that when an amended pleading contained a claim for punitive damages, leave of the court must first have been sought to file the amended pleading. Under ORS 174.020(2), when a general and a particular provision are inconsistent, the particular intent controls over the general intent. Because <em>former </em>ORS 18.535 is the more specific statute regarding the pleading of punitive damages, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>controls over ORCP 23 A in the event of a conflict between the two rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">The second sentence of ORCP 23 A, however, is not inconsistent, at least in part, with the provisions of <em>former </em>ORS 18.535. Under <em>former </em>ORS 18.535, a party may amend a pleading only by leave of the court or by written consent of the adverse party after a responsive pleading is served. Under the latter rule, \u201c[a]t any time after the pleading is filed, a party may move the court to allow the party to amend the pleading to assert a claim for punitive damages.\u201d However, ORCP 23 A thereafter directs the court to exercise its discretion as to whether to grant the motion to amend \u201cand leave shall be freely given when justice so requires.\u201d In contrast, <em>former </em>ORS 18.535 provided that the court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-5\">\u201cshall deny a motion to amend a pleading made under the provisions of this section if the court determines that the affidavits and supporting documentation submitted by the party seeking punitive damages fail to set forth specific facts supported by admissible evidence adequate to avoid the granting of a motion for a directed verdict to the party opposing the motion on the issue of punitive damages in a trial of the matter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Although plaintiff argues that the trial court was authorized to deny his motion to add a claim of punitive damages only if grounds to grant a directed verdict existed, the above statutes are not susceptible to that interpretation. <em>Former </em>ORS 18.535 directed a court when to deny a motion to amend a pleading to add a claim for punitive damages when the evidence is insufficient; it did not purport to limit a court\u2019s discretion to deny such a motion on other grounds. Under ORS 174.010, we are not authorized to insert terms that have been omitted; rather, our obligation is to \u201cdeclare what is, in terms or in substance, contained therein[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">If the legislature had intended to limit a trial court\u2019s discretion in the above circumstances to denying a motion only when the evidence was insufficient, it could have easily said so by directing courts to grant motions to amend only when the evidentiary requirement is satisfied and not otherwise. Because the legislature instead chose to describe only when a court is required to deny such motion, we infer that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>intended to vest the trial court with discretion to grant or deny the motion on other grounds, as ORCP 23 A indicates.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">The above understanding of the interaction between ORCP 23 A and <em>former </em>ORS 18.535 is supported by a comparison with the statute involved in <em>Foust. </em>In that case, ORS 36.425(6) provided that \u201c [exceptions [to an arbitrator\u2019s award] under this subsection may be directed to the legal grounds for an award or denial of attorney fees or costs, or to the amount of the award. * * * A judge of the court shall decide the issue [.]\u201d We held that judicial review was mandated under the language of the statute unless one or both of the requirements for judicial review was not met. <em>Foust, </em>180 Or App at 131. Unlike ORS <em>36.425(6), former </em>ORS 18.535 did not prescribe the universe of circumstances under which a motion to amend a pleading to add a claim for punitive damages may be denied. Indeed, ORS 36.425(6) illustrates that the legislature knows how to promulgate those kinds of requirements when it intends to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">There is one further loose end that needs to be tied up. In <em>Bolt, </em>on which plaintiff relies, the plaintiffs brought an original mandamus proceeding in the Supreme Court after the trial court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to amend on the ground that they had not presented evidence sufficient for a jury to find by clear and convincing evidence that they were entitled to punitive damages. The Supreme Court examined the legislative history of <em>former </em>ORS 18.535 and declared,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-6\">\u201cThat provision requires a court to deny such a motion <em>only </em>if the evidence submitted is not adequate to overcome an opposing motion for a directed verdict \u2014 i.e., <em>only </em>if there is \u2018no evidence\u2019 from which the jury could find the facts necessary to establish an element of plaintiffs claim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-7\"><em>Bolt, </em>333 Or at 580 (emphasis added). That interpretation of <em>former </em>ORS 18.535 became part of the statute as if it were written into the statute at the time of its enactment. <em>Holcomb v. Sunderland, </em>321 Or 99, 105, 894 P2d 457 (1995). As a result of the proceeding, a peremptory writ issued from the court requiring the trial court to reconsider the petitioners\u2019 motion to amend under the correct evidentiary standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>When the <em>Bolt </em>court said that <em>former </em>ORS 18.535 required a court to deny a motion to add a claim for punitive damages \u201conly\u201d if the evidence submitted is not adequate, it was in the context of the evidentiary standard imposed by the legislature. It necessarily follows that this case presents a different issue than the issue in <em>Bolt. </em>Because of the difference in issues between this case and <em>Bolt, </em>the above language in <em>Bolt, </em>although part of the statute, is inapposite to our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\"> In light of the above circumstances, we turn to the question of whether, because of a lack of a record about what occurred at the hearings on plaintiff\u2019s motions, we are able to review plaintiffs claim of error. A trial court exceeds its discretion if its ruling falls outside the range of two or more legally correct or permissible results. <em>State v. Rogers, </em>330 Or 282, 310-12, 4 P3d 1261 (2000). Here, ORCP 23 A granted the trial court discretion to grant or deny the motion to amend the pleading when \u201cjustice so requires.\u201d The trial court\u2019s order ruling on the motion expressly stated that it had considered the parties\u2019 oral arguments. Without a transcript of the hearings, we have no inkling of why the trial court exercised its discretion as it did. Indeed, plaintiffs materials submitted in support of his motion appear to create issues of fact for the jury to decide whether an award of punitive damages was warranted. If the trial court ruled on the basis of the sufficiency of the evidence, it erred. However, if the trial court ruled based on some other permissible ground, such as untimeliness of the motion or because discovery had been completed prior to plaintiff bringing the motion, it may not have exceeded its discretion by denying the motion. The end result is that we cannot discern if the trial court exceeded its discretion and, because it was within the ability of plaintiff, the appellant, to make an adequate record for review by requesting that the initial hearing be reported or recorded, or to submit a narrative statement regarding the second hearing, ORAP 3.05(2), plaintiff cannot prevail on appeal. <em>Glover v.
