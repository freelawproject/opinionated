She argues that the evidence, which shows that she refused to obey a lawful order to move from one place to another, is insufficient to support her conviction. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">In January 2004, defendant was arrested on an unrelated felony charge. She was booked and lodged at the Multnomah County Sheriffs Office. On March 7,2004, while defendant was still incarcerated on the felony charge, Corrections Sergeant Jacobs discovered during a review of prisoner booking photographs that defendant\u2019s file contained a profile photograph but no frontal photograph. He went to defendant\u2019s cell and told her to accompany him to the booking area to take a frontal photograph. She refused. Jacobs decided not to force the issue at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">The next week, he again directed defendant to go to the booking area to be photographed. She again refused and asked to speak to her attorney. He informed her that she could speak to her attorney, but that he would resolve the issue of the missing photograph the next time her saw her. When Sergeant Jacobs approached her a week later, defendant told him that her attorney said that it was unlawful for the police to take her photograph unless he produced the relevant law in writing. Sergeant Jacobs informed her that she was incorrect and ordered her to accompany him to the booking area. Defendant refused a third time.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">After defendant\u2019s third refusal, Jacobs checked her record and discovered that defendant had also refused to cooperate at her initial booking. According to that record, as a result of defendant\u2019s resistance, the booking process, which normally takes about three hours, took 17 hours. Defendant had turned her head to the side every time the booking officers had attempted to take a frontal photograph. The record also indicated that the officers had resorted to force in order to fingerprint defendant and to dress her in jail garments.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">Jacobs concluded that any efforts he made to obtain a frontal photograph of defendant would likely be met with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>similar resistance. He decided not to force another such confrontation with defendant and to have her charged with obstructing governmental or judicial administration in violation of ORS 162.235. The information alleged that, \u201con or about March 21, 2004,\u201d defendant \u201cunlawfully and intentionally obstruct [ed], impair [ed] and hinder [ed] the administration of law by means of physical interference and obstacle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">Defendant was tried in a bench trial. Jacobs\u2019s testimony on behalf of the state established that defendant verbally refused to go to the booking area to be photographed but did not otherwise physically resist. At the close of the state\u2019s evidence, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal, arguing that her refusal to accompany Jacobs from her housing unit to the booking area in the basement to have her picture taken did not constitute \u201cphysical * * * interference or obstacle\u201d within the meaning of ORS 162.235. The trial court denied the motion and ultimately convicted defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">On appeal, defendant argues that there is insufficient evidence that she violated ORS 162.235. She contends that her three refusals to accompany Jacobs to the booking area in March did not obstruct the administration of law \u201cby means of* * * physical * * * interference or obstacle\u201d because her refusal to move was not a physical act. The state argues that defendant was properly convicted for failing to perform a physical act that she was legally required to perform, specifically moving from her cell to the booking area.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\"> ORS 162.235(1) provides, \u201cA person commits the crime of obstructing governmental or judicial administration if the person intentionally obstructs, impairs or hinders the administration of law or other governmental or judicial function by means of intimidation, force, physical or economic interference or obstacle.\u201d The question before us is whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>defendant\u2019s refusal to move obstructed, impaired, or hindered the administration of law \u201cby means of* * * physical or economic interference or obstacle.\u201d To answer that question, we look to the text of the statute in context and, if necessary, to legislative history and other interpretive aids. <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610-12, 859 P2d 1143 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">We begin by considering the plain, natural, and ordinary meaning of \u201cphysical * * * interference or obstacle.\u201d \u201cInterference\u201d and \u201cobstacle\u201d are defined respectively as \u201cthe act of meddling in or hampering an activity or process : OBSTRUCTION, INHIBITION,\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>1178 (unabridged ed 2002), and \u201csomething that stands in the way,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1558. Defendant\u2019s refusal to move to the booking area \u201champered\u201d Jacobs\u2019s attempts to take her photograph and \u201cstood in the way\u201d of his performance of his lawful duties. Defendant does not argue otherwise. <em>See </em>ORS 181.511(l)(a) (requiring law enforcement agencies to collect certain criminal offender information, including a booking photograph). Rather, she contends that her conduct was verbal, defines physical as \u201cof or relating to the body,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and argues that her conduct was not, therefore, \u201cphysical.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">We agree with defendant that a bodily movement that intentionally hinders the administration of law would qualify as \u201cphysical * * * interference or obstacle.\u201d It does not follow, however, that defendant cannot be convicted for her conduct merely because she did not move her body. A failure to move one\u2019s body can fairly be said to \u201crelate to the body.\u201d In <em>State v. Mattila, </em>77 Or App 219, 712 P2d 832, <em>rev den, </em>301 Or 77 (1986), sheriffs deputies charged with evicting the defendant from the premises ordered him to remove the crutch blocking their way into the home, and the defendant refused. The defendant argued that his conduct was not \u201cphysical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>interference,\u201d and we held that evidence of the defendant\u2019s refusal to remove the crutch and intent to block the deputies from entering could support a conviction under the statute. As in the present case, the defendant did not thwart the deputies\u2019 efforts by means of bodily movements. Rather, in <em>Mattila, </em>the defendant verbally refused to use his body to move something (a crutch), thereby impeding the deputies\u2019 performances of their lawful duties. We see no meaningful distinction between the facts of <em>Mattila </em>and the facts of this case. Here, defendant verbally refused to move something (her body), thereby impeding Jacobs\u2019s performance of his lawful duties. We therefore conclude that defendant\u2019s failure to move when ordered to do so obstructed Jacobs\u2019s efforts to take her photograph \u201cby means of * * * physical interference * * * or obstacle.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">Defendant also argues that there was no evidence that she \u201cintentionally\u201d obstructed the administration of law because both she and Sergeant Jacobs testified that defendant was upset and wanted to speak with her attorney. We disagree. The inference that defendant intended to hinder the administration of law by refusing to move in March was reasonable in light of Sergeant Jacobs\u2019s testimony about her conduct during the January booking.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b397-7\"> In her opening brief, defendant argued that the trial court improperly convicted defendant for her conduct at the initial booking in January. At oral argument, the state explained that the prosecutor \u201cnever made an argument * * * that the January incident alone was sufficient to support a conviction.\u201d According to the state, the trial court convicted defendant for her conduct in March, and evidence of her conduct in January helped prove that she acted intentionally in March. We agree with the state\u2019s characterization of the record. Thus, we consider only whether defendant\u2019s conduct in March, viewed in the context of her January conduct, was sufficient to support a conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b398-6\"> Another broader definition of \u201cphysical\u201d as it is used in ORS 162.235 is \u201cof or relating to natural or material things as opposed to things mental, moral, spiritual, or imaginary.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 1706; <em>see also </em>ORS 162.225 (defining \u201cphysical evidence\u201d as used in ORS 162.225 to 162.375 as \u201cevidence of physical substance\u201d unless the context requires otherwise). As the body is a natural thing, if something is \u201cof or relating to the body,\u201d it is necessarily \u201cof or related to natural things.\u201d Because we conclude that defendant\u2019s conduct fit within the narrower definition of the term \u201cphysical,\u201d as suggested by defendant, we need not resolve in this case whether the legislature intended the broader meaning.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b399-6\"> The parties assume that the term \u201cphysical\u201d modifies both \u201cinterference\u201d and \u201cobstacle.\u201d Because we conclude that defendant\u2019s failure to move when ordered to do so obstructed the administration of law by means of physical interference, we need not resolve that question.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
