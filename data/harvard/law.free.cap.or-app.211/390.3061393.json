We summarily affirmed the decision of the post-conviction court vacating petitioner\u2019s convictions for burglary in the first degree with a firearm, assault in the third degree with a firearm, and unlawful use of a weapon on the grounds that petitioner\u2019s trial counsel provided constitutionally inadequate assistance of counsel by failing to advise petitioner, who is a Mexican national, that, by pleading no contest to the charges, he would almost certainly be deported from the United States. The Supreme Court allowed review, vacated our decision, and remanded the case to us for reconsideration in light of <em>Gonzalez v. State of Oregon, </em>340 Or 452, 134 P3d 955 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\"> In <em>Gonzalez, </em>the Supreme Court held that defense counsel is not required, under state constitutional standards governing inadequate assistance of counsel, to assess and advise a defendant of the likelihood that the defendant will be deported as a result of a criminal conviction. Rather, it is sufficient that the defendant be advised of the maximum collateral consequences that may result. <em>Id. </em>at 459-60.

That petitioner was virtually certain to be deported \u2014 and would not get the hearing to contest his deportation that counsel also told him that he would have \u2014 does not render counsel\u2019s advice constitutionally inadequate under <em>Gonzalez. </em>The maximum collateral consequence of petitioner\u2019s conviction was deportation. Petitioner was told that.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
