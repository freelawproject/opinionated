He was tried on stipulated facts without objection, but without a written waiver of his right to a jury trial. On appeal, he argues that the trial court committed plain error when it conducted the stipulated facts trial without first having defendant sign a written jury waiver. The state concedes that the trial court erred and that there are no facts in the record otherwise indicating that defendant voluntarily and knowingly waived his right to a jury trial. <em>See State v. Barber, </em>209 Or App 262, 269, 147 P3d 915 (2006) (court refused to exercise discretion to review unpreserved claim that trial court should have obtained a signed written waiver when record demonstrates that defendant knowingly waived the right). We agree with the state and accept its concession.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Reversed and remanded for new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
