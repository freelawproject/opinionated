Defendant was charged in a two-count indictment that alleged, in the first count, that he stole packaged meat from his employer and, in the second count, that he sold that meat to another store. A jury found him guilty of both counts, and the trial court entered a judgment of conviction on both counts. On appeal, defendant argues that under <em>State v. Cox, </em>336 Or 284, 82 P3d 619 (2003), the court erred in failing to merge the convictions, because the two counts alleged separate aspects of a single offense. The state concedes that, under <em>Cox, </em>the two convictions should merge. We agree and accept the concession. Under <em>State v. White, </em>202 Or App 1, 13, 121 P3d 3 (2005), <em>aff'd, </em>341 Or 624, 147 P3d 313 (2006), the proper remedy under the circumstances is to remand the case for entry of a judgment reflecting a single conviction and enumerating the two alternate theories of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Reversed and remanded with instructions to enter a judgment of conviction for first-degree theft reflecting that defendant was convicted on both theories and for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
