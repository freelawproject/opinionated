J.</author>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Petitioner Convention Foliage Service, Inc., seeks judicial review of an order issued by the Office of Administrative Hearings for respondent Employment Department concerning tax assessments against petitioner for certain periods in the years 2001 through 2004. That order determined that petitioner was not entitled to an \u201cagricultural labor\u201d exemption from unemployment compensation insurance taxes. ORS 657.045(1). On review, petitioner contends, principally, that the administrative law judge (ALJ) erred in determining that the \u201cagricultural labor\u201d exemption is inapplicable because petitioner primarily leases, rather than sells, the plants that it grows and maintains in its greenhouses. For the reasons set forth below, we agree with petitioner and, consequently, reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Before describing the material facts, we summarize the applicable statutes. Under ORS chapter 657, Oregon employers generally must pay unemployment compensation insurance taxes based on their employment of Oregon workers. However, the statute includes several exemptions for the provision of various services. <em>See, e.g., </em>ORS 657.043 (pertaining to performance of caddying services at golf courses); ORS 657.053(2) (exempting \u201cservice performed by an individual on a boat engaged in catching fish\u201d under certain \u201carrangement[s]\u201d). Among those exemptions is ORS 657.045, pertaining to \u201cagricultural labor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Three provisions of ORS 657.045 frame our review. <em>First, </em>ORS 657.045(1) provides, \u201c \u2018Employment\u2019 does not include agricultural labor,\u201d so long as the employing entity does not exceed certain statutorily prescribed limits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number><em>Second, </em>ORS 657.045(3)(a) defines \u201c[a]gricultural labor\u201d as including all services performed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-4\">\u201cOn a <em>farm, </em>in the employ of any person, in connection with cultivating the soil, or <em>in connection with raising </em>or harvesting <em>any agricultural or horticultural commodity, </em>including the raising, shearing, feeding, caring for, training and management of livestock, bees, poultry and fur-bearing animals and wildlife.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\"><em>Third, </em>ORS 657.045(5) defines \u201cHarms\u201d as including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-7\">\u201c[S]tock, dairy, poultry, fruit, fur-bearing animal, Christmas tree and truck farms, plantations, orchards, ranches, nurseries, ranges, <em>greenhouses or other similar structures used primarily for the raising of agricultural or horticultural </em>commodities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">Here, it is uncontroverted that petitioner\u2019s business involves leasing decorative plants, primarily for special events. Petitioner grows and maintains the plants in greenhouses and employs several workers to care for the plants. Petitioner did not pay unemployment taxes for those workers. In 2004, the Employment Department assessed unemployment insurance taxes against petitioner for portions of the tax years 2001 through 2004, and petitioner appealed the notices of tax assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">After the ensuing contested case hearing, the ALJ made the following findings of fact that are pertinent to our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-11\">\u201cConvention Foliage Service, Inc. (the employer) operates a plant leasing business. The employer raises and maintains decorative plants which it leases out for conventions and other large events. The employer maintains the plants in pots which it stores in a number of large greenhouses. Maintenance of the plants requires extensive pruning, trimming, fertilizing, watering, re-potting, and treating with fungicides and pesticides. Many plants require extensive work after they are returned from an event by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>lessee to restore the plants to a condition suitable for decorative use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-4\">\u201cThe employer purchases primarily mature plants for lease, although it occasionally grows some plants from \u2018cell packs\u2019 which are small thumb-sized plants. The employer does not grow the plants from seeds. The majority of the work in the greenhouses consists of maintaining existing plants, and not in growing new plants. The employer sells a minimal amount of its plants each year.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">In contending that petitioner was not entitled to the benefit of the \u201cagricultural labor\u201d exemption, respondent argued that the fact that petitioner leased the vast majority of its plants, rather than selling them, was all-important. Indeed, respondent conceded that \u201call of the labors being performed [by petitioner\u2019s employees] would be agricultural in nature were it not for the fact that the greenhouse\u201d leases its plants rather than sells them.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">The ALJ agreed. In particular, the ALJ understood that, under <em>Just-A-Mere Farm v. Peet, </em>247 Or 413, 430 P2d 987 (1967), and <em>Appleman v. Employment Division, </em>21 Or App 186, 534 P2d 218 (1975), \u201ca farm must involve the production and sale of annual crops and animals.\u201d Consequently, because the plants that petitioner raises and maintains in its greenhouses do not produce an annual yield and because petitioner sells few of its plants, the ALJ concluded that the plants were not \u201cagricultural or horticultural commodities\u201d for purposes of ORS 657.045(3) and (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">On judicial review, petitioner raises two assignments of error: (1) The ALJ erred, as a matter of law, in concluding that the \u201cagricultural labor\u201d exemption is inapplicable because petitioner leases, rather than sells, all but a \u201cminimal amount\u201d of its plants. (2) The ALJ\u2019s finding that petitioner \u201cpurchases primarily mature plants for lease\u201d is unsupported by substantial evidence. As amplified below, we agree with petitioner in both respects. Because our resolution of the second assignment of error informs \u2014 though is not dis-positive of \u2014 our resolution of the first assignment, we begin by addressing petitioner\u2019s substantial evidence challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>As noted above, \u201cagricultural labor\u201d includes all services performed \u201c[o]n a <em>farm </em>* * * in connection with <em>raising </em>* * * any agricultural or horticultural commodity [.]\u201d ORS 657.045(3)(a) (emphasis added). \u201cFarms\u201d include, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cgreenhouses * * * used primarily for the <em>raising </em>of agricultural or horticultural commodities.\u201d ORS 657.045(5). Thus, putting aside for the moment the meaning of \u201ccommodities,\u201d the \u201craising\u201d of such products is a prerequisite to eligibility for the \u201cagricultural labor\u201d exemption. Petitioner contends that the ALJ\u2019s finding that petitioner purchases \u201cprimarily mature plants\u201d is not only erroneous but also potentially material, because at least implicit in that finding is the suggestion that petitioner does not \u201craise\u201d its plants \u2014 but, instead, merely \u201cwarehouses\u201d and maintains them.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">We need not determine whether the ALJ\u2019s finding could, if correct, support an alternative basis for rejecting petitioner\u2019s claim of exemption (on the ground that it was not \u201craising\u201d the plants), because that finding is, in all events, unsupported by substantial evidence. <em>See Younger v. City of Portland, </em>305 Or 346, 360, 752 P2d 262 (1988) (a finding of fact is supported by substantial evidence if the record, viewed as a whole, permits a reasonable person to make that finding).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Here, the evidence pertaining to petitioner\u2019s purchase of plants is straightforward. One of petitioner\u2019s owners, Conway, testified, without contradiction, that petitioner raises plants, but does not raise them from seed. Rather, petitioner buys seedlings or purchases growing plants and raises them \u201cto whatever size we feel we need them after they\u2019re acclimated.\u201d Greenhouse workers\u2019 tasks involve fertilizing and repotting the plants. The average time that petitioner has a plant is six to eight months during which they are leased out for events, and after which they are generally discarded as unusable. On cross-examination, Conway testified that petitioner bought fewer plants that \u201cjust broke the soil\u201d than \u201cplants that were a little bigger\u201d and had a better chance of living than the \u201cnew starts.\u201d That is the totality of the pertinent evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Based on that evidence, we conclude that substantial evidence does not support the ALJ\u2019s finding that petitioner primarily purchases \u201cmature\u201d plants. In this context, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>\u201cmature\u201d means \u201chaving attained the normal peak of natural growth and development : fully grown and developed.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>1394 (unabridged ed 2002). The undisputed evidence shows that, although many of the plants that petitioner purchased were not seedlings, petitioner grew the plants it purchased to whatever size it needed in order to use them as decorative plants to be leased. Thus, the plants that petitioner bought were not fully grown and developed; they were not \u201cmature\u201d plants. The ALJ\u2019s contrary finding was unsubstantiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">We return to the central issue: Did the ALJ err, as a matter of law, in determining that, because petitioner leased, rather than sold, the vast majority of its plants, those plants were not \u201cagricultural or horticultural commodities\u201d for purposes of the definitions of \u201c[fiarms,\u201d ORS 657.045(5), and, derivatively, of \u201c[a]gricultural labor,\u201d ORS 657.045(3)(a)? We do not understand respondent to dispute that the ornamental plants in question are \u201chorticultural\u201d within the plain meaning of that term. <em>See Webster\u2019s </em>at 1093 (defining \u201chorticulture\u201d as \u201cthe science and art of growing fruits, vegetables, flowers, or <em>ornamental plants\u201d </em>(emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">The question thus reduces to whether the plants that petitioner grows are \u201chorticultural <em>commodities.\u201d </em>\u201cCommodity,\u201d as used in this context, generally means \u201can economic good; <em>esp </em>: a product of agriculture, mining, or sometimes manufacture as distinguished from services.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 458. Respondent argues that leased goods, however, do not qualify as commodities. Respondent relies on a portion of the dictionary definition that indicates that a commodity is \u201csomething used or valued esp. when regarded as an article of commerce.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cCommerce,\u201d respondent contends, means \u201cthe exchange or buying and selling of commodities,\u201d citing <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 456. Thus, respondent reasons, commodities must be bought and sold, not leased.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">We reject respondent\u2019s extremely narrow and selective application of those definitions. As noted, the definition of \u201ccommodity\u2019 makes specific reference to agricultural goods, and also makes separate reference to \u201csomething used or valued,\u201d followed by the reference to \u201ccommerce.\u201d There is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>no serious dispute that leased agricultural goods such as petitioner\u2019s ornamental plants are \u201cused or valued.\u201d The final reference after that phrase \u2014 \u201cespecially] when regarded as an article of commerce\u201d \u2014 does not import the limitation that respondent suggests, as the word \u201cespecially\u201d means \u201cparticularly,\u201d or \u201cnotably,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 776, rather than \u201conly.\u201d Thus, given the statutory definition of \u201cfarms,\u201d and the ordinary meaning of \u201craising\u201d and \u201chorticultural commodities,\u201d petitioner\u2019s raising of ornamental plants in a greenhouse for lease at special events constituted \u201craising\u201d a \u201chorticultural commodity\u201d on a \u201cfarm.\u201d ORS 657.045(3), (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">Nevertheless, as noted, the ALJ concluded that merely growing and maintaining plants was insufficient. Rather, the ALJ determined that both the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Just-A-Mere Farm </em>and our decision in <em>Appleman </em>compelled the conclusion that the plants needed to be harvested annually and sold in order for them to be \u201chorticultural commodities\u201d raised on a \u201cfarm\u201d as those terms are used in ORS 657.045(3) and (5). The ALJ erred in that understanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">In <em>Just-A-Mere Farm, </em>the question was whether, under a prior version of ORS 657.045, the raising of \u201cforest-type trees for the purpose of eventually producing commercial timber\u201d constituted \u201cagricultural labor.\u201d The definition of \u201cfarm,\u201d in the 1967 version of ORS 657.045(3), contained no reference to tree farms, other than orchards. 247 Or at 416.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The pertinent portion of the definition of \u201cagricultural labor,\u201d then found in ORS 657.045(2), was the same in all material respects as the definition currently found in ORS 657.045(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">In considering whether the activities of the tree farm workers constituted \u201cagricultural labor\u201d on a \u201cfarm,\u201d the court first noted that no legislative history existed concerning the purpose of excluding \u201cagricultural labor.\u201d 247 Or at 416. The court then canvassed the various reasons suggested for such an exclusion discussed by courts in other jurisdictions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>and in treatises, focusing on the \u201cdifficulties involved in collecting the tax and the inconvenience and possible unfairness to farmers in reporting their tax because of the seasonal character of farming operations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 417. The court concluded that, because those considerations \u201cwould not ordinarily apply to an operation involving the growing of timber,\u201d \u201cthe operation of large \u2018tree farms\u2019 would not fall within the exclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 418. Finally, the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-4\">\u201cWe reach this conclusion principally upon the basis of our understanding of the terms \u2018agricultural labor\u2019 and \u2018farm\u2019 as those terms are used in the vernacular. Although, with the development of the selective cutting of timber, it is not uncommon to refer to timber as a \u2018crop,\u2019 we do not think that in common parlance the growing of trees for the purpose of producing lumber is regarded as an agricultural operation, and we assume that ORS 657.045 was cast in terms of this common usage. <em>The types of activity described in ORS 657.045 in defining \u2018agricultural labor\u2019 relate directly or indirectly to operations which are commonly regarded as associated with farming in its traditional sense, i.e., where the work performed is directly or indirectly connected with the production and sale of that which the land yields annually in the form of crops or animals.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 418-19 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">In <em>Appleman, </em>the question was whether an unemployment claimant was entitled to benefits based on his work in an evergreen seedling nursery. 21 Or App at 187-88. The employer disputed benefits, invoking the \u201cagricultural labor\u201d exemption. Following <em>Just-A-Mere Farm, </em>we concluded that the exemption was not applicable because the raising of commercial timber seedlings was not farming in its \u201ctraditional sense,\u201d and because \u201c[t]imber tree seedlings are not \u2018agricultural or horticultural commodities\u2019 as these terms are commonly used and understood.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 192, 193. <em>But see </em>211 Or App at 111 n 2 (current version of statute includes this type of activity within the definition of \u201cagricultural labor\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">Neither <em>Just-A-Mere Farm </em>nor <em>Appleman </em>compels us \u2014 in a dramatically different circumstance \u2014 to deviate from the plain meaning of the statute. Both of those cases were decided at a time when the statute contained no explicit references to tree farms. Thus, the courts were faced with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>determining whether, as a generic matter, employers engaged in a class of activity that was not commonly understood to be \u201cagricultural\u201d and that was not specifically listed in the statute were nevertheless entitled to avail themselves of the benefit of the statutory exemption. Here, by contrast, the question is much more straightforward. The definition of \u201c[f]arms\u201d explicitly includes \u201cgreenhouses * * * used primarily for the raising of * * * horticultural commodities.\u201d ORS 657.045(5). Petitioner raises ornamental plants \u2014 an activity that clearly constitutes horticulture \u2014 in greenhouses.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">Respondent\u2019s predominant rejoinder, based on the above-emphasized language from <em>Just-A-Mere Farm, </em>is that the ornamental plants cannot be \u201ccommodities\u201d because petitioner does not raise them for \u201csale\u201d and because they are not \u201cthat which the land yields annually.\u201d 247 Or at 419. We disagree. We do not read <em>Just-A-Mere Farm </em>as limiting the plain meaning of the words used in ORS 657.045 by inserting the additional requirement that, regardless of the character of the work performed, the exemption can apply only if crops are harvested annually and then sold.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Indeed, such a construction would be contrary to ORS 174.010 (in construing a statute, a court is \u201cnot to insert what has been omitted, or to omit what has been inserted\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Rather, the court in <em>Just-A-Mere Farm </em>was attempting to determine whether an activity <em>not specifically mentioned in the statute </em>was nevertheless included \u2014 and it did so by reference to what it \u201ccommonly regarded as associated with farming in its traditional sense.\u201d 247 Or at 419. Conversely, the court did not suggest that activities expressly encompassed within the statute should nonetheless be excluded because those activities did not comport with the court\u2019s understanding of farming \u201cin its traditional sense.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>Again, such a construction could not be squared with the dictates of ORS 174.010.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">In sum, the work performed by petitioner\u2019s greenhouse employees constituted \u201cagricultural labor\u201d for purposes of ORS 657.045(1). The ALJ erred in concluding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b134-7\"> The \u201cagricultural labor\u201d exemption does not apply if the employing entity either:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-8\">\u201c(a) During any calendar quarter in the current calendar year or the preceding calendar year paid remuneration in cash of $20,000 or more to individuals employed in agricultural labor; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-9\">\u201c(b) On each of 20 days during the current calendar year or the preceding calendar year, each day being in a different calendar week, employed in agricultural labor for some portion of the day (whether or not at the same moment of time) 10 or more individuals.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">ORS 657.045(l)(a), (b). Here, respondent department does not contend on judicial review that petitioner exceeded either of those limits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b139-7\"> The current version of the statute, unlike the version at issue in <em>Just-A-Mere Farm, </em>specifically addresses the exception\u2019s applicability to forestry activities. <em>See, e.g., </em>ORS 657.045(5) (exception is applicable to Christmas tree farms); ORS 657.045(6) (raising of forestry-type seedlings is agricultural labor when performed in a nursery).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b141-6\"> Indeed, a number of crops, particularly crops grown in greenhouses, may well be harvested on other than an annual basis. <em>Cf. West Foods, Inc. v. Morgan, Orr, </em>16 Or App 613, 519 P2d 1062 (1974) (mushrooms grown in sheds and harvested daily were considered \u201cagricultural or horticultural commodities\u201d for purposes of ORS 657.045).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b141-7\"> In fact, the court went on to note that <em>some </em>of the activities specified in the statute did <em>not </em>fit within its \u201cconcept of farming as it is understood in common parlance.\u201d 247 Or at 419. The court referred particularly to a subsection of the statute (which has since been deleted) that included within \u201cagricultural labor\u201d various packaging and processing of agricultural and horticultural commodities if \u201csuch service is performed as an incident to ordinary farming operations.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
