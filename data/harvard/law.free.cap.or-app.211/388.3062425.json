On appeal, defendant contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress, because the evidence was found after defendant consented to a search of his car at a time when he had been stopped without reasonable suspicion. The state concedes that, under <em>State v. Hall, </em>339 Or 7, 115 P3d 908 (2005), the evidence should have been suppressed. We accept the state\u2019s concession as well-founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
