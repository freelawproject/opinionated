ORS 426.005(l)(d). On the merits, the state concedes that the evidence is insufficient to justify appellant\u2019s involuntary commitment. The state argues, however, that appellant never objected to the sufficiency of the evidence at his commitment hearing and that he \u201cin effect * * * stipulated to the commitment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">We disagree with the state\u2019s contention that appellant failed to preserve the claim of error or stipulated to his commitment. At the commitment hearing, appellant repeatedly stated that he did not want to go to the hospital. He also testified that hospitalization \u201cwon\u2019t do me any good\u201d and asserted \u201cthere\u2019s no reason to put me in a hospital. I\u2019m fine.\u201d Appellant\u2019s objections were sufficient to preserve the claim of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">On <em>de novo </em>review, <em>State v. Hitt, </em>179 Or App 563, 565, 41 P3d 434 (2002), we agree that the evidence in the record is insufficient to establish that appellant suffers from a mental disorder that renders him unable to provide for his basic needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
