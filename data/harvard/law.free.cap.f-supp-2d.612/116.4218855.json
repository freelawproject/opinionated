INTRODUCTION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AtN\">In these products liability cases, Plaintiffs allege that they, or their decedents, suffered suicide-related injuries when their doctors prescribed the drug Neurontin, manufactured by defendants Pfizer and Warner-Lambert Company (\u201cDefendants\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, they allege that Neurontin caused behavioral disturbances, depression, and ultimately suicidal actions (including completed suicide) in over one hundred individuals. Defendants have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>moved to exclude Plaintiffs\u2019 expert testimony on the issue of general causation\u2014 that is, the question of whether Neurontin has the capacity to cause the alleged suicide-related events (suicide attempt, gesture, ideation, and/or completed suicide). (Docket No. 1157.)</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">After a three-day hearing,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> conducted jointly with Justice Marcy S. Friedman of the New York State Supreme Court,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and review of the voluminous briefing and submissions,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the motion is <em>DENIED.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">\n<em>II. BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">A. A Brief History of Neurontin Litigation</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">Defendants manufacture and distribute the prescription drug Neurontin, or gabapentin (generic).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In December 1993, the Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) approved Neurontin for use as an \u201cadjunctive therapy\u201d (i.e., second-line treatment) in the treatment of partial seizures in adults with epilepsy. <em>See In re Neurontin Mktg. and Sale Practices Litig., </em>244 F.R.D. 89, 92 (D.Mass.2007). In May 2002, the FDA approved Neurontin for the management of post-herpetic neuralgia (pain resulting from nerve damage caused by shingles or herpes zoster) in adults. <em>Id. </em>In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Parke-Davis, a division of Warner-Lambert, filed patent applications for Neurontin as a treatment for depression, neurodegenerative disease, mania, and bipolar disorder; Parke-Davis, however, never sought FDA-approval for any of these indications. <em>Id. </em>Without FDA approval of Neurontin for indications beyond epilepsy and post-herpetic neuralgia, the law prohibited Defendants from marketing or promoting Neurontin for other (\u201coff-label\u201d) uses.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b162-14\">As this Court detailed extensively in a prior opinion, Defendants face allegations that they nevertheless engaged in an extensive off-label marketing scheme, promoting Neurontin for a variety of off-label uses, including psychiatric disorders such as bipolar, mood, and anxiety disorders. <em>See id. </em>at 92-103 (detailing the alleged off-label marketing scheme). In July 2004, Defendants pled guilty to two criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>counts related to the off-label marketing and misbranding of Neurontin. Civil actions were filed in federal courts across the country, all of which have been consolidated into the multi-district litigation presently before this Court. The Neurontin multi-district litigation has two distinct parts: (1) \u201cSales and Marketing\u201d actions brought by consumer purchasers and third party payors for damages stemming from Defendants\u2019 alleged fraudulent off-label marketing scheme and (2) \u201cProducts Liability\u201d actions alleging injuries resulting from the prescription and subsequent use of Neurontin. The current motion relates to the products liability actions alleging suicide-related injuries caused by Neurontin.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">B. The Legal Backdrop and the Current Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">In order to prevail in a pharmaceutical personal injury case, a plaintiff must establish two types of causation: general and specific. <em>In re Bextra and Celebrex Mktg. Sales Practices and Prod. Liab. Litig., </em>524 F.Supp.2d 1166, 1171-72 (N.D.Cal.2007) (consumers alleging cardiovascular injury in a products liability suit against drug manufacturer); <em>In re Rezulin Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>369 F.Supp.2d 398, 401-02 (S.D.N.Y.2005) (diabetes patients alleging liver injuries in products liability actions against drug manufacturer). As explained in the Federal Judicial Center\u2019s <em>Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence, </em>\u201cGeneral causation is established by demonstrating, often through a review of scientific and medical literature, that exposure to a substance can cause a particular disease.... Specific, or individual, causation, however, is established by demonstrating that a given exposure is the cause of an individual\u2019s disease____\u201d Mary Sue Henifin et al., <em>Reference Guide on Medical Testimony, </em>in <em>Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence </em>439, 444 (Fed. Judicial Ctr.2d ed.2000) (hereinafter <em>\u201cReference Guide on Medical Testimony </em>\u201d). Only general causation\u2014 whether Neurontin is capable of causing suicide-related events \u2014 is at issue in this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-12\">Plaintiffs offer the testimony of three experts \u2014 Dr. Michael Trimble,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Dr. Stefan Kruszewski,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and Dr. Cheryl Blume<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>\u2014 to establish general causation. They opine that, by altering the brain chemistry of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>users, Neurontin has the biological capacity to cause mood and behavioral changes that predictably result in suicidality. As the Plaintiffs\u2019 key witness on the issue of biological plausibility, Dr. Trimble puts forth a three-step explanation for <em>how </em>Neurontin can cause .such changes: First, gabapentin (Neurontin) increases the amount of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), a neurotransmitter, in the brain. Second, this increase of GABA leads to a decrease of other neurotransmitters in the brain, like serotonin and norepinephrine.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> And third, the decrease of serotonin and norepinephrine can prompt behavioral disturbances, depression, and suicidal behavior. Thus, according to Plaintiffs, taking Neurontin can increase a patient\u2019s risk of suicidality. All three of Plaintiffs\u2019 experts present a variety of scientific evidence, including human and animal studies, case reports, and scientific literature, as support for the position that Neurontin can increase the risk of suicidality in patients.</p>\n<p id=\"AV\">Defendants challenge the admissibility of Plaintiffs\u2019 expert testimony on general causation, asserting that it is insufficiently reliable under <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993), and Federal Rules of Evidence 702 and 703. Defendants contend that Plaintiffs lack scientific evidence demonstrating a statistically significant association between Neurontin and suicide-related events. According to Defendants, this purported omission is a fatal flaw in Plaintiffs\u2019 case. Defendants also attack Plaintiffs\u2019 experts\u2019 three-step theory of biological plausibility, contending that, as a whole, it lacks widespread acceptance in the scientific community and, more specifically, that particular pieces of the theory are contradicted by current scientific literature. Defendants offered three experts of their own \u2014 Dr. Charles Taylor,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Dr. Robert Gibbons,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and Dr. Anthony Rothschild<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u2014 to support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>their contentions, each of whom submitted a report and testified at the hearing.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">C. A Scientific Primer</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">\n<em>1. Evidence of Causation in Medicine &amp; the Courtroom</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Epidemiology is the field of public health and medicine that studies the incidence, distribution, and etiology of disease in human populations with the purpose of better understanding disease causation. Michael D. Green et al., <em>Reference Guide on Epidemiology, </em>in <em>Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence </em>333, 335 (Fed. Judicial Ctr.2d ed.2000) (hereinafter <em>\u201cReference Guide on Epidemiology\u201d). </em>\u201cEpidemiology focuses on the question of general causation (i.e., is the agent capable of causing disease?).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 336.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">\n<em>a. Epidemiological Studies and Statistics</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">Epidemiological studies are research studies designed to identify associations between a drug and a disease. These studies generally \u201cidentiffy] agents that are associated with an increased risk of disease in groups of individuals, quantify] the amount of excess disease that is associated with an agent, and provide[ ] a profile of the type of individual who is likely to contract a disease after being exposed to an agent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 335-336. \u201cAn association is not equivalent to causation,\u201d and so epidemiological studies, on their own, \u201ccannot objectively prove causation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 336, 374. Instead, an identified association must be evaluated by researchers to determine whether the association is causal. <em>Id. </em>at 374 (\u201c[Cjausation is a judgment for epidemiologists and others interpreting the epidemiological data.\u201d). Nevertheless, epidemiological studies are often offered as evidence supporting a theory of general causation in the courtroom. <em>See In re Viagra Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>572 F.Supp.2d 1071, 1078 (D.Minn.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-13\">There are many types of epidemiological studies. The \u201cgold standard\u201d for determining the relationship between a drug and a health outcome is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. <em>Reference Guide on Epidemiology, supra, </em>at 338. In such a trial, subjects are assigned randomly to one of two groups: one receives the drug and the other does not, often receiving a placebo instead. <em>Id. </em>at 338. The study is also \u201cdouble-blind,\u201d meaning that neither the participants nor those conducting the study knows which group is receiving the actual drug and which group is receiving the placebo. <em>Id. </em>These studies are often used to evaluate new drugs or medical treatments, but because ethical constraints preclude exposing human subjects to agents believed to cause adverse effects, these experimental studies cannot be undertaken to investigate a suspicion that a drug increases the risk of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>suicide. <em>Id. </em>at 338-39; <em>Giles v. Wyeth, </em>500 F.Supp.2d 1048, 1058 (S.D.Ill.2007) (\u201cSuicide presents researchers seeking to study it with both ethical and practical difficulties.\u201d). Thus, most epidemiological studies are \u201cobservational,\u201d not experimental like the studies described above. Observational studies compare subjects already exposed to the drug to those not exposed. <em>Reference Guide on Epidemiology, supra, </em>at 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">Oftentimes, epidemiological studies lack the statistical power needed for definitive conclusions, either because they are small or the suspected adverse effect is particularly rare. <em>Id. </em>at 380; <em>see, e.g., Giles, </em>500 F.Supp.2d at 1058 (noting that, \u201c[a]s a rare event, studying [suicide] for purposes of causation requires a huge number of participants\u201d). The technique of meta-analysis, where study results are pooled \u201cto arrive at a single figure to represent the totality of the studies reviewed,\u201d was developed to address such situations. <em>Reference Guide on Epidemiology, supra, </em>at 380. Meta-analysis \u201csystematizes] the time-honored approach of reviewing the literature\u201d and provides a \u201cstandardized framework with quantitative methods for estimating risk.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Meta-analysis is \u201cmost appropriately]\u201d used to pool randomized experimental trials, but \u201cif carefully performed it may also be helpful for observational studies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 361 n. 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">One statistical approach for expressing an association in epidemiologic research, including meta-analyses, is an odds ratio. <em>Id. </em>at 350. An odds ratio \u201cexpresses in quantitative terms the association between exposure to an agent and a disease.\u201d <em>Id. </em>An odds ratio uses a null value of 1.0. An odds ratio greater than 1.0 means that there is a positive association, while an odds ratio lower than 1.0 indicates a negative association.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">Another method for investigating whether a drug is associated with a particular event is risk difference, or attributable risk.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This measure \u201crepresents the amount of disease among exposed individuals that can be attributed to the exposure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 351. Unlike odds ratios, risk differences have a null value of zero. Thus, a risk difference greater than zero suggests a positive association, and a risk difference less than zero suggests a negative association.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">The risk difference method is often used in meta-analyses where many of the individual studies (which are all being pooled together in one, larger analysis) do not contain any individuals who developed the investigated side effect.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Whereas such studies would have to be excluded from an odds ratio calculation, they can be included in a risk difference calculation.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-11\">Regardless of which method \u2014 odds ratio or risk difference \u2014 is used, a finding of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>association is often assessed statistically to determine whether the result likely represents a true association or simply random error. <em>Reference Guide on Epidemiology, supra, </em>at 354. A study found to have \u201cresults that are unlikely to be the result of random error\u201d is labelled \u201cstatistically significant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Statistical significance, however, does not indicate the strength of an association found in a study. <em>Id. </em>at 359. \u201cA study may be statistically significant but may find only a very weak association; conversely, a study with small sample sizes may find a high relative risk but still not be statistically significant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To reach a \u201cmore refined assessment of appropriate inferences about the association found in an epidemiologic study,\u201d researchers rely on another statistical technique known as a \u201cconfidence interval.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 360 (defining a confidence interval as \u201ca range of values calculated from the results of a study, within which the true value is likely to fall\u201d). The width of the confidence interval provides an indication of the precision of the risk figure found in the study. <em>Id. </em>at 389.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">\n<em>b. Non-Epidemiological Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AF\">Medical researchers also rely on a variety of non-epidemiological evidence when assessing causation. For example, researchers often examine and analyze case reports, descriptions of a particular patient\u2019s clinical history and symptoms. As explained in the <em>Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence: </em>\u201cCase reports lack controls and thus do not provide as much information as controlled epidemiological studies do.... Causal attribution based on case studies must be regarded with caution. However, such studies may be carefully considered in light of other information available.\u201d <em>Reference Guide on Medical Testimony, supra, </em>at 475.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">Scientists also look beyond studies on living humans, turning to animals and cell and tissue cultures. Animal studies have the advantage of being able to be conducted as true experiments, with exposure controlled and measured. However, extrapolation from animal studies to humans entails some risks, as physiological differences and dosage differences can complicate comparisons. <em>In re Rezulin Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>369 F.Supp.2d at 406-07 (citing <em>Reference Guide on Epidemiology, supra, </em>at 345-46). Experiments on cell and tissue cultures (either human or animal) are often called <em>in vitro </em>studies, as a means of distinguishing them from in <em>vivo </em>studies, meaning on live humans and animals. <em>Id. </em>While <em>in vitro </em>studies are often used, extrapolation from laboratory conditions to live patients can also be problematic. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\"><em>2. </em>Neurotransmitters<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-11\">Plaintiffs\u2019 theory of how Neurontin causes increased risk of suicide (referred to as a theory of biological plausibility) centers on the impact that Neurontin has on neurotransmitters in the brain. Accordingly, a basic understanding of neurotransmitters is needed to assess Plaintiffs\u2019 theory and Defendants\u2019 challenges to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-12\">A neurotransmitter is a natural signaling chemical contained in the body. Communication between cells is essential to the effective functioning of any complex multicellular organism, and the major mode of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>intercellular communication is the transmission of chemical substances, specifically neurotransmitters. <em>Principles of Pharmacology: The Pathophysiologic Basis of Drug Therapy </em>59 (David E. Golan, et al. eds., 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">A nerve cell, or <em>neuron, </em>is connected to another nerve cell, by a specialized junction called a <em>synapse. </em>In a scenario where Nerve Cell A is going to transmit a signal to Nerve Cell B, Nerve Cell A is called the <em>presynaptic cell, </em>and Nerve Cell B is called the <em>postsynaptic cell. Principles of Neural Science </em>22-23 (Eric R. Kandel et al. eds., 4th ed.2000). The transmission process begins when an electrical signal, known as an action potential, travels through the presynaptic cell (Nerve Cell A) down to its tip, known as the presynaptic terminal. <em>Id. </em>at 21-23. At the presynaptic terminal are collections of synaptic vesicles, each holding thousands of specific neurotransmitters. <em>Id. </em>at 182. Also at the presynaptic terminal are <em>ion channels, </em>designed for rapid information processing; these channels open and close like gates in response to particular electric or chemical signals. <em>Id. </em>at 105-7,182-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">When the signal (action potential) reaches the presynaptic terminal of Nerve Cell A, it causes the channels to open, leading to an influx of calcium ions. This, in turn, triggers the opening of the synaptic vesicles and the release of the packaged neurotransmitters into the area between the two nerve cells, known as the <em>synaptic cleft. Id. </em>at 183, fig. 10-7. Some of these released neurotransmitters then bind to receptor molecules on the post-synaptic cell (Nerve Cell B), causing that cell\u2019s ion channels to open or close, and ultimately creating either an excitatory or inhibitory reaction. <em>Id. </em>at 183-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">Under Plaintiffs\u2019 theory, Neurontin affects several different neurotransmitters in the human brain. First, Plaintiffs contend that Neurontin increases the amount of the neurotransmitter known as GABA in the brain. GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain and spinal cord. Golan, <em>supra, </em>at 147; Kandel, <em>supra, </em>at 214. Second, Plaintiffs contend that the increase in GABA leads to a decrease in several monoamine neurotransmitters,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> namely serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Serotonin is associated with depression and aggression, while norepinephrine is related to movement and depression. (Trimble Rep. 8); <em>see Principles of Neural Science, supra, </em>at 283. Third, an established theory, known as the monoamine theory of depression, states that decreased levels of serotonin and/or norepinephrine neurotransmission causes depression. <em>{See </em>Trimble Rep. 8) (\u201cEarly observations were that drugs which depleted the brain\u2019s reserves of monoamines (serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine in particular) led to depression.\u201d); <em>cf. </em>Golan, <em>supra, </em>at 184. Plaintiffs\u2019 experts also present scientific literature that links low levels of serotonin in the brain to suicidal behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">\n<em>3. How Gabapentin Works: The Scientific Debate</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b168-11\">Plaintiffs\u2019 and Defendants\u2019 experts concur that the scientific mechanism by which gabapentin works is not fully understood. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number><em>(See also </em>Label for Neurontin (Supp. No. 041), April 23, 2009, at 2) (stating that the mechanism by which gabapentin exerts its pain-relief and anticonvulsant actions is \u201cunknown\u201d).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Developed as an antiepileptic compound, \u201c[gjabapentin was originally conceived to be similar in chemical structure (and therefore in function) to ... GABA.\u201d (Taylor Rep. 5.) As the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, GABA has been viewed as a key to designing a therapeutic strategy for epilepsy, a condition precipitated by a lack of inhibition (or an increase in excitation) in some areas of the brain. Thus, many antiepileptic drugs were designed to counteract the over-excitation in an epileptic\u2019s brain by increasing the amount of GABA in the brain. <em>(See </em>Hr\u2019g Tr. 52-3, June 19, 2008 (Trimble.)) Such drugs are often referred to as \u201cGABAergic.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AHX\">Over time, though, researchers began to question whether gabapentin acted in the same way as other GABAergic agents and set out to investigate exactly how the drug worked. Some studies, published in the peer-reviewed literature, have indicated that, rather than acting on GABA-related receptors, gabapentin binds to a subunit of the calcium ion channel located at the edge of a presynaptie nerve cell. (Taylor Rep. 5-6.) Specifically, it is theorized that gabapentin acts at a specific part of the calcium channel known as the alpha-2delta subunit. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Debate over the chemical and pharmacological properties of gabapentin has significant repercussions for this litigation. In advancing their theory of general causation, Plaintiffs characterize gabapentin as a GABAergic drug and rely on studies of other GABAergic drugs which have been shown to lead to negative effects on mood and behavior. <em>(See, e.g., </em>Trimble Rep. 18) (discussing studies that have \u201cshown that ... AEDs [antiepileptic drugs] which increase brain GABA lead to negative effects on mood and behavior\u201d). In fact, when hired by Warner Lambert to investigate the relationship between gabapentin and behavioral disturbances in the mid-1990s, Dr. Trimble (now one of Plaintiffs\u2019 experts) advised the company that one of the strongest associations with anticonvulsant drugs generally was to depression. (Trimble Rep. 29; <em>see </em>Michael Trimble, <em>Psychosis with Gabapentin (Neurontin), </em>May 20, 1995) (Pis.\u2019 Ex. 17.) And, more recently, the FDA has documented a statistically significant association between GABAergic antiepileptic drugs and an increased risk of suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">Defendants, however, contend that the belief that gabapentin is GABAergic (which they admit has been published in peer-reviewed literature) has been \u201cmostly discounted by subsequent research.\u201d (Taylor Rep. 6; <em>see id. </em>at 11-16) (listing and discussing studies which suggest that gabapentin has little, if any, GABAergic qualities). Defendants\u2019 expert Dr. Taylor insists that \u201cgabapentin is both chemically and pharmacologically distinct\u201d from the GABAergic drugs referenced by Plaintiffs\u2019 experts. (Taylor Rep. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">In sum, the parties \u2014 and most significantly their two very qualified experts, Dr. Trimble and Dr. Taylor \u2014 fundamentally disagree as to whether gabapentin is properly deemed GABAergic and, significantly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>whether Plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on comparisons to and extrapolations from studies examining other GABAergic drugs renders their theory of causation unreliable under <em>Daubert,</em><footnotemark><em>25</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">\n<em>III. DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">A. The Court\u2019s Gatekeeping Role</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">The admission of expert evidence is governed by Federal Rule of Evidence 702, which codified the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993), and its progeny. <em>See United States v. Diaz, </em>300 F.3d 66, 73 (1st Cir.2002); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Evid. 702 advisory committee\u2019s note. Rule 702 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-7\">If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if (1) the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods, and (3) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A33\">Fed.R.Evid. 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">The trial court must determine whether the expert\u2019s testimony \u201cboth rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand\u201d and whether the expert is qualified. <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 597, 113 S.Ct. 2786; <em>Diaz, </em>300 F.3d at 73 (\u201c[A] proposed expert witness must be sufficiently qualified to assist the trier of fact, and ... his or her expert testimony must be relevant to the task at hand and rest on a reliable basis.... \u201d). An expert\u2019s methodology is the \u201ccentral focus of a <em>Daubert </em>inquiry,\u201d but a court \u201cmay evaluate the data offered to support an expert\u2019s bottom-line opinions to determine if that data provides adequate support to mark the expert\u2019s testimony as reliable.\u201d <em>RuizTrocke v. Pepsi Cola of P.R. Bottling Co., </em>161 F.3d 77, 81 (1st Cir.1998); <em>see Bonner v.

Fed.R.Evid. 702 advisory committee\u2019s note (citing <em>Bourjaily v. United States, </em>483 U.S. 171, 107 S.Ct. 2775, 97 L.Ed.2d 144 (1987)). \u201cThe proponent need not prove to the judge that the expert\u2019s testimony is correct, but she must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the testimony is reliable.\u201d <em>Moore v. Ashland Chem., Inc., </em>151 F.3d 269, 276 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-12\"><em>Daubert </em>itself listed four factors which should guide judges in this determination: (1) whether the theory or technique can be and has been tested; (2) whether the technique has been subject to peer review and publication; (3) the technique\u2019s known or potential rate of error; (4) the level of the theory\u2019s or technique\u2019s acceptance within the relevant discipline. <em>United States v. Mooney, </em>315 F.3d 54, 62 (1st Cir.2002) (citing <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 593-94, 113 S.Ct. 2786). \u201cThese factors, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>however, are not definitive or exhaustive, and the trial judge enjoys broad latitude to use other factors to evaluate reliability.\u201d <em>Mooney, </em>315 F.3d at 62 (citing <em>Kumho Tire, </em>526 U.S. 137, 153, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 143 L.Ed.2d 238 (1999)); <em>see United States v.

Sandoz Pharm. Corp., </em>295 F.3d 1194, 1197 (11th Cir.2002). When, for example, \u201cthe factual basis of an expert\u2019s testimony is called into question, the district court must determine whether the testimony has \u2018a reliable basis\u2019 in light of the knowledge and experience of the relevant discipline.\u201d <em>Crowe v.

If an expert\u2019s testimony is within \u201cthe range where experts might reasonably differ,\u201d the jury, not the trial court, should be the one to \u201cdecide among the conflicting views of different experts.\u201d <em>Kumho Tire, </em>526 U.S. at 153, 119 S.Ct. 1167. \u201cOnly if the expert\u2019s opinion is so fundamentally unsupported that it can offer no assistance to the jury must such testimony be excluded.\u201d <em>In re Viagra Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>572 F.Supp.2d at 1078 (quoting <em>Bonner, </em>259 F.3d at 929-30). As the First Circuit has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-10\"><em>Daubert </em>does not require that a party who proffers expert testimony carry the burden of proving to the judge that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>expert\u2019s assessment of the situation is correct. As long as an expert\u2019s scientific testimony rests upon \u201cgood grounds, based on what is known,\u201d <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 590, 113 S.Ct. 2786 (internal quotation marks omitted), it should be tested by the adversary process \u2014 competing expert testimony and active cross-examination \u2014 rather than excluded from jurors\u2019 scrutiny for fear that they will not grasp its complexities or satisfactorily weigh its inadequacies, <em>see id. </em>at 596, 113 S.Ct. 2786. In short, <em>Daubert </em>neither requires nor empowers trial courts to determine which of several competing scientific theories has the best provenance. It demands only that the proponent of the evidence show that the expert\u2019s conclusion has been arrived at in a scientifically sound and methodologically reliable fashion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-4\"><em>Ruiz-Troche, </em>161 F.3d at 85. It is with these principles in mind that the Court assesses Defendants\u2019 motion to exclude.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">B. Epidemiological Evidence of an Association between Neurontin and Suicide</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">\n<em>1. Hiking Bradford Hill</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">Defendants\u2019 first attack on Plaintiffs\u2019 evidence of general causation is that Plaintiffs fail to cite to any epidemiological study demonstrating a statistically significant association between Neurontin and suicide-related events. Without solid evidence of such an association, Defendants contend that Plaintiffs\u2019 experts\u2019 theory of <em>how </em>Neurontin might induce suicide-related events in patients is irrelevant and inadmissible. Referring to the Bradford Hill criteria (discussed further below), Defendants contend that failing to first identify an association between the drug and the negative effect before beginning a causation analysis violates the generally accepted methodology for establishing causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">Epidemiologic studies, while considered to be \u201cpowerful evidence of causation,\u201d are not required to prove causation in a pharmaceutical personal injury case. <em>See, e.g., Rider, </em>295 F.3d at 1198-99 (citing Eighth, Tenth, and Eleventh Circuit decisions holding that epidemiology is not required to prove causation in a toxic tort case); <em>In re Meridia Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>328 F.Supp.2d 791, 800-01 (N.D.Ohio 2004) (surveying the pre- and <em>post-Daubert </em>landscape and concluding that \u201cno court has held that epidemiological evidence is necessary to establish general causation when other methods of proof are available\u201d), aff<em>'d, </em>447 F.3d 861 (6th Cir.2006). While an epidemiological study is not <em>per se </em>required, establishing general causation without some \u201cconfirmatory\u201d evidence of an association between the drug and the negative effect can be an uphill battle. <em>See Lynch v. Merrell-Nat\u2019l Labs., </em>830 F.2d 1190, 1194 (1st Cir.1987) (holding, in a <em>pre-Daubert </em>opinion, that without \u201cconfirmatory epidemiological data,\u201d animal studies and extrapolations from studies of analogous drugs cannot establish causation in human beings); <em>see e.g., Rider, </em>295 F.3d at 1202 (noting that plaintiffs can prove causation via non-epidemiological evidence but holding the evidence in that case to be insufficient).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">Defendants are correct in their assertion that an association is the starting point for the Bradford Hill criteria, one accepted approach to establishing causation. <em>See Dunn v. Sandoz Pharms. Corp., </em>275 F.Supp.2d 672, 678 (M.D.N.C.2003) (concluding, in a <em>Daubert </em>inquiry, that an epidemiological study demonstrating an association is a prerequisite for proper application of Bradford Hill criteria). Developed by Sir Bradford Hill in the 1960s, the criteria are nine factors which researchers often consider when judging whether an observed association is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>truly causal. The Bradford Hill criteria are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-4\">(1) strength of the association;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-5\">(2) consistency;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-6\">(3) specificity of the association;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-7\">(4) temporality;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-8\">(5) dose-response curve;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-9\">(6) biological plausibility;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-10\">(7) coherence (with other knowledge);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-11\">(8) experiment; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-12\">(9) analogy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-13\">A. Bradford Hill, <em>The Environment and Disease: Association or Causation?, </em>58 Proc. Royal Soc\u2019y Med. 295 (1965) (Defs.\u2019 Ex. 16); <em>see Gannon v.

Passenger Corp., </em>137 F.Supp.2d 147, 167-68 (E.D.N.Y.2001) (same). These factors are viewed as guidelines, and it is acknowledged that each factor need not be fulfilled in order for a researcher to proclaim causation. See A. Bradford Hill, <em>supra, </em>at 11 (\u201cNone of my nine viewpoints can bring indisputable evidence for or against the cause-and-effect hypothesis and none can be required as a <em>sine qua </em>non.\u201d); <em>Reference Guide on Epidemiology, supra, </em>at 375 (referring to the criteria as \u201cguidelines\u201d and noting that the \u201cdrawing of causal inferences is informed by scientific expertise\u201d as opposed to a strict scientific methodology).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b173-15\">Several courts have recognized the Bradford Hill criteria as a generally accepted \u201ctool for determining whether an epidemiological study establishes causation.\u201d <em>Dunn, </em>275 F.Supp.2d at 678-79 (citing \u201cthe small number\u201d of reported federal and state cases discussing the criteria). Other courts have found the Bradford Hill criteria neither \u201cnecessary [n]or helpful.\u201d <em>In re Phenylpropanolamine (PPA) Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>289 F.Supp.2d 1230, 1243 n. 13 (W.D.Wash.2003). And in the context of a general causation challenge, failure to satisfy the Bradford Hill criteria does not doom admission under <em>Daubert. See, e.g., In re Viagra Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>572 F.Supp.2d at 1081 (\u201cThe Court agrees that the Bradford Hill criteria are helpful for determining reliability but rejects Pfizer\u2019s suggestion that any failure to satisfy those criteria provides independent grounds for granting its <em>Daubert </em>Motion.\u201d); <em>Dunn, </em>275 F.Supp.2d at 680 (rejecting an expert\u2019s Bradford Hill-based testimony because he lacked evidence of an association but separately considering \u201cwhether [the plaintiff] can establish general causation independent of the Bradford Hill criteria\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-19\">Although courts have not embraced the Bradford Hill criteria as a litmus test of general causation, both parties repeatedly refer to the criteria, seemingly agreeing that it is a useful launching point and guide. Accordingly, this Court will begin its inquiry by evaluating Plaintiffs\u2019 evidence of an association between Neurontin and suicide-related events, the starting point for an investigation under the criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-20\">\n<em>2. The FDA Study</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b173-21\">Plaintiffs trumpet a recent study conducted by the FDA that contains epidemiological data supporting their experts\u2019 theories of general causation. In early 2005, the FDA initiated an inquiry into whether the use of antiepileptic drugs (\u201cAEDs\u201d) led to an elevated risk of suicidality, defined as suicidal behavior or ideation.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>After collecting data from manufacturers, the FDA conducted a meta-analysis, analyzing reports of suicidality from 199 placebo-controlled clinical studies covering eleven different AEDS, including Neuron-tin (gabapentin).

The Statistical Review\u2019s Executive Summary states: \u201cIn conclusion, antiepileptic drugs are associated with increased risk of suicidality relative to placebo in randomized placebo-controlled trials. The effect appears consistent among the group of 11 drugs.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>(Statistical Review 6.) The review also revealed that the eleven drugs had been divided into three subgroups chosen by the medical officers from the FDA\u2019s Division of Neurology. Gabapentin, along with four other drugs, was placed within the GABAergic and GABAmimetic drug group. <em>{Id. </em>at 13.) When tested by drug group, the GABAergic/GABAmimetic group demonstrated a statistically significant association with increased risk of suicidal behavior or ideation. <em>{Id. </em>at 32, fig. 7.) Finally, the statistical review revealed that, in addition to the primary analysis, the FDA also conducted three sensitivity analyses to examine the robustness of its primary analytical method.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">On July 10, 2008, the FDA held a Joint Meeting of the Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee (\u201cPCNS\u201d) and the Psychopharmacologic Drag Advisory Committee (\u201cPDAC\u201d).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The meeting was open to the public and offered \u201cinterested persons\u201d the opportunity to \u201cpresent data, information, or views, orally or in writing.\u201d Meeting Notice, 73 Fed.Reg. 32588 (June 9, 2008). The Committee heard presentations from representatives of two drug manufacturers of AEDs contained within the FDA\u2019s study, including Defendant Pfizer, and additional statements from an FDA Safety Reviewer. Discussing the significance and methodology of the FDA\u2019s meta-analysis, Dr. Russell Katz, the FDA Director of the Division of Neurology Products, stated: \u201cWe\u2019re unequivocally comfortable with ... saying that this establishes causality.\u201d (Transcript of the Joint Meeting of the Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee and the Psychopharmacologic Drag Advisory Committee, July 10, 2008, at 90) (Docket No. 1365, Ex. G) (hereinafter \u201cFDA Hr\u2019g Tr.\u201d).<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Emphasizing that the agency had applied its regular methodology for determining causality, Dr. Katz then repeated his position that the FDA is \u201cquite comfortable with saying there is causality.\u201d (FDA Hr\u2019g Tr. 90.)</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">At the close of the meeting, the Committee members voted on four questions. First, the Committee, with twenty in favor and one abstention, voted to affirm the FDA\u2019s overall finding of an increase in suicidality for the eleven AEDs analyzed. Second, the Committee, with eighteen in favor and three against, affirmed the FDA\u2019s conclusion that the finding of increased suicidality should apply to each of the eleven drags in the analyses. Third, the Committee, with fifteen in favor, five against, and one abstention, affirmed the FDA\u2019s conclusion that the finding should apply to all currently approved chronically administered AEDs, including drugs beyond the eleven included in the analysis. Finally, the Committee rejected, by a vote of fourteen to four with three abstentions, a proposal to place a \u201cblack box\u201d warning (the most serious available) on the labels for all AEDs. However, the Committee did approve, by a vote of seventeen to four, a proposed labeling change for AED medication guides.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">On December 16, 2008, the FDA announced that it had completed its analysis and, based on the outcome of its review, is requiring all manufacturers of antiepileptie/anticonvulsant drugs to include a warn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>ing in their labeling and to inform patients of the risks of suicidal thoughts and actions. (See Updated FDA Alert, Dee. 16, 2008 (Docket No. 1600, Ex. A.)) The FDA stated that the general consistency of results among drugs with \u201cvarying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all antiepileptic drugs used for any indication,\u201d <em>id,., </em>but did not articulate a theory as to how such drugs increased the risk of suicidal thoughts and actions in patients. (Press Release, FDA News, FDA Requires Warnings about Risk of Suicidal Thoughts and Behavior for Antiepileptic Medications, Dec. 16, 2008) (stating that the biological reasons for the increased risk are \u201cunknown\u201d) (Docket No. 1600, Ex.

Entrusted with the responsibility of protecting the public from dangerous drugs, the FDA regularly relies on a risk-utility analysis, balancing the possible harm against the beneficial uses of a drug. Understandably, the agency may choose to \u201cerr on the side of caution,\u201d <em>Rider, </em>295 F.3d at 1201, and take regulatory action such as revising a product label or removing a drug from the marketplace \u201cupon a lesser showing of harm to the public than the preponderance-of-the-evidence or more-like-than-not standard used to assess tort liability.\u201d <em>McClain v. Metabolife Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>401 F.3d 1233, 1250 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Glastetter v. Novartis Pharm. Corp., </em>252 F.3d 986, 991 (8th Cir.2001)). In fact, FDA regulations provide that the agency can issue an Alert or warning label even before causation is established, (Hr\u2019g Tr. 128-9, June 19, 2008 (Blume)), and the agency has, in a recent guidance document, stated that it has \u201cbegun taking a more comprehensive approach to making information on potential drug risks available to the public earlier.\u201d (FDA Amicus Br. 2) (quoting Guidance: Drug Safety Information-FDA\u2019s Communication to the Public (March 2007)).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>This earlier disclosure allows \u201chealthcare professionals and patients [to] ... consider the information when making decisions about medical treatment\u201d even when there may be \u201cuncertainties in the data.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3. As such, the decision by the FDA to require warnings on a drug label, without more, does not suffice to establish causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">Plaintiffs argue persuasively that even if this Court does not consider the FDA study as definitive proof of general causation, the study nevertheless qualifies as powerful epidemiological evidence establishing an association between Neurontin and suicidality. Whether the FDA meta-analysis is properly termed an epidemiological study is an area of dispute between the parties. Defendants\u2019 expert Dr. Gibbons acknowledged that some would call it an epidemiological study, but disagreed with that characterization. (Hr\u2019g Tr. 299-300, June 20, 2008.) He takes the position that, because the meta-analysis combined the results of many small clinical trials, it does not bear the hallmark characteristic of an epidemiological study, which, he says, typically involves very large populations. <em>(Id.) </em>On the other hand, Plaintiffs\u2019 experts Blume and Trimble \u2014 who are not epidemiologists or biostatisticians but work regularly with such data \u2014 both testified that the study qualified as an epidemiological study. (Hr\u2019g Tr. 57, June 19, 2008 (Trimble); Hr\u2019g Tr. 170,174, June 20, 2008 (Blume.)) Moreover, the <em>Reference Guide on Epidemiology </em>suggests that a meta-analysis can itself be deemed an epidemiological study. <em>See Reference Guide on Epidemiology, supra, </em>at 380. For reasons discussed below, the Court finds that the FDA study is an epidemiological study that may be considered on the question of whether the Plaintiffs have produced evidence of an association between Neurontin and suicidality (the starting point for a causal inquiry under Bradford Hill).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">\n<em>a. Dr. Gibbons\u2019 Critique</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Defendants strenuously argue that the FDA study contains methodological flaws, which produce a misleading picture of the data. In their view, the data actually suggest that only two of the eleven drugs\u2014 neither of which is Neurontin \u2014 are associated with increased suicidality. Thus, Defendants maintain that any claim that the FDA Alert demonstrates an association between Neurontin and suicidality is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">Defendants\u2019 expert Dr. Robert Gibbons critiques the FDA study, stating that it fell prey to what he describes as a serious, but not uncommon, problem with meta-analyses: that a subset of the studies can \u201cdrive the overall results, making it appear as if there\u2019s an overall effect that\u2019s consistent.\u201d (Hr\u2019g Tr. 380-81, July 23, 2008.) Here, Dr. Gibbons points the finger at two of the eleven drugs: \u201cMy postmortem on the FDA Alert is that the entire analysis was driven by lamotrigine and topiramate. If those two drugs were not a part of FDA\u2019s analysis, there would be no FDA Alert on anticonvulsants.\u201d The issue raised by Dr. Gibbons is often referred to as \u201ctrial heterogeneity.\u201d (Hr\u2019g Tr. 320-21, June 20, 2008.) Gibbons highlights the fact that sixty-one percent of all of the suicidality events (thoughts and behaviors) observed in the entire meta-analysis came from the lamotrigine and topiramate studies, even though these two drugs account for only thirty-eight percent of the total data. (Supp. Expert Rep. of Robert D. Gibbons, July 11, 2008 at 2) (Docket No. 1363, Ex. A.) (hereinafter \u201cGibbons July Rep.\u201d). Moreover, he points out that these two drugs were the only ones in the analysis which demonstrated a statistically significant increased risk in both the primary and secondary sensitivity analyses. (Gibbons July Rep. 2; Statistical Review at 24, fig. 2; 26, fig. 4.) While several other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>drugs, including Neurontin, demonstrated a positive association with suicidality events, these associations were not statistically significant. As further evidence for his position, Dr. Gibbons offered his own analysis of the data, in which he separated lamotrigine and topiramate from the other nine AEDs in the meta-analysis. While lamotrigine and topiramate together demonstrated a statistically significant association, the other nine AEDs in combination did not. (Gibbons July Rep. \u00b6 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b178-3\">The \u201crevelation\u201d that these two drugs are driving the entire study, according to Dr. Gibbons, undercuts two FDA conclusions upon which Plaintiffs rely: (1) that the results were consistent among the eleven drugs, and (2) the FDA\u2019s finding of a statistically significant association within the GABAergie or GABAmimetic drug subgroup, a group which included both topiramate and Neurontin.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">With respect to the GABAergic/GABA mimetic subgroup, Gibbons again insists that topiramate was the driving force behind the statistically significant finding; without topiramate, the remaining four drugs in the GABAergie subgroup together have an incidence rate of suicide events \u201cvirtually identical\u201d to patients treated with placebo and thus producing no signal, much less one with statistical significance. (Gibbons \u00b6 4; Hr\u2019g Tr. 320, June 20, 2008 (Gibbons.)) Gibbons also points out that topiramate, which was found to increase the risk of suicidality in patients approximately two-and-a-half times, was the only one of the five drugs which, when analyzed independently, produced a statistically significant association. Grouping these five drugs together was therefore, according to Gibbons, empirically inappropriate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-5\">[Tjhese five drugs are showing very different results. Topiramate is going one way, and all of the other drugs are going the other way.... [F]rom an empirical basis, based solely on the numbers ... it\u2019s inappropriate to apply a statistical method that assumes that all five of these drugs have a common risk.... You cannot come up with a reliable conclusion about the pooled risk when you have that level of heterogeneity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">(Hr\u2019g Tr. 321-22, June 20, 2008.)</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">Having laid out his argument as to why the FDA\u2019s overall finding of an increased risk of suicidality and its particular finding of an increased risk within the GABAergie subgroup are flawed, Dr. Gibbons next turns his eye to the gabapentin-specific data. In the FDA\u2019s primary analysis, gabapentin yielded an odds ratio of 1.57, indicating a positive association between the drug and suicidal behavior or ideation. However, Gibbons emphasizes that the perceived association had an extremely wide confidence interval (.12 to 47.66) and was not statistically significant; thus the possibility that the association occurred by chance cannot be ruled out. (FDA Statistical Review 24, fig. 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">Dr. Gibbons also attacks the FDA study for employing an odds ratio methodology, in which the FDA excluded all studies where no suicidality events occurred (\u201czero event\u201d studies) from its primary meta-analysis. <em>See </em>discussion <em>supra, </em>at Part ILC.l.a. Gibbons maintains that because only three of the forty-nine studies on Neurontin submitted to the FDA by Defendants included qualifying incidents of suicidality (two incidents of suicidal ideation in Neurontin-treated patients and one in a patient receiving a placebo), this approach translated to the exclusion of the vast majority of the gabapentin data from the initial FDA analysis, arguably skewing the gabapentin-specific analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">The FDA, however, did not ignore this limitation. As part of its sensitivity analysis, the FDA applied a risk difference analysis (an alternative method which does not require the exclusion of zero event stud<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>ies), <em>see </em>discussion <em>supra, </em>Part II.C.1.a, to all of the data submitted for each of the eleven drugs. Here, the gabapentin-specific data yielded a 0.28 risk difference, indicating a positive association. Gibbons emphasizes that it is a small association that was deemed not statistically significant. Gibbons characterized this finding as evidence indicating that \u201cfor gabapentin, [there was] no increased risk of suicidality observed.\u201d (Gibbons July Rep. \u00b6 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">In sum, Dr. Gibbons concludes that, in light of what he deems serious methodological and analytical flaws, the FDA\u2019s statement that \u201cthe results were generally consistent among all the different drug products\u201d is not supported by the data. (Gibbons July Rep. \u00b6 6.) Gibbons contends that the agency selected \u201creally bad methods\u201d for examining \u201cwhether or not the effects they were seeing applied to all of the drugs.\u201d (Hr\u2019g Tr. 401-02, July 23, 2008.) For Gibbons, the bottom line is that, in his view, neither the FDA study nor any evidence put forth by Plaintiffs demonstrates that gabapentin itself is associated with suicidality or supports a conclusion of a causal link between gabapentin and suicidality. (Gibbons May Rep. 16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">\n<em>b. Does the FDA Study Withstand Dr. Gibbons\u2019Critique?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Dr. Gibbons has presented a powerful critique of the FDA\u2019s statistical analysis and its conclusion that the increased risk of suicidality detected in its meta-analysis is \u201cconsistent among the group of 11 drugs.\u201d (FDA Statistical Review 6.) However, on balance, Dr. Gibbons\u2019 criticism of the FDA\u2019s statistical methods and conclusions \u2014 particularly its conclusion of consistency in effect among the eleven drugs\u2014 affects the weight that should be given to the study, not its admissibility. First, the underlying data for the FDA\u2019s meta-analysis were placebo-controlled, clinical studies, the \u201cgold standard\u201d for epidemiological evidence.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> And, as the <em>Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence </em>explains, pooling such evidence is the \u201cmost appropriate\u201d application of the meta-analysis method. <em>Reference Guide on Epidemiology, supra, </em>at 380.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">Moreover, the FDA has continued to stand by its statistical methods and conclusions even after considering the very concerns raised by Dr. Gibbons. As detailed in the Statistical Review, the FDA conducted several sensitivity analyses \u201cto examine the robustness\u201d of the results generated by the study\u2019s primary analysis. (FDA Statistical Review 43.) In fact, two of the sensitivity analyses addressed the key concerns raised by Gibbons. One sensitivity analysis specifically examined the question of trial heterogeneity, the primary critique raised by Dr. Gibbons. The FDA applied two separate tests to evaluate whether all eleven drugs were properly grouped together in the primary analysis or whether the drugs\u2019 \u201ctreatment effects\u201d were too heterogenous \u2014 or different from each other \u2014 to justify such pooling. While the first test was inconclusive, the second model produced a result that convinced the FDA that \u201ctrial heterogeneity was not a major concern\u201d and that, therefore, it was appropriate to group all eleven drugs together in the meta-analysis. (FDA Statistical Review 27.)</p>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">At the Advisory Committee meeting three statisticians expressed general approval of the FDA\u2019s technical approach to the study\u2019s analyses. Then, the entire group was asked whether they agreed with the Agency\u2019s overall finding of an increase in suicidality for the eleven AEDs analyzed. The Committee voted yes, with a tally of twenty to zero (with one abstention). The second question was whether \u201cthe Committee agree[s] with the Agency\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>conclusion that [the] finding of increased suicidality should apply to all, or each, of the drugs included in the analysis, despite the observation that the odds ratio for two of the drugs was below one.\u201d (FDA Hr\u2019g Tr. 94.) Again, the Committee signaled its agreement with the FDA, with eighteen members voting \u201cyes\u201d and three voting \u201cno.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">Perhaps most persuasive is that these votes each came <em>after </em>the Committee members had heard Dr. Christopher Wohlberg, on behalf of Pfizer, argue that it was improper to pool the eleven drugs together and that the effects were not consistent across all eleven drugs. <em>(Id. </em>at 37.) In fact, Dr. Wohlberg articulated the very point Dr. Gibbons emphasized in his testimony: that topiramate and lamotrigine were driving the results of the study. <em>(Id. </em>at 38.) Yet, even after this testimony, this blue ribbon Committee voted to affirm the FDA\u2019s methods and conclusion of consistency among the eleven drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">In addition, Plaintiffs\u2019 expert Dr. Sander Greenland,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> a statistician and epidemiologist, rebuts many of Dr. Gibbons\u2019 arguments. Greenland concludes that \u201c[t]he FDA Analysis was in all respects conducted properly and followed the current best standards of practice.\u201d (Decl. of Sander Greenland, July 22, 2008, at 2.) Dr. Greenland also declared that he \u201cconcur[s] with the ... vote of the ... Advisory Committee, agreeing with the FDA finding of increase in suicidality for the drugs examined.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 11.) Thus, while reputable experts may disagree as to the strength of the study\u2019s methodology and its findings, this Court considers the FDA study to be <em>reliable </em>and potent evidence supporting an association between Neurontin and depression or suicidality.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">c. <em>Drug-specific Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"An1\">Still, the FDA study is not a silver bullet for Plaintiffs. Standing alone, the Neurontin-specific data produced a positive association, but not a statistically significant one. Defendants insist that the FDA\u2019s findings of association (overall and within the GABAergic subgroup) are not an adequate substitute for a drug-specific statistically significant finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">Statistical significance is one of the factors the Court should examine when determining whether a drug can cause an adverse event. <em>See Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 594, 113 S.Ct. 2786 (\u201c[I]n the case of a particular scientific technique, the court ordinarily should consider the known or potential rate of error.\u201d). Drug-specific statistical significance, though, is not always required where it is not reasonably attainable. In <em>Kennedy v. Collagen Corporation, </em>161 F.3d 1226, 1228 (9th Cir.1998), the Ninth Circuit reversed the trial court\u2019s exclusion of general causation testimony because the trial court had improperly \u201cfocused on the lack of specific studies\u201d proving the particular collagen product at issue caused the disease. The <em>Kennedy </em>court emphasized that epidemiological studies linking the collagen product to the disease \u201cwould be almost impossible to perform.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1229; <em>see also Giles, </em>500 F.Supp.2d at 1058-61 (allowing plaintiff to present her theory of general causation and discussing the difficulties of studying suicide and suicidality for purposes of causation).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>As discussed above, because suicide is a rare event, large numbers of subjects are needed to produce informative results. <em>(Id.) </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 experts point out that the gabapentin studies submitted to the FDA are simply too small and contain too few high-risk psychiatric patients to produce an informative finding as to whether gabapentin itself is associated with an increased risk of suicide. Dr. Trimble explains that the placebo-controlled studies used in the meta-analysis are designed for therapeutic, not adverse effect, inquiries. Here, because Neurontin was developed and initially approved as an antiseizure medication, the pool did not include many- psychiatric patients. This potential bias was further compounded by the purposeful exclusion of many psychiatric patients based on previous studies indicating that GABAergie antiseizure medications may have serious behavioral impacts. As a result, in Trimble\u2019s view, the gabapentin-specific data did not include enough psychiatric, or high risk, patients necessary to establish a link between Neurontin and suicide-related side effects.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> (Hr\u2019g Tr. 74-76, June 19, 2008.)</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">From a statistical viewpoint, Dr. Greenland adds his conclusion that, because (or at least partially because) the gabapentin data was dominated by low risk patients, the data was so \u201cunderpowered\u201d that there was \u201cover a 90% chance that a doubling of risk by gabapentin would go <em>undetected </em>by the gabapentin trials.\u201d (Decl. of Sander Greenland, July 22, 2008, at 8) (emphasis in original). This, in Greenland\u2019s view, makes it \u201call the more remarkable that the gabapentin trials were able to see as much of a risk increase as they did (a risk ratio of 1.49).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Accordingly, in these circumstances, the fact that there is no statistically significant information about Neurontin alone is not dispositive,, particularly since there is statistically significant information about the class of drugs and other indicia of reliability. <em>Cf. In re Viagra Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>572 F.Supp.2d at 1081 (holding, in a pharmaceutical drug products liability multidistrict litigation, that an expert\u2019s report was reliable even though there was no statistically significant epidemiological data because it was based upon studies that were peer-reviewed, published, contained known rates of error and resulted from generally accepted experience or research data); <em>In re PPA Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>289 F.Supp.2d at 1241.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">In pressing their theory that gabapentin increases the risk of suicide, Plaintiffs seek to extrapolate not only from the FDA\u2019s overall finding that \u201cantiepileptic drugs are associated with increased risk of suicidality\u201d (Statistical Review 6), but also from the finding of a statistically significant association within the GABAergie or GABAmimetic drug subgroup, which included Neurontin and four other drugs. (Statistical Review 32, Fig. 7.)</p>\n<p id=\"b181-12\">Extrapolating from drugs within the same class is permissible, so long as there is there is scientific evidence supporting the analogy. <em>See Kennedy, </em>161 F.3d at 1230 (deeming admissible an expert\u2019s testimony that was based on analogous reasoning). Other courts have wrestled with the question of whether an analogy between drugs in the same class is reliable enough to support a plaintiffs theory of general causation.

Defendants, via Dr. Taylor, argue that \u201cgabapentin is both chemically and pharmacologically distinct\u201d from other GABAergic drugs and that drawing analogies between gabapentin and these drugs is \u201cnot a reliable or generally accepted methodology.\u201d (Taylor Aff. \u00b6 13, March 12, 2008) (provided at hearing). Citing to peer-reviewed and published articles, Dr. Taylor asserts that current reviews of gabapentin\u2019s mechanism of action have undermined the FDA\u2019s classification of gabapentin as GABAergic. (Taylor Rep. 5, 10-16.) In essence, Defendants boldly invite the Court to proclaim the FDA and its panel of blue-ribbon experts dead wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">However, in contrast to the cases cited above, Plaintiffs\u2019 experts present convincing scientific evidence as to why the analogy between Neurontin and other GABAergic antiepileptic drugs makes sense and is sufficiently reliable. Plaintiffs\u2019 expert Dr. Trimble states, \u201cIt has been shown experimentally in the peer-reviewed scientific literature that gabapentin significantly and reliably increases the quantity of [central nervous system] GABA in the human brain.\u201d (Trimble Rep. 25.) Trimble then cites and discusses two peer-reviewed studies measuring changes in GABA levels after administration of gabapentin in humans <em>in vivo </em>\u2014 both of which he characterizes as supporting the proposition that gabapentin is GABAergic.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Dr. Trimble also cites to an <em>in vitro </em>study of gabapentin-treated human neocortical tissue which reported an increase in GABA, confirming the results of the two studies performed on live patients.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> <em>(Id.) </em>Moreover, citing published literature<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> and in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>ternal Pfizer documents,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Plaintiffs\u2019 experts demonstrate that gabapentin has been presented by Pfizer as a GABAergic drug and generally regarded as such in the scientific community (particularly the epilepsy research community). <em>(See, e.g., </em>Trimble Rep. 23-24); (Hr\u2019g Tr. 92, June 19, 2008 (Trimble) (stating that when study results first indicated that gabapentin was GABAergic, the \u201cnews was heralded with great enthusiasm\u201d by Defendants.)) Most notably, Dr. Trimble cites to a 2003 company email which not only references multiple studies finding that gabapentin causes an increase in GABA in the human brain, but also acknowledges that the increases in GABA \u201cmight contribute to ... adverse events in humans.\u201d (E-mail from Douglas Feltner to Charles Taylor, Elizabeth Carofalo, Chiara DePaolis, Brian Corrigan, Timothy Wang, and Douglas Feltner (Oct. 14, 2003)) (Pis.\u2019 Ex. 51.) In sum, Dr. Trimble describes the conclusion that Neurontin is a GABAergic drug as \u201csecure,\u201d stating, \u201c[a]t no time has there been in the scientific literature a specific rejection of the GABAergic properties of neurontin.\u201d (Trimble Rep. 23, 41.)</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Significantly, Defendants do not dispute that gabapentin has been shown to prompt an increase in whole-tissue brain concentrations of GABA, but assert that these findings do not establish that gabapentin is \u201cGABAergic\u201d because they do not prove either that gabapentin impacts GABA within specific GABA neurons or synapses or actually affects the function of the GABA neurotransmitters. This argument highlights yet another dispute among experts. Under defense expert Dr. Taylor\u2019s definition, for a drug to be deemed GABAergic, it must act on specific GABA receptors or GABA neurons and effect the release or function of GABA. (Taylor Rep. 9, 14-15.) On the other hand, Plaintiffs\u2019 expert Dr. Trimble states that, among epilepsy specialists and biological psychiatrists, GABAergic is defined as a drug that increases either the amount or the effect of GABA.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> (Hr\u2019g Tr. 43-44, June 19, 2008.) Even more variations of the definition exist, as Dr. Taylor readily admitted that there is no generally accepted definition in the field. (Hr\u2019g Tr. 347, June 20, 2008) (\u201c[I]f you asked ten different people, you might get at least three different answers.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">Putting this definitional dispute aside, it is undisputed that Defendants designed gabapentin as a GABAergic drug. <em>(See </em>Taylor Rep. 5, 10.) Although Defendants maintain that the \u201cgabapentin as GABAergic\u201d literature cited by Plaintiffs is outdated, the FDA, by keeping gabapentin in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>the GABAergic subgroup, still adheres to the traditional view, rejecting the Pfizer position. In addition, as discussed above, Plaintiffs\u2019 experts cite to several articles published in recent years identifying gabapentin as GABAergic, and even Dr. Taylor has acknowledged that several posb-2000 studies have reported findings indicating that gabapentin has a functional impact on GABA. <em>(See </em>Taylor Rep. 12 (acknowledging that \u201csome investigators have reported a functional action of gabapentin <em>... in vitro ... </em>that is similar to those of known GABA(B) agonists\u201d); Taylor Rep. 13 (acknowledging several studies demonstrating an effect of gabapentin on release of GABA in vitro and a 2001 study showing that gabapentin increased the number of GABA transport proteins present at the cell membrane\u201d).)<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Finally, Dr. Trimble firmly stated that he, and many of his colleagues in the epilepsy field, still view gabapentin as a GABAergic agent. (Hr\u2019g Tr. 91-92, June 19, 2008.) Under <em>Daubert, </em>Plaintiffs do not have to demonstrate that all scientists believe that gabapentin <em>is </em>GABAergic, but simply that their experts\u2019 \u201ctestimony rests upon \u2018good grounds, based on what is known.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ruiz-Troche, </em>161 F.3d at 85 (quoting <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 590, 113 S.Ct. 2786). While Pfizer has presented scientific evidence to support its view that Neurontin may differ from traditional GABAergic antiepileptic drugs, Plaintiffs \u2014 via their own scientific evidence and the methodology employed by the FDA \u2014 have demonstrated that gabapentin is sufficiently similar to these drugs to render pooling and extrapolation \u201cscientifically sound and methodologically reliable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">In sum, this Court views the FDA findings as reliable evidence of an association between Neurontin and an increased risk of suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">\n<em>S. The Collins &amp; McFarland Study</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 experts also rely on a study and peer-reviewed article, authored by Jon C. Collins and Bentson H. McFarland, as evidence of an association between Neurontin and suicide.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The study compared rates of completed suicide and suicide attempts among patients with bipolar disorder taking four different drugs. (Collins &amp; McFarland Study at 2.) The gabapentin group demonstrated the \u201chighest rate\u201d of completed suicides (3.5 per thousand person-years) among all four drugs. <em>Id. </em>at 4. When compared to lithium (which exhibited the lowest rate), gabapentin was found to have a statistically significant greater risk of suicide completion (2.6 times) and a greater, but not statistically significant, risk of suicide attempt (1.6 times).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">- The experts have varied interpretations of this study. Dr. Trimble characterized the study as one \u201cof great importance,\u201d emphasizing that it \u201cshowed a significant over-representation of patients on gabapentin for suicide deaths.\u201d (Trimble Rep. 19.) But Dr. Greenland, Plaintiffs\u2019 expert statistician, cautions that the study has limitations: the study\u2019s findings cannot indicate whether gabapentin is only \u201criskier\u201d than lithium (which is considered by some researchers to help prevent suicidal behavior) or whether it actually is associated with an increased risk of suicid\u00e9 in general patient populations, bipolar or otherwise. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>(Expert Report of Sander Greenland, Oct. 19, 2007, at 3-6.) Defendants\u2019 experts argue that the study\u2019s data demonstrates that Neurontin is actually protective of suicide \u2014 the exact opposite of Plaintiffs\u2019 characterization of the findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">While the Collins &amp; McFarland study is consistent with the FDA\u2019s findings, Defendants have the better argument that it does not provide independent proof of an association or causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">C. Plaintiffs\u2019 Theory of Biological Plausibility</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Having established an association between Neurontin and an increased risk of suicide, Plaintiffs have satisfied the prerequisite for a causation analysis using the Bradford Hill methodology. <em>See Dunn, </em>275 F.Supp.2d at 678. In addition to lengthy debate over the existence, strength, and specificity of the association, most of the hearing focused on the question of biological plausibility, a key factor in the Bradford Hill analysis. Plaintiffs\u2019 experts put forward a three-step theory for how Neurontin can cause mood and behavioral changes that predictably result in suicidality. Defendants contend that this theory of biological plausibility fails to satisfy <em>Dauberf </em>s requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">\n<em>1. Does Gabapentin Increase the Amount of GABA in the Brain?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">The first step in Plaintiffs\u2019 theory of biological plausibility is that gabapentin increases the amount of GABA in the brain. Given the admission by Defendants that gabapentin increases the amount of GABA in the whole brain and the general acceptance \u2014 by the FDA and relevant scientific specialties of the medical community \u2014 that gabapentin is a GABAergic drug, this first step in Plaintiffs\u2019 theory, as discussed above, has \u201ca reliable basis\u201d on which to stand. <em>Crowe, </em>506 F.3d at 17 (quoting <em>Kumho Tire, </em>526 U.S. at 148, 119 S.Ct. 1167); <em>see </em>discussion <em>supra </em>Parts II.C.3., III.B.2.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">\n<em>2. Does Gabapentin Lead to a Decrease in Monoamines?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b185-12\">In arguing biological plausibility, Plaintiffs emphasize their claim that gabapentin is GABAergic or increases the amount of GABA in the brain. However, Plaintiffs\u2019 expert Dr. Trimble acknowledges that the mechanism by which gabapentin acts in precipitating suicidal behavior could either stem from gabapentin\u2019s \u201cGABAergic effect and/or the results of its action at the alpha-2-delta protein.\u201d (Trimble Rep. at 6.) Thus a more precise articulation of the second step of Plaintiffs\u2019 causation theory is that, regardless of the biological mechanism by which gabapentin acts (i.e., whether by its GABAergic effect or its binding at the alpha-2-delta protein), gabapentin decreases several monoamine neurotransmitters \u2014 namely, serotonin, norepinephrine,<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> and dopamine. Plaintiffs generally focus on serotonin, identifying it as the primary monoamine neurotransmitter whose reduction prompts behavioral disturbances, depression, and suicidality in particular patients taking Neurontin.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-13\">\n<em>a. In vitro studies</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b185-14\">It is generally accepted and Defendants do not dispute that the presence of GABA in the nuclei where serotonin originates (the raphe nuclei) reduces the rate of serotonin release. This finding was repeatedly demonstrated, via animal models, by researchers in the 1980s and was published in multiple peer-reviewed articles. (Trim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>ble Rep. 9-10; Hr\u2019g Tr. 48-9 (Dr. Trimble describing the studies and Defendants stating that they do not dispute the findings); <em>see </em>Pis.\u2019 Exs. 42, 45-47.) While these experiments involved several GABAergic antiepileptic drugs, none studied gabapentin itself.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Thus, Plaintiffs\u2019 experts present additional, gabapentin-specific evidence which they contend demonstrates that gabapentin leads to a decrease in the release of monamine transmitters (i.e. serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine). Specifically, Plaintiffs rely on animal studies, each published and peer-reviewed, that have reported that gabapentin inhibits the release of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Defendants acknowledge these studies; in fact, the findings were discussed in a July 2001 internal Pfizer research report titled, \u201cSummary of Preclinical Pharmacological Studies With Gabapentin ... In Vitro and in Laboratory Animals.\u201d <em>(See </em>Pfizer Global Research and Development Research Report, Summary of Preclinical Pharmacological Studies with Gabapentin ... In Vitro and in Laboratory Animals, July 19, 2001, at 39-40) (provided at hearing). This confidential report was authored by Defendants\u2019 expert Dr. Taylor and summarizes twenty years of studies examining gabapentin\u2019s pharmacological effects, including <em>in vitro </em>studies designed to examine the effects of gabapentin on the release of monoamine transmitters. <em>(Id. </em>at 7.) As summarized by Dr. Taylor in the report, several animal studies have demonstrated that gabapentin decreases monoamine neurotransmitter release <em>in vitro. (Id. </em>at 41.) Specifically, Dr. Taylor reported that gabapentin caused a reduction of norepinephrine of twenty to forty percent and a significant reduction in the release of dopamine as well. <em>(Id. </em>at 39^0) (acknowledging that \u201cit is possible that these effects of gabapentin on monoamine neurotransmitter release contribute to their effects in anxiety and other mood disorders\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">Nevertheless, Defendants contend that these studies are insufficient to establish that Neurontin reduces levels of serotonin and other monoamines <em>in humans. </em>First, Dr. Taylor criticizes Plaintiffs\u2019 experts for relying on <em>in vitro </em>(laboratory) studies, stating that extrapolating from a laboratory setting to predict outcomes in living beings is not a generally accepted methodology or practice. (Taylor Aff. \u00b6 25; Taylor Rep. 19) (stating that it is \u201cwidely understood that in <em>vitro </em>studies of neurotransmitter overflow in ... brain tissue samples do not model or precisely replicate all aspects governing monoamine release <em>in vivo </em>\u201d).<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>Second, Dr. Taylor maintains that extrapolation from <em>in vitro </em>animal studies is particularly inappropriate in this case because the rat -brain slices in the <em>in vitro </em>studies relied on by Plaintiffs were subjected to artificial electrical stimulation. According to Dr. Taylor, such a \u201csynchronized massive stimulation\u201d would never occur in intact animals or humans during normal behavior or disease. (Taylor Aff. \u00b624.) Therefore, in Taylor\u2019s view, these studies are ultimately irrelevant to an inquiry into the effects of the drug in a human or whole animal. (Hr\u2019g Tr. 446-47, July 23, 2008.) In sum, Defendants do not dispute that, once the rat brain tissue was stimulated, gabapentin reduced the release of monoamines, but they dismiss the results recorded during this stimulated, or \u201chyperexcited,\u201d state as beside-the-point and theoretical. Instead, they contend that these same <em>in vitro </em>studies actually demonstrate that gabapentin has little or no effect on the release of monaomines. (Taylor Rep. 24) (\u201cAlthough gabapentin reduced the artificially \u2018stimulated\u2019 release of monoamines by 20 to 40%, it had no effect on the \u2018basal\u2019 release of monoamines (without application of either potassium or electrical shocks) .... gabapentin has little or no effect on the release of monoamines in the absence of severe (abnormally strong) and synchronized presynaptic stimulation in whole tissues.\u201d).<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Notably, however, while Dr. Taylor competently points out the limitations of these <em>in vitro </em>studies, he concedes that the very methods he critiques have \u201cbeen used by numerous research teams for more than 30 years as a model to study various physiological and pharmacological aspects of neurotransmitter release\u201d at monoamine-containing neurons. (Taylor Rep. 18.)</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">\n<em>b. In vivo studies</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">Dr. Taylor contends that, in addition to <em>in vitro </em>studies, studies using \u201cintact animals\u201d (i.e., <em>in vivo </em>studies) and other methods are required to determine the effects a drug has on the release of monoamine neurotransmitters in humans. (Taylor Aff. \u00b6 25; Taylor Rep. 19-20.) He cites two \u201cwhole animal\u201d studies which he contends \u201creinforce the view that gabapentin does not change the release of monoamine neurotransmitters in animals behaving normally in vivo.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> (Taylor Rep. 25.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>Yet he places the greatest emphasis on two human studies examining gabapentin\u2019s effect on monoamine neurotransmitters. These two peer-reviewed studies, both conducted by Dr. Elinor Ben-Menachem and published in the 1990s, are the only such studies involving human subjects. The first study, published in 1992, was a short-term experiment with only five human subjects.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> It evaluated the influence of one dose of gabapentin on the release of dopamine and serotonin over the course of three days. The study found a \u201ctendency for HVA<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> [dopamine] and 5-HIAA<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> [serotonin] to increase after 24 and 72 h[ours] post dose.\u201d (1992 Ben-Menachem study 48.)</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">The second study, published in 1995, was of longer duration and greater size.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> In this double-blind placebo-controlled experiment, thirty-six human patients received either 900 mg of gabapentin per day, 1200 mg of gabapentin per day, or a placebo for three months. Measurements of monoamines in the participants\u2019 cerebrospinal fluid were taken both before and after the three-month treatment period. The results indicated that there were no significant differences between the \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d levels of both dopamine [HVA] and serotonin [5-HIAA] in the patients treated with gabapentin. (1995 Ben-Menachem study 234) (\u201cThere was no influence of GBP [gabapentin] on HVA [dopamine] or 5-HIAA [serotonin] in the CSF.\u201d). Defendants argue that this \u201cno effect\u201d finding in the 1995 study undercuts Plaintiffs\u2019 theory. They also characterize the 1992 study as having demonstrated the opposite (a serotonin increase) of what Plaintiffs theorize (a serotonin decrease).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">Plaintiffs\u2019 expert Dr. Trimble refutes the Defendants\u2019 characterization of the 1992 study findings, stating that, given the short-term nature of the 1992 study, the finding of an increase in serotonin is \u201centirely what you would expect,\u201d even if the ultimate impact of the drug is to reduce serotonin in the patient. (Hr\u2019g Tr. 64, June 19, 2008.) Trimble explains that, when a patient is given a drug whose effect is to block the receptors of a particular neurotransmitter, the brain\u2019s immediate response is to produce a \u201chuge outflow\u201d of that neurotransmitter. <em>(Id.) </em>This initial outflow, however, ultimately results in the depletion of the stores of that neurotransmitter; if the drug treatment is continued over a longer time period, a decrease in the \u201cturnover\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> will occur.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> (Hr\u2019g Tr. 64-65, June 19, 2008.)</p>\n<p id=\"b189-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>Turning to the 1995 Ben-Menachem study, Trimble emphasizes that, particularly at the 1200 mg dosage level, the experiment revealed a slight decrease of serotonin after three months of gabapentin treatment. (Hr\u2019g Tr. 68, June 19, 2008.) <em>(See </em>1995 Ben-Menachem Study 233, fig. 5.) Trimble acknowledges that there is no indication that the decrease is statistically significant, but states that a visual comparison of the bars reflecting levels of serotonin before and after three months treatment at 1200 mg dosage \u201creflect[s] a decrease.\u201d (Hr\u2019g Tr. 68, June 19, 2008.) This decrease is all the more noticeable when compared with the placebo results, which indicate an increase in serotonin turnover. <em>(Id.) </em>Thus, in Trimble\u2019s view, the 1995 Ben-Menachem study, while not conclusive, \u201csupports the view that in the human brain, with chronic , gabapentin, treatment, you get down regulation of activity of this key neurotransmitter for mood regulation; namely, serotonin.\u201d (Hr\u2019g Tr. 69, June 19, 2008.) Thus, the experts dispute the proper interpretation of the results of the 1995 Ben-Menachem study.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">Finally, Defendants take the position that it is a decrease \u2014 not an increase \u2014 in GABA levels in the brain that can lead to depressive effects. Defendants rely on <em>The Textbook of Psychopharmacology </em>which states that, in replicated studies, GABA concentrations in depressed patients have been shown to be \u201csignificantly lower\u201d than those in nondepressed control subjects and that \u201cGABA concentration was inversely correlated with severity of depression.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> (Alan Schatzerg &amp; Charles Nemeroff, eds., <em>Textbook of Psychopharmacology, </em>736 (3d ed. 2002)) (Defs.\u2019 Slides for Taylor Direct Examination, at 3) (Docket No. 1375, Ex. 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">c. <em>Kumho Wrestling</em></p>\n<p id=\"AO1\">While Defendants have demonstrated that there is a robust debate in the scientific community, on whether gabapentin decreases the release of monoamines, Plaintiffs have put forth reliable scientific evidence from a highly qualified expert, Dr. Trimble, who relies in part on peer-reviewed animal studies documenting such a decrease. It is true that Dr. Trimble cannot explain with a reasonable degree of scientific certainty how gabapentin might prompt a decrease in monoamines. Instead, he relies on an \u201ceither/or\u201d explanation, contending that Neurontin <em>either </em>prompts an increase of GABA which causes a reduction in the rate of serotonin release <em>or, </em>by binding to the subunit of the alpha-2-delta protein, somehow triggers a decrease in monoamine production.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> <em>(See, e.g., </em>Trimble Rep. 6 (stating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>that when gabapentin is given to a patient with a mood disorder [or a history of mood disorders], \u201cthe GABAergic effect <em>and/or </em>the results of its action at the alpha-2-delta protein precipitates suicidal behavior\u201d) (emphasis added)); Hr\u2019g Tr. 231, June 20, 2008 (Kruszewski) (stating that, regardless of which mechanism theory you ascribe to, the \u201cend result\u201d is a \u201creduction in the release of monoamine neurotransmitters\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-3\">Significantly, Pfizer has, in both internal and external communications over the course of many years, repeatedly acknowledged that gabapentin has been shown to reduce the release of monoamine neurotransmitters. <em>(See </em>Trimble Rep. 36 (\u201cThe findings that gabapentin decreases the release of key monoamines in the depression/impulsivity/suicide narrative is also constantly referred to in the company documents, and investigative brochures.\u201d)). As representative examples, Defendants\u2019 1993 Product Monograph states, \u201cNeuron-tin slightly reduces the release of monoamine neurotransmitters in vitro.\u201d (Pis.\u2019 Ex. 25.), and a 2001 internal Project Operating plan reads: \u201cGabapentin has been known to reduce monoamine neurotransmitter release for many years.\u201d (Pis.\u2019 Sur-Reply, Ex. 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">There is therefore, in the peer reviewed scientific literature and Pfizer\u2019s own literature, \u201c \u2018good grounds\u2019 \u201d to support testimony that gabapentin causes a decrease in monoamines like serotonin. <em>Ruiz-Troche, </em>161 F.3d at 85 (quoting <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 590, 113 S.Ct. 2786). That two key experts, Dr. Taylor (who has spent his professional life researching Neurontin for Pfizer) and Dr. Trimble (who was once hired by Pfizer to research Neurontin and is eminent in his field) vigorously disagree on the interpretation of the existing literature makes clear that Plaintiffs theory falls squarely within \u201cthe range where experts might reasonably differ\u201d and is thus proper fodder for a jury. <em>Kumho Tire, </em>526 U.S. at 153, 119 S.Ct. 1167; <em>see Ruiz-Troche, </em>161 F.3d at 85 <em>(\u201cDaubert </em>neither requires nor empowers trial courts to determine which of several competing scientific theories has the best provenance.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">\n<em>3. Does a Decrease in Monoamines Lead to Depression and Suicidality?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">The third step in Plaintiffs\u2019 theory is that a decrease in serotonin and/or norepinephrine created by gabapentin can prompt behavioral disturbances, depression, and suicide. As stated by Plaintiffs\u2019 expert Dr. Kruszewski, \u201ca depletion of monoamines, particularly serotonin and norepinephrine, or an inhibition of those monoamines\u2019 functional activities, [creates] a significantly increased risk of mood and behavioral disturbances.\u201d (Stefan Kruszewski, Gabapentin: Mechanism of Mood-altering Action, at 11) (hereinafter \u201cKruszewski Rep.\u201d) (Pis.\u2019 Ex. 28.) These disturbances ultimately \u201cresult[] in <em>inter alia, </em>dysphoria, sadness, depression, abnormal thinking, depersonalization, irritability, agitation, aggression, suicidal behavior and completed suicides.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Dr. Trimble articulates the same proposition in his report: \u201cThe decrease in the functional activity of serotonin and norepinephrine ... results clinically in depression, anxiety, panic, irritable mood, dysphoria, anger, agitation, hostility, [and] impulsivity,\u201d ultimately precipitating suicidal behavior in certain individuals. (Trimble Rep. 6.) According to Dr. Trimble, there are two ways in which Neurontin can cause suicidal behavior. First, the link between the drug and suicidality can be \u201cdirect,\u201d with the drug causing the precipitation of aggressive emotions. Or, the link can be \u201cindi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>rect,\u201d through the onset of depression caused by the drug. (Trimble Rep. 15.)</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">. <em>a. Serotonin and Mood</em></p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">The premise that the decrease of serotonin and other monoamines in the brain is deleterious to mood including depression and aggression is supported in the literature <footnotemark>55</footnotemark> and not controversial, as even Defendants\u2019 experts and employees acknowledge.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Moreover, the acceptance of a connection between serotonin and depression is illustrated by the pervasive use of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (\u201cSSRIs\u201d) as an antidepressant medication. SSRIs bind to the serotonin transporter in the brain and block the \u201cre-uptake\u201d of serotonin, thereby increasing the amount of serotonin in the human brain. (See Kruszewski Rep. 12 (\u201cThat decreased serotonergic and noradrenergic activity is casually [sic] related to depression and suicide forms the basis of previous and present-day antidepressant treatment.\u201d); <em>see also Blanchard v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co., </em>207 F.Supp.2d 308, 311 (D.Vt.2002) (\u201cThere is medical and scientific evidence that SSRIs ... are effective in treating major depressive disorders. This is because d\u00e9pression is associated with serotonin depletion in many people, and SSRIs are thought to increase the activity of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain.\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">\n<em>b. Serotonin and Suicide</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">An association between low levels of serotonin in the brain and suicide is also well documented, appearing in peer-reviewed literature spanning several decades. <em>(See </em>Trimble Rep. 12 (stating that the relationship between suicide and low serotonin release is \u201cone of the most replicated findings in the whole of biological psychiatry\u201d); Kruszewski Rep. 11 (describing the association between reduced central levels of serotonin and depression and suicide as \u201clong established and supported by the referenced and published literature\u201d)). Taken together, two generations of studies have established that \u201cat least part of the pathology related to suicidal behavior is reduced serotonin turnover or serotonergic neuron activity.\u201d <em>Guide to Suicide </em>Assessment <em>and Intervention </em>102 (Douglas G. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>Jacobs, ed., 1999) (Pis.\u2019 Ex. 70) (hereinafter \u201cGuide to Suicide Assessment\u201d). The first generation of studies reported modest reduction in levels serotonin in the brain-stem of suicide victims, while the next set of studies connected low levels of serotonin in cerebrospinal fluid (\u201cCSF\u201d) to suicidal behavior.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>at 102) (concluding that \u201c[f]uture suicide and attempted suicide are associated with low CSF 5-HIAA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">A host of more recent articles and textbooks confirms that the association between low serotonin levels and depression and suicide remains generally accepted in the field. In fact, a recent peer-reviewed article declared that the \u201cample evidence of an association\u201d between serotonin neurotransmission and suicidal behavior, achieved via many different research methods, \u201csuggest[s] a causal interpretation of this association.\u201d Kees van Heeringen, 48 <em>The Neurobiology of Suicide and Suicidality, </em>Can. J. Psychiatry 292, 296 (June 2003) (provided at hearing).<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> While defense expert Dr. Sanacora disagrees with the causation label, even he admits that there is a \u201cfairly large literature base showing abnormal measures of serotonin associated with suicide victims.\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> (Sanacora Dep. 87:8-88:25, Jan. 18, 2008) (Pis.\u2019 Ex. 66.)</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">These studies also report an association between lowered serotonin levels and aggression, which can manifest in suicidal acts.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> Also significant is that the connection between reduced serotonergic activity and suicide is not limited to a particular psychiatric diagnosis. In the studies examining the brainstem of suicide victims, the degree of reduction in serotonin was similar in depressed patients, schizophrenics, personality disorders, and alcoholics. As stated in the <em>Guide to Suicide Assessment and Intervention, </em>\u201c[t]his is a critical point because it indicates that the reduction in serotonin activity is related to suicide independent of psychiatric diagnosis.\u201d <em>Guide to Suicide Assessment, supra, </em>at 100; <em>see </em>van Heeringen, <em>supra, </em>at 298. (stating that the relationship between serotonergic dysfunction and suicidal behaviors is \u201cnot confined to depressive disorders .... [as it] also appears to be involved in the development of suicidal behaviour in the context of other disorders, such as schizophrenia, substance abuse, and bipolar disorder\u201d); (Trimble Rep. 13 (\u201cImportantly the studies with 5-HIAA link alteration of the levels of this metabolite of serotonin to impulsivity and aggression, rather than any DSM IV diagnosis .... [T]he findings do not apply only to people with personality disorders, but also across a spectrum of psychiatric diagnoses.\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">Thus the conclusion that alterations in monoamine neurotransmitters, including serotonin, can impact mood and behavior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>and is associated with depression, aggression, and suicide, has been published extensively in peer reviewed literature and is widely accepted in the scientific and medical community.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> Accordingly, the third step of Plaintiffs\u2019 theory passes muster, at least with respect to serotonin depletion.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">D. Additional Evidence: Adverse Event Data</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Plaintiffs offer examples of adverse events experienced in patients as further support for their general causation theory. Courts may, and often do, rely on other lines of causation evidence such as adverse event data. <em>See, e.g., In re PPA Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>289 F.Supp.2d at 1242 (finding \u201cthe sheer volume of case reports, case series, and spontaneous reports\u201d to be \u201csignificant\u201d and instructive in its reliability assessment). To be sure, Plaintiffs and Defendants agree that adverse event reports (\u201cAERs\u201d) \u2014 whether published in safety databases or the medical literature \u2014 have significant limitations. <em>See; In re Baycol Prods. Litig., </em>532 F.Supp.2d 1029, 1039-40 (D.Minn.2007) (noting that the \u201cFDA has published certain caveats\u201d as to the proper use of adverse event reports and citing multiple court opinions addressing the reliability of AERs); <em>McClain, </em>401 F.3d at 1253-4 (\u201cBecause they are anecdotal, \u2018case studies lack controls and thus do not provide as much information as controlled epidemiological studies do.... Causal attribution based on case studies must be regarded with caution.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Reference Guide on Medical Testimony, supra, </em>at 475).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">Plaintiffs also use a subset of adverse event data, known as dechallenge and re-challenge events. A positive dechallenge event refers to a situation where a patient\u2019s adverse event partially or completely disappears after the patient stops taking the drug. If the patient later resumes taking the drug, and one or more of the adverse events reoccur, the event is known as a positive rechallenge. <em>See Glastetter, </em>252 F.3d at 990. As other courts have noted, dechallenge and rechallenge data \u201cis substantially more valuable than run-of-the-mill case reports because a patient\u2019s reactions are measured against his own prior reactions.\u201d <em>Id.; see Giles, </em>500 F.Supp.2d at 1051 n. 7. More generally, adverse event data can contribute to an evaluation under the Bradford Hill criteria, where temporal relationship is one of the many factors considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">\n<em>1. Adverse Events in Pre- and Post-Approval Clinical Trials</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AqS\">Plaintiffs\u2019 experts cite to data submitted by Pfizer to the FDA as part of its New Drug Application for Neurontin in 1992 as additional evidence supporting their theory of general causation. The data, summarized in an FDA report, documents adverse events reported in all controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials conducted by Pfizer through June 2002, reflecting a total of 2,048 patients exposed to gabapentin.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> <em>(See </em>Division of Neuropharmacological Drug Products Combined Medical-Statisti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>cal Review, Oct. 13, 1993, at 77) (Pis.\u2019 Ex. 5) (hereinafter \u201c1993 Med.-Stat. Review\u201d). In the total exposed population of patients in the New Drug Application, seventy-eight, or 5.3 percent, of the reported adverse events were of depression, including nineteen instances where the patient had no prior history of depression, twenty-two instances where the patient required treatment for his or her depression, and nine instances where the patient had to withdraw from the study due to the depression. (1993 Med.-Stat. Review 109, 114.) The adverse event data was also broken down by severity, with each of the events categorized as \u201cserious\u201d or \u201cnon-serious.\u201d As stipulated in FDA regulations, a \u201cserious\u201d adverse event is defined as \u201cimmediately life threatening, permanently disabling, or requiring hospitalization ..., overdose, ... or other events deemed of medical concern.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 102) (citing 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 312.32(a)). Seventy-eight \u201cserious\u201d adverse events were identified (from the 2048 patients exposed), including seven reports of depression (each involving suicidal ideation), six of drug overdoses, and two suicide attempts. <em>(Id. </em>at 102, 109.) Six of the seventy-eight \u201cserious\u201d incidents, including both suicide attempts, were deemed by the clinical investigator to be \u201cpossibly Or probably\u201d related to gabapentin. <em>(Id. </em>at 107.)</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">After detailing all of the data, the 1993 FDA Review describes gabapentin\u2019s safety profile as \u201cgenerally good,\u201d but notes that \u201cseveral important concerns\u201d remain. <em>(Id. </em>at 116.) The report identified five \u201cserious events,\u201d including depression, which could \u201climit the drug\u2019s widespread usefulness,\u201d and stated, \u201cdepression, while it may be not an infrequent occurrence in the epileptic population, may become worse and require intervention or lead to suicide, as it has resulted in some suicidal attempts.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 117) (listing \u201cclinically important depression\u201d as one of \u201cfive groups of important adverse events that have not yet been fully characterized\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 expert Dr. Blume also draw upon adverse event data from the clinical studies of gabapentin conducted after its epilepsy-based approval in 1993 (particularly studies from the 1994-1996 time period).<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> Having reviewed these studies, Dr. Blume emphasized that a greater percentage of patients in the gabapentin-treated group experienced serious psychobiologic adverse events than those in the placebo-treated group (17.3 percent gabapentin patients versus 13.8 percent placebo patients). She also reported that, of those patients who had to withdraw because of the severity of a psychobiologic side effect, nearly twice as many were from the gabapentin-treatment group as compared to the placebo group (26 percent versus 14 percent). (Blume Rep. \u00b6 96.) At the hearing, Dr. Blume highlighted these calculations, explaining that they are the type of summary data that the FDA requires drug companies to compile for safety assessments of their products. (Hr\u2019g Tr. 123, June 19, 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">\n<em>2. Dechallenge/Rechallenge Events</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">According to Dr. Blume, observations of dechallenge and/or rechallenge events are significant and, in some instances, can be deemed a safety \u201csignal.\u201d<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> (Blume Rep. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>\u00b6\u00b6 55-56.) A positive dechallenge \u201ccan represent evidence that the drug under study was responsible for or associated with the adverse event\u201d; the case is even stronger, therefore, when a positive rechallenge is present. <em>See </em>U.S. Dept. of Heath and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, <em>Guidance for Industry: Good Pharmacovigilance Practices and Pharmacoepidemiolgic Assessment </em>4 (March 2005) (\u201cIt is possible that even a single well-documented case report can be viewed as a signal, particularly if the report describes a positive rechallenge....\u201d) (Pis.\u2019 Hr\u2019g Ex. 3.) Moreover, according to Dr. Blume, dechallenge and rechallenge data is accepted in the field as a useful tool in making decisions as to causation. (Blume Rep. \u00b6\u00b6 55-56.)</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">Combing through the adverse event reports in all Neurontin clinical trials from the pre-approval stage through 1996, Dr. Blume identified forty-five positive dechallenge events. (Blume Rep. \u00b6\u00b6 58, 141.)<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> Seventeen of these events were deemed \u201cprobably\u201d related to gabapentin, while seven were determined to be \u201cdefinitely\u201d related to gabapentin. Notably, none of these twenty-four events involved specifically suicidal behavior,<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> but rather entailed depression (one case) and \u201cpsyehobiological events\u201d such as hostility, emotional liability, thinking abnormal, nervousness, and confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Dr. Blume also highlights a positive re-challenge event reported in 1991. In this event, a 36-year-old male patient experienced severe depression and suicidal ideation while on gabapentin. (1993 Med.Stat. Review 107-08.) The depression was deemed \u201cclinically important\u201d and both the depression and suicidal ideations were \u201cjudged possibly related to gabapentin.\u201d (Defendants\u2019 Narrative Summaries and Tabular Data for Study Participants who Withdrew Due to Adverse Events, App\u2019x C.3, at 53-54) (Pis.\u2019 Ex. 91.) The patient stopped taking the drug and the depression and suicidal ideation were \u201cresolved\u201d (i.e., a positive dechallenge). <em>(Id.) </em>Approximately five months later, the patient was given gabapentin again (the \u201crechallenge\u201d). The depression re-appeared just four days later, and had become \u201csevere\u201d within thirty days of resuming gabapentin treatment. <em>(Id.) </em>This time the depression was considered \u201cprobably related to gabapentin,\u201d and the patient was withdrawn from the study. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">Both Drs. Blume and Kruszewski point to this positive rechallenge patient narrative \u2014 and the dechallenge events \u2014 as significant pieces of evidence indicating a relationship between gabapentin and adverse mood and behavioral events. <em>(See </em>Kruszewski Rep. 14 (stating that \u201cparticular significance\u201d should be attributed to a positive rechallenge because \u201csuch findings reflect a scientifically sound position that gabapentin was a substantial factor in causing the adverse event\u201d); Blume Rep. \u00b6 92 (\u201cThe relationship of these psy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>chobiological adverse events to gabapentin therapy is supported by numerous examples of positive dechallenge/rechallenge data and their occurrence in a number of postmarketing surveillance databases.\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">\n<em>3. Periodic Safety Update Reports</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">In her report, Dr. Blume extensively reviews case report data from a variety of sources beyond Defendants\u2019 own clinical studies,<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> identifying adverse events which, in her view, collectively demonstrate \u201cthat Neurontin can be associated with suicide-related behavior.\u201d (Blume Rep. \u00b6 280.) One source of such information are Periodic Safety Update Reports (\u201cPSUR\u201d) prepared by Defendants. PSURs include \u201ccases of adverse events reported spontaneously to Pfizer Defendants, cases reported from healthcare providers, cases published in the medical literature and cases reported from clinical studies.\u201d (Blume Rep. \u00b6 162.) Notably, events are included in the PSURs regardless of causality assessments. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">After reviewing multiple PSURs for Neurontin, Dr. Blume concluded that \u201csuicide-related adverse events ... began to appear consistently in PSUR documents starting in 2000 and early 2001\u201d and ultimately \u201cculminated in large numbers of reports\u201d in a five-year summary document issued at the beginning of 2003. (Blume Rep. \u00b6 163.) In addition, Dr. Blume reviewed a PSUR covering events reported from February 2003 through January 2004, in which \u201cgabapentin was listed as the sole suspect agent in a total of 6 completed suicides and 15 suicide attempts.\u201d (Blume Rep. \u00b6 247.)</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">J. <em>Peer-Reviewed Literature</em></p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">Case reports indicating that gabapentin can lead to mood or behavioral disturbances also appear in the peer-reviewed literature. In his report, Dr. Kruszewski cites to multiple peer reviewed articles from 1995 through 2002 which he says report adverse events that \u201cstrongly link[ ] gabapentin\u2019s neurobiological effects to multiple significant mood and behavioral problems.\u201d (Kruszewski Rep. 10.) Similarly, Dr, Trimble lists seven articles that report \u201coutbursts of aggression following prescription with gabapentin,\u201d and notes that a review of anticonvulsant drugs published in 2001 commented on aggression and irritable behavior in its discussion of gabapentin. (Trimble Rep. 20.) In addition, Dr. Trimble cites a published 2002 post-marketing surveillance study of gabapentin. The study, conducted on 3,100 patients in England, reported 311 psychiatric events, including fifty depression, forty-one aggression, twenty-eight anxiety, twenty-seven abnormal behavior, and twenty-six confusion. The authors noted that seventeen patients took an overdose and two patients made suicide threats. (Trimble Rep. 37-38.)</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">\n<em>5. Trimble\u2019s Research for Defendants</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">Finally, Dr. Trimble\u2019s research for Defendants back in 1996 provides additional data worthy of consideration. Dr. Trimble reviewed a total seventy-six case reports of psychosis, mood disturbances, and aggressive behavior in patients taking Neurontin. Dr. Trimble concluded that nine of the twenty-one cases of aggression (forty-three percent) were either precipitated or exacerbated by gabapentin. <em>(Behavioural </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number><em>Disturbance with Gabapentin </em>13.) As for depression, Dr. Trimble reported that there was a possible association in two of ten cases he examined in detail, but concluded that it was \u201cnot possible to clearly link gabapentin with any case directly.\u201d<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>at 14.)</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Despite Defendants\u2019 insistence to the contrary, adverse event reports of behaviors which are not directly suicidal, such as depression and aggression, are relevant to the ultimate inquiry because Plaintiffs\u2019 theory is that Neurontin causes a decrease in serotonin in a patient\u2019s brain which, in turn, can prompt mood and behavioral disturbances, some of which ultimately lead to suicidal behavior.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">In sum, Plaintiffs\u2019 experts point to the adverse event and case report data as real-world evidence to back up their theory that Neurontin increases the risk of suicidality in its patients. As summarized by Dr. Blume: \u201cWhile these events do not prove that Neurontin causes suicidal behavior, they do demonstrate, in conjunction with the vast numbers of post-marketing events, that Neurontin can be associated with suicide-related behavior.\u201d (Blume Rep. \u00b6 280.)</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">E. Expert-Specific Challenges</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">Defendants contend both Drs. Kruszewski and Blume are testifying beyond their expertise when they opine on the mechanism of action of gabapentin. Defendants also contend that Dr. Blume is not qualified to offer any medical theory of causation. Defendants do not challenge Dr. Trimble\u2019s qualifications or the scope of his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-12\">Dr. Stefan Kruszewski is a board certified psychiatrist with a medical degree from Harvard Medical School, specialized training and knowledge in psychopharmacology, and twenty-eight years of clinical practice experience. (See Brief Resume, Stephan Kruszewski, M.D. (Pls.\u2019 Ex. 114); Kruszewski Aff. \u00b6 1 (Pls.\u2019 Ex. 115.)) Dr. Kruszewski has been accepted as an expert witness in pharmaceutical litigation before several courts. <em>See, e.g., In re Zyprexa Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>489 F.Supp.2d 230, 287-88 (E.D.N.Y.2007). As a practicing psychiatrist he has treated, and prescribed drugs for, several thousand patients with a variety of psychiatric and neuropsychiatric indications. (Kruszewski Aff. \u00b6 3.) Dr. Kruszewski is currently on the faculty at Eastern University in Pennsylvania and was a clinical professor of psychiatry at Pennsylvania State University from 1999-2004. He has also lectured at many universities on epidemiology, psychiatry, neuropsychiatry, and related fields. (Kruszewski Aff. \u00b6 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b197-13\">As for research activities, Dr. Kruszewski has authored articles published in peer-reviewed journals addressing issues pertaining to drugs, side-effects, conflicts of interest, and the validity and consistency of research. (Kruszewski Aff. \u00b6 6.) As a member of the Board of the Alliance for Human Research Protection, Dr. Kruszewski reviews research from peer-reviewed sources discussing issues pertaining to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>drug side effects, including the study of side effects of anticonvulsants. (Kruszewski Aff. \u00b6 7.)</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Accordingly, Dr. Kruszewski is well-qualified to perform a literature search and review records of patients exposed to Neurontin, and to testify based on those investigations and his own experience as a practicing psychiatrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Dr. Cheryl Blume holds a Ph.D. in pharmacology and toxicology from the West Virginia University School of Medicine. <em>(See </em>Curriculum Vitae of Cheryl Blume, Ph.D. (Pls.\u2019 Ex. 116.)) She has extensive experience in the evaluation of safety information of pharmaceutical products; for the past twenty-five years, Dr. Blume has worked with pharmaceutical companies to prepare new drug applications and supplemental documents for submission to the FDA. In this role, Dr. Blume has worked on at least 150 submissions to the FDA for more than fifty different drugs. (Blume Decl. \u00b6 3) (Pls.\u2019 Ex. 102.) She has been involved in collecting and evaluating post-marketing adverse event reports, as well as the design of studies to assess safety signals after a drug has been approved. (Blume Rep. \u00b6 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Defendants contend that, despite her industry experience, Dr. Blume is not qualified to testify about Neurontin\u2019s mechanism of action or any medical theory of causation. In offering an opinion on general causation,<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> Dr. Blume does discuss mechanism of action and biological plausibility, yet her report and testimony overwhelmingly focus on the review and evaluation of adverse events associated with Neurontin. In performing this review, Dr. Blume states that she used the same methods that she employs when preparing a drug development for submission to the FDA. (Blume Decl. \u00b6 5.) She states that she reviewed the same types of records and applied the same analytical methods used by the FDA to evaluate a drug\u2019s risks, benefits, safety, and efficacy. (Blume Decl. \u00b6 9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">Dr. Blume is amply qualified at least to evaluate the adverse event data and other sources of information regularly used by the FDA and industry professionals.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">F. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">In a challenge to expert testimony under <em>Daubert, </em>the Court is tasked with operating as a gatekeeper. The court must exclude testimony that is \u201cjunk science\u201d and rests on unreliable principles, but allow in \u2014 for a jury\u2019s evaluation \u2014 testimony that is based on \u201csufficient facts and data,\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 702, and \u201chas a reliable basis in light of the knowledge and experience of the relevant discipline.\u201d <em>Crowe, </em>506 F.3d at 16-17 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-12\">Here, Plaintiffs have successfully demonstrated, by a preponderance of the evidence, that their experts\u2019 general causation testimony is reliable. Most significantly, the FDA study provides evidence of an association between Neurontin and an increased risk of suicidality, the prerequisite for a causation analysis under the Bradford Hill criteria. Though the parties\u2019 experts debate the strength and specificity of the association (two Bradford Hill factors), its presence alone significantly strengthens the Plaintiffs\u2019 case for admission under <em>Daubert.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b198-13\">Moreover, Plaintiffs have demonstrated that a relationship between gabapentin and increased suicidality is biologically plausible, a particularly crucial Bradford <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Hill factor. That a decrease in serotonin and other monoamines can lead to negative effects on mood and behavior, and even prompt suicidality, is well established and hardly disputed by Defendants. What is hotly disputed is whether gabapentin causes any such decrease in monoamines. In this battle, both sides present peer-reviewed studies to support their position. Plaintiffs\u2019 star expert Dr. Trimble relies primarily on <em>in vitro </em>animal studies and a mechanism of action theory that is questioned by some in the scientific community. Yet, Dr. Trimble has more than animal studies on which to rest his theory \u2014 there is a long trail of \u201cgabapentin as GABAergic\u201d literature winding from Defendants\u2019 own doorstep to the halls of the FDA.

As for consistency, or replication of findings, both parties agreed that the FDA meta-analysis was the first of its kind and has not been repeated. Thus, there is little evidence either way for this factor. The case report data, particularly the dechallenge and rechallenge data, provides some evidence of a temporal relationship between taking gabapentin and the alleged adverse effects, while Plaintiffs\u2019 experts\u2019 analogies to other GABAergic antiepileptic drugs, some of which are known to be associated with negative effects on mood and behavior, also support an inference of causation. And although there is dispute within the scientific field as to the chemical and pharmacological properties of gabapentin, the proposition that gabapentin increases the risk of suicidal behavior by decreasing serotonin in the human brain is consistent with \u201cgenerally known facts\u201d about the causes of suicidality.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">In sum, Plaintiffs have demonstrated that their experts\u2019 theory of general causation is admissible under <em>Daubert </em>and Federal Rule of Evidence 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">\n<em>TV.

To support the first explanation, Dr. Trimble relies on the uncontested <em>in vitro </em>animal studies demonstrating that, by causing an increase of GABA in serotonin-related nuclei, other GABAergic antiepileptic drugs reduced the rate of serotonin release. For the latter explanation, Dr. Trimble states that there \"are peer-reviewed papers showing that gabapentin produces this effect by its action on calcium channels.\u201d (Trimble Rep. 10-11) (citing Fink et al., <em>Inhibition of neuronal Ca(2+) influx by Gabapentin and subsequent reduction of neurotransmitter release from rat </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number><em>neocortical slices, </em>130 British J. of Pharmacology 900-906 (2002)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"55\">\n<p id=\"b191-7\">. Plaintiffs characterize this finding as \"[o]ne of the most established findings in the whole of biological psychiatry,\u201d (Pis.\u2019 Mem. in Opp\u2019n 20), and cite several publications, including two pharmacology textbooks for support. <em>See, e.g., The Handbook of Psychopharmacology Trials: An Overview of Scientific, Political, and Ethical Concerns </em>299 (Marc Hertzman and Douglas E.

Ex. 63.) In addition, Plaintiffs\u2019 expert Dr. Trimble states that the serotonin system has been linked to the regulation of affect and that \"[ejarly observations were that drugs which depleted the brain\u2019s reserves of monoamines (serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine in particular) led to depression.\u201d (Trimble Rep. 13.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"56\">\n<p id=\"b191-12\">. In their depositions, two defense experts'\u2014 Dr. Rothschild and Dr. Gerard Sanacora\u2014 testified that serotonin is related to mood and behavior. <em>(See </em>Rothschild Dep. 12:18-23, Jan. 15, 2008 (stating that both serotonin and norepinephrine are \"related to mood and behavior\u201d) (Pis.\u2019 Ex. 67); Sanacora Dep. 79: 8-9, Jan. 8, 2008 (\u201cI would say changes in serotonergic system has been associated with differences in mood.\u201d) (Pis.\u2019 Ex. 61)). In addition, Pfizer employee and a member of the Neurontin worldwide team, Dr. Leslie Tive testified at her deposition that a reduction in monoamines has been associated with depression and that \"[a]n increase or decrease of serotonin in the brain can be associated with depression.\u201d (Tive Dep. 300: 11-24, July 19, 2008) (Pis.\u2019 Ex. 66).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"57\">\n<p id=\"b192-6\">.
