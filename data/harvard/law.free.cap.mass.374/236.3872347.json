This forecast, which was filed in compliance with G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 691, stated that Pilgrim Station Unit 2 (Pilgrim 2), a nuclear generating plant then proposed to be operational in Plymouth in 1982, was an exempt facility. The principal issue in these appeals is whether Pilgrim 2, a majority of which Edison will own, is exempt from the review and approval provisions of G. L. c. 164, \u00a7\u00a7 691 and 69J. We agree with the council\u2019s determination that Pilgrim 2 is exempt. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>We defer to the end of this opinion consideration of Edison\u2019s claim that the appeals are not properly here.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">After Edison filed its long-range forecast, the council referred the issue whether Pilgrim 2 was exempt from \u00a7\u00a7 691 and 69J to a hearing officer. Plymouth County Nuclear Information Committee, Inc. (PCNIC), an organization of over 500 citizens principally from Plymouth and Barnstable counties, and Stanley U. Robinson, Third, a customer of Edison, were permitted to intervene. The factual contest before the hearing officer focused on the question whether construction of Pilgrim 2 had commenced prior to May 1, 1976. Statute 1975, c. 617, \u00a7 15, provides that \u201c[t]he provisions of [G. L. c. 164, \u00a7\u00a7 691 and 69J] shall not apply to facilities under construction prior to [May 1,1976].\u201d General Laws c. 164, \u00a7 69G, as appearing in St. 1975, c. 617, \u00a7 1, defines construction \u201c[a]s used in [G. L. c. 164, \u00a7\u00a7 69H through 69R],\u201d as \u201cany placement, assembly, or installation of facilities or equipment. . ., <em>including contractual obligations to purchase such facilities or equipment, </em>at the premises where such equipment will be used, including preparation work at such premises\u201d (emphasis supplied). The significant legal question argued before the hearing officer was whether the definition of \u201cconstruction,\u201d in G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69G, applies to St. 1975, c. 617, \u00a7 15, the \u201cgrandfather clause\u201d referred to above, which exempts from \u00a7\u00a7 691 and 69J those \u201cfacilities under construction prior to [May 1, 1976].\u201d PCNIC and Robinson argued that the word \u201cconstruction\u201d has a less expansive meaning in St. 1975, c. 617, \u00a7 15, than in G. L. c. 164, \u00a7\u00a7 69H-69R.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">The hearing officer concluded that there had been no preparation work at the site and that there had been no \u201cplacement, assembly or installation of facilities or equipment on the plant site.\u201d He did find, however, that Edison had made \u201ccontractual obligations to purchase such facilities\u201d in the amount of $34,727,563. He then determined that the cost of the entire project was expected to be at least $1,396,000,000. He concluded that, even if \u201cconstruction\u201d does mean the same thing in St. 1975, c. 617, \u00a7 15, as it does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>in \u00a7\u00a7 691 and 69J, Pilgrim 2 was not under construction on May 1, 1976, because Edison\u2019s contractual obligations were de minimis. In his tentative decision, the hearing officer instructed Edison to file the required information concerning Pilgrim 2 with the council so that the council could begin a review of the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">The council then considered the question of Pilgrim 2\u2019s exemption and rejected the hearing officer\u2019s conclusion. It ruled that the \u00a7 69G definition of \u201cconstruction\u201d should be used in determining whether St. 1975, c. 617, \u00a7 15, exempts a facility from \u00a7\u00a7 691 and 69J, and agreed with Edison that \u201cconstruction\u201d had commenced before May 1, 1976. The council accepted the propriety of a de minimis standard, as it had in an earlier decision, but ruled that Edison had \u201cincurred substantial contractual obligations sufficient to constitute construction as of May 1, 1976 and that therefore the proposed Pilgrim II plant is exempt from the requirements of [G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 691].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Both PCNIC and Robinson filed appeals under G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, as permitted by G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69P. Edison moved to dismiss each appeal on the ground that neither was commenced seasonably. The parties agreed on a record, and a single justice of this court reserved and reported the consolidated appeals for decision on the issues raised by the petitions for appeal and by Edison\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">1. The council was correct in ruling that the definition of \u201cconstruction\u201d in G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69G, applies to St. 1975, c. 617, \u00a7 15, and that it should be used to determine whether Pilgrim 2 is exempt from the review and approval requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 691 and 69J. We start with a consideration of language within \u00a7 691 itself which indicates that the Legislature did not intend that the review and approval requirements of \u00a7 691 apply to facilities whose development had progressed as far as had Pilgrim 2\u2019s prior to May 1, 1976. The fourth paragraph of G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 691, which is set forth in the margin,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> states that after an electric com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>pany has filed its initial long-range forecast and the council has acted on it, the company \u201cshall not commence construction of a facility at a site unless the facility is consistent with the most recently approved long-range forecast.\u201d The implication of this prohibition is that an electric company may proceed with constructing and using any facility whose construction was commenced at least before the filing of the company\u2019s long-range forecast. There is no doubt that the definition of \u201cconstruction\u201d in \u00a7 69G applies to the word \u201cconstruction\u201d in \u00a7 691. Section 69G says so explicitly. Thus, even if the word \u201cconstruction\u201d in St. 1975, c. 617, \u00a7 15, did not have the meaning given it by \u00a7 69G, Pilgrim 2 would not be subject to review and approval by the council.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">This significant exemption within \u00a7 691 goes far in support of a reading of St. 1975, c. 617, \u00a7 15, to exempt from \u00a7\u00a7 691 and 69J all facilities under construction prior to May 1, 1976, in the sense in which \u201cconstruction\u201d is defined in \u00a7 69G. It would be a peculiar reading of the exemption from \u00a7\u00a7 691 and 69J appearing in St. 1975, c. 617, \u00a7 15, to construe \u201cconstruction\u201d any less broadly than the exemption for facilities under construction which \u00a7 691 itself grants. Moreover, in the absence of a plain contrary indication, a word used in one part of a statute in a definite sense should be given the same meaning in another part of the same statute. <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps, &amp; Taxation, </em>327 Mass. 694, 700 (1951), and cases cited. The word \u201cconstruction\u201d is used in the general exemption, or \u201cgrandfather clause,\u201d appearing in \u00a7 15 of St. 1975, c. 617, and the definition of \u201cconstruction\u201d in G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69G, appears in \u00a7 1 of St. 1975, c. 617. Similar provisions appeared in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>comparable earlier legislation. See St. 1973, c. 1232, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 4. We believe that the Legislature as matter of policy has chosen not to subject facilities in Pilgrim 2\u2019s position to the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 691 and 69J, and it is not for us to substitute our own judgment for that of the Legislature.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">2. We turn then to the question whether the construction of Pilgrim 2 was so insubstantial prior to May 1, 1976, as to permit the council to disregard it in determining whether Pilgrim 2 was \u201cunder construction\u201d (St. 1975, c. 617, \u00a7 15) before that date. PCNIC argues that Edison\u2019s contractual obligations to purchase facilities and equipment ($34,727,563) are less than 2.5% of the projected cost of the facility, and that a sum representing so small a percentage should be disregarded as inconsequential. Even if a de minimis principle may be read into the statutory pattern, as the council appears willing to do and did in an earlier proceeding, we do not view $34,727,563 as an amount so inconsequential that it should be disregarded. The de minimis concept applies where a subject is trifling (see <em>Albre Marble </em>&amp; <em>Tile Co. </em>v. Goverman, 353 Mass. 546, 550 [1968]) and has been held inapplicable to sums as small as $500 and $1,000 in cases challenging their inclusion in determining local real estate tax rates. See <em>Jenney </em>v. <em>Assessors of Mattapoisett, </em>322 Mass. 76, 80-81 (1947), and cases cited. There is nothing in the applicable statute to suggest that the Legislature intended a de minimis principle to be effective in these circumstances. We would be trifling with the de minimis principle if we were to declare that more than $34,000,000 of construction costs is inconsequential. The council was plainly correct in ruling that construction of Pilgrim 2 had commenced prior to May 1, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">3. PCNIC argues that the council\u2019s decision failed to set forth adequate reasons for its finding regarding the definition of \u201cconstruction.\u201d The council\u2019s determination that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>construction had commenced on Pilgrim 2 before May 1, 1976, was based (1) on a ruling of law that it should use the definition of \u201cconstruction\u201d in \u00a7 69G and (2) on certain factual conclusions concerning Edison\u2019s obligations incurred before that date. The first aspect involved a question of law and required no more than a recitation of the ruling to satisfy the council\u2019s duty to disclose its reasoning. The second aspect involved questions of fact and was discussed adequately in the council\u2019s decision. PCNIC and Robinson do not seriously challenge those findings. A statement of reasons for agency action in adjudicatory proceedings is required in part to facilitate adequate judicial review. See <em>Trustees of Clark Univ. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>372 Mass. 331, 336 (1977); <em>Save the Bay, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>366 Mass. 667, 687 (1975). For the purposes of these appeals, the council\u2019s decision sufficiently disclosed the reasons for its action.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">4. Edison\u2019s motion to dismiss PCNIC\u2019s appeal should be denied. Its motion to dismiss Robinson\u2019s appeal should be allowed. Edison argues for dismissal of PCNIC\u2019s and Robinson\u2019s appeals, claiming that they were not filed within the statutory time limit. Under G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69P, any party in interest aggrieved by a decision of the council may obtain judicial review as provided in G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5. A petition for appeal must be filed with the council within twenty days \u201cafter the date of service of the decision,\u201d and the appealing party must enter the appeal in the county court within ten days thereafter. G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, as amended through St. 1971, c. 485.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">This court has followed the principle that not every procedural misstep requires the dismissal of an appeal. We have made a distinction between serious errors and relatively innocuous ones. See <em>Schulte </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>369 Mass. 74, 79 (1975). In the <em>Schulte </em>opinion, we noted that an attempt to institute a late appeal from an administrative decision was a prime example of an omission \u201cso repugnant to the procedural scheme, so destructive of its purposes, as to call for dismissal of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In this connection, we note that the council has not moved to dismiss the appeal, has not argued here that the appeals are untimely, and has not claimed that a decision on the merits of the appeal would be repugnant to the procedural scheme. The council\u2019s abstention may be understandable because, as will be seen, the council\u2019s own actions contributed to some degree in creating the circumstances which give rise to Edison\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">On April 13, 1977, the council issued a decision which it entitled in part, \u201cFinal Decision.\u201d The record does not disclose that the decision was served by mail on PCNIC and Robinson as provided in G.L. c. 25, \u00a7 5. However, the decision came to the attention of Robinson and PCNIC\u2019s counsel immediately. Robinson filed a \u201cMotion for Rehearing\u201d on the same day, asserting that, because of lack of notice, he had been denied an opportunity to present oral argument to the council. The council granted Robinson the right to be heard and denied his so called motion for rehearing. The council served notice of its final decision by mail on May 4, 1977. That notice included a statement that any aggrieved person could petition for a rehearing \u201cwithin 7 days after receipt of this notice pursuant to Siting Council rule 17.1.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The notice of that final decision was received by PCNIC on May 9, 1977. PCNIC filed a petition for rehearing on May 13, 1977, and the council denied it without hearing on May 17, 1977. PCNIC received notice of that action on May 19, 1977.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Robinson and PCNIC filed petitions for appeal with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>the council on June 8, 1977. PCNIC\u2019s appeal was filed with the county court on June 14, 1977. Robinson\u2019s appeal was filed on June 21, 1977.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Because the council in effect withdrew its April 13, 1977, decision in response to Robinson\u2019s claim that he had been denied an opportunity to present final argument, we think the first significant date for determining appellate rights is May 9, 1977, the date PCNIC was served with notice of the council\u2019s final decision.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If we accept May 9, 1977, as the date notice of the council\u2019s decision was served on PCNIC, it is clear that PCNIC\u2019s petition for appeal, filed with the council on June 8, 1977, was not timely (i.e., not within twenty days), unless the filing of the request for a rehearing in fact delayed the finality of the council\u2019s decision until such time as the council acted on that petition.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Edison argues forcefully that G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, does not recognize a petition for rehearing in measuring appeal periods. It points out that G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (1), as amended through St. 1976, c. 411, \u00a7 1, describes an appeal period measured from the date of the final decision \u201cor if a petition for rehearing has been timely filed with the agency, within thirty days after receipt of notice of agency denial of such petition for rehearing.\u201d Chapter 25, \u00a7 5, has no similar language. If the council did not acknowledge the right of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>party to petition for rehearing, we would be inclined to agree that a petition for rehearing has no status in the appellate process. But such is not the case here. In analyzing the timeliness of an appeal, the procedural pattern should be assessed in light of the agency\u2019s own estimation of the finality of its action, provided, of course, that the agency\u2019s perception of the situation is permissible under the governing statutes. The council\u2019s regulations and its notice of decision in these proceedings expressly acknowledge the right to file a petition for rehearing within seven days of the notice, and the regulations purport to delay commencement of the appeal period until the council has acted on the petition for rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">If the council is willing to treat its decisions as tentative, or otherwise less than final, we think that it is entitled to do so. It could have achieved the same result by issuing a tentative decision and announcing that it would be made final unless within seven days any party requested reconsideration. We have noted that an appeal under G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, may not be taken from a tentative decision of the Department of Public Utilities and that a party may appeal only from the agency decision which finally resolves the issue. <em>Western Mass. Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>373 Mass. 227, 237 (1977). We conclude that, if the council treats a decision as subject to change on a timely petition for rehearing, that decision is not final for the purposes of review under G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, until the council has denied a seasonably filed application for a rehearing. Even if the council does not have authority to issue regulations relating to appeal periods,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> it intended to treat its decision as subject to change, and in this respect PCNIC relied on the representation made in the council\u2019s notice of decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>5. Judgment shall be entered affirming the decision of the council. Edison\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeals shall be allowed as to Robinson and shall be denied as to PCNIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b257-8\">The fourth paragraph of G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 691, as amended through St. 1974, c. 852, \u00a7 7, reads as follows: \u201cSubsequent to the filing as pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>vided for in this section by an electric or gas company of its initial long-range forecast, and action thereon by the council as provided for in section sixty-nine J, such company shall not commence <em>construction </em>of a facility at a site unless the facility is consistent with the most recently approved long-range forecast or supplement thereto. In addition, no state agency shall issue a construction permit thereafter unless such site and facility conforms <em>[sic] </em>to the most recently approved long-range forecast or supplement thereto\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b259-7\"> Each party has argued at length that particular circumstances evidence a legislative intent in support of its position.
