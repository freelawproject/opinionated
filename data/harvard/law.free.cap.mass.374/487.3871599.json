The crimes stemmed from a robbery on August 9, 1973 \u2014 not directly charged in these five indictments \u2014 in which the defendant Cepulonis with Frank Lovell (a codefendant) and James Guimond (a Commonwealth witness), all masked and armed with machine guns, held up a branch of the Suburban National Bank in Woburn, fired their guns to intimidate the customers and employees of the bank, and stole approximately $17,000. A witness, Dorothy Juliano, had seen the three men driving up in a yellow Mustang automobile and, suspecting that a robbery was in progress, telephoned the police. Officer John P. Gibbons, in a cruiser, spotted the car as it left the scene, and gave chase. He was met by gunfire from two men riding in the car, later identified as the defendant and Lovell, one firing through the rear window and the other hanging out a side window. At one point in the chase a car driven by Ann Moselunas came between the Mustang and Gibbons. Moselunas was wounded by shots from the Mustang smashing through the windshield of her car. Finally the robbers eluded their single pursuer. The Mustang, a stolen car, was later found abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">The defendant\u2019s involvement in the criminal events was proved impressively by testimony of Federal agents and State police who described the clues and how they followed them to close on the defendant and Lovell and accomplish their arrest in New York in September, 1973. Guimond as a participant in many of the events gave compelling testimony and the Commonwealth\u2019s case was further buttressed by Richard Vidito, at whose apartment the robbers met the day before the robbery and to which the defendant and Lovell returned the day of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">To trace the several prosecutions following upon the robbery: The defendant was convicted in February, 1974, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>New York of the knowing possession of an unregistered firearm, to wit, a machine gun, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d) (1970), and was sentenced to five years\u2019 imprisonment. In October, 1974, he and Lovell were found guilty in the United States District Court for Massachusetts of robbing a federally-insured bank while assaulting and putting in jeopardy the bank employees by use of dangerous weapons (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113[a] and [d] [1970]), and received a sentence of twenty-five years, concurrent with the previous sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Also in February, 1974, the Middlesex County grand jury returned seven indictments against the defendant and James Lovell for the offenses of armed robbery (G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 17); confining or putting in fear for the purpose of stealing (G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 21); assault with intent to murder Gibbons (G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15); a like assault and also assault with a dangerous weapon (G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15B) as to Moselunas; concealment of a stolen motor vehicle (G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 28); and unlawful possession of a machine gun (G. L. c. 269, \u00a710).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The defendants moved before trial to dismiss all the indictments on the ground of former jeopardy. After a hearing in January, 1975, a judge of the Superior Court dismissed the indictments for armed robbery and confining. Trial proceeded on the remaining indictments. The defendants were found guilty of all the crimes there charged, and from the judgments of conviction<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> they severally appealed under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G. We took Cepulonis\u2019s appeal for direct review and decide that alone in this opinion. This defendant renews his claim of former jeopardy and presses a number of other points arising in the course of trial. We affirm his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>1. <em>Former jeopardy. </em>The defendant contends that the Massachusetts charges of which he has been convicted should have been held barred by reason of the prior Federal prosecution (whether for the bank robbery, possession of the weapon, or both, he does not say). The answer is that this contention (i) cannot be made successfully as a matter of Federal constitutional right, and (ii) fails on the present facts if we apply \u2014 although without constitutional compulsion \u2014 a rule with respect to successive Federal and State prosecutions similar to the \u201csame evidence\u201d test that this court has regularly applied to repetitive prosecutions within the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Under still reigning authority of the Supreme Court of the United States, there is nothing unconstitutional about a State prosecution that is precisely duplicative of a prior Federal trial; and the converse is also true. These results follow from a \u201ctwo-sovereignty principle\u201d <em>(Bartkus </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>359 U.S. 121, 134 [1959] [Frankfurter, J.] [five to four decision]): the United States and the several States are conceived to have distinct competencies so that the action of one sovereign does not eliminate or supersede the authority of the other, and is not relevant in determining whether an individual liberty has been invaded by that other. <em>Bartkus </em>v. <em>Illinois, supra </em>(subsequent State trial). <em>Abbate </em>v. <em>United States, </em>359 U.S. 187 (1959) (subsequent Federal trial) (six to three decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">We need not describe fully the large and well known critical commentary which argues for some constitutional limit on repetitive Federal-State trials and punishments. The <em>Bartkus </em>position has been attacked as unhistorical, and also as morally wrong.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (On the latter point, see especially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>Black, J., dissenting in <em>Bartkus, supra </em>at 150-164.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> And some attritions of the two-sovereignty notion are pointed to that might influence the constitutional law of double jeopardy. Thus it is no longer the case that the Federal courts will admit evidence illegally seized by State authorities <em>(Elkins </em>v. <em>United States, </em>364 U.S. 206 [I960]), and a State may not compel testimony under a promise of immunity which does not protect against Federal prosecution <em>(Murphy </em>v. <em>Waterfront Comm\u2019n, </em>378 U.S. 52 [1964]). See Schaefer, Unresolved Issues in the Law of Double Jeopardy: <em>Waller </em>and <em>Ashe, </em>58 Calif. L. Rev. 391, 401 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Notwithstanding its possible infirmities, the <em>Bartkus-Ahhate </em>view is the present law of the Supreme Court, and recognized as such.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We look to that Court for interpretation of the double-jeopardy guaranty in so far as it now binds us under the Fourteenth Amendment <em>(Benton </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>395 U.S. 784 [1969]), and in that respect we of course accept <em>Bartkus. </em>And if our own Declaration of Rights is taken to include a double-jeopardy guaranty (a proposition, as it happens, never explicitly adopted<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>), we would not be inclined at present, on these facts, to interpret our guaranty more generously than <em>Bartkus </em>to impose constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>tional limits on State prosecutions following Federal convictions or acquittals of similar offenses. But cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>398 Mich. 450 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">But there is a great difference between constitutionalizing a restriction, and voluntarily applying a common sense limitation, whether by judicial, prosecutorial, or legislative decision. This the Supreme Court opinions not only do not forbid, but actively encourage. See <em>Bartkus, supra </em>at 138-139. And this is the path that has been followed federally, and by many States.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">The <em>Bartkus </em>and <em>Abbate </em>cases were decided on March 30, 1959. On April 6,1959, the Attorney General issued a directive to United States Attorneys stating that \u201c[i]t is our duty to observe not only the rulings of the Court but the spirit of the rulings as well.\u201d The Attorney General added that \u201c[ajfter a state prosecution there should be no federal trial for the same act or acts unless the reasons are compelling. . . . [N]o federal case should be tried when there has already been a state prosecution for substantially the same act or acts\u201d without the approval of an assistant attorney general after consultation with the Attorney General. Department of Justice Press Release, April 6, 1959, 27 U.S.L.W. 2509 (1959). This has remained the policy of the Department of Justice. On a few occasions Federal prosecutions have been initiated mistakenly, and the government has then sought dismissals to conform to the policy of the directive. In such cases the Supreme Court has supported the policy \u201cto protect the individual from unfairness associated with needless multiple prosecutions.\u201d <em>Rinaldi </em>v. <em>United States, </em>434 U.S. 22 (1977) (per curiam). See cases cited <em>id. </em>at 25 n.8, and <em>Petite </em>v. <em>United States, </em>361 U.S. 529 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">By the time of the <em>Bartkus </em>decision a considerable number of States had already enacted statutes intended to eliminate redundant State prosecutions following Federal trials,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>and more States have done so since.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The American Law Institute\u2019s Model Penal Code proposes legislation on this line at \u00a7 1.10 (Proposed Official Draft 1962). Among the States with such laws are California,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Illinois,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and New York.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Supreme Court of Michigan has reached a like result as a matter of State constitutional law, <em>People </em>v. <em>Cooper, supra, </em>while Pennsylvania has done so without constitutional reference, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mills, </em>447 Pa. 163 (1971). Some State courts have overlooked the invitation of <em>Barikus, </em>or have declined it;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> others have not had occasion to respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Owing, perhaps, to the sound exercise of discretion by prosecutors, this court has not had to decide squarely a jeopardy question where the Commonwealth has prosecuted an offense already tried in another competent jurisdiction. In speaking to those situations we have not invoked a two-sovereignty concept; rather we have approached them on much the same footing as cases in which the former prosecution was in-State. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>8 Met. 313, 317-318 (1844); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>12 Met. 387, 396-397 (1847) (Shaw, C.J.); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ponzi, </em>256 Mass. 159, 164 (1926); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>358 Mass. 488, 492 (1970). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barry, </em>116 Mass. 1, 6 (1874); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCan, </em>277 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>199, 201 (1931).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We think we should take that course here. Thus we would apply to dual jurisdiction cases the substance of the \u201csame evidence\u201d test currently used by us and expounded in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallarelli, </em>372 Mass. 573, 577 (1977); <em>Kuklis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>361 Mass. 302, 306 (1972); <em>Morey </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>108 Mass. 433, 434 (1871).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We observe, however, that this test or rule may require some modulation when applied to a case in which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>prior prosecution occurred in a Federal court.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> On the one hand, a mere reference in a Federal criminal statute to a Federal jurisdictional contact (e.g., that a bank was federally insured) may well be disregarded in matching the elements of that statute with those of the State statute under the \u201csame evidence\u201d regimen. <em>People </em>v. <em>Belcher, </em>11 Cal. 3d 91, 100 (1974). <em>People </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>398 Mich. 450, 461 (1976). Ark. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 43-1224.2(b) (Cum. Supp. 1975). On the other hand, in particular cases Federal prosecution for a given crime may conceivably not preclude later State prosecution for a crime which would embrace the substance of the former as a \u201clesser included\u201d offense; and the fact that a Federal crime is punishable much more lightly than the parallel State crime may justify a subsequent prosecution by the State.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> (It will be understood that this opinion can be only suggestive on these matters, and that no rule can work satisfactorily without the willing cooperation of fair-minded prosecutors.)</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">To apply the \u201csame evidence\u201d precept to the present case: We surmise that it was on that basis of comparison of the elements of our statute with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) and (d) (1970) that the judge of the Superior Court dismissed the indictments for robbery and confining. He reached the right result.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">There is no such congruence of the Federal and State charges regarding a machine gun as to require reversal of the subsequent State conviction here under appeal. Each charge comprises possession, but each requires proof of a culpable omission by the defendant which the other does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>not, and it is thus possible to violate one statute without transgressing the other. The defendant violated G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(c), </em>by possessing a machine gun (in Massachusetts) without having obtained a license to carry one under G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The latter law licenses individuals, but does not register the weapons they later acquire. Under the Federal statute, by contrast, the weapon must be registered by the transferor to render legal the transferee\u2019s (defendant\u2019s) possession (charged as in New York); it would have been impossible for the transferee to register the weapon himself. Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Freed, </em>401 U.S. 601, 604 (1971). Compliance with the Federal registration law leaves open the possibility that possession of the weapon is a State law violation. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Freed, supra </em>at 610 (Brennan, J., concurring) (hand grenades federally registered, but possession in State illegal). The differences in the statutes are major: the State statute scrutinizes the character of those who possess guns and stands in with a Federal statute concerned with checking the traffic in dangerous weapons. We think the crimes are not duplicative. This is quite apart from the circumstance that the Federal offense carries at most a sentence of ten years, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5871 (1970), while the State offense is punishable by life imprisonment, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10. Next, the three indictments for the attacks on Gibbons and Moselunas are clear of the Federal bank robbery indictment which charged assault on the employees at the bank and not the later assaults during the escape.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> (We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>add that there is no proscribed duplication as between the two State charges involving Moselunas, as shown by <em>Salemme </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>370 Mass. 421, 423 [1976]). The charge of concealment of a stolen motor vehicle is also separate from the Federal charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">The defendant\u2019s brief in fact concedes that \u201cthe indictments here at issue appear to charge wholly distinct offenses from those previously tried in the federal courts,\u201d so that there is no attempted argument under <em>Gallarelli </em>and associated cases. Rather the defendant asks us to overrule those cases and apply a \u201csame transaction\u201d rule \u2014 that trial and conviction of an offense preclude trial of other offenses committed in the course of the criminal episode. In <em>Gallarelli </em>the court rejected a transactional view even as applied to repetitious trials in this jurisdiction of crimes committed in a single episode.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Far less appealing is such a view when it is sought to be applied to trials in different jurisdictions, for it would yield the untoward result that a criminal violating different Federal and State laws in a natural sequence called an episode must necessarily escape punishment for one or more of his crimes. The point has been perceived by those who sponsor a transactional rule for the single-jurisdiction situation.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>2. <em>Admission of evidence of the robbery. </em>The defendant contends that he was dealt with unfairly at his Massachusetts trial by the introduction of excessive evidence bearing on the bank robbery. There is perhaps an irony here because in his double jeopardy argument the defendant is insistent to an extreme on there being but one trial to cover the entire criminal episode. The defendant concedes that some references to the robbery were appropriate \u2014 indeed testimonial connections with the robbery were inevitable \u2014 but he objects to the extent of the allusions made to it. However his argument is diffuse; his brief is weak in furnishing detail and leaves us guessing just where the prejudice came in.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">\u201c[Ejvidence otherwise admissible does not cease to be so because it happens to show the commission of an independent crime\u201d <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Green, </em>302 Mass. 547, 552 [1939]), but there may come a point at which its prejudicial effect overcomes its probative value. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chalifoux, </em>362 Mass. 811, 817-818 (1973). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>353 Mass. 409, 420 (1967); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Choate, </em>105 Mass. 451, 457-458 (1870). Examining the record closely, we note that evidence regarding the robbery so far as admitted bore on the propositions that the defendant possessed a machine gun at the place charged, that the defendant participated in the shooting of Gibbons and Moselunas, and that the stories of Guimond and Vidito inculpating the defendant were in substance true. Nor do we think the robbery received undue attention or emphasis.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Indeed the trial judge showed commendable energy in controlling introduction of the proof related to the robbery. He warned the jury before the Commonwealth put on its first witness that such evidence would be received for limited purposes and should not otherwise influence them: the trial was not one of a bank robbery. At bench confer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>enees he advised the prosecutor to steer away from the subject of the robbery where possible. Objections to various tendentious questions were sustained, and all but a few photographs of the robbery were excluded. Finally there was strong cautionary comment in the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">3. <em>Denial of severance. </em>The defendant rested on the prosecution\u2019s case. Codefendant Lovell adopted a different strategy and took the stand in his own defense. Thereupon the defendant renewed his pretrial motion for a severance, which was refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Severance is usually a matter within the sound discretion of the trial judge (see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hogg, </em>365 Mass. 290, 296 [1974]), and we think no abuse is shown here. The defendant asserts that \u201cLovell\u2019s defense was not only contrary to the stance taken by Cepulonis, but was inculpatory of him as well.\u201d For this statement no explanation or reference to the record is offered. The Commonwealth\u2019s case was much the same as to both defendants, and we do not perceive anything in that case or in Lovell\u2019s testimony that could create material jury confusion. If Lovell\u2019s testimony can be construed as inculpatory of the defendant, it is only by vague implication, and the defendant was at liberty to cross-examine, but did not do so.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Lovell in fact may have benefited the defendant by casting some doubt on the truthfulness and motivation of Guimond and Vidito.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">4. <em>Prosecutorial behavior, </em>(a) <em>Reference to the prior Federal trial. </em>The judge made it unmistakably clear to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>prosecutor that in impeaching Lovell through his prior conviction for bank robbery, he was to avoid reference to the defendant. We join the judge in his criticism of the prosecutor for disregarding this admonition, notably by reading the Federal indictment of Lovell, Guimond, and \u2014 as he improvised \u2014 \u201canother of Winchester,\u201d which most probably was understood as a reference to the defendant. But we agree with the judge\u2019s denial of a motion for mistrial because there was no practical possibility of material prejudice. Unavoidably the jury knew that the defendant participated in the bank robbery, and, as we have seen, the judge had used care to make it clear to them that they were not to take the robbery as indicative of the defendant\u2019s guilt of the crimes in suit.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">(b) <em>Reference to suppressed evidence. </em>There is complaint that the prosecutor referred to physical evidence that had been suppressed by the judge who tried the Federal bank robbery case and was therefore, by agreement of counsel, not to be introduced in evidence in the Middlesex trial. The suppressed material should have been better skirted by the prosecutor, but the defense was at fault in not objecting at its first mention and in waiting to the conclusion of lengthy testimony and moving only then for a mistrial, which the judge in his discretion refused. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiPietro, </em>373 Mass. 369, 387 (1977). The references could remind the jury of the defendant\u2019s part in a bank robbery in which machine guns were carried, but that, we note yet again, was necessarily in the background of the present trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">(c) <em>Reference to the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. </em>The prosecutor said in his summation, in effect, that the defendant\u2019s guilt was necessarily to be inferred from certain evidence to which he pointed. These remarks were not objected to, nor was an exception saved. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gouveia, </em>371 Mass. 566, 571-572 (1976). In any case the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>context was such that the comments would be understood as no more than argument, if emphatic, that the evidence adduced warranted the inference. This may not be viewed as an improper comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to take the stand. To be contrasted are such prohibited lines of argument as that the evidence must be true because the defendant did not contradict it (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harlow, </em>110 Mass. 411 [1872]; <em>Government of V.I. </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>392 F.2d 207 [3d Cir. 1968]), or that the evidence was unchallenged where only the defendant could have challenged it by testifying. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Borodine, </em>371 Mass. 1, 10 (1976), cert, denied, 429 U.S. 1049 (1977); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Flannery, </em>451 F.2d 880 (1st Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">5. <em>Denial of directed verdict. </em>The case against the defendant was powerful, as we can attest after study of the transcript, and there can be no doubt that the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict of acquittal was properly denied as to all charges. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sandler, </em>368 Mass. 729, 740 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b507-7\"> The judge sentenced Cepulonis to forty to fifty years\u2019 imprisonment for possession of the machine gun, to be served from and after expiration of the Federal sentences.

If double punishment is what is feared, it hurts no less for two \u2018Sovereigns\u2019 to inflict it than for one.
