Green (Green) to evict her for a violation of her lease. After a jury trial, a verdict was returned in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-14\">The lease between the parties contained the following clause: \u201cIf the court action rules against RESIDENT, then he shall pay to MANAGER any costs, sheriff fees or any other fees involved, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees; if court action rules against MANAGER, then he shall pay to RESIDENT any costs, sheriff fees or any other fees involved, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, incurred by the RESIDENT in any such process.\u201d Pursuant to this provision, Green filed a motion to assess attorney\u2019s fees against Lincoln Street. This motion was granted. Subsequently, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>Lincoln Street filed a motion to reconsider the award of attorney\u2019s fees. On reconsideration, the judge revoked and rescinded the allowance of attorney\u2019s fees. Green appeals from the order denying attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Green\u2019s attorney is employed by Central Massachusetts Legal Services, Inc., a publicly funded legal service organization which represents indigent clients who are unable to afford attorney\u2019s fees and which does not bill clients for its services. In general, a prevailing party may not recover attorney\u2019s fees in the absence of statutory authorization or a contractual provision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <em>Bournewood Hosp., Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>371 Mass. 303, 311-313 (1976); <em>Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilderness Soc\u2019y, </em>421 U.S. 240 (1975). The issue presented for review is therefore whether a person represented by an attorney who does not charge his clients may recover attorney\u2019s fees under a contractual clause which provides that the prevailing party shall recover reasonable attorney\u2019s fees incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Green argues that since publicly funded legal service organizations are generally recognized as appropriate recipients of fee awards, attorney\u2019s fees should be awarded under the lease in the present case. However, none of the cases on which the defendant relies for the proposition that fee awards to legal service organizations are proper involved a contractual provision allowing the prevailing party to recover attorney\u2019s fees. While we agree that when attorney\u2019s fees are statutorily authorized legal service organizations are entitled to receive such awards, see <em>Lund </em>v. <em>Affleck, </em>442 F. Supp. 1109 (D.R.I. 1977), we conclude that, because of the different policy considerations involved, legal service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>organizations are not appropriate recipients of fee awards made pursuant to a contractual provision allowing recovery of attorney\u2019s fees <em>incurred.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Statutory authorization to award attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party in certain types of actions primarily serves the interrelated purposes of encouraging private enforcement of particular laws chosen by the Legislature, deterring illegal conduct in connection with these laws, and punishing those who violate these laws. See Note, Awards of Attorney\u2019s Fees to Legal Aid Offices, 87 Harv. L. Rev. 411, 412-421 (1973). Since these same public policies are served by an award of attorney\u2019s fees to a legal service organization, such an organization is a proper recipient of a fee award authorized by a statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>Lund </em>v. <em>Affleck, supra; </em>Note, Awards of Attorney\u2019s Fees to Legal Aid Offices, 87 Harv. L. Rev. 411, 412-421 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">However, these public policy considerations are absent when an award of fees is sought pursuant to a contractual provision authorizing the recovery of \u201cattorney\u2019s fees <em>incurred\u201d </em>(emphasis added). Rather, in this context, the agreement between the parties resembles a contract of indemnity and contemplates that the prevailing party will be reimbursed for his attorney\u2019s fees. We, therefore, conclude that \u201cincurred\u201d in this contractual context means \u201cpersonally obligated to pay.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>Since Green was not liable for any attorney\u2019s fees, no fee award should have been made. We affirm the District Court\u2019s disposition of the plaintiff\u2019s motion to reconsider the allowance of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">\n<em>Order allowing plaintiff\u2019s</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AZv\">\n<em>motion affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b649-7\">One possible exception to this general rule is that attorney\u2019s fees might be awarded when a losing party acts in bad faith. See <em>Fairley </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>493 F.2d 598, 606 (5th Cir. 1974). There is no evidence of any such bad faith on the part of the plaintiff in this case. In particular, the lease contained a provision allowing the manager to evict a resident with the approval of the Massachusetts Housing Finance Agency after a hearing. The defendant was afforded such a hearing and a decision favorable to the management was rendered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b650-7\">General Laws c. 186, \u00a7 20, inserted by St. 1977, c. 159, \u00a7 1, provides in pertinent part: \u201cWhenever a lease of residential property shall provide that in any action or summary proceeding the landlord may recover attorneys\u2019 fees . . . incurred as the result of the failure of the tenant to perform any covenant or agreement contained in such lease,. . . there shall be implied in such lease a covenant by the landlord to pay to the tenant the reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees . . . incurred by the tenant as the result of the failure of the landlord to perform any covenant or agreement on its part. . . or in the successful defense of any action or summary proceeding commenced by the landlord against the tenant . . . .\u201d We do not decide whether, in cases in which the statute is applicable, it constitutes statutory authorization for an award of attorney\u2019s fees in circumstances similar to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b650-8\">The defendant argues that such an interpretation would distort the lease provision in the management\u2019s favor. Since few tenants in the hous<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>ing project involved can afford private counsel, the management would rarely be required to pay attorney\u2019s fees when it was unsuccessful. This argument, however, ignores the fact that since tenants are of low or moderate income, it would be unlikely that the management could recover any or all of its attorney\u2019s fees from the tenants when it was successful.
