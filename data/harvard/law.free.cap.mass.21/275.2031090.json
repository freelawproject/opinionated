It however appeared, that there was a condition in the sale to Dean, that it should be void, if the town had no right by law to make the sale; and the judge was of opinion, that the town had no right to make the sale to Dean, and that it was void. It appeared also, that in March 1820, the intestate offered, in town meeting, to select a place for fishing, if the town would indemnify him against Dean, and that no such indemnification was given, and that the intestate did not select any place ; but it was proved that he was concerned in fishing with Dean, who did select a place as before mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-7\">The defendant agreed to be defaulted; but if the Court should be of opinion that the plaintiffs were not entitled to judgment, the default was to be taken off, and the plaintiffs were to become nonsuit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b295-8\">Williams, for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A4m\">objected to the declaration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>because it did not set out the plaintiffs\u2019 right to dispose of the fishery. Their title being derived neither from the common law, nor from a public statute, but from a private act, they should have recited the act, and have averred, that in making the sale to Caswell, they had complied with its requisitions. Com. Dig. <em>Pleader, </em>C, 76 ; Bac. Abr. <em>Pleas </em>\u00a7c., <em>B, </em>5, 3. He also contended, that on the merits the plaintiffs had no cause of action, the condition of the sale to Caswell having been broken.</p>\n<otherdate data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b296-6\"><em>Aug. </em>1827, <em>at Taunton.</em></otherdate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b296-8\"><em>W. Baylies </em>and <em>Cobb, </em>contra.'</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AsX\">As the sale to Dean was not made at the time prescribed by <em>St. </em>1819, c. 133, it was in effect no sale, and so the condition in the first sale was not broken.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-9\">The contract having been executed on the part of the plaintiffs, and nothing remaining to be done by the defendant but to pay money, a special count was unnecessary. 1 Chit.

The <em>St. </em>1818, c. 106, under which the sale was made, was a public statute. <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Webster, 5 </em>Mass R. 266; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>M' Curdy, </em>ibid. 324.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-10\"><em>Williams, </em>in reply, said that admitting it to be a public statute, still it should have been referred to in the declaration 1 Chit. PL 218.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b296-11\">The opinion of the Court <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> was drawn up by</p>\n<author id=\"b296-12\">Parker C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Arz\">We think it clear that the plaintiffs have no right to recover. The contract of sale was conditional, the condition being for the benefit of the purchaser. They violated this agreement, and by that means forfeited their right to the price. That the sale to Dean may have been unlawful, maltes no difference in their favor, for they gave him authority, and they have no right to deny their power so to do. Nor does it make any difference that the intestate joined Dean in carrying on the fishery under his license ; for finding his own to be void on account of the sale to Dean, he was at liberty to take his chance with him. The intestate\u2019s offer to pay the price for which the privilege was sold, provided the town would indemnify him against the claim ol Dean, and their refusal to do this, takes away all equitable ground in their favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>We find no validity in the objection to the declaration; but on the merits of the case we think the default ought be taker off and the plaintiff nonsuited.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b296-13\"><em> Morton </em>J. did not sit in this cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
