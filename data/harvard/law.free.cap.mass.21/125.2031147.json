The petitioner appealed from the sentence of the magistrate, and at the trial before the Court of Common Pleas, it being proved that he did not turn his wagon to the right of the centre of that part of the road which was usually travelled, although it was in his power to do it, he offered to prove that the travel was usually near one side of that part of the road which was wrought for travel, and that he did turn to the right of the centre of the part so wrought, leaving sufficient room for the chaise to pass on the part which was wrought and made safe and convenient for travellers. This evidence was rejected, and the petitioner was found guilty and sentenced to pay a fine ; whereupon he prayed for a writ of <em>certiorari </em>to the Court of Common Pleas.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b136-14\"><em>Hoar </em>and Newton, in support of the petition,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ai6\">contended, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>that by \u201c the travelled part\u201d of the road, in <em>St. </em>1820, c. 65, was meant the part wrought and made for travel, and cited Si. 1804, c. 125, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b137-15\">Oct. <em>9th.</em></decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b137-4\">Merrick, for the commonwealth,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AtY\">suggested, that <em>certiorari </em>was not the proper remedy in this case, but that exceptions should have been filed ; Si. 1820, c. 79, \u00a7 5 ; and he insisted, that by \u201c travelled part\u201d of the road, was meant the beaten path, it being intended that two parties meeting should each have the benefit of the part on which the public usually travelled.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b137-5\">Hoar, in reply, said the <em>St. </em>1820, c. 79, &lt;\u00a7&gt; 5, relates to civil actions only ; but supposing that exceptions might have been filed here, the statute does not prohibit a party from pursuing any other legal course for correcting erroneous proceedings in the court below.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b136-15\"> See Revised Stat. <em>c. </em>51, \u00a7 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b137-6\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AZI\">This being a proceeding not according to</p>\n<p id=\"ATm\">the course of the common law, <em>certiorari </em>lies.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">By \u201cthe travelled part\u201d of the road, is intended that part which is usually wrought for travelling. A traveller is not obliged, because a track happens to have been made on one side of the part so wrought, to turn to the right of the centre of this track. If he turns to the right of the centre of the wrought part, so that there is room on the wrought part for the other traveller to pass, it is sufficient, and the penalty is not incurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b137-8\"> See Howe\u2019s Praot. 491, 498; 1 Chitty\u2019s Grim.
