Brastow, a deputy sheriff, to Abraham Dar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>ling, conveying an equity of redemption of the land described in the plaintiff\u2019s writ, subject to a mortgage from Ziba Cook, the execution debtor, to Ezekiel Cook. Also a deed of the same from A. Darling to the plaintiff, dated March 1, 1816 The plaintiff then introduced evidence to show his actual occupation under these deeds, and that the trespasses complained of were committed by the defendants.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"Ah6O\">Nov. <em>2d.</em></otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AsDV\">Nov. 4th</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-4\">The defence was, that the title and possession were in Z. Cook, and that the other defendant entered as his servant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ay0k\">To prove this title and possession, the defendants produced a copy of a judgment recovered by Z. Cook against T. Darling in 1821, and the return of his execution, which was extended in June 1821 upon the land in question. They then introduced evidence to show that the mortgage of Z. Cook to E. Cook was assigned to J. Paine, and was after-wards paid, in whole or in part, by T. Darling, and that Paine, in December 1818, without any consideration from the plaintiff, conveyed the land to him at the request of T. Darling, To show that at the time of' the conveyance by Paine to the plaintiff, T. Darling was indebted to Z. Cook, the defendants offered in evidence a judgment recovered in 1821 by Z. Cook against T. Darling, in an action of slander commenced in 1817.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-10\">The defendants contended that the land was liable to be levied on as the estate of T. Darling, and that the extent of Z. Cook\u2019s execution gave him a title ; but under the instruc tians of the judge, a verdict was found for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b325-11\"><em>Hastings senior </em>and <em>Richardson, </em>for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQU\">cited <em>Damon </em>v.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Auy\">The plaintiff has shown a title to the premises by his deed from Abraham Darling of the equity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>of redemption, which had been conveyed by Brastow, the deputy sheriff, to A. Darling, as the purchaser at a sale on execution. This gave him the right .of possession, and he entered and actually occupied under his deed. He therefore is entitled to an action of trespass against any one who cannot defend himself by title or right of entry.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> One of the defendants claims to own under a levy of an execution against Thomas Darling, but he shows no estate in Thomas Darling. The release of the mortgage is to Kempton, the plaintiff; so that the legal estate is wholly in him.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\"><em>Oct. term </em>1827.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">The ground taken in defence is, that the consideration for the release from Paine, was paid in whole or in part by Thomas Darling, and therefore that a trust results to him. But if this be so, he had not such a title as can be taken by levy, for he holds nothing by deed or record, and so- cannot be the owner of the estate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The case of <em>Goodwin </em>v. <em>Hubbard et al. </em>will not support this defence, for in that case Hubbard the tenant was in actual possession, and he was allowed to defend himself by showing that the demandant\u2019s title was fraudulent and covinous.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">\n<em>Judgment according to verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\"><em>Note. </em>This action was against two defendants, Cook ana Aldrich, who pleaded severally the general issue. The declaration contained two counts. The jury found Aldrich not guilty on the first count, and Cook guilty, and found both guilty on the second count; and assessed damages severally, to wit, against Cook, on both counts, 55 dollars, and against Aldrich, on the second count, 11 dollars and 50 cents <em>Metcalf </em>now inquired in what manner execution should issue, and cited <em>Proprs.
