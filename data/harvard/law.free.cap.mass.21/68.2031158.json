They take the. roads in the condition in which they are left by that court. The provision that roads so laid out shall be subjected to the supervision and review of the commissioners, means, that they shall be made under their superintendence ; not that the commissioners shall revise the decrees of the Court of Sessions. The petitioners accordingly did not ask them to make such a revision, but to perform a duty which is merely ministerial and is imperatively enjoined on them by the statute.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b78-6\">\n<em>Sept. 30th.</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b78-10\">\n<em>Rice, contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqE\">The proceedings in the Court of Sessions had closed and the time for an appeal had elapsed, when the petition was presented, so that the case was not pending in that court within the last proviso in the 5th section of the statute. Neither does the case come within the first proviso, for the commissioners were not asked to supervise and review the road. The commissioners have power to put the county to expense, only in regard to roads which have been viewed and laid out by the commissioners themselves.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b78-11\">Parker C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AVc\">delivered the opinion of the Court to the following effect. The commissioners object, that in the state m which this road was at the time when the statute went into operation, they had no jurisdiction in the case. They allege that the road did not come within the 4th section, which provides that they shall have power \u201cto cause all roads <em>located by them </em>to be constructed and finished,\u201d and it is true that this road was not located by them, but by the Court of Sessions, and so is not within those words. But in the next section it is said, that \u201c all roads laid out, but not worked, at the time this act takes effect, shall be subjected to the super-, vision and review of the commissioners aforesaid, and the said commissioners shall have all the powers, and the counties be subject to all the liabilities, in reference to such roads, as are provided for new roads by this act.\u201d The legislature here had respect to roads located by the Court of Sessions, but not finished <em>; </em>including as well those which had been partly worked, as those on which no work had been done, and thej meant to transfer all authority on the subject to the commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>In the case before us the petition to the commissioners was, not to supervise and review, but to finish working the road ; and it is made a question whether they have power to recon- . .... _ \u201e sider the expediency of laying it out. The statute, we think, manifestly intends that they shall have such power. If they shall deem it proper that the road be made as laid out, they can go on and finish it; if not, it may be discontinued.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The petition, though not asldng them to supervise and review the road, yet contains a request on a subject on which they had jurisdiction, and they ought to have taken cognizance of it. We shall therefore grant a mandamus, but not a peremptory one, and they can determine whether it is, or is not, expedient that the road should be completed, and make return of their doings on the mandamus, at the next term of this Court in the county of Hampden.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b79-24\"> See <em>Springfield </em>v. <em>County Comm. of Hampden, </em>10 Pick. 59; <em>Danvers </em>v. <em>County Comm of Essex, </em>6 Pick.
