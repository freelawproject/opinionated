This provision gave occasion to extrava<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>gant charges, and the statute of 1821 was designed to correct the abuse, by fixing upon a sum which, on an average, would be an adequate compensation for such expenses. The true construction of this statute is, that where the defendant town is guilty of no negligence, the plaintiff town shall recover only at the rate of a dollar per week- Suppose that the pauper had died within ten days after the notice, and the defendants had immediately removed the dead body ; or suppose that the plaintiffs had prevented her removal; \u2014 it could hardly be pretended, that the defendants would not be entitled to the benefit of the statute. This case is similar in principie, as here the defendants were prevented by the pauper herself from bringing themselves within the letter of the act. If the construction given in the court below shall be sustained, it will open a door to collusion ; for towns will then induce paupers to remove, on purpose to recover more than this statute prescribes.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Adh\"><em>Sept. </em>29th.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b53-6\"><em>E.

Atch<em>eson </em>v. <em>Everitt, </em>Cowp. 391. The object of it was, to effect a speedy ascertainment of the settlement of paupers. Had the defendants removed this pauper, by their admission, the question of her settlement would have been for ever at rest. ' To the suggestion respecting collusion, the answer is, that where one party, by colluding, prevents the other from performing a condition, the latter shall not suffer.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b53-7\">Parker C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGn\">delivered the opinion of the Court. We think the verdict in this case stands right, it being for the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred by the plaintiffs for the support of a pauper belonging to the defendant town. Their right to this sum is derived from the general statute providing for the relief and support of paupers,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and cannot be taken away, except by some subsequent statute, the terms or which must be strictly complied with.</p>\n<p id=\"AQN\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>The <em>St. </em>1821, c. 94, [see Revised Stat. c. 46, \u00a7 15,] provides, that if the defendant town shall, within thirty days after notice, remove the pauper from the plaintiff town, it shall be charged only at the rate of one dollar per week. The defendants, instead of showing that they did remove, show only that they prepared to do the act, and that they were prevented by the voluntary removal of the pauper.</p>\n<p id=\"AD5\">It is argued, that to all the purposes intended by the legis lature, this removal is equivalent to a removal caused by the defendants ; hut we do not see it in this light: for we think that the great object of the provision was, to give an inducement to towns to admit the settlement of paupers and thereby save the expense of litigation. This purpose is not answered by a voluntary removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Technical rules support this construction ; for the removal provided for is to be considered a condition precedent to the diminution of expense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Now such a condition must be strictly performed <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which has not been done in the presen case.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b53-9\"> See Revised Stat. <em>c. </em>46, $ 13.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b54-12\"> See <em>Seckonk </em>v. <em>Attleborough, 7 </em>Pick. 155.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b54-13\"> See 1 Chit.
