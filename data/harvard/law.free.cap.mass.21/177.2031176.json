Wilgus.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b191-4\">On an indictment for obtaining money by false pretences, the defendant\u2019s assuming a false name, and delivering spurious quarters of lottery tickets to A. B. for sale on commission, with a declaration that the defendant had in a bank the genuine corresponding whole tickets, were held to be false pretences within <em>St. </em>1815, <em>c. </em>136; held also, that those facts were a sufficient evidence of an intent to defraud A. B.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-6\">Indictment on <em>St. </em>1815, c. 136, alleging that the defendant did knowingly and designedly, with the intent to cheat and defraud one Edward Hammond, get into his possession from Hammond, fifteen dollars of the property of Hammond, by the following false pretences and tokens, viz. \u2014 1. that his name was H. Cleutt; 2. that he was an agent for the managers of the Maryland Grand State Lottery; 3. that the quarters of tickets which the defendant offered to Hammond, signed H. Cleutt, were genuine quarters of tickets in that lottery; and 4. that he had the original tickets, corresponding with the numbers in the quarters, deposited in a bank in Boston.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-7\">On the trial, before <em>Morton </em>J., it was proved, that the defendant delivered to Hammond several quarters of tickets, signed H. Cleutt, purporting to be quarters of tickets in the lottery above mentioned, to sell on commission; that after Hammond had sold some of them, the defendant called upon him and obtained from him all the money which he had then received, deducting the commissions, which was fifteen dollars ; that when the defendant called upon Hammond to employ him to sell the quarters of tickets, Hammond understood the defendant to be Cleutt; that when he called to get the money, he answered to the name of Cleutt. and being asked if that was his name, said it was ; that in fact neither the defendant, nor Cleutt, was possessed, in a bank or elsewhere, of any original tickets in the lottery mentioned ; that the quarters sold by Hammond were signed by a man in Boston, who called himself Cleutt, and not by the defendant; and that the defendant\u2019s true name was Wilgus. But there was no evidence that the defendant pretended to Hammond that he was an agent of the Maryland Grand State Lottery, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>nor was there any evidence, other than what is above stated of an intent to defraud Hammond.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b192-7\">\n<em>Oct. 20th.</em>\n</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b192-8\"><em>Oct. </em>21st.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-10\">The jury were instructed, that if they were satisfied that the defendant obtained the money by means of any or all of the pretences stated in the indictment, \u2014 that the pretences by which the money was obtained were known by the defendant to be false, \u2014 and that he thus obtained the money with an intent to cheat and defraud Hammond, \u2014 they should find him guilty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-11\">A verdict being returned for the commonwealth, the defendant moved for a new trial, because there was no evidence showing that he obtained the money with intent to <em>cheat </em>and defraud Hammond.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b192-12\"><em>Hoar, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aa3\">after observing that the statute was copied from <em>St. 30 Geo. </em>2, <em>c. </em>24, insisted upon the objection stated in the motion, and also said that there was no evidence of such pretences as were intended by the statute. The quarters of tickets could not deceive, for like other quarters sold by lottery ticket venders generally, they are mere promissory notes, by which the seller agrees to pay the buyer one fourth of such a sum as may be drawn by a ticket of a corresponding number, quarters of tickets being in no case sold under the authority of the legislature or of the managers.

We are of opinion, however, that the misrepresentations here are evidently within the statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>The other point is also clear in favor of the commonwealth. It' was not necessary to prove that Hammond was actually defrauded ;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> if he might have been, and if there was an intent to defraud him, it is sufficient. He might have had so much confidence in the defendant\u2019s representations, as to make a warranty that the quarters sold by him should be paid accordng to their purport; and if he had done so, he would have been exposed to loss. It is plain then that he might have been defrauded ; and the fact of delivering these false papers to him to be sold as genuine, is sufficient evidence to warrant the jury in finding the wicked intent alleged.* <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">\n<em>Prisoner sentenced.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b192-15\"> The statutes of New York on this head extend to every case where a party has obtained money or goods by falsely representing himself to be a situation in which he is not, or by falsely representing any occurrence, that had not happened, to which persons of ordinary caution might give credit. <em>People </em>v. <em>Haynes, </em>11 Wendell, 565.
