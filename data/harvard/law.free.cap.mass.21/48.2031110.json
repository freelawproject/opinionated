J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5\">delivered the opinion of the Court. The authorities cited, especially the cases of <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Dutch </em>and <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>explicitly lay down the principle, that the promise of an infant cannot be revived, so as to sustain an action, unless there be an express confirmation or ratification after he comes of age,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>Such a ratification may be proved in divers ways ; but it cannot be inferred from a mere acknowledgment of debt, as in the cases on the statute of limitations. A promise to pay, is evidence of a ratification ; so is a direct confirmation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>though not in words amounting to a direct promise: as, if the party should say, after coming o\u00ed age, <em>I do ratify and </em>confirm, or, <em>do agree to </em>pay, <em>the debt.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">But a ratification may he absolute or conditional. If it be the latter, the terms of the condition must have happened, or been complied with, before an action can be sustained. <em>I ratify and confirm my </em>promise, <em>provided I receive a certain </em>legacy, or, <em>if I succeed to a certain </em>estate, or, <em>if I recover a certain sum of </em>money, or, <em>if I draw a prize in a certain </em>lottery, would make a conditional promise or ratification, sufficient to make the defendant liable on a contract made when a minor, when the events happen, but not before. So an engagement or promise to pay when able, is a conditional promise, and the plaintiff, to avail himself of it, must give in evidence the ability of the defendant. It would not be necessary to show an ability to pay without inconvenience, but evidence that there is property from which the debt might be paid, or an income from some source which would enable the party to pay, would be sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">The cases cited by the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel are bottomed upon this principle. That of <em>Martin </em>v. Mayo<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is thought to be of a different description, but we understand the Court to have there explicitly admitted the principle, but to have decided that the words appended to the promise did not constitute a condition, hut merely postponed the time of pay rnent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If there was any error, which however we do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>perceive, it was not in the principle adopted, but in the construction of the words of the promise.</p>\n<p id=\"Aoj\">\n<em>nonsuit.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b55-13\"> See 2 Kent\u2019s Com. (3d ed.) 288; <em>Benham </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>9 Connect. R. 330; 2 Stark. Ev. (5th Amer. ed.) 406, n. (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-15\">The ratification of an infant\u2019s engagement should be equivalent to a new promise. It should be a promise to a <em>party </em>in interest or his agent, or, at least, an explicit admission of an existing liability from which a promise may be implied. <em>Goodsell </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>3 Wendell, 479. See also <em>Gay </em>v. <em>Ballou, </em>4 Wendell, 403; <em>Merriam. </em>v. <em>Wilkins, </em>6 N. Hamp. R. 432; <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Hurd, </em>4 Day, 57; <em>Kline </em>v. <em>Beebe, </em>6 Connect. R. 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-16\">It has been held, that a negotiable note executed by an infant is void <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number><em>M\u2018Minn </em>v. <em>Richmond, </em>6 Yerger, 1; <em>Swasey </em>v. <em>Vanderheyden, </em>10 Johns. R. 33; 2 Kent\u2019s Com. (3d ed.) 235. If this position were correct, such a note would seem to be incapable of confirmation. See <em>Maples </em>v. <em>Wightman, 4 </em>Connect. R. 376; <em>Baylis </em>v. <em>Dineley, </em>3 Maule &amp; Selw. 477. But the weight of authority is strongly in favor of holding such a note voidable only and capable of confirmation by the infant on arriving at age. See <em>Goodsell </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>3 Wendell, 479; <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Steele, </em>2 N. Hamp. R. 51; <em>Lawson </em>v. <em>Lovejoy, </em>8 Greenl 405; <em>Dubose </em>v. <em>Wheddon, </em>4 M'Cord, 221; <em>Cheshire </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>4 M'Cord. 241; <em>Delano </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>11 Wendell, 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">Where an infant purchased a yoke of oxen, for which he gave his negotia ble promissory note, and after coming of age he converted them to his own use and received their avails, it was held, that this was a ratification of the promise, and that the indorsee of the note was entitled to recover. <em>Lawson </em>v. <em>Lovejoy, </em>8 Greenl. 405; S. <em>P. Cheshire </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>4 M'Cord, 241.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">It is held, however, in Connecticut, that the bare retention of the consideration for which a note was given by an infant, after his arriving at age, is not a ratification; nor is an acknowledgment, that he made the note, or that it is due, sufficient for this purpose, but there must be a promise to pay. <em>Benham </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>9 Connect. R. 330.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">An infant took the note of a third person, in payment for work done, and retained it eight months after coming of age. <em>Held, </em>a ratification of the contract. <em>Delano </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>11 Wendell, 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-11\">The voidable deed of an infant passes his interest in lands to the bargainee, and it may be confirmed, on his arriving at age, by acts short of a deed of confirmation. <em>Wheaton </em>v. <em>East, </em>5 Yerger, 41. But see <em>Dearborn </em>v. <em>Eastman, 4 </em>N. Hamp. R. 441; <em>Somes </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>2 Pick. (2d ed.) 199, n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-12\">But it is held, that a mere acquiescence in a conveyance made by him, with out objection for several months after his coming of age, is not a confirmation of it. Those acts <em>in pais </em>which amount to a confirmation of his deed, should be of such a solemn and unequivocal nature as to establish a clear intention to confirm the deed after a full knowledge that it was voidable. <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Moreland, </em>10 Peters, 75, 76; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>11 Johns. R. 542, 543.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-13\">It is, however, said in <em>Wheaton </em>v. <em>East, </em>5 Yerger, 41, that any act of the minor, from which his assent to a deed made during his minority may be inferred, will operate as a confirmation.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-14\">Where an infant, having executed a deed of conveyance in 1791, at the age of eighteen years, held the note given for the consideration four years, and then married, and her husband held it until her death in 1815, and continued to hold it eleven years afterwards, and during the whole period there was no act or expression of disaffirmance, and the grantee was permitted to remain in the undisturbed occupation of the land, it was held, that there was both an implied and a tacit affirmance. <em>Kline </em>v. <em>Beebe, </em>6 Connect. R.494. See <em>Bigelow </em>v. <em>Kinney, </em>3 Vermont R. 353; <em>Belton </em>v. <em>Briggs, 4 </em>Desauss. 465; 2 Stark. Ev. (5th Amer. ed.) 405, n.
