The committee assessed damages to the plaintiff\u2019s testator in the sum of 203 dollars, for injury done to his land by the location, which sum was tendered by the corporation to the testator before the working of the road, but was not received by him. In September 1823, the testator petitioned the Court of Sessions for a jury to assess his damages, and such proceedings were had thereon, that a verdict was returned to that court in March 1824. At a subsequent term in March 1825, those proceedings were vacated and the verdict set aside for irregularity, leaving the petition pending ; after which the respondents appeared no further in the suit. Before the next term the testator died ; and the court adjudged that the petition was thereby abated. In November 1825, the plaintiff demanded of the treasurer of the corporation, the damages assessed by the committee, and afterwards brought this action upon the order above mentioned, requiring the corporation to pay the damages so assesed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b141-8\">\n<em>Newton,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A49\">to show that debt would lie on such order, referred to <em>Bigelow </em>v. <em>Cambridge &amp;c.
