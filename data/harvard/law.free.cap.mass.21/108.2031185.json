The defendant contended, that the plaintiff had made a new contract with Sibley, by which he had discharged him from a fulfilment of the first contract, and had agreed to take his pay for the chaise of one Chase. After the defendant had introduced some evidence tending to prove such new contract, he offered to show that Sibley indorsed upon a note of hand which he held against Chase, the value of the scythes; to which the plaintiff objected, unless it should be also proved that the indorsement was made with the knowledge and consent of the plaintiff. The objection however was overruled, and the evidence admitted, without proof that the indorsement was made with the knowledge or consent of the plaintiff, and a verdict was returned for the defendant. Whereupon the plaintiff filed his exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Ay4\">Newton, in support of the exceptions,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9Y\">said the indorsement was the mere declaration of the adverse party ; not a part of the res gestee, but <em>res inter alios acta; </em>having no tendency to prove that the plaintiff made a new2 contract, but which might however mislead the jury ; and not coming within the excepted cases in which declarations are admissible m evidence. 1 Starkie on Evid. 49, <em>et seq. </em>and 69, [5th Amer. ed. 61 ;] <em>Roseboom, </em>v.
