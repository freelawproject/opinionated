And also, for that the said <em>John </em>and Phineas, at &amp;c., being indebted to the plaintiffs in the sum of nine dollars and twenty-five cents,\u201d &amp;c. The <em>ad damnum </em>was laid at' 100 dollars.

This, it was stated by the counsel, was before the xvrit of error was sued out, but not until after Joseph H. had been committed on execution and had broken his bond for the prison liberties.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-11\">The counsel for the present defendants noxv moved that the writ of error be dismissed, on the ground that the right to file exceptions, under <em>St. </em>1820, c. 79, \u00a7 5, in cases in which the <em>ad damnum </em>does not exceed 100. dollars, is substantially a right of appeal, and therefore error will not lie. <em>Savage </em>v. Gulliver, 4 Mass. R. 178; <em>Jarvis </em>v. <em>Blanchard, 6 </em>Mass. R. 5; <em>Champion </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>9 Mass. R. 228. [Rand\u2019s ed. 229, n.

PI. 298 ; Lawes on Assumpsit, 59 ; \u2014 and as to the third, <em>Grosvenor </em>v. Danforth, 16 Mass. R. 74.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-13\">The counsel on the other side admitted, that the mistake in calling <em>Joseph </em>H. by the name of <em>John, </em>would have been fatal, had advantage been taken of it in season; but they insisted that the defect was cured by suffering a judgment by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>default. 5 Dane\u2019s Abr. 705, \u00a7 32; <em>Wolf </em>v. <em>Stepney, </em>Cro.

R. 230; 3 Mass. R. 160; that the first count was in fact upon a promissory note, but it was not necessary to allege it to be so, as no profer\u00ed of the note is required ; Chitty on Bills (5th ed.), 452; that a promissory note imports a consideration, without the words \u201c value received,\u201d and in declaring upon it a consideration need not be stated ; Bayl. on Bills (Phillips and Sewall\u2019s 1st ed.), p. 25, and note 71, and <em>p. </em>275 ; Chitty on .Bills (5th ed.), 12, 13, 87, 452; 4 East, 455 ; 8 East, 7 ; 2 Bos. &amp; Pul. 79 ; and that the fact, that the promise in this case was by a note, being matter of evidence only, it was not necessary to allege a con-, sideration for the promise set forth ; <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Goddard, </em>Cro. Eliz. 79 ;\u2014 and further, that every thing was to be intended against the defendant after a verdict, and, by our <em>St. </em>1784, <em>c. </em>29, \u00a7 14, after a default, and it was too late to make this objection to the first count. 1 New Rep. 172.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-5\">To show that the third error assigned was cured by the <em>remittitur </em>of the excess of damages, they cited 6 Dane\u2019s Abr. <em>p. </em>279, \u00a7 2, 7, and p. 302, \u00a711; <em>Hutchinson </em>v. <em>Crossen, </em>10 Mass. R. 252.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b521-6\">Parker C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQM\">delivered the opinion of the Court. By the record it appears, that the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas could not have been appealed from, the damages demanded being not more than 100 dollars ; and so the writ of error cannot be dismissed on that ground. That the court rendered judgment for more than the <em>ad damnum, </em>did not entitle the defendant to appeal therefrom, for it was erroneous ; unless a <em>remittitur </em>entered at the next term after judgment, in the Court of Common Pleas, cured it. And we think it did, for it seems a <em>remittitur </em>may be entered, as well after judgment as before, by the court where the record is by the law supposed to remain; as appears by the case of <em>Hutchinson v Crossen, </em>10 Mass. R. 252; 1 Sellon\u2019s Pract. 481. In 6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>Dane\u2019s Abr. <em>p. </em>279, \u00a7 2, is cited a case in Essex, June term 1796, where on error brought because the damages exceeded the <em>ad </em>damnum, the plaintiff was allowed, by way of amendment, to release the excess. And in <em>Pickwood </em>v. Wright, 1 H. Bl. 642, it was expressly decided, that a <em>remittitur </em>might be entered after judgment and after error brought.* <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">The first count is very clearly bad, in not showing any consideration for the promise declared on.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Authorities have been cited to show that no consideration need be averred, but the cases cited are all of bills of exchange or promissory notes, which may be thought to import a consideration. The declaration in this case is only, that the defendants promised the plaintiffs to pay them, or their order, one hundred and seven dollars and thirty-two cents. Whether it was a written or verbal promise does not appear, and the Court cannot intend it to be a promissory note. This no doubt was a mere clerical mistake, which might have been amended at the Court of Common Pleas; but standing as it does, and this Court having no power to amend it,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the judgment must be reversed for this error.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">It certainly is questionable, whether if the promise had been declared to be by a promissory note, and no value re ceived were averred, the <em>count would be </em>good, notwithstanding the passage cited from <em>Bayley </em>;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which does not appear to be supported by the case referred to in the margin, and a contrary inference is to be drawn from the case cited from 2 Bos. &amp; Pul. 79. The doctrine of that case is, that in all declarations on simple contracts, a consideration must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>averred. The case of a hill of exchange may be an exceptian, that being treated rather as a specialty, which imports a consideration in itself. And we do not find in any of the cases cited, that it is clearly laid down, that counts in assumpsit on simple contracts are good without an averment of consideration.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"AtS\">\n<em>April 2d.</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b523-3\">After the foregoing opinion was delivered, it was suggested, that for the error therein maintained the judgment could be reversed in part only; and the Court afterwards considered the remaining error.</p>\n<author id=\"b523-4\">Parker C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aezd\">As to the second count, the error assigned is, that no promise is alleged, nor any cause of action shown, against the parties sued. They were attached by the names of <em>Joseph </em>and Phineas, and the count avers that <em>\u201c </em>the said <em>John </em>and Phineas\u201d made the promise. This is undoubtedly bad ; and the only question is, whether for this cause judgment shall be reversed. It is not like any of the cases which are cured by a verdict, for among all which were cited to that point, we do not find one which goes beyond the curing of a misnomer. This is not a misnomer, for the defendants were attached by their true names ; the defect is in the declaration, it not showing any cause of action against the parties sued. If the defendants bad appeared and pleaded, talcing no advantage of this mistake, we will not say that they should be allowed afterwards to avail themselves of it on error; but here was a default, and nothing can be presumed but what appears in the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"AecX\"><em>Judgment </em>reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b522-11\"> See <em>Herbert </em>v. <em>Hardenbergh, </em>5 Halsted, 222, and the cases there commented <em>on; Davenport </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>4 Connect.
