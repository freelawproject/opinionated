The defendants objected that this agreement, if it proved any thing, was a contract, and not evidence in this action. It was rejected by the chief justice ; but lists of the names of workmen, which had been furnished by the plaintiffs, were admitted in evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-9\">One of the men supposed to have been enticed, having been called as a witness by the defendants, testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>Parmenter, one of the defendants, agreed with him, the day after he had given notice to the plaintiffs that he should leave their service in a fortnight, to receive him into the de fendants\u2019 works ; and it appeared that this man, and another who was called by the defendants, received pay from the defendants for the last fortnight while they were under pay from the plaintiffs ; but it did not appear that any offer was made before notice had been given, and the men remained with the plaintiffs until the fortnight after notice had expired.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b448-7\">March 31st, 1826</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-6\">The defendants contended that they had a right to make a bargain with the men during the continuance of their service with the plaintiffs, to take effect only after the expiration o\u00ed that service according to notice. But the chief justice instructed the jury, that while the actual employment continued, though after the notice to quit, it was not lawful for the defendants to malte any bargain or any offer of employment to take effect at a future time, and that if the jury believed the witness, they must return a verdict against Parmenter, and such others of the defendants as they should be satisfied participated in the transaction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AmQ\">A verdict was found for the defendants. If the evidence offered by the plaintiffs and rejected at the trial ought to have been admitted, a new trial was to be granted. If the foregoing instruction to the jury was correct, the Court were to judge whether a new trial should be granted on account of the verdict\u2019s being against the evidence on that point.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AZfd\"><em>Sullivan </em>and Hubbard, for the plaintiffs,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ac-\">said it might be doubtful whether the agreement was any thing more than an honorary engagement; which would not sustain an action, but he insisted that it ought to have been received in evidence as an admission by the defendants that the plaintiffs were glass-makers, that the men enticed were essential to them in that business, and that the defendants knew these men were in the employment of the plaintiffs when they contracted with them. If the agreement would support an action, the plaintiffs had a choice of remedies, and a recovery here would be a bar to an action on the contract, so that on this ground there could be no objection to the admission of the paper in evidence.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b449-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number><em>April 3d, </em>1826</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-2\">But the strong ground of the plaintiffs is, that ti ,iefendants hired and retained the men while in the act\u00faa employment of the plaintiffs, and which fact was knows to the defendants at the time. In the course of the fortnight after the notice the plaintiffs might have reengaged the men, if the defendants had not improperly interfered. Giving the notice was in consequence of a combination between the defendants and the workmen, which was an enticing, within the true meaning of the term. <em>Blake </em>v. Lanyon, 6 T.

The counsel for the plaintiffs move for a new trial on two grounds , first, because certain contracts offered by them in evidence were not admitted ; secondly, because the verdict, according to the law as laid down at the trial by the chief justice, is against the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">As to the first point, we think it very clear that the contracts offered in evidence were not admissible, not having any tendency to establish any fact material to the issue. The contracts with the laborers who are said to have been enticed from the plaintiffs\u2019 employment, had expired long before the \\3ts complained of; they could not therefore by any possibility be material; and as to the contract or agreement between some of the plaintiffs and some of the defendants, it is a sufficient objection, that the defendants are not sued upon that agreement; nor could they be, for it is between different parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">As to the second point, we are of opinion that the verdict is right. The evidence is clearly insufficient to support the action, as we understand the law. The defendants had a legal right to make a contract with the plaintiffs\u2019 laborers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>to take effect after the expiration of their term, of service with the plaintiffs. The law is laid down correctly by Lord Kenyon, in the case of <em>Nichol et al. </em>v. <em>Martyn, </em>2 Esp. R. 732, that \u201cto induce a servant to leave his master\u2019s service at the expiration of the time for which the servant had hired himself, although the servant had no intention at the time, of quitting his master\u2019s service, was not the subject of an action.\u201d It is <em>damnum absque injuri\u00e9. </em>The cases cited by the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel do not countenance a. different doctrine. If the law were otherwise, it would lead to the most mischievous consequences, and would operate injuriously both to Iaoorers and their employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">\n<em>Judgment according to the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
