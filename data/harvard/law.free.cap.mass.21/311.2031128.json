Pratt and indorsed in blank by the defendant. The declaration contained two counts, the first charging the defendant as maker, the second, as guarantor.</p><p id=\"b331-10\">\n<em>Rand</em>\n</p><p id=\"AUP\">contended that the defendant must be considered as an indorser, and not as an original promisor; <em>Tillman </em>v. Wheeler, 17 Johns. R. 326; <em>Huntington </em>v. Harvey, 4 Connect.

R. 436, was erroneously described in the report as being payable to order. He cited also <em>Carver </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>5 Mass. R. 546; <em>Palmer </em>v. Grant, 4 Connect.

See <em>Wylie </em>v. <em>Lewis, 7 </em>Connect. R. <em>301; Herrick </em>v. <em>Carman, </em>12 Johns. R. 159. But <em>where </em>the indorsement is made after the making of the not\u00e9, a consideration for the indorsement must be proved. <em>Tenney </em>v. <em>Prince, </em>4 Pick. 385, and 7 Pick. 243.
