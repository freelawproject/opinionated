The case of <em>Callender </em>v. Marsh, 1 Pick. 426, shows that the power of surveyors of highways does not depend on the \u2022 limits being assigned ; and the same may be said of their duties. It is indeed there intimated, that until such assignment they must act together, but the case did not require the decision of that point. No joint powers are given to surveyors, and it is manifest from the whole statute, that they are to act separately. See \u00a7 2, 4, 8, 10, 11 ; also <em>St. </em>1796, c. 58. If no assignment is made by the assessors, any one of the surveyors may receive the highway tax list of all persons in the town, and may give notice of the times and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>places for laboring on the highways, and any person, who shall agreeably to such notice work out his tax, will be justified in refusing to comply with a subsequent requisition for the same tax. So too if no tax is assessed and no limits assigned by the assessors, the surveyors may agree among themselves on their respective limits and make the necessary repairs. There is alw\u00e1ys by law a period in which there may be no limits assigned, as the surveyors are chosen at the annual meeting in March or April, and the assignment may be made at any time before the first day of May. If all the surveyors must be consulted, a road cannot be repaired, however defective it may be, until a majority of them determine that the repairs shall be made ; and yet each surveyor is liable for the deficiency. Making the repairs was necessary for the plaintiff\u2019s protection, so that it was not a voluntary courtesy, as in the case of <em>Roxbury </em>v. <em>Worcester Turnp. Corp. </em>2 Pick. 41; [see 2d edit. 44, n. 1 ;] and the consent of the other surveyors, who were equally interested, may be presumed. It may be said the consent of the selectmen was wanting ; but if it is admitted that with their consent one surveyor might have made the repairs and have claimed indemnity, then we say that the necessity of such consent was dispensed with by the urgency of the case, the public safety demanding that the repairs should be made immediately.</p>\n<otherdate data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"AnH\"><em>April term </em>1827.</otherdate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b163-4\">Stedman, contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQif\">said, that the plaintiff was a statute officer, and must in every thing pursue the provisions of the statute. As a surveyor, he had no right to charge the town in this manner. He had no duties to perform, and was not liable for any deficiency in the ways, until his limits were assigned. <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Waterville, </em>5 Mass. R. 294. But if he might have acted before the assignment, he ought to have consulted with the other surveyors. <em>Callender </em>v. Marsh, 1 Pick. 426. It is said he might repair, because he, with the other survey ors, was liable for any deficiency in the way ; for a similar reason then, the town being subject to an indictment for such deficiency, any inhabitant might make repairs and claim indemnity from the town.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b163-8\">Parker C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWdT\">delivered the opinion of the Court. If the factd reported in the bill of exceptions present a whole view <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>of the transaction, it seems an ungracious thing on the part \u00b0f the town to refuse to reimburse the plaintiff for his expenditure on their behalf; but as they put themselves upon the law, for which they may have better reasons than we can discern from the bill of exceptions, we must decide according to the strict rights of the parties as they exist by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"AiDs\">It appears that the limits for the surveyors had not been assigned,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> so that the particular piece of road in question did not fall within the care of the plaintiff; neither did he exercise his authority under his former appointment according to the statute. It was the intention of the legislature, that the inhabitants of towns should have the right to discharge this important duty of keeping the roads in repair, by their labor or the use of their utensils, so as to be relieved, from paying the tax in money. This design is apparent in various provisions of <em>St. </em>1786, c. 81. By the 4th section, where the sum appropriated for the repairs of highways, in the limits of any surveyor, shall prove insufficient for the purpose, he is, with the consent of the selectmen, to employ the inhabitants to make up the deficiency, and the persons thus employed shall be equitably paid out of the town treasury. By the 8th section, if the town neglects to vote a sufficient sum, or otherwise to provide for the repairs, the surveyor is to assess a sufficient portion of work and labor on the persons in his limits, who shall still perform the duty required in labor, if they see fit. The case before us does not come within either of the sections cited, because it does not appear that there was any deficiency in the highway tax for the preceding year, nor was there any neglect of the town for the current year. Under the 8th section however it is conceived, that as the town had not provided means for repairing this road, the surveyor might, supposing his authority within the limits before appointed to have continued until there was a new assignment, have proceeded, as was advised by one of the selectmen, to apportion the work upon the inhabitants within his limits. But there seems to be in no part of the statute any authority for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>mm to malee the repairs at his own expense and then to call on the town ; and it would be dangerous to uphold town officers in assuming any authority beyond what the statutes give</p>\n<p id=\"b165-3\">them. Regretting therefore as we do the loss which the plaintiff has incurred, we do not however think ourselves justified in supporting his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">It is said it was the duty of this town to,have repaired this road | that it was liable to indictment for the neglect, as well as to an action by any one who might have been injured thereby; and that for these reasons it is answerable to the plaintiff, who stepped in to save it from these consequences : but the same reasons would, justify any individual of the town, or any stranger, as well as a surveyor ; who, beyond the duty imposed on him by the statute, has no more authority than the other inhabitants.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b164-5\"> As to the mode of assigning limits for the surveyors, see Be vised Stat e. 25, \u00a7 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b165-10\"> See <em>Loiter </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>13 Pick. 349.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
