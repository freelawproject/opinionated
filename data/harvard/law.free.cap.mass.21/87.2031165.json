There can be no question of this, unless in regard to the covenant against incumbrances. If that breach is ill assigned, the defendant could take advantage of the defect only on special demurrer ; it is cured by verdict or general demurrer. Com. Dig. Pleader, C, 47, 48, 2 V, 3; 2 Saund. 380; <em>Fowle </em>v. Welsh, 1 Barn. &amp; Cressw. 29; <em>Sedgwick </em>v. <em>Hollen</em>back, 7 Johns. R. 376. It is apprehended, however, that even on special demurrer the breach is well assigned, notwithstanding the dictum to the contrary in <em>Marston </em>v. Hobbs, 2 Mass. R. 433; which seems to be founded on a mistake, in considering the covenant against incumbrances as similar to a covenant for quiet enjoyment.</p>\n<otherdate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"Agd\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>\n<em>April term 1827, at Greenfield</em>\n</otherdate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b97-2\"><em>E. H. Mills </em>and <em>Ashmun, contra,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AnU\">to show that no particular incumbrance being set forth, the assignment of the breach was ill, cited <em>Marston </em>v. Hobbs, 2 Mass. R. 433; <em>Bickford </em>v. <em>Page, </em>ibid. 461; 1 Chit. Pl. 328; and this defect would be fatal after verdict. 1 Chit. Pl. 332. It was necessary to plead to those breaches only which were well assigned, and the plea operates as a demurrer to the other.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-3\"><em>Wells, </em>in reply. The defendant ought to have pleaded to the two first breaches and demurred to the last. Com. Dig <em>Pleader, </em>2 <em>V, </em>3, cites 1 Saund. 108; <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Sherwin, </em>1 Salk. 137. His plea professes to be an answer to the whole declaration, but in truth is an answer to part only , the plaintiff was therefore obliged to demur. If he had gone to issue, it would have been a discontinuance. 1 Chit. Pl. 509, 510.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-5\">On the subject of discontinuance, <em>Mills </em>referred to <em>Sterling </em>v. <em>Sherwood, </em>20 Johns. R. 204.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b97-6\">The opinion of the Court was read as drawn up by</p>\n<author id=\"b97-7\">Parker C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARQ\">The last cause of demurrer is manifestly mistaken, for there is a direct affirmation and denial between the declaration and the plea, so that it was proper to tender an issue to the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">And with respect to the other cause, it is clearly unsupported. If three breaches had been well assigned, no doubt the plea would be bad, as it does not answer all; but we think it clear that the breach in relation to the incumbrances is not well assigned, and therefore needed not to be noticed in the plea. A general assignment of a breach, such as negativing the words of the covenant, is proper where such general assignment shows clearly that there is a breach ;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as in the covenant of seisin and of a right to sell, denying the seisin and the right to sell, of itself shows a breach.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 3But in relation to covenants respecting quiet enjoyment, warranty, and incumbrances, the law is otherwise, because a mere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>denial does not necessarily show a breach;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 2for there may be disturbances or incumbrances which are not covered by such covenants, and therefore the manner in which the plaintiff was disturbed or the land incumbered, must be stated, in order that the Court may see that there has been a breach. And so it is laid down in the case of <em>Marston </em>v. Hobbs, and the position is fully supported by Com. Dig.
