The declaration contained only one count. The defendants pleaded severally the general issue, which was joined. A trial was had before <em>Williams </em>J. in the Court of Common Pleas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ARK\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>The plaintiff, to prove his title to the close and fence, reac\u00a1 in evidence a deed from Bourne, one of the defendants, to Joscelyn and Howard, dated March 8, 1824, conveying to them his homestead farm (comprehending the close) and describing it as bounded \u201c westerly on W. White.\u201d Also a deed from Joscelyn and Howard, dated January 10, 1825, conveying the close to the plaintiff and referring to the former deed for boundaries. To show the true course <em>of </em>the plaintiff\u2019s westerly line, he read in evidence a deed, dated in 1823, from Bourne to White, of the adjoining lot of land. <em>Ia </em>that deed White\u2019s easterly line, adjoining the plaintiff\u2019s close, is described as running from a stake and stones in E. Phillips\u2019s corner, in a straight course, to the corner first mentioned in the deed, without referring to any other visible monument upon or near the line. The plaintiff further proved, that at the time of making the deed to White, the fence in question was standing ; that it extended from the stake and stones in Phillips\u2019s corner to the other corner of the plaintiff\u2019s and White\u2019s land; that the ends of the fence were exactly or very nearly coincident with the plaintiff\u2019s line, but that it deviated from a straight course, so that at its greatest distance it was fifteen feet from the plaintiff\u2019s line ; and that it was the only fence which protected the plaintiff\u2019s land on that side.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-5\">It also appeared in evidence, that at the time of making the deed to White, Bourne took a stipulation from White, that the whole of the fence should continue to be the property of Bourne, notwithstanding the deed, and although the greater part of the fence stood on White\u2019s land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-6\">The fence continued to protect the plaintiff\u2019s close, until May 1825, when the defendants carried away the greater part of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-7\">The judge instructed the jury, that the plaintiff had no right to that part of the fence which stood on the westerly side of the straight line mentioned in the deed to White ; that he had a right to that part which stood within the limits of his own land or on the line thereof; that if the defendants took away any part so belonging to the plaintiff, it was a breach of his close, for which he was entitled to recover damages in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>action, but that the burden of proof was on the plaintiff, and if they were not satisfied of this fact beyond a reasonable doubt, their verdict must be for the defendants.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b257-11\">\n<em>Oct 24th</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-3\">The jury then retired, and at the opening of the court after an adjournment, they delivered in a sealed verdict as follows:\u2014\u201c The evidence adduced by the plaintiff, &amp;c. is not sufficient to prove to the jury beyond a doubt, that there was a breach made in the plaintiff\u2019s close.\u201d The judge being of opinion, that under the above instructions, this was a verdict for the defendants, directed a general verdict of <em>not guilty </em>to be drawn, and he stated to the jury, that if it was their intention to find a verdict for the defendants, it must, in order to conform to the pleadings, be, that the defendants are not guilty; but if such was not their intention, they had in fact found no verdict. The verdict of not guilty was then presented to the foreman, with instructions, if he was satisfied with it in that form, to sign it; which he did. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel requested that the jury might be polled, in order to ascertain whether they agreed to the verdict in its present form. The jurors were not inquired of separately and individually, whether they agreed to the verdict, but it was distinctly read to them and affirmed by them collectively, in the usual manner, without objection on their part, and was recorded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-4\">To these instructions and proceedings the plaintiff filed his exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b257-5\"><em>Wood </em>and <em>Eddy,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AUz\">in support of the exceptions, contended, that the fence passed to the plaintiff as appurtenant to the farm. It was one continuous thing, and the deviation of fifteen feet from the boundary line was of no consequence. If the grantor had died before the conveyance, the fence would have gone to his heir, and not to his executor. <em>Archer </em>v.

R. 447; <em>Whalley </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>1 Bos. &amp; Pul. 375. The plaintiff was tenant by sufferance of the land between the boundary line and the fence, and so may maintain trespass against the defendants for entering on that land. Com.

P. 90.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-6\">If a breach of the plaintiff\u2019s close is not proved, still the action is maintained, for a tortious taking of the fence is shown. 1 Chit.

This doctrine is not applicable to civil cases. If a jury are satisfied that a plaintiff has maintained his action, they should find a verdict for him, notwithstanding they may have some particle of doubt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-8\">The sealed verdict did not embrace the whole issue, which included the <em>asportavit </em>as well as the <em>clausum fregit. </em>It is true that the courts here do not poll juries according to the practice in New York; but in this instance the jury should have retired to deliberate, before their verdict was changed into a general verdict for the defendant. <em>Rosse\u2019s case, 3 </em>Leon. 83.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b258-9\"><em>Beal, </em>for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-z\">cited, in regard to polling the jury, <em>Wats </em>v. <em>Brains, </em>Cro.

The objection on this point furnishes no ground for' a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">Another objection is made in relation to the effect of the verdict as returned by the jury. When the jury have found a verdict substantially, it is read to them in form.( If any juror does not agree to it when so read, he may express his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>dissent, and the jury may retire and revise the verdict. But if, when asked in the usual manner whether they agree to the verdict, they all answer in the affirmative, it will be sufficient to authorize it to be recorded.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">As to the merits of the case, we consider the property of the fence to have been in Bourne, by virtue of his agreement with White. Without doubt, but for this agreement, the fence would have passed to White. The conveyance to the plaintiff was by a line which excluded the fence, and left it, in one place, fifteen feet within White\u2019s land, and the deed contained no covenant or bargain respecting the fence. This gave no right as against White, so that the plaintiff could not, without license from him, have occupied between the line of his purchase and the fence, without trespassing. The act of the defendants therefore, in taking away the fence, was no wrong to the plaintiff, for he neither owned the land on which it stood, nor is there any evidence that he was in possession of it; for his possession must be held to correspond with his title, unless a different possession is proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">The principles advanced by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel are not controverted, that the fence upon the land conveyed will pass as appurtenant, without being specially named, and that a fence intended and maintained as a division fence would so pass, although it might vary from the true line. But the part of the fence taken by the defendants was not intended as a division fence. On the contrary, by compact, it was agreed between Bourne and White not to be a division fence, but to be left as the property of Bourne, distinct from the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Joscelyn and Howard should have contracted with Bourne for the fence, if they wished to have it, and they would then have had the same right respecting it that Bourne had ; which however, as against White, would have been limited to the right of taking it away, for by the deed of White there was no qualification of his title or possession of the land conveyed to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">It was urged, that in trespass <em>quare clausum, </em>although the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>plaintiff fails to prove his close, he may recover for chatte.s alleged to have been carried away. The authorities however do not support this, where there is but one count.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But if it were so, the case shows that the plaintiff has neither proved his property in the close, nor in the fence.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b259-8\"> See <em>Commonwealth v.
