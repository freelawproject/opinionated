The defence was, that the <em>locus in quo </em>was the soil and freehold of the defendant. The plaintiff claimed under a deed from James Conant, of April 2, 1824. The defendant claimed by virtue of an attachment made on the 30th of March, 1824, and a levy in 1825, in a suit against the same Conant. It appeared that the defendant being the assignee of a mortgage of the land, and the plaintiff being desirous of purchasing the land, the defendant agreed to sell his interest to the plaintiff for 175 dollars, and upon receiving that sum from the plaintiff\u2019s agent on the 29th of March, 1824, he conveyed his right to Conant for the purpose of enabling Conant to convey the whole estate to the plaintiff on the 2d of April; but in the mean time he made his attachment as before stated. The trespass complained of consisted in the subsequent levy. There was no evidence of any actual injury done to the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-7\">The counsel for the defendant contended, that the jury could not legally infer from these facts that the defendant acted fraudulently in making his attachment; but the jury were instructed, that if the defendant had agreed to convey his interest to the plaintiff by this form of conveyancing, he had no right to interfere in his own behalf to prevent it, and that such conduct was fraudulent and rendered his attachment of no avail against the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-8\">The counsel contended also, that the jury should give nominal damages, if any ; but they were instructed, that they could find a verdict for the plaintiff only on the ground that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>the defendant had conducted himself fraudulently, and that they might give such damages as they were satisfied the plaintiff had sustained in consequence of the wrongful act of the defendant, not including in their estimate any thing paid for counsel fees, or services which are compensated in the bill of costs.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b156-6\">\n<em>Oct. 4th.</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<otherdate data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b156-7\"><em>April term </em>1827</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-9\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff for 45 dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-10\">If, in the opinion of the Court, the plaintiff was not entitled to recover, he was to be nonsuited; if he was entitled to recover, but only nominal damages, he was to release the excess and have a judgment on the verdict for nominal damages.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b156-11\"><em>E. SI Mills </em>contended,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6e\">that although the defendant\u2019s conduct was unfair and fraudulent, yet that as the whole estate in the land was revested in Conant, it might be attached by any of Conant\u2019s creditors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b156-12\">But he insisted chiefly on the point, that the damages should have been nominal only ; as to which, he cited 3 Stark. Ev. 1450, 1451, 1454; Bennett v. <em>Allcott, 2 </em>T. R. 166 ; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>3 T. R. 292 ; <em>Bracegirdle </em>v. <em>Orford, 2 </em>Maule &amp; Selw. 77.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b156-13\">\n<em>Lee, contra,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMd\">said, that where the act of the defendant is malicious, or morally fraudulent, there might be more than nominal damages ; and that unless the damages assessed were outrageous, the Court would not set aside the verdict. He cited <em>Tillotson </em>v. <em>Cheetham, 2 </em>Johns. R. 63 ; 3 Bl. Com. 209 <em>el seq.; Newman </em>v. <em>Smith, 2 </em>Salk. 642 ; <em>Dix </em>v. <em>Brookes, </em>Str. 61 ; Bull. N. P. 89 ; <em>Hoyt v. Gelston, </em>13 Johns. R. 141, 561 ; <em>Woert </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>14 Johns. R. 352.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b156-14\">Parker C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"APG\">delivered the opinion of the Court. This is trespass <em>quare clausum, </em>and by the evidence reported the case is well maintained for the plaintiff. The fraud of the defendant in relation to his attachment is palpable and gross and his counsel has wisely pressed but very feebly any genera defence.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-15\">But the point of damages is questionable. There is no evidence of any injury done to the soil or to the buildings, or to the trees, or any other product of the soil. The tres pass, for aught that appears, and probably in fact, was a simple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>entry ; so that there is no ground for any but nominal damages, unless the jury had a right to consider the fraud practised, and to give arbitrarily what they might suppose was proper either as punishment or compensation. We do not think they had any right in this action to assess damages upon any such principle. If the soil had been disturbed, or the trees been cut down, then, in such case, they would give the utmost value of the property injured or destroyed; but because the defendant acted fraudulently, the plaintiff is not entitled to his money, unless he suffered by the fraud.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> *3It looks like an attempt, either to punish the defendant, or to reimburse the plaintiff for the expenses of his suit, in a way different from that provided by law. There is no more reason for giving 45 dollars, than there would be for giving 500; indeed it is going without rule or compass. We think therefore the plaintiff must remit all the damages above one dollar, or a new trial will be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b157-3\"> See <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Bliss, </em>2 Mass. R. 112. The principle, that fraud accompanied with damage is a good cause of action, has been repeatedly recognised, and is now well settled, both in the English and American jurisprudence. <em>Baily </em>v. <em>Merrell, </em>3 Bulst. 95; S. <em>C. </em>Cro. Jac. 386; Com. Dig. <em>Action upon the Case for a Deceipt, A </em>1; <em>Pasley </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>3 T. R. 56; <em>Ward </em>v. Center, 3 Johns. R. 271; <em>Upton </em>v. <em>Vail, </em>6 Johns. R. 181; <em>Young </em>v. <em>Covell, </em>8 Johns. R 23, <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>7 Cranch, 92; <em>Gallagher v. Brunel, </em>6 Cowen, 346; <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Tracy, </em>7 Wendell, 229; <em>Addington </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>11 Wendell, 374; S. <em>C, </em>7 Wendell, 1; <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Paige, </em>7 Pick. 542; <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>6 Mass. R. 242; <em>Whittier </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>11 Mass. R. 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">And it is not necessary to prove any <em>moral </em>fraud on the part of the defendants. <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Paige, </em>7 Pick. 542; <em>Bird </em>v. <em>Randall, </em>3 Burr. 1353 ; 3 Bl.
