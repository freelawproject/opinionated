Russell, deceased, in the hands and under the administration of D. Cottle, administrator &amp;c. of Russell, and to summon Cottle, as he was administrator, to answer to the plaintiff, for that Cottle, as administrator aforesaid, being indebted to the plaintiff in the sum of 3690 dollars, according to an account annexed to the writ, in consideration thereof, promised &amp;c., \u2014 and also for that Cottle, in his capacity aforesaid, being indebted to the plaintiff in one other and like sum, for so much money had and received by Cottle as ad ministrator aforesaid, in consideration thereof, promised &amp;c., \u2014 and also for that Cottle, as administrator as aforesaid, being indebted to the plaintiff in one other and like sum, for so much money laid out and expended by the plaintiff for the use of the said Cottle and at his request, in consideration thereof, promised &amp;c., yet, though requested, neither Russell in his life time, nor Cottle in his said capacity, had ever paid either of said sums, &amp;c. The account referred to in the first count was against \u201c the estate of N. Russell.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-7\">In the Court of Common Pleas the parties referred the action, and all demands, to referees ; who awarded, that the plaintiff \u201crecover against the goods and estate of N. Russell &amp;c. in the hands and under the administration of D. Cottle, the administrator on said estate, the sum of\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-8\">The acceptance of this report having been ordered by the Court of Common Pleas, the defendant excepted to the order, as deciding that the referees had authority to arbittate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>in the case, and that the award was good against the estate of the \"ntestate in the hands of the defendant, though the plaintiff\u2019s declaration alleged the debt to be due from the defendant personally, and did not set forth any debt due from, or promise made by the intestate.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b477-13\">\n<em>March 17th.</em>\n</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b477-14\"><em>March </em>26th.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b477-3\"><em>T. </em>Fuller, in support of the exceptions,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AgfH\">said that although the first count was equivocal and might justify a judgment <em>de bonis </em>testatoris, the second and third had relation only to what had taken place subsequently to the death of the intestate, and would require a judgment <em>de bonis propriis; </em>and the counts could not be joined. 5 East, 150 ; 4 T. R. 347 ; 2 Bos. &amp; Pul. 424 ; 2 Wms\u2019s Saund. 117 <em>d, </em>117 <em>e ; </em>1 Chit. PI. 205. The presumption is, that the referees took cognizance of all things that might come before them on all the counts, as the award should follow the submission. 1 Dane\u2019s Abr. 264 ; Bac. Abr. Arbitrament, <em>El. </em>At least the Court cannot see on which of the counts the award is founded, and it ought not to have been accepted.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b477-4\"><em>Fletcher </em>and Rand, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b477-5\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Apy\">We think it very clear that the administrator had a lawful right to enter into the rule of reference; <em>Dickey </em>v. <em>Sleeper, </em>13 Mass. R. 244; <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>5 Mass. R. 139;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that under this rule, whereby all demands between the plaintiff and the administrator of Russell were referred, the particular form of the counts, whether good or not at law, or whether rightly joined, is wholly immaterial. Forseth <em>v. Shaw, </em>10 Mass. R. 253. If it appeared to the referees, that the money advanced by the plaintiff was on account of debts due from the estate of the intestate, we think they did right to allow them, although they might have become due and been paid after his death ; for if due, the administrator would have been obliged to pay them, and would have charged the amount in his administration account. The award of damages <em>de bonis testatoris </em>was correct, because the action was against the defendant as representative of that estate, and so far as appears in the case, the debts proved were all due from the intestate or his estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">\n<em>Judgment of C.
