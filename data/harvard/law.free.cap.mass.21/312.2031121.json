To prove his title, the plaintiff introduced a deed, of the <em>locus in quo, </em>from the defendant as administratrix, made pursuant to a license from the judge of probate to sell the real estate of the intestate for the payment of debts ; which deed, not being acknowledged and recorded, was objected to by the defendant as <em>incompetent </em>evidence, but was admitted as evidence against the defendant, she being the grantor. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>A verdict was found for the plaintiff; but if the deed was improperly admitted, a new trial was to be granted ; otherwise judgment was to be entered according to the verdict.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b333-11\"><em>Oct. 25th, </em>1825.</decisiondate>\n<otherdate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b333-12\"><em>March 26th, </em>1827, <em>in Suffolk.</em></otherdate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b333-4\">Churchill, for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AipI\">took the distinction, that this deed was made era <em>autre </em>droit, (3 Mass.

He referred to <em>St. </em>1783, <em>c. </em>32, \u00a7 2, which relates to a sale of more of the real estate than shall be sufficient to pay the debts, when by a partial sale the residue will be in jured, and which enacts that a deed given in such case, when \u201c duly acknowledged and recorded, &amp;c., shall make a com p\u00edete and legal title in fee to the purchaser.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b333-5\">\n<em>Metcalf, contra,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABkQ\">referred to <em>Prov.
