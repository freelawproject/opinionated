Judgment was rendered against Brazer on the third Monday of June, 1825, and execution was issued on the 30th of that month, returnable on the 29th of August following, and delivered to a deputy sheriff of Worcester.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b131-6\">The defendant pleaded that Brazer died before the execution was in fact returned. The replication denied that fact, and issue was joined on it to the country.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b131-7\">It appeared that Brazer died on the 18th of September, and that the execution was returned into the clerk\u2019s office soon after the 1st of November, and after it was reported in Worcester that Brazer had deceased. The officer\u2019s return bore date of the return day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b131-8\">The plaintiff objected to the admission of paroi evidence to prove the time when the execution was in fact returned. If upon the whole matter the Court should think the plaintiff entitled to recover, the defendant was to be defaulted ; other wise the plaintiff was to become nonsuit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b131-10\"><em>\u25a0A. </em>Denny, for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZsO\">contended, that independently of the objection to the evidence, the facts proved did not constitute a defence. The condition of the bail-bond is forfeited by the principal\u2019s avoidance and a return of <em>non est </em>inventus; and whether the execution shall be actually filed in the clerk\u2019s office or not, is immaterial. <em>St. </em>1784, c. 10 ; <em>St. </em>1803, c. 132 ; <em>Hunt </em>v.

Though it should remain in the hands of the officer, yet that would be no objection to the <em>scire facias </em>against,the bail, if the proper return is made. The object in putting the execution in the clerk\u2019s office is, to preserve it as evidence for the benefit of the parties.
