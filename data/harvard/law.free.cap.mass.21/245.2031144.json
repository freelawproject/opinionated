During all this time, the demandant lived near and occupied land adjoining the land in question, and suffered Joseph F. and James to occupy as above mentioned, without molestation, and also took from the tenants a deed of mortgage, since cancelled, dated August 9, 1806, purporting to convey, among other estate, \u00a3t all the land that said James purchased of Joseph Faunce by virtue of a deed dated February <em>23, </em>1804,\u201d referring to that deed and to a division of lands, for further descriptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-9\">The jury were instructed, that if from the facts proved they were satisfied that the demandant had given a deed of the demanded premises to Joseph Faunce, they should find a verdict for the tenants. A verdict being returned for the tenants, the demandant filed his exceptions to this instruction.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b262-10\"><em>Wood </em>supported the exceptions</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b262-11\">\n<em>W.

Under, the circumstances proved, the presumption that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>a grant had been made to Joseph Faunce was certainly violent. The counsel for the demandant is right, in supposing that mere adverse possession for twenty years, though sufficient for the presumption of a grant of an easement, will not raise a presumption of title by grant to land;* <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but such a presumption may be drawn from other facts, and the possession under such circumstances is strongly corroborative of the presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-3\"><em>Judgment according to </em>verdict.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b263-15\"> <em>Balling v.
