Respondent\u2019s counsel objected that he was not. a competent [witness]; for whatever by his testimony he fixed on his co-executor, for so much he discharged himself, he being; equally bound, in first instance, to receive and take care of the-goods, money, etc. of the deceased; and so he shifted the responsibility from himself by charging the executrix with the-receipt of money and goods not accounted for by either.

[As to the] last will of Arthur Murphy (November 4, 1825): First, the clause by which these appellants claim an interest is no part of the will. It is not signed nor sealed by testator; it is not a codicil, nor a nuncupative will. It is his declaration, after the will was executed, reduced to writing by witnesses, and not signed by testator. 4 Del.Laws 270, Act relative to wills. This is no revocation of the will. It is no part of his will. Act of Assembly not complied with. Second, this memorandum to the will has not been proved. 20 Johns, .502, 507.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b213-6\"><em>Mr. Hamilton </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APh\">This is a transaction at the :same time, and before same witnesses.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b213-7\"><em>George Bead, Jr., </em>for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AP9\">This will has been proved before the Register, and it cannot be incidentally questioned here.
