Defendants admit that testator\u2019s brother Zachariah is living, and his five children, <em>viz </em>Hannah, Sarah, Eliza, Morgan and Zachariah. That Sarah Mason the testator\u2019s sister has five children as set forth in the bill. Defendants insist that the proceeds of the sale of the Mansion Farm belong exclusively to the children of Zachariah Jones, the brother, and Sarah Mason, the sister of the testator, and are not subject to the payment of any of the other legacies directed to be paid by the said will; and that the representative of the said Mary Jones is entitled only to a moiety of the per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>sonal estate, in addition to the legacy of $2000, after the payment of the legacies specially mentioned and [-] in the said will and in [-]<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the proceeds of the sale of real estate directed by the said will to be sold.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b42-8\">Defendants insist that the thirds of the personal estate given in the first clause is not to be deemed as one of the legacies mentioned in the seventh clause, but that the clear intention of the testator as expressed in his said will was that his said widow should be entitled to one-third of his personal estate in case the child should live and survive her; and that should the child die under age and without issue legally begotten, then that his said wife should be entitled to receive the one half or moiety of his personal estate, after payment of the legacies specially mentioned, and that all the legacies directed to be paid in said will, excepting said moiety so bequeathed to the said widow, are chargeable on, and to be paid out of the proceeds of the real estate directed by said will to [be] sold.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b42-9\">Defendants insist that two-thirds of the amount of sale of the Mansion Farm should be paid to the children of Z. Jones without any deduction of expense attending said sale, and the remaining one-third in like manner to the children of Sarah Mason, and that the expenses in supporting the child, and of its illness and burial are to be paid out of the estate generally or of the personal estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b42-10\">Defendants consider and believe it was the intention of the testator that the Negroes and servants should serve their mistress only during her life, and not be held to service after that period.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"b42-11\">\n<em>Decree.</em>\n</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-12\">And now, to wit, the [-]<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> day of April, 1822, this cause coming on to be heard before the Chancellor upon the bill and answer, in the presence of counsel on both sides, and the bill and answer, and last will and testament of the said Morgan Jones mentioned and referred to in the said bill and answer, and what was alleged by counsel on both sides being heard, the Chancellor declares that the first clause in the will by which the testator Morgan Jones bequeathed to his wife Mary Jones the sum of $2000 in addition to the thirds of his personal property is contra-ruled and annulled, as to the implied bequest of the thirds of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>the personal property, by the subsequent clause in the said will by which the said testator declared that, should the child with which his said wife was then pregnant die under age and without issue legally begotten, then and in that case his said wife Mary should be entitled to receive one half or moiety of all his the said testator\u2019s personal estate after the payment of the legacies specially mentioned; it being the intention of the testator, on the event of the death of the said child, under age and without issue, to give to his said wife, the $2000 and only the moiety of the personal estate, after the payment of debts and of the legacies mentioned in the said will. The testator did not design to make the bequest of the moiety of the personal estate to his wife cumulative, but he only intended by the latter clause above mentioned, in case of the death of the child under the age of 21 years and without issue, to increase the bequest to his said wife, to a moiety of the personal estate after payment of debts and legacies. The. bequest to the wife, in the first clause, is not one of the legacies specially mentioned, after the payment of which the moiety of the personal estate is given to the wife; but it is residuary bequest, the amount whereof depends upon debts, and the pecuniary and specific legacies bequeathed in said will. And it is a bequest by implication and not express, the testator seeming to suppose that the wife was entitled by law to a third part of his personal property, as well as to a third of the real estate; and the $2000 seemed to have been given in addition to portions of the personal and real estate, to which she was entitled, independent of the will of the testator. It is true that in the clause by which the testator\u2019s dwelling plantation is devised to the child, he gives to the child all the residue or remaining part of his estate, except what is there specially bequeathed or devised; but he did not thereby mean to except in the devise to the child, the thirds of the personal estate, and the thirds in the real estate, because such thirds were specially bequeathed or devised, for they were not specially bequeathed or devised; but he supposed his wife entitled to them, and therefore did not, in this residuary clause to the child, intend to include them. So that the representative of Mary Jones the widow is entitled to the sum of $2000, and to a moiety only of the personal estate after payment of debts and legacies.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b42-14\"> Blanks in manuscript,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b42-15\"> Blank in manuscript.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b43-5\">And the Chancellor further declares that the legacy bequeathed to Benjamin Jackson, and to James Kennedy of the Iron Hill, to Isaac Hill of the same place, to William McCIement and to Catherine Price, respectively, are severally to be deducted from the personal estate of the said testator Morgan Jones, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>before the same is divided into moieties, and that the said legacies should be retained by the surviving executor, James Patton, to be paid to the said legatees, which said legacies may be paid immediately though there are times limited in said will beyond which their payment cannot be postponed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">And the Chancellor further declares that the proceeds of sale of the real estate directed by the said will to be sold (the plantation on which the testator lived excepted) are to be considered as personal estate, and may pass under the description of personal estate, and be applied to the payment of debts of the testator, and to the pecuniary and residuary legacies bequeathed in the will (except the legacies to be paid out of the proceeds of the sale of the dwelling plantation), such being the intention of the testator.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He has directed the sale to be made by his executors as soon after his decease as may be thought by them advantageous for the benefit of his estate; he has directed that all his lawful and just debts should be paid out of his estate; he has bequeathed several legacies to be paid by his executor, and he has not specially bequeathed the money arising from such sale. Hence it is clearly to be inferred that he intended that this money should be taken as personal property, and be converted into a general personal fund to be applied by his \u00abexecutors, in a due course of administration, according to his will. By directing the real estate to be sold as soon as the executors should judge such sale to be advantageous for the benefit of his estate, he had in view such an application of the money arising from the sale as would most effectually enable the executors to pay the creditors and legatees the debts and legacies charged on his estate, in a manner the most beneficial to them, and so as most speedily to effectuate the general intention of his will.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">And the Chancellor further declares that the expenses which accrued in making the sale of the dwelling plantation of the testator, and the compensation to which the executor is entitled for his service therein are to be retained out of that sale, and are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>not to be charged upon the general personal fund of the said estate; and that the balance of the proceeds of sale of said plantation, after deducting said expenses and compensation, is to be paid to the children of said Zachariah Jones, and to the children of said Sarah Mason, as is directed by the said last will.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">And the Chancellor further declares that all the expenses: which accrued in the maintenance of the child with which the said Mary Jones was pregnant at the time of the testator\u2019s death, in its illness and burial, are not to be paid out of the sale of the dwelling plantation of the testator, but are to be paid out of that part of the general personal fund, which was bequeathed to the said child, that is to say, from the two third parts of the said general personal fund, and that the said James Patton, executor of the last will of the said Mary Jones pay one fourth part of said expenses, and that the other three fourth parts of said expenses be paid out of the moiety bequeathed to Morgan Jones Thomas,. Samuel Mason, son of John, and the children of Zachariah Jones, in proportion to their respective parts or shares of said moiety.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">And the Chancellor further declares that the said James'. Patton, executor of the last will and testament of the said Mary Jones, deceased, is entitled as such executor, to the services of Hannah the black, so as to complete the period of seven years, next after the decease of the said Morgan Jones. And that the said James Patton, executor as aforesaid, is entitled as such executor to the service of Samuel Stephenson until the said Samuel shall arrive to the age of 24 years. And that the said James Patton executor of the last will of the said Mary Jones, at the expiration of said term of seven years, will be liable and bound to pay out of the assets of said Mary Jones, to the said Hannah, $100, and two suits of good substantial wearing apparel; and that he the said James Patton, executor of the last will of said Morgan Jones will be liable and bound to pay to the said Samuel Stephenson, at the expiration of the term of service of him the said Samuel, out of the general personal fund of the estate of the said Morgan Jones, $150.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">It is therefore ordered, adjudged and decreed by the Chancellor, that the said James Patton, executor of the said last, will and testament of the said Morgan Jones, do pay out of the general personal fund of the estate of the said testator, including therein the goods and chattels, rights and credits which were of the said Morgan Jones, and the proceeds of sale of the real estate directed by the said will to be sold (the plantation on which the said testator lived excepted) all debts which were lawfully and. justly due from the said testator at the time of his death;
