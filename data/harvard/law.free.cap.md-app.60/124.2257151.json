It remained only for time and circumstance to transport it to Maryland via the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That Amendment provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-4\">\u201cCongress shall make no law ... abridging the ... right of the people ... to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Having set the scene, we now address the instant case. John J. Miner, a deputy sheriff for Harford County, arrested Joseph A. Novotny and charged him with, \u201cDriving or attempting to drive while intoxicated and/or under the influence of alcohol, drugs and/or controlled dangerous substances,\u201d and \u201cfailing to keep to the right of center.\u201d Md.Transp.Code Ann. \u00a7 21-902 and \u00a7 21-301 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Based on the record before us, we infer that matters exacerbated and Novotny was then charged with battery as a result of expectorating on Miner\u2019s face. Subsequently, Novotny was released on his own recognizance. Two days later he filed a complaint with the sheriff\u2019s office of Harford County alleging that he had been subjected to \u201cpolice brutality.\u201d Apparently, Miner was exonerated of the brutality charges. He then sued Novotny in the Circuit Court for Harford County, asserting defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and abuse of administrative procedures. A demurrer was sustained to each count of the declaration, without leave to amend. Miner has appealed only the count dealing with defamation.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">He asserts that the hearing judge erred in two respects, namely: 1) in holding that a complaint of brutality against a law enforcement officer \u201cis absolutely privileged as a petition for redress of grievances under the First Amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>____and 2) in sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Miner maintains that the investigation conducted by the sheriff\u2019s office into Novotny\u2019s complaint was an internal procedure aimed only at ascertaining the validity <em>vel non </em>of the charge of brutality. That investigation, Miner says, was not directed at providing any form of redress for Novotny\u2019s grievances. Reasoning from that premise, Miner concludes that the First Amendment petitioning right, therefore, has no application to this case. We think Miner exhibits tunnel vision; the petitioning privilege is considerably broader than he perceives it to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">A case factually similar to the one now before us, <em>Stern v. United States Gypsum, Inc., </em>547 F.2d 1329 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 975, 98 S.Ct. 533, 54 L.Ed.2d 467 (1977), was decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. There, Stern, an Internal Revenue Service agent, was in charge of an audit of United States Gypsum (USG). A complaint was filed by USG with Stern\u2019s superiors. USG alleged that certain misdeeds were performed by Stern, including an improper settlement offer. Stern then sued USG for defamation, <em>inter alia, </em>in federal court under pendent jurisdiction. The district court overruled USG\u2019s motion to dismiss on jurisdictional grounds. The appellate court, in reversing, concluded that Stern\u2019s complaint stated no actionable federal claim. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-8\">\u201cThe public criticism of governmental policy and those responsible for government operations is at the very core of the constitutionally protected free speech area, <em>see e.g., Rosenblatt v. Baer, </em>383 U.S. 75, 85, 86 S.Ct. 669 [675], 15 L.Ed.2d 597 (1966); <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 270, 84 S.Ct. 710 [720], 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964).\u201d 547 F.2d at 1342.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">This Court in <em>Bass v. Rohr, </em>57 Md.App. 609, 471 A.2d 752, <em>cert. granted, </em>300 Md. 88, 475 A.2d 1200 (1984), had before it a matter wherein Rohr filed a complaint against Bass <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>with the Maryland Home Improvement Commission. That administrative agency, after a review of \u201call the facts,\u201d was not persuaded to charge Bass with a violation of the law and suggested to Rohr that it thought the case was a \u201ccivil matter.\u201d Bass thought it libelous and slanderous; he sued Rohr for defamation. When he lost in the trial court, Bass appealed. We said that the right to \u201cpetition the Government for a redress of grievances, ... rests not on mere public policy or convenience.\u201d The petition privilege is among our most precious liberties. <em>United Mine Workers of America, District 12 v. Illinois State Bar Association, </em>389 U.S. 217, 222, 88 S.Ct. 353, 356, 19 L.Ed.2d 426 (1967). When the United States declared its independence from Great Britain and successfully concluded the Revolutionary War, the right of redress was embodied into the Bill of Rights where it has since remained in unaltered form.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">We held in <em>Bass v. Rohr </em>that the filing and prosecution of the complaint with the Home Improvement Commission were an exercise of the right of petition to redress grievances. 57 Md.App. at 620, 471 A.2d at 758. Earlier, in <em>Sherrard v. Hull, </em>53 Md.App. 553, 456 A.2d 59 (1983), a defamation action arising out of a zoning hearing, we said that \u201cthe right to petition protects the freedom to seek redress from all three coordinate branches of government.\u201d <em>Bass v. Rohr </em>makes crystal clear that petitioning for a redress of grievances applies to executive agencies. 57 Md.App. at 620, 471 A.2d at 758. Beyond doubt, the sheriffs office of Harford County, engaged as it is in law enforcement, is an agency of the executive branch of government. It is clear from <em>Stern, Sherrard, </em>and <em>Bass, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>that the petitioning privilege includes police brutality complaints filed against law enforcement officers of the Harford County Sheriffs Office.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It matters not that Novotny\u2019s complaint may have been made without substantial justification, <em>Bass v. Rohr, </em>or that it was unfair or malicious, <em>Sherrard v. Hull, </em>or that it was motivated by self interest, or that it was likely to cause professional injury to Miner, or even that Novotny was pleased by the prospect of causing such injury to Miner. <em>Stern v. United States Gypsum.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">In this country the right of the people to complain to responsible governmental officials about the manner in which the complainant believes himself or herself to have been abused by public officials<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and other public employees is a fundamental, constitutional one expressly reserved to the people. The First Amendment, as we have seen, expressly reserves to the people the right \u201cto petition the Government for redress of grievances.\u201d If that right is denied, our government will no longer be representative of the will of the people, which representation is the cornerstone of our republican form of government. <em>See United States v. Cruikshank, </em>2 Otto 542, 92 U.S. 542, 552, 23 L.Ed. 588 (1875).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">The trilogy of <em>Stern, Sherrard, </em>and <em>Bass </em>establishes that it was not error to sustain Novotny\u2019s demurrer to Miner\u2019s declaration. Whether he should have sustained the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>demurrer without leave to amend poses another question to which we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\"><em>Sherrard </em>and <em>Bass </em>point out that the petitioning privilege is not without bounds, and it was never intended as an unassailable license to defame. Judge Alpert, writing for the Court in <em>Sherrard, </em>noted that, \u201cInherent in the words \u2018petitioning for redress of grievances\u2019 is the concept that the words contained in the petition will relate to the redress sought and that the petitioner is genuinely seeking redress.\u201d 53 Md.App. at 574, 456 A.2d at 71. A sham petition, he penned, may never be classified as a petition for a redress of a grievance. What constitutes a sham, however, is decided on a case by case basis. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Miner avers that the hearing judge erred in not affording Miner the opportunity to amend the declaration so as to assert an action based on impermissible use of the petitioning process. In short, Miner wants to amend his suit against Novotny so as to state claims in the declaration which, if true, will establish that the complaint was not a valid use of the petitioning process, but was, in fact, a sham. To allow such an amendment under the circumstances is fraught with grave peril. If a public officer may maintain an action against a complainant simply by alleging that the complaint was a sham, the right to petition for redress of a grievance is in serious trouble. A police officer might bring suit against a complainant merely as a means of retaliation. That possibility was noted in <em>Stern v. United States Gypsum, Inc., </em>547 F.2d at 1345, where the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-6\">\u201cDefendants in suits such as this one would in all likelihood be obliged to face full-blown litigation in which they must persuade a jury that their complaints, if not true, were at least based on enough facts as to avoid an inference of knowing or reckless falsity. This spectre alone could lead a citizen or taxpayer contemplating the lodging of a good faith complaint to reconsider.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>We shall not permit that spectre to appear else the right to petition the government for redress of grievances will be an empty phrase, signifying nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">As previously stated, we said in <em>Sherrard v. Hull </em>that whether a petition for redress of grievances was filed in good faith or was \u201ca sham must be decided on a case-by-case basis.\u201d 53 Md.App. at 574, 456 A.2d at 71. We are of the view that a law enforcement officer may not maintain an action for defamation against a person who, in the exercise of that person\u2019s constitutional right to petition for redress of grievances, initiates a complaint against the officer, unless the petition is facially a sham, that is, one that is unsupported by <em>any </em>facts. In so holding, we are cognizant that the Court of Appeals in <em>Berkey v. Delia, </em>287 Md. 302, 413 A.2d 170 (1980), <em>aff'g </em>41 Md.App. 47, 395 A.2d 1189 (1978), upheld a police officer\u2019s suit against a psychiatrist who wrote to the chief of police professionally questioning whether an officer was \u201cmentally deranged\u201d and requesting that the officer be mentally evaluated. <em>Berkey v. Delia </em>was not, however, decided on First Amendment grounds, nor was Berkey\u2019s letter to the chief of police a petition for redress of grievances within the meaning of that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Miner probably feels that he has been maligned by Novotny, and that the complaint was used by Novotny as a ploy to compel Miner to drop the charges against Novotny. Even if that be true, the constitutional right to petition cannot be made subservient to hurt feelings, bruised egos or tarnished reputations. The First Amendment does not provide that only truthful petitions for redress may be filed. What Judge Eldridge said in his dissent in <em>Berkey v. Delia, </em>287 Md. at 341-42, 413 A.2d 170 (1980), is particularly applicable to the instant case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-7\">\u201cIf one wants to be a public servant in a free society, he must develop a thick skin. If the First Amendment means anything, it means that a citizen has a right to criticize, even unjustifiably, the conduct of those operating the government. If the government itself can decide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>which criticisms it will tolerate and which it will not, by its courts freely allowing government officials to bring defamation actions against citizens expressing grievances, then an essential aspect of our freedom is impaired.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">Miner might feel that he has been wronged without a remedy. We are sympathetic to his plight, but he will have to content himself with the knowledge that the federal constitutional right of petitioning for redress of grievances, a right reserved to all people, is superior to the common law right to bring an action of defamation.
