A jury in the Circuit Court for Charles County (Bowling, J., presiding) convicted Briscoe under counts 1, 3 and 4. According to the docket, it merged count 2 into count 1. Judge Bowling sentenced Briscoe to confinement for five years on the count 1 conviction, to one year concurrent on the count 3 conviction, and to one year on the count 4 conviction, to be served consecutively to the count 3 sentence but concurrently with the count 1 sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">The sole error alleged on appeal is that the trial judge should not have instructed the jury as to the statutory inferences of intoxication established by \u00a7 10-307 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. The State concedes that this instruction should not have been given, but argues that the error was harmless. We conclude that Briscoe\u2019s argument on this point is more persuasive. Therefore, we reverse the manslaughter (count 1) and driving while intoxicated (count 3) convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">Sections 10-302 \u2014 10-306 of the Courts Article provide for the administration of a chemical test of breath or blood to determine its alcoholic content. These sections also establish certain conditions under which these tests must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>performed. There is no question that in this case all the conditions were not met.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">Section 10-307 sets forth inferences as to intoxication or lack thereof, based on the alcoholic content of the blood analyzed by the tests. The results of a test not performed under the \u00a7\u00a7 10-302 \u2014 10-306 rules may be admitted in evidence. <em>State v. Moon, supra. </em>But the statutory inferences of intoxication contained in \u00a7 10-307 are not available under those circumstances. <em>See Fouche v. Masters, </em>47 Md.App. 11, 21, 420 A.2d 1279 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">In the case before us, there was evidence that Briscoe\u2019s blood, tested as a result of standard medical procedures and not pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 10-302 \u2014 10-306, had an alcohol content of .27. A doctor testified that a person with that much alcohol in his blood would be \u201cpretty drunk.\u201d There was other evidence tending to show Briscoe\u2019s intoxication. Had this evidence and other evidence presented gone to the jury under normal instructions, Briscoe would have little to argue on appeal. That, however, did not occur. In the face of a timely objection, the trial judge read to the jury \u00a7 10-307, including subsection (e) which provides</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-6\">If at the time of testing there was in the person\u2019s blood 0.13 percent or more by weight of alcohol, as determined by an analysis of the person\u2019s blood or breath, it shall be prima facie evidence that the defendant was intoxicated. This instruction, which the State concedes should not</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXx\">have been given, plainly told the jury that they could indulge in a prima facie inference that Briscoe was intoxicated. The statutory \u201cprima facie evidence\u201d language is, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>course, addressed to the trial judge. It tells him, in effect, that if certain evidence has been introduced (after compliance with the statutory preconditions) there is a case sufficient to go to the jury \u2014 a case in which the jury may but is not required to find intoxication. In the case before us, we cannot hold that the \u201cprima facie evidence\u201d instruction was not prejudicial so far as the driving while intoxicated charge is concerned. Use of the \u201cprima facie evidence\u201d wording of \u00a7 10-307(e) might have incorrectly persuaded the jury that this was a statutory presumption, thus requiring Briscoe to rebut it. Further, use of the statutory language might well have bolstered the doctor\u2019s credibility in the jury\u2019s eyes and could have provided that degree of certainty needed to produce a verdict beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Despite the substantial evidence of intoxication in addition to that produced by the inadmissible statutory test, we are unable \u201cto declare beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict.\u201d <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">The case is closer on the manslaughter charge. There was evidence of high speed and matters other than intoxication that went to the issue of .the gross negligence required to sustain that charge. Moreover, the judge explained that the jury did not have to find intoxication to convict under count 1. Nevertheless, the State argued strongly that Briscoe\u2019s intoxication was one of the factors that demonstrated the presence of gross negligence. In any event, reviewing the instructions as a whole, we find references to intoxication so intertwined in all of them that, once again, we cannot say that there \u201cis no reasonable possibility\u201d that the erroneous reading of \u00a7 10-307 did not affect the verdict under that count as well. <em>Dorsey v. State, supra. </em>As the Supreme Court said in <em>Sandstrom v. Montana, </em>442 U.S. 510, 526, 99 S.Ct. 2450, 2460, 61 L.Ed.2d 39 (1979):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-7\">[E]ven if a jury <em>could </em>have ignored the presumption ... we cannot be certain that this is what they <em>did </em>do. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>the jury\u2019s verdict was a general one ... we have no way of knowing that [the defendant] was not convicted on the basis of the unconstitutional instructions [emphasis in original, footnote omitted].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Consequently, we must reverse Briscoe\u2019s convictions of manslaughter and driving while intoxicated. The error affecting those judgments does not relate to the driving while revoked conviction which we affirm. Nevertheless, pursuant to Md.Rule 1070, we direct that it be modified to eliminate its concurrent and consecutive aspects. There are no longer other sentences to which it can be either consecutive or concurrent.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">JUDGMENTS UNDER COUNTS 1 AND 3 REVERSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">CASE REMANDED FOR NEW TRIAL.

As in <em>State v. Moon, </em>291 Md. 463, 436 A.2d 420 (1981) Briscoe\u2019s blood test was the product of standard medical procedures. It was not performed pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 10-302 \u2014 10-306 and 10-309. The specimen of blood was not taken within two hours after Briscoe's apprehension (\u00a7 10-303), there was no showing that Briscoe was permitted to have a physician of his own choosing administer the test (\u00a7 10-304(d)), that the equipment used to perform the test was approved (\u00a7 10-304(e)), or that Briscoe had been permitted to select the type of test administered (\u00a7 10-305).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
