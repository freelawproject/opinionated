Md.Ann.Code 1957, art. 27, \u00a7 342 (1982 Repl. Vol.). The Court (McAuliffe, John, J.) sentenced him to three years incarceration with all but three months suspended in consideration of three years probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-15\">Appellant raises three issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b442-16\">I. That'the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction for theft because adequate security was transferred to the mortgage company in exchange for the mortgage loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>II. That the trial judge committed plain error by instructing the jury that \u201cthe value of the loan at the time the loan is made determines\u201d whether appellant committed misdemeanor or felony theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">III. That the trial judge abused his discretion in eliciting testimony injurious to appellant after defense counsel had ended their examination of the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Co-defendant Harmon was in the business of purchasing, rehabilitating and reselling residential properties. Appellant, a real estate broker, was Harmon\u2019s principal agent for the sale of these properties. As much as 90 percent of the properties owned by Harmon were listed with appellant. Harmon paid appellant a commission of 4 to 6 percent of the selling price.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">The bases for the convictions were appellant\u2019s activities regarding two of Harmon\u2019s properties, located at 7623 Barlow Road and 6611 Drylog Road in Prince George\u2019s County. There was evidence of a scheme to procure mortgage loans for purchasers of those properties from Steed Mortgage Company (later purchased by Gold Dome Realty Credit Company) (hereafter referred to as \u201cSteed\u201d) through the use of \u201cstraw buyers\u201d and falsified employment and loan documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">The Court denied appellant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal in which he argued that because the loans were secured by a deed of trust on the real estate, there was no evidence that appellant intended to deprive Steed of its money. Alternatively, he argued that even if there had been a deprivation, its value was less than $300.00, making the offense a misdemeanor and not a felony. Art. 27, \u00a7 342(f). At the conclusion of all the evidence, the Court again denied appellant\u2019s motion for acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">\n<em>Barlow Road</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">In 1981, Sylvia Elum and her husband, Keith, were Harmon\u2019s tenants in the Barlow Road property. Mr. &amp; Mrs. Elum approached appellant inquiring about the purchase of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>a home. Appellant suggested the Barlow Road property. Because Keith had a poor credit history, appellant, in order to assist the Elums in purchasing the Barlow Road property, procured Michael Paige to act as a \u201cstraw purchaser\u201d with Sylvia Elum. In exchange for \u201clending his credit\u201d, appellant gave Paige a $300.00 rent credit on property Paige was renting from appellant. Paige certified falsely that he intended to live in the Barlow Road property.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Paige as principal borrower and Sylvia Elum a co-borrower applied to Steed for a mortgage loan in the amount of $47,450.00. On the application Sylvia Elum stated that she earned $708.33 per month as a bookkeeper for J &amp; J Painting Services. At trial she testified that in fact she earned only $508.00 per month working as a housekeeper at the Georgetown Hotel. Paige\u2019s wage information was accurate. According to the application, their combined monthly income was $2,934.31; actually it was $2,734.80.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Appellant\u2019s son-in-law, Stuart Himes, testified that S &amp; J Painting was his part-time business. One of the State\u2019s exhibits notes a change of addressee from \u201cJay &amp; Jay Painting\u201d to \u201cS &amp; J Painting\u201d. Apparently, on the loan application, \u201cJ &amp; J\u201d was intended to be \u201cS &amp; J\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">S <em>&amp; </em>J frequently cleaned and refurbished homes on appellant\u2019s behalf. At appellant\u2019s request and \u201cas a favor to help someone qualify\u201d Himes signed a blank form falsely verifying Sylvia Elum\u2019s employment with S &amp; J. Himes' had never met her.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">Alison Himes, appellant\u2019s daughter and Stuart Himes\u2019 wife, was an employee in appellant\u2019s real estate office. She testified that on the blank application form, which her husband had signed, she filled in false information concerning Elum\u2019s position with S &amp; J, her salary, length of employment and finally, probability of future employment, which she classified as \u201cgood\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">Because there was also a problem with Michael Paige\u2019s qualifications, appellant induced Paige\u2019s co-worker, Willie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Taylor, to certify falsely that Paige was his nephew and that he was making a $3,000.00 gift to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Steed approved a loan for $47,450.00. A Steed mortgage underwriter testified that she would not have approved the loan to Paige and Elum in that amount with the agreed interest rate, had she known the true stati of the applicants.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">At settlement Steed issued a check in the net amount of $44,411.02 payable to the settlement attorney and to the mortgagors, Paige and Elum. In exchange, Steed took from Paige and Elum a purchase money deed of trust on the property which referred to a contemporaneously executed promissory note. As listing broker, appellant received a commission of $1,998.00 and a bonus of $300.00. The purchase price of the property was $49,450.00, the amount of the appraisal at the time of the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">Sylvia Elum testified that it was not until after they signed the \u201cpapers\u201d that she realized her monthly payments to Steed would be $770.00. Because she was unable to make any of the payments, she moved out of the residence in April of 1982, five months after settlement. As a result of her default, Steed\u2019s successor corporation, Gold Dome Realty Credit foreclosed and a new owner took over the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">\n<em>Drylog Road</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">At appellant\u2019s request, in exchange for a $500.00 fee paid to her by appellant, Pauline Cypress \u201clent her credit\u201d in order to assist co-defendant Harmon\u2019s friend and sometime employee Phillip Dillon, Jr. to qualify for a mortgage to purchase Harmon\u2019s Drylog Road property. At no time did Cypress intend to live on the property. Appellant told her that he himself would own the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">The Cypress and Dillon loan application correctly stated that Cypress was employed full time with the D.C. Office of Personnel and part time as a cashier in a liquor store with a total combined monthly earnings of $2,044.66. Falsely stated on the application was that Dillon was employed as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>foreman with R.J. &amp; Sons Construction, earning $3,033.33 monthly. Cypress and Dillon falsely certified that they had a joint monthly income of $5,077.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Co-defendant Harmon\u2019s sister-in-law and bookkeeper, Sharon Harmon, testified that from July, 1981, to February, 1982, Dillon performed maintenance and yard work for Harmon on a sporadic basis and earned about $50.00 per job. There is nothing in the record indicating that Dillon had any steady income. He did not testify. Sharon Harmon also testified that her husband, Donald Harmon, co-defendant\u2019s brother, owned R.J. &amp; Sons Construction and that Dillon not only never worked for that company as a foreman but the company did not employ a foreman.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Appellant\u2019s daughter, Alison Himes, testified that at meetings she attended with co-defendant Harmon, appellant, Harmon\u2019s secretary Kay Verhalen, and others, it was said that \u201cthey [co-defendant Harmon and appellant Lane] were going to give [Dillon] employment with R.J. &amp; Sons ... [to help him] qualify for a particular house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">Although Dillon\u2019s employment verification was signed by a \u201cSharon Martin\u201d, Sharon Harmon\u2019s maiden name, the latter denied having signed it. The telephone number listed for R.J. &amp; Sons Construction on the loan application was actually that of co-defendant Harmon\u2019s office. Harmon had instructed his secretary, Verhalen, who had in turn instructed Sharon Harmon, to answer the telephone with \u201chello\u201d and to expect a call verifying Dillon\u2019s employment with R.J. &amp; Sons Construction. Messages were to be taken and given to Harmon.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">Steed approved the loan of $72,200.00. At settlement Steed issued a check in the net amount of $68,028.32 payable to the settlement attorney and mortgagors Dillon and Cypress. In exchange, Steed received a purchase money deed of trust from Dillon and Cypress securing the total amount of the loan. The deed of trust referred to a promissory note contemporaneously executed by Dillon and Cypress. Appellant received a commission of $2,800.00. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Steed mortgage underwriter testified that the loan to Dillon and Cypress would not have been approved had she known the true facts underlying the application. There was testimony that the Drylog Road property was in the process of foreclosure, but it was not known whether the process had been completed. An appraiser testified that the property had a value of $77,500.00 at approximately the time of settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Pauline Cypress testified that after she was contacted by Montgomery County State\u2019s Attorney investigators, she falsely told them, at appellant\u2019s direction that: (1) she was planning to move into the Drylog Road property with Dillon and that her son was going to help with the payments; (2) she had not moved into the house because of recent surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">\n<em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Appellant\u2019s conviction must be affirmed if \u201cafter viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); <em>Tichnell v. State, </em>287 Md. 695, 717, 415 A.2d 830 (1980). The legislature revised the theft laws in 1979 in order to create a \u201csingle consolidated offense designated as \u2018theft\u2019... The purpose of this revision [was] to eliminate [the] technical and absurd distinctions that have plagued the larceny related offenses and produced a plethora of special provisions.\u201d <em>Joint Subcommittee on Theft Related Offenses, Revision of Maryland Theft Laws and Bad Check Laws, </em>p. 2 (October, 1978). Under the new law \u201c[c]onduct designated as theft ... constitutes a single crime embracing, among others, the separate crimes, heretofore known as larceny, larceny by trick, larceny after trust, embezzlement, false pretenses, shoplifting and receiving stolen property.\u201d Md.Ann.Code 1957, art. 27, \u00a7 341 (1982 Repl.Vol.).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>While the statute codifies a single offense called \u201ctheft\u201d, it sets forth several different methods for its commission:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_d\">A person commits a theft whenever with the intention to deprive the owner of the property, he: (a) obtains or exerts unauthorized control of the property of another, (b) obtains control over the property of another by deception, (c) obtains the services of another person by deception, (d) possesses lost, mislaid or mistakenly delivered property and he knows or can reasonably ascertain the identity of the true owner; or (e) possesses stolen property knowing or believing that it had been stolen.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Gilbert <em>&amp; </em>Moylan, <em>Maryland Criminal Law: Practice and Procedure, </em>\u00a7 19.5 (1983) (Citations Omitted); Art. 27, \u00a7 342(a)-(e). If the evidence against appellant was sufficient to prove theft under any subsection of \u00a7 342, the court may affirm. <em>See </em>Art. 27, \u00a7 341; Gilbert &amp; Moylan, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 19.1, pp. 204-205, (\u201cthe careful practioners of law will demand particulars from the prosecution in order to ascertain precisely the offense alleged to constitute theft.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">We hold that evidence was sufficient for a rational trier of fact to conclude that appellant was guilty of theft by deception. Art. 27, \u00a7 342(b). That subsection provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A43\">(b) Obtaining control by <em>deception. </em>\u2014 A person commits the offense of theft when he willfully or knowingly uses deception to obtain and does obtain control over the property of the owner, and;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-7\">(1) Has the purpose of depriving the owner of the property; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-8\">(2) Willfully or knowingly uses, conceals or abandons the property in such manner as to deprive the owner of the property; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-9\">(3) Uses, conceals or abandons the property knowing such use, concealment, or abandonment probably will deprive the owner of the property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">Appellant concedes that he procured and then induced both Michael Paige and Pauline Cypress to certify falsely to Steed that they were co-purchasers and future residents of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>the Barlow Road and Drylog Road properties, respectively. Also, it is clear that neither of the actual purchasers would have individually qualified for the respective mortgages. Appellant personally arranged for the false employment verification of Elum and was implicated in the false employment verification of Dillon.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">The jury could have and apparently did conclude that had appellant not engaged in these acts of deception and had Steed been aware of the financial stati of the real purchasers, Steed would not have parted with its money. From this fact, the jury could fairly infer that appellant used deception to obtain control of the property of Steed. Art. 27, \u00a7 340(h) provides that \u201cProperty funder \u00a7 342] means anything of value, including, but not limited to... (2) money (3) commercial instruments____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">That the checks were issued to the purported \u201chome buyers\u201d and not to appellant is irrelevant under the statute. \u201c \u2018Obtain\u2019 means: (1) in relation to property, to bring about a transfer of interest or possession <em>whether to the offender or another </em>...\u201d Art. 27, \u00a7 340(f) (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Before this Court appellant maintained, despite the evidence, that because Steed received a purchase money deed of trust securing the amount of the loans, and because the State failed to show any pecuniary loss to Steed upon foreclosures of the Barlow Road and Drylog Road properties, there was no evidence that he deprived Steed of any property. Without a loss or deprivation, he argues, there is no theft under the statute. Appellant urges the Court to adopt the holding of the Georgia Supreme Court in the case of <em>McGhee v. State, </em>97 Ga. 199, 22 S.E. 589 (1895). The appellant in that case was convicted under Georgia\u2019s 1895 cheating and swindling statute, \u00a7 4587. Although the state had shown that appellant procured a loan by misrepresenting that the security was unencumbered, the court reversed the conviction because there was no proof from the creditor that he had suffered any pecuniary loss upon foreclosure. Not only are the facts distinguishable from the case at bar, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>but its holding is contrary to the majority of other jurisdictions which do not require proof of loss. <em>See, e.g., Nelson v. United States, </em>227 F.2d 21, 23 (D.C.Cir., 1955) (where defendant misrepresented extent of prior encumbrance on collateral used to secure payment for goods transferred and creditor relied on misrepresentation in transferring property, the fact that collateral actually had value in excess of loan held no defense to charge of obtaining property by false pretenses). <em>State v. Hines, </em>36 N.C.App. 33, 243 S.E.2d 782, 787 (1978); <em>Annot. </em>53 A.L.R.2d 1215 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Furthermore, neither the current theft statute nor analogous prior case law requires proof of loss \u201cas an essential element of the crime.\u201d Appellant correctly notes that case law decided under Maryland\u2019s former \u201cfalse pretenses\u201d statute<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> required a showing that the victim relied on the defendant\u2019s misrepresentation \u201cto his detriment\u201d. <em>Polisher v. State, </em>11 Md.App. 555, 556, 276 A.2d 102, <em>cert. denied, </em>262 Md. 749, <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 984, 92 S.Ct. 449, 30 L.Ed.2d 368 (1971). This Court, however, held explicitly that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-6\">[t]he gravamen of the offense is in the making of the false pretense with intent to defraud and thereby obtaining another\u2019s property. <em>So it is not essential that the victim suffer a permanent loss or that he sustain a pecuniary loss.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-7\"><em>Baskerville v. State, </em>23 Md.App. 439, 443, 327 A.2d 918 (1974) <em>cert. denied, </em>274 Md. 725 (1975) <em>(quoting, </em>32 Am. Jur.2d, False Pretenses, \u00a7 38 p. 200 (1982 ed. at p. 262) (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">Consistent with this approach, the theft statute prohibits the act of obtaining unauthorized control over the property of another, when the offender either</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>(1) <em>Has the purpose of depriving </em>the owner of the property; <em>or</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-5\">(2) Willfully or knowingly uses, conceals or abandons the property <em>in such manner as to </em>deprive the owner of the property; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-6\">(3) Uses, conceals or abandons the property knowing such use, concealment or abandonment <em>probably will deprive </em>the owner of the property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Art. 27, \u00a7 342(a)(l)-(3); (b)(1) \u2014 (3); (c)(l)(i)-(iii) (emphasis added). Under the plain language of the statute, actual deprivation to the owner is merely one circumstance from which the jury may infer that the offender committed the prohibited act with the requisite criminal intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">From the evidence in this case, a jury could reasonably infer that appellant obtained control of the property of Steed with the intent to deprive the lender of its money. As a matter of law, Steed was in fact so deprived. Art. 27, \u00a7 340(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-9\">(c) \u201cDeprive\u201d means to withhold property of another: ... (2) for such a period as to appropriate a portion of its value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">Appellant appropriated a portion of the value when the money was used, at least partially, to fund his commissions and bonus.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-11\">Appellant relies heavily on the fact that a purchase money deed of trust was transferred to Steed, securing future repayment of the fraudulently obtained loans. At best such security was merely evidence of an intent to repay the stolen money.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-12\">If a person ... obtains money or goods by [deception], he is none the less [sic] guilty because he intends to repay the money ... That there is ... intent to repay is no defense. Even ... actual repayment is no defense. [Since] [t]he offense is complete when money or property has been obtained by false representations ... it cannot be purged by subsequent restoration or repayment...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number><em>Baskerville v. State, </em>23 Md.App. 439, 443-445, 327 A.2d 918 (1974) <em>(quoting, Clark &amp; Marshall\u2019s Law of Crimes, </em>at 823 (Worgersky Ed., 1958) and 32 Am.Jur.2d, False Pretenses, \u00a7 38 (1982)). Although the appellant in <em>Baskerville </em>was convicted under our old false pretenses statute, it is clear that the legislature, when enacting \u00a7 342, intended to include all those activities which had been criminal under t;he repealed larceny related statutes. <em>See </em>Art. 27, \u00a7 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Even if intent to repay were a defense, appellant could not have reasonably believed the loan would be repaid, in full, with interest, pursuant to the documents executed by the purchasers. Since appellant knew of the purchasers\u2019 respective incomes, a jury could infer that appellant allowed the security to be transferred knowing that the purchasers\u2019 underlying promise to pay was not reasonably likely to be performed. Therefore, the transfer of the deed of trust, being no less an act of deceit than the loan which it secured, only serves to support further the conclusion that appellant intended to deprive Steed of its money.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Finally, Steed bargained for, and had a primary right to receive, repayment pursuant to the loan documents. What it got was the burdensome, costly and necessarily risky alternative of foreclosure.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AiS2\">If by reason of false representations [regarding] the debtor, the creditor has assumed a substantially greater risk than would have been his if the debtor\u2019s [qualifications] had been true,... the crime is satisfied even if the security is not entirely worthless, or even if it may turn out to be adequate... There is an obvious and unreasonable <em>risk </em>of loss which has been forced upon [the creditor], without his knowledge or consent, by reason \u00f3f the [wrongdoer\u2019s] deceit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">Perkins, <em>Criminal Law, </em>312-313 (2d Ed.1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">Conceding, <em>arguendo, </em>that he did commit theft, appellant argues in the alternative that the evidence was insufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>to support a finding of felony theft. Art. 27, \u00a7 342(f) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-4\">(1) A person convicted of theft where the property or services that was the subject of the theft has a value of $300.00 or greater is guilty of a felony...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-5\">(2) A person convicted of theft when the property or services that was the subject of the theft has a value of less than $300.00 is guilty of a misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">The statute defines value as \u201cthe market value of the property ... at the time and place of the crime ... [I]f the market value cannot be satisfactorily ascertained, [value means] the cost of replacement of the property within a reasonable time after the crime.\u201d Art. 27, \u00a7 340(Z)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Appellant argues that the \u201cmarket value\u201d of the fraudulently obtained loans must be measured by the amount of lost profit to Steed. Since there was no evidence of lost profit, their value must be measured by replacement cost, which according to appellant, can only be shown by evidence that Steed suffered a deficiency upon the foreclosure sales of the two properties. Since there was no such alternative evidence, appellant claims that under - section 340(Z )(4), the jury could only have convicted him of misdemeanor theft. That subsection provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-8\">When it cannot be determined if the value of the property is more or less than $300.00 ... its value shall be determined to be an amount less than $300.00.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">Whether a theft is a felony or a misdemeanor depends on the value of the property <em>that was the subject of the theft. </em>\u00a7 342(f)(1) and (2), <em>supra. </em>The subject of this theft was the loan itself. The market value of the loan \u201cat the time and place of the crime\u201d was evidenced by the amount of money obtained by each of the purchasers on the settlement date. That Steed parted with over $120,000.00 as a result of appellant\u2019s actions cannot reasonably be denied. <em>See e.g., Smith v. State, </em>237 Md. 573, 580, 207 A.2d 493 (1965) <em>aff\u2019d sub nom Smith v. Warden, Maryland House of Correction, </em>280 F.Supp. 827 (D.Md.1968) (amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>of loss sustained by defrauded creditor equals entire amount loaned to defendant.)</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Consistent with our approach is <em>La Moyne v. State, </em>53 Tex.Cr.R. 221, 111 S.W. 950 (1908), used by Judge McAullife in rejecting appellant\u2019s value argument in that court. The appellant in <em>La Moyne </em>was charged with swindling in excess of $50.00, a felony. The trial judge had instructed the jury that if it found that appellant had swindled less than $50.00, it would be a misdemeanor. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-6\">The learned trial judge seems to have labored under the impression that, from the fact that the prosecuting witness did not suffer a financial loss of over $50 by the transaction, it would not be a felony. This is not the law. If prosecuting witness by means of false and deceitful pretenses on the part of appellant was induced thereby to part with $250 worth of property, the fact that the same was subsequently secured and most of the value of the property obtained would not be any character or kind of legal defense to the prosecution, and in fact would not be legitimate evidence to be introduced in the trial of the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 950. Because the evidence \u201cconclusively show[ed] a swindling in excess of $50\u201d, the <em>La Moyne </em>court held that it was error to instruct the jury on the misdemeanor offense. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">\n<em>Jury Instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">Appellant next contends that the trial judge committed plain error in instructing the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-10\">... how do we value the so-called loss? Well, from what I have said, I think it is apparent to you it is the value of the loan at the time that the loan is made that determines the question of value without any regard to amounts that may have been repaid ... the crime is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>complete upon the making of the loan, and the value \u2014 the question of how much has been stolen... \u2014 is dependent on how much money was involved in the loan, how much was in fact actually disbursed...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">Appellant did not object to the instruction \u201cbefore the jury retired.\u201d M.R.P. 757(f). Therefore, he relies on former Rule 757(h) which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-5\">An appellate court ... upon the suggestion of a party, may take cognizance of and correct any plain error in the \u00a1jury] instructions, material to the rights of the defendant even though the error was not objected to as provided by... this Rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">The Rule is now new Rule 4-325(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">As previously noted, the value of the \u201csubject of the theft\u201d, Art. 27, \u00a7 342(f) \u201cat the time and place of the crime\u201d, \u00a7 340(/ )(1), is the amount of loan money obtained by the purchasers on the settlement date. <em>Smith v. State, </em>237 Md. at 579-80, 207 A.2d 493; <em>La Moyne v. State, </em>53 Tex.Cr.R. 221, 111 S.W. 950. Accordingly, there was no error at all in the challenged instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">\n<em>Questioning by the Trial Judge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">Appellant\u2019s final allegation of error involves the trial judge\u2019s questioning of State\u2019s witness, Alison Himes, appellant\u2019s daughter. On direct examination, Mrs. Himes testified that she had seen Sylvia Elum\u2019s employment verification form, that she knew her husband had signed it, she knew the verification was false and that she did not know why she did not tell her father that something was wrong. Neither attorney elicited any information from her as to where the form came from, who filled it out or how Mrs. Himes knew the information contained in the form was false.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">In order to obtain that information, at the conclusion of all questioning by both the State and the defense, the trial judge questioned Mrs. Himes as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>THE COURT: I would like you to take a look at State\u2019s Exhibit No. 23, which is a request for verification of employment, having to do with Sylvia Elum. Have you ever seen that before?</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">MR. HELFAND: With all due respect, Your Honor, may I object.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">THE COURT: Yes, you may. Overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">THE WITNESS: Yes, I have.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">MR. HELFAND: I don\u2019t want to interrupt you, but can I have it to your whole line of questioning?</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">THE COURT: Yes. I will give you a continuing objection.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">MR. SOBANSKY: And I also, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">THE COURT: Certainly.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-12\">Just tell us briefly what involvement you had with that verification.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-13\">THE WITNESS: I filled out the individual blocks on him, \u00e1nd my husband signed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-14\">THE COURT: You filled out which blocks?</p>\n<p id=\"b456-15\">THE WITNESS: The base pay, the earnings last 12 months, number of hours worked, probability of employment, length of applicant\u2019s employment, position, job title, and the applicant was employed\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b456-16\">THE COURT: For what reason did you do that?</p>\n<p id=\"b456-17\">THE WITNESS: Because if she needed to have a job, and \u2014 so that she could buy the house that she and Mr. Paige ended up buying.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-18\">THE COURT: Did you do this on your own initiative, or at the request of someone else?</p>\n<p id=\"b456-19\">THE WITNESS: It was at the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-20\">THE COURT: Of whom?</p>\n<p id=\"b456-21\">THE WITNESS: I don\u2019t remember who the requester was. I do know it was asked that because her and her husband were going to be living in the house, that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>needed a job, to qualify to buy it, and I know her husband \u2014 they tried to have her husband on the house, and her husband was not able to buy with her because of his credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">THE COURT: Well, I understand that. But there came a time when it came to your attention as a processor that the loan was not likely to be approved because she didn\u2019t have a job?</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">THE WITNESS: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">THE COURT: And did you discuss that fact with anyone else?</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">THE WITNESS: About her not having a job?</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">THE COURT: About the problem with the loan, unless she did show a job.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">THE WITNESS: Ms. Vernon.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">THE COURT: What I want to know is, whose idea was it to provide information that she had a job, when in fact she did not?</p>\n<p id=\"b457-11\">THE WITNESS: I would have to say it was my father.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-12\">THE COURT: All right.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-13\">Appellant contends that the Court abused its discretion by unfairly eliciting testimony prejudicial to appellant. It is well settled that \u201cthe trial court has the right to examine a witness in order to elicit information which will help the jury determine the issues.\u201d <em>Bailey v. State, </em>6 Md.App. 496, 509-510, 252 A.2d 85, <em>cert. denied, </em>255 Md. 739 (1969); <em>Madison v. State, </em>200 Md. 1, 12, 87 A.2d 593 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-14\">The appellant here, as in <em>Bailey, </em>does not claim that the judge\u2019s questions were objectionable themselves. He objects to the judge\u2019s role in eliciting information injurious to him. It is not improper, however, \u201cfor a trial judge presiding at a jury trial to examine a witness on matters admissible in evidence...\u201d <em>Sim-Kee Corp. v. Hewitt, </em>13 Md.App. 296, 299, 282 A.2d 525 (1971), where, as here, the prior testimony is unclear, evasive or equivocal. <em>Id.; Glad</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number><em>den v. State, </em>20 Md.App. 492, 498, 316 A.2d 319, <em>aff'd, </em>273 Md. 383, 330 A.2d 176 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">It does not appear from the record that Judge McAuliffe \u201cmanifested an opinion adverse to appellant or to the defense upon which he sought to rely.\u201d <em>Rickards v. State, </em>129 Md. 184, 190, 98 A. 525 (1916). It appears that the judge\u2019s questions were designed to elicit and clarify the full facts \u201cin furtherance of the search for truth, which is the ultimate end and reason for being of the trial process.\u201d <em>Gladden, </em>20 Md.App. at 498, 316 A.2d 319; <em>Kelly v. State, </em>16 Md.App. 533, 545, 298 A.2d 470, <em>aff'd, </em>270 Md. 139, 310 A.2d 538 (1973); <em>King v. State, </em>14 Md.App. 385, 394, 287 A.2d 52 (1972).
