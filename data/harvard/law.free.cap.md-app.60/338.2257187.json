McAuliffe, Jr., J., presiding) of assaulting Officer Barry L. Abramowitz of the Gaithersburg City Police Department and Officer David Godbold of the Montgomery County Police Department, of resisting arrest and of violating Maryland Code (1957, 1981 Repl.Vol.), Art. 2B, \u00a7 207(a)(2), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-6\">(a) A person may not: ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\">(2) Be intoxicated or drink any alcoholic beverage in a public place and cause a public disturbance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">For each assault and for resisting arrest the appellant was sentenced to five years. The imprisonment was suspended and he was placed upon a five year supervised probation. He was fined $100.00 for the violation of \u00a7 207(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">There was evidence from which the jury could have found that the following took place shortly after midnight on July 10, 1982. At that time Officer Maryann Troutner of the Gaithersburg City Police Department, who was alone in her patrol vehicle, had apprehended a drunk driving suspect on the parking lot of the Orchard Pond Apartments, a short distance from the public highway. As Officer Troutner was engaged in placing the arrested suspect in her police cruiser she was approached by the appellant who loudly asked her, \u201cWhat the fuck you think you\u2019re doing.\u201d The appellant had an open bottle of Heineken beer in his hand and Officer Troutner asked him what he was drinking. The appellant replied \u201cbeer.\u201d The appellant\u2019s demeanor was abrasive, his eyes were \u201cwatering,\u201d he was unsteady on his feet and Officer Troutner concluded that he had been drinking. Because she believed he was violating Maryland Code (1957, 1981 Repl.Vol.), Art. 2B \u00a7 211, which prohibits the drinking of alcoholic beverages on public property, she asked him for identification. The appellant advised her that his identification papers were in his van which was parked nearby and he proceeded to get them. On the way he finished drinking the beer. Officer Troutner waited with the arrested drunk<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>en driver for five to ten minutes while the appellant was in his motor vehicle. During that time, she became apprehensive that she was going to have trouble and called on her radio for backup assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">When the appellant returned with his identification papers, Officer Troutner asked him to stand behind the cruiser to which he replied, \u201cI\u2019ll stand anywhere I fuckin\u2019 please.\u201d The appellant then continued to protest the Officer\u2019s actions in the presence of a group of about ten bystanders that had congregated. Officer Troutner decided at this point to issue the appellant a citation for public drinking. Md.Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol., 1984 Supp.) Art. 27, \u00a7 594B(j); Md. District Rule 711.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While she wrote the ticket, the appellant continued to protest her actions loudly, prompting a woman in one of the nearby apartments to yell from a window to keep down the noise in the parking lot. By the time Officer Troutner had completed writing the citation, Officers Godbold and Abramowitz, as well as three other police officers, had arrived on the scene in response to the backup call issued earlier by Officer Troutner. When Officer Godbold attempted to quiet the appellant, the appellant suggested that Officer Godbold take off his badge and they could settle the dispute then and there.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Officer Troutner then explained to the appellant that he was being issued a citation for public drinking; that he could go on his way and that a court date would be set if he signed it, but that if he refused he would be arrested. The appellant read the citation, then slammed the pen down on Officer Troutner\u2019s cruiser stating loudly, \u201cI\u2019m not signing any fuckin\u2019 ticket.\u201d Officer Abramowitz then took hold of the appellant\u2019s arm and told him he was under arrest. A struggle then ensued between the officers and the appellant and after several minutes the appellant was subdued and placed in the cruiser of Officer Abramowitz. A few min<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>utes later the appellant tried to break away from custody and stumbled out of the cruiser.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">He was placed back into the police vehicle and transported to the Germantown Police Station in the back seat of the vehicle under physical restraint by Officer William Mortall. In the course of this melee, Officer Abramowitz was struck and kicked and Officer Godbold was bitten by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">When the appellant arrived at the Germantown Police Station, he was placed in the holding cell. He began screaming, yelling and throwing chairs around the cell, so that it became necessary to handcuff him to the cell bench. Thereafter the appellant began screaming again and jumping up and down on the bench in his cell, requiring the officers to cuff his legs as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">The appellant prayed a jury trial in the District Court and the case was transmitted to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">In this appeal the appellant asserts that there was no legally sufficient evidence to support his convictions, that the trial judge gave the jury an improper advisory instruction as to the meaning of \u00a7 207, and that evidence of the appellant\u2019s conduct at the police station following his arrest was improperly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">\n<em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">The challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence of the assaults upon the two police officers and resisting arrest is based upon the appellant\u2019s contention that his arrest on the parking lot of the Orchard Pond Apartments on July 10, 1982, was illegal. He points out that since Officer Troutner was acting under the misapprehension that the parking lot was \u201cpublic property\u201d within the prohibition of \u00a7 211, when she attempted to issue a citation to him charging him with a violation of that section, his subsequent arrest was illegal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We believe his contention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>meritless for either of two reasons. The issue of the appellant\u2019s legal arrest depends not upon whether Officer Troutner correctly assumed that the parking lot in question was public property within the definition of that term as used by the Legislature in enacting \u00a7 211, but whether there was evidence from which the jury could conclude that Officer Troutner possessed probable cause to believe that \u00a7211 had been violated. The rule of probable cause has often been characterized as a \u201cnon-technical conception of a reasonable ground for belief of guilt requiring less evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>for such belief than would justify conviction, but more evidence than that which would arouse mere suspicion.\u201d <em>Collins v. State, </em>17 Md.App. 376, 384, 302 A.2d 693 (1973). Given the proximity of the site of arrest to the public highway and the further fact that by virtue of Art. 2B, \u00a7 210, private parking lots of certain kinds of commercial ventures are included within the definition of public property on which drinking is prohibited by \u00a7 211, we believe that the evidence was sufficient to permit the jury to conclude that Officer Troutner, under the facts and circumstances present in the early morning hours of July 10, 1982, was justified in believing that a violation of \u00a7 211 was taking place.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Moreover, the jury could also have concluded, based upon the evidence, that Officer Troutner possessed ample probable cause to believe that the appellant had violated Art. 2B, \u00a7 207(a)(2). The fact that Officer Troutner cited the wrong section of Art. 2B of the Code in placing the appellant under arrest is of no consequence. <em>Braxton v. State, </em>234 Md. 1, 197 A.2d 841 (1964). He appeared intoxicated and she witnessed his consumption of an alcoholic beverage. We believe the parking lot of this apartment complex was a <em>public place </em>within the meaning of \u00a7 207, and that the appellant was creating a <em>public disturbance </em>thereon. The words just emphasized from \u00a7 207(a)(2) have not previously been interpreted by the Court of Appeals or this Court. We therefore construe them according to their ordinary and normal meaning unless a different legislative intent is indicated by the context. <em>Blake v. State, </em>210 Md. 459, 124 A.2d 273 (1956). Clearly, the use in \u00a7 211 by the legislative draftsmen of the term \u201cpublic property\u201d with its attendant definition in \u00a7 210 of the same subheading shows a legislative intent to prohibit mere consumption of alcohol more limitedly than disorderly drinking or intoxication. <em>Public property </em>as defined in \u00a7 210, as applicable in \u00a7 211 is a much more limited term than <em>public place </em>used in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>\u00a7 207(a)(2), and clearly indicates the intent of the Legislature to make a distinction between the two types of situs.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">In Webster\u2019s Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary (1969), \u201cpublic\u201d is defined as \u201ca place accessible or visible to the public.\u201d In Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary, 2d ed. (1976) \u201cin-public\u201d is defined as \u201copenly; not in private or in secrecy.\u201d \u201cDisturb\u201d is defined as \u201cto break up the quiet or serenity of; agitate ... to break in on; interrupt; interfere____\u201d \u201cDisturbance\u201d is defined as \u201c... commotion; disorder.\u201d Webster has also defined \u201cdisturb\u201d as \u201cto interfere with the lawful enjoyment of a right.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, (Rev. 5th ed.) defines disturbance as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANT\">Any act causing annoyance, disquiet, agitation, or derangement to another, or interrupting his peace, or interfering with him in the pursuit of a lawful and appropriate occupation or contrary to the usages of a sort of meeting and class of persons assembled that interferes with its due process or irritates the assembly in whole or in part.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Diehl v. State, </em>294 Md. 466, 451 A.2d 115 (1982). to justify his outrageous conduct is misplaced. <em>Diehl </em>does not stand for the proposition that one is privileged to disturb the public peace in the middle of the night and interfere with police officers in the lawful performance of their duties. We conclude that the parking lot was a <em>public place </em>and that the appellant\u2019s conduct thereon amounted to a <em>public disturbance </em>justifying his arrest for violation of \u00a7 207(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">Since there was evidence from which the jury could have concluded that the appellant\u2019s arrest was valid, it follows that sufficient evidence was presented to support the jury\u2019s determination that he was guilty of assaults upon Officers Abramowitz and Godbold and of resisting a valid arrest. <em>Jones v. State, </em>4 Md.App. 616, 244 A.2d 459 (1968); <em>Preston v. Warden, </em>225 Md. 628, 169 A.2d 407, <em>cert. denied </em>366 U.S. 974, 81 S.Ct. 1940, 6 L.Ed.2d 1262 (1961). For the reasons expressed above we also conclude that there was sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>evidence of appellant\u2019s violation of Art. 2B \u00a7 207(a)(2) of Md.Code, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">\n<em>The Supplementary Jury Instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AcqT\">In the course of their deliberations the members of the jury sought advice from the trial judge with regard to the charge that appellant had violated Art. 2B, \u00a7 207(a)(2). The notes requesting such assistance stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-5\">We need further instruction on the fourth count.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-6\">The matter we wish to discuss relates to count four. Our question centers on the conjunction \u201cand\u201d. What we would like to know in the Court\u2019s opinion, does the first part of the count have to be the cause of the second part.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">The trial court, after discussing the jury\u2019s question with counsel concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-8\">Here, the particular section says, \u201cA person may not be intoxicated or drink any alcoholic beverage in a public place and cause a public disturbance.\u201d There are two elements. The first element is in the alternative. It can be one or the other. But there must be the second element that coexists with one or the other of the first elements, and that is all, and that is what the legislation says.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-9\">If the Legislature intended otherwise, it would be charged with the responsibility for saying so and it would be very simple to say so, and they have said so frequently in other contexts. For instance, be intoxicated or drink any alcoholic beverage in a public place which thereby poses a public disturbance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-10\">Any words would show the causal relationship and a necessary causal nexus between the first and the second. It did not so state, and the only way, in my view, that it can be interpreted is that they are distinct elements which must coexist but which have no cause and effect between themselves, necessarily linking them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-11\">If it was intended otherwise it would have so provided, and it could have so provided. This is the way they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>provided, when they did not intend that there he that causal distinction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">We agree with this construction of the statute by the trial court since the statute\u2019s words are given their ordinary and natural import \u2014 not forced so as to limit their applicatibn. <em>Blake v. State, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The trial court in accordance with defense counsel\u2019s request agreed to emphasize to the jury that in this area of determining the proper interpretation of a statute where there is a substantive dispute that its supplementary instruction in answer to the jury\u2019s question would be advisory only and that the jury, not the judge, was the judge of the proper interpretation to be afforded the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The trial court proceeded to answer the jury\u2019s question dwelling at some length on Maryland\u2019s unique view that with respect to disputes over the substantive law of the crime in the trial of a criminal case that the jury, not the judge, is charged with resolving the dispute. Judge McAuliffe then continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-7\">In short, the instruction which I now will give you is advisory. The fourth count, the one about which you are concerned, is Article 2B, Section 207 of the Annotated Code of Maryland____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-8\">... (2) reads, <em>\u201cA </em>person may not be intoxicated or drink any alcoholic beverage in a public place and cause a. public disturbance.\u201d The Court\u2019s advisory opinion to you is that the first part of that is in the alternative, being intoxicated or drink any alcoholic beverage in a public place, and that alternative is easy enough for us to understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-9\">Then there is an \u201cand,\u201d the coordinate conjunction \u201cand,\u201d and after that, \u201ccause a public disturbance.\u201d The advisory instruction to you is that as that appears there are two elements, the first of which is in the alternative and can be satisfied by having either of those two, the second of which is, \u201cand cause a public disturbance,\u201d the two elements, the first being met by a finding that either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>of those exist, and the second element, when they coexist together, which is what the coordinate conjunction \u201cand\u201d means. There is the two elements and the violation of the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-5\">If the Legislature intended to put a causal connection therein, it would be easy enough to do so. For instance, be intoxicated or drink any alcoholic beverage in a public place which thereby causes a public disturbance. So that, if that was what was intended, those who are charged with the responsibility of telling us precisely and particularly, very precisely in the criminal law what is intended, would have it available to them in our English language, the ready means to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-6\">What they have told us is that there are two coexisting elements, the two elements which must coexist. When they do, they have said that is a violation of the statute. They have not connected them up in a cause and effect relationship. They could very easily have done so if they had intended to do so, and there <em>are </em>\u2014 I <em>have served in both the House of Delegates and the State Senate. </em>There are professional draftsmen there whose responsibility alone is to make certain that statutes of this type spell out precisely and exactly and with coordinate conjunctions or the precise use of the English language exactly what is intended, and they are for the most part law students and lawyers who are trained in the precise wording of the language and in draftsmanship.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-7\">The final word on this subject is not mine, and I have made that clear to you. Our law says and intends, and we would have changed it if it wasn\u2019t intended that way. Our law intends that when you sit there, that in this area you have final say. You are entitled to an advisory instruction, and you have requested one and I have given it to you. But the final say rests in this State with you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">The appellant also complains that by mentioning his service as a member of the legislature, above emphasized, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>the trial judge undermined the advisory nature of his charge. We disagree. Reading the charge as a whole, the jury was properly instructed as to its role as judge of the law in response to its question. <em>Montgomery v. State, </em>292 Md. 84, 437 A.2d 654 (1981); <em>Stevenson v. State, </em>289 Md. 167, 423 A.2d 558 (1980); <em>Guardino v. State, </em>50 Md.App. 695, 440 A.2d 1101 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">\n<em>Admission of Evidence of Appellant\u2019s Conduct at Police Station</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Over the appellant\u2019s objection, Officer Ronald J. Gad-dis of the Montgomery County Police Department was permitted to testify to the appellant\u2019s assaultive and abusive conduct at the Germantown Police Station where he was taken from the scene of the arrest. We think the evidence was admissible on either of two grounds. The appellant\u2019s conduct at Germantown Police Station was part of a continuing event and was relevant to all four charges on which he was being prosecuted. The fact that in continuing his outrageous conduct, which began at the scene of his arrest, into the police station where he was taken following his arrest, the appellant was guilty of other crimes, is admissible as an exception to the general \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence rule. <em>Tichnell v. State, </em>287 Md. 695, 415 A.2d 830 (1980). Secondly, the appellant\u2019s conduct at the Germantown Police Station corroborated the testimony of Officers Troutner, Abramowitz, Shortall and Godbold as to his earlier conduct and credibility of those officers\u2019 testimony was very much in issue before the jury. Finally, Officer Abramowitz later at the trial testified to the same conduct of the appellant without objection and, therefore, the admission of Officer Gaddis\u2019 testimony was not prejudicial to the appellant\u2019s defense. <em>Peisner v. State, </em>236 Md. 137, 202 A.2d 585 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b370-7\">.
