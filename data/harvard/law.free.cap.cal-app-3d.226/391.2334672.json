At issue is whether the transfer of the real property was a change of ownership that would invoke a reassessment of the real property under Proposition 13<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the statutory and regulatory provisions that implement it.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">In 1947, Kern, Paul Juel, and Adolph Magagna formed a partnership to feed lambs in the Imperial Valley. In 1963, the partnership was incorporated as Sweetwater Feeders, Inc., (Sweetwater). Magagna died in 1965; Juel died in 1970. On August 22, 1977, Kern and the other shareholders of Sweetwater, all of whom were related to one of the original partners, entered into an \u201cAgreement to Dissolve and Liquidate a Corporation,\u201d which provided that upon the death or retirement of Kern, the assets of the corporation would be distributed according to the terms of the agreement. The agreement set forth specific parcels of Sweetwater\u2019s real property that were to be distributed to three groups of shareholders: the Kern Group; the Juel Group; and the Magagna Group.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">In 1982, Stewart Kern retired. On August 3, 1982, Attorney Mercedes Wheeler, wrote to the Imperial County Assessor and inquired whether transferring title of Sweetwater\u2019s real property to the shareholders would result in a reassessment of the transferred property. On August 10, 1982, the county\u2019s chief appraiser responded that such a transfer would result in a reappraisal because the transfer would be a change of ownership of the property under title 18, California Code of Regulations, section 462, subdivision (j)(2)(B)(iv). On October 1, 1982, the real property of Sweetwater was distributed pursuant to the terms of the 1977 agreement. The transfer consisted of the deeding of fifteen different parcels to the shareholders, with the Kern Group receiving title to five parcels, the Juel Group receiving title to six parcels and the Magagna Group receiving title to four parcels. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>shareholders paid the property taxes on the parcels for the years 1983-1984 and 1984-1985 per the reassessed value of the parcels and later filed claims for tax refunds. The Imperial County Board of Supervisors, sitting as a board of equalization, denied the claims in January 1986. The shareholders filed this complaint in March 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">The parties\u2019 stipulation of facts for trial included the following statements: (1) \u201cAs a result of the distribution of the assets of Sweetwater, the shareholders\u2019 proportional interest in the real estate remained the same after the transfer\u201d; and (2) \u201cEach shareholder took an exact pro rata share of the assets available for distribution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">In ruling in favor of the county, the trial court found (1) the date of transfer of Sweetwater\u2019s real property was 1982 and (2) under the controlling statute, Revenue and Taxation Code<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> section 62, the transfer constituted a change of ownership that triggered a reassessment under Proposition 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">The main issue presented by this case is whether the transfer of the Sweetwater real property to the shareholders pursuant to the liquidation agreement was a change of ownership in the context of Proposition 13. As indicated in footnote 2, <em>ante, </em>Proposition 13 provided that \u201ca change in ownership\u201d is one of three events that triggers a reassessment. (Cal. Const., art. XIII A, \u00a7 2.) Proposition 13, however, did not define \u201cchange of ownership.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">Pertinent to this case are sections 60 and 62. Section 60 sets out a basic definition of \u201cchange of ownership.\u201d It provides: \u201cA \u2018change in ownership\u2019 means a transfer of a present interest in real property, including the beneficial use thereof, the value of which is substantially equal to the value of the fee interest.\u201d Section 62 provides for specific exclusions from the definition of \u201cchange of ownership.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>Kern and the other shareholders (hereafter Kern) contend the trial court misconstrued section 62, as it existed in 1982. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">In 1982, section 62 provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-6\">\u201cChange in ownership shall not include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-7\">\u201c(a) Any transfer between coowners which results in a change in the method of holding title to the real property without changing the proportional interests of the coowners, such as a partition of a tenancy in common, or any transfer of title between an individual and a legal entity or between legal entities, such as a cotenancy to a partnership, a partnership to a corporation, a trust to a cotenancy, or an individual to a legal entity, which results solely in a change in the method of holding title and in which the proportional interests of the transferors and transferees, whether represented by stock, partnership interest, or otherwise, remain the same after transfer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">Essentially, section 62, subdivision (a), in effect in 1982, exempted from the definition of \u201cchange of ownership\u201d a real property transaction \u201cwhich results solely in a change in the method of holding title and in which the proportional interests of the transferors and transferees . . . remain the same after transfer.\u201d Here, we are dealing with a situation in which prior to the execution of the agreement 16 persons (and the estate of another) had corporate equity interests in each of 15 parcels of land. After the transfer, groups of six, four, and eight persons owned fee interests in various different parcels. No two groups received an interest in the same taxable parcel. They agreed among themselves\u2014and, indeed, no one disputes this\u2014that this division of land was proportional to their corporate interests. However, it is clear that with respect to the title of the real property, the proportional interest of each shareholder in each of the 15 parcels of land changed with the October 1982 transfer. Thus, the October 1982 transfer was not covered by then-section 62 and was not exempted from the definition of \u201cchange of ownership.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">Our interpretation is bolstered by the then-existing administrative regulation. Government Code section 15606 provides the State Board of Equalization with the duty of prescribing rules and regulations to govern assessment practices throughout the state. The Board of Equalization has adopted rules and regulations collected in title 18, California Code of Regulations, section 1 et seq. At the time of the October 1982 transfer, the issue of change of ownership was addressed in title 18, California Code of Regulations, section 462, which provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>\u201c(a) General.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-5\">\u201c(1) There shall be a reappraisal of real property as of the date of a change in ownership of that property. The reappraisal will establish a new base year full value and will be enrolled on the lien date following the change in ownership.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-6\">\u201c(2) A \u2018change in ownership\u2019 in real property occurs when there is a transfer of a present interest in the property, and a transfer of the right to beneficial use thereof, the value of which is substantially equal to the value of the fee interest. Every transfer of property qualified as a \u2018change in ownership\u2019 shall be so regarded whether the transfer is voluntary, involuntary, by operation of law, by grant, gift, devise, inheritance, trust, contract of sale, addition or deletion of an owner, property settlement (except as provided in (1) (3) for interposal transfers), or any other means. A change in the name of an owner of property not in the right to beneficial use is excluded from the term \u2018transfer\u2019 as used in this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-7\">\u201c(j) Legal Entities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-8\">\u201c(1) Transfers of property to and by legal entities. Except as is otherwise provided in subdivision (2), the transfer of any interest in real property to a corporation, partnership, or other legal entity is a change in ownership of such real property transferred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-9\">\u201c(2) Exclusions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-10\">\u201c(B) Transfers of real property between separate and legal entities or by an individual(s) to a legal entity (or vice versa), which result solely in a change in the method of holding title and in which the proportional ownership interests in the property remain the same after the transfer. (The holders of the ownership interests in the transferee legal entity, whether such interests are represented by stock, partnership shares, or other types of ownership interest, shall be defined as \u2018original co-owners\u2019 for purposes of determining whether a change in ownership has occurred upon the subsequent transfer(s) of the ownership interests in the legal entity.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-11\">\u201cExamples:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>\u201c(iv) Corporation X owns Blackacre and Whiteacre (both are of equal value). A &amp; B each own 50 % of Corporation X\u2019s shares. X transfers Whiteacre to A and Blackacre to B. Change in ownership of 100% of both Blackacre and Whiteacre.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The transfer of Sweetwater\u2019s real property to its shareholders falls squarely within the provisions of the regulation. Moreover, the example provided by California Code of Regulations, title 18, section 462, subdivision (j)(2)(B)(iv), is directly on point.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Interpretations put forth by administrative agencies charged with enforcement, implementation and interpretation of enactments are entitled to great weight. <em>(Amador Valley Joint Union High Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 208, 245 [149 Cal.Rptr. 239, 583 P.2d 1281]; <em>State of South Dakota </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1978) 20 Cal.3d 765, <em>777 </em>[256 P.2d 305] [144 Cal.Rptr. 758, 576 P.2d 473].) \u201c \u2018[C]ourts generally will not depart from such construction unless it is clearly erroneous or unauthorized.\u2019 \u201d <em>(City of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Rancho Homes, Inc. </em>(1953) 40 Cal.2d 764, 770-771.) In <em>South Dakota, supra, 20 </em>Cal.3d at page <em>777, </em>our Supreme Court characterized administrative construction of an enactment as a \u201cfactor of considerable force.\u201d Thus, our interpretation of section 62, in effect in 1982, is significantly supported by the administrative regulation on the books at the relevant time of the transfer here.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">To support the assignment of error, Kern asks this court to consider the statute as it was amended by the Legislature in 1982. (Stats. 1982, ch. 1465, \u00a7 4.5, p. 5633.) Effective January 1, 1983, section 62 read, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-9\">\u201cChange in ownership shall not include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-10\">\u201c(a)(1) Any transfer between coowners which results in a change in the method of holding title to the real property transferred without changing the proportional interests of the coowners in that real property, such as a partition of a tenancy in common.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-11\">\u201c(2) Any transfer between an individual or individuals and a legal entity or between legal entities, such as a cotenancy to a partnership, a partnership</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6q\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>to a corporation, or a trust to a cotenancy, which results solely in a change in the method of holding title to the real property and in which proportional ownership interests of the transferors and transferees, whether represented by stock, partnership interest, or otherwise, in each and every piece of real property transferred, remain the same after the transfer . . . The linchpin of Kern\u2019s argument is twofold: (1) The transfer here was not covered by the exclusionary language of the 1982 amendment of section 62;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and (2) the 1982 amendment was a change in the law that should not be given retrospective eifect. Thus, Kern argues, section 62, subdivision (a), in eifect on October 1, 1982, excluded the transfer from being a change in ownership. In other words, Kern is arguing the Legislature changed the law effective January 1, 1983, so that the type of transfer involved here does not fall within the exemption provisions of section 62, and, therefore, this type of transfer must have fallen within the exemption provisions of the statute before it was amended.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">To support the premise that the 1982 legislation was a change in the law, Kern (1) points to the change in language of the statute, (2) the absence of any language in the legislation that the amendment was intended to be declaratory of existing law, and (3) the absence of a provision on retroactivity.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Kern argues the insertion of the phrase \u201cin that real property\u201d in subdivision (a)(1) limited partition to a property that had not yet been subdivided, and the use of the phrase \u201cin each and every piece of real property transferred\u201d in subdivision (a)(2) added the requirement that the transferees take an undivided interest in each property.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">We disagree for we conclude the changes in the language, and, more particularly, the addition of new language, in the 1982 legislation was a clarification of the existing law, particularly the notion of \u201cproportional interests\u201d used in the earlier version. Also, the changes in the language were in keeping with the administrative regulation promulgated by the State Board of Equalization, as discussed above.  In <em>Mudd </em>v. <em>McColgan </em>(1947) 30 Cal.2d 463, 471 [183 P.2d 10], our Supreme Court noted the rule that \u201cadministrative interpretation of a prior provision in a revenue law and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>subsequent legislative definition in accord therewith [is] acceptable evidence of legislative intent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">We also reject Kern\u2019s interpretation of the 1982 legislation based on established principles of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">The cardinal rule of statutory construction is the court should ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law. <em>(Cossack </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 726, 732 [114 Cal.Rptr. 460, 523 P.2d 260].) The canon of statutory construction that statutes are not to be given retrospective operation unless it is clearly made to appear that such was the legislative intent is subordinate to the rule that a statute must be interpreted so as to effectuate legislative intent. <em>(Mannheim </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1971) 3 Cal.3d 678, 686 [91 Cal.Rptr. 585, 478 P.2d 17].)  We are, of course, mindful of the principle that a substantial change in the language of a statute by an amendment generally indicates an intention to change its meaning. <em>(Mosk </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 474, 493 [159 Cal.Rptr. 494, 601 P.2d 1030].) However, the presumption that legislative action was intended to change the law has no bearing upon legislative actions that are readily explained by other purposes. <em>(Becker </em>v. <em>Lindsay </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 188, 192 [127 Cal.Rptr. 348, 545 P.2d 260].) Furthermore, while an intention to change the law is usually inferred from a material change in the language of the statute, a consideration of the surrounding circumstances may indicate merely a legislative intent to clarify the law. <em>(Nationwide Investment Corp. </em>v. <em>California Funeral Service, Inc. </em>(1974) 40 Cal.App.3d 494, 501 [114 Cal.Rptr. 77].)</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">Here, we look at the legislative history of Assembly Bill No. 3382, 1981-1982 Regular Session, the measure by which section 62 was amended in 1982.  The legislative history of a statute and the wider historical circumstances of its enactment are legitimate and valuable aids in divining statutory purpose. <em>(California Mfrs. Assn. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Com. </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 836, 844 [157 Cal.Rptr. 676, 598 P.2d 836].) The State Board of Equalization sponsored Assembly Bill No. 3382 and in its legislative bill analysis,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the board referred to it as a \u201c \u2018housekeeping bill\u2019 \u201d aimed toward \u201ccorrecting] a number of technical and minor substantive inconsistencies, errors, and problems in the law relative to property taxation.\u201d When the amendments to section 62 were added to the bill, the board\u2019s analysis was supplemented to note, in pertinent part, the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number><em>\u201cSections 4 and 5 </em>of the bill would amend Sections 62 and 64 of the Revenue and Taxation Code to clarify provisions relating to changes in ownership of real property by legal entities which, under current law, are ambiguous when applied to a specific factual situation, and would also make various technical changes to these sections:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-5\">\u201ca. Section 62 (a) would be amended to clarify that transfers between co-owners in cases of partitions and changing methods of holding title as co-tenants are distinct from transfers to, from, and between legal entities. The proposal would also make technical changes to Section 62 (a)(2) for the purpose of clarifying that the \u2018proportional interests\u2019 must remain the <em>same </em>in each and every piece of real property transferred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-6\">\u201cExample: Corporation A owns Blackacre and Whiteacre, each of equal value. X and Y are each 50% of shareholders. Upon dissolution of Corporation A, X and Y receive a 1/2 undivided interest in both Blackacre and Whiteacre. This transfer is excluded under proposed Section 62 (a)(2), whereas a transfer of Blackacre to X and Whiteacre to Y upon dissolution qf Corporation A would not be, since the proportional ownership interests in each property is not the same before and after the transfer.\u201d (Italics in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Thus, it is clear the intent of the sponsor of the bill was to <em>clarify </em>existing law and remove any ambiguity to specific fact situations, one of which was the type of transfer which is the subject of this lawsuit.  The statements of the sponsor of legislation are entitled to be considered in determining the import of the legislation. <em>(De Malherbe </em>v. <em>International Union of Elevators Constructors </em>(1977 N.D.Cal.) 438 F.Supp. 1121, 1139, fn. 22, relying on <em>Schwegmann Bros. </em>v. <em>Calvert Corp. </em>(1951) 341 U.S. 384, 394-395 [95 L.Ed. 1035, 1047-1048, 71 S.Ct. 745, 19 A.L.R.2d 1119]; and <em>Woodwork Manufacturers </em>v. <em>NLRB. </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 612, 640 [18 L.Ed.2d 357, 375-376, 87 S.Ct. 1250].) We note that our review of the legislative history discloses nothing that indicates the board\u2019s analysis, which was made available to the the Legislature and the legislative committees that passed judgment on it, was ever disputed at any point in the legislative process. It is reasonable to infer from the absence of any challenge to the board\u2019s statements that the Legislature \u201caccepted these authoritative representations as to the proper construction of the bill.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Mine Workers </em>(1947) 330 U.S. 258, 279-280 [91 L.Ed. 884, 905, 67 S.Ct. 677].)</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">Thus, we conclude it was the intent of the Legislature in enacting Assembly Bill No. 3382 to clarify section 62 or, in other words, provide a legislative construction of the preexisting statute. <em>(Standard Oil Co. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 765, 770 [114 Cal.Rptr. 571].) Therefore, given this strong evidence of statutory intent to clarify the law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>the absence in the legislation itself of any explicit statement that it was intended to be declaratory of existing law is not binding on us. (See <em>Verreos </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>(1976) 63 Cal.App.3d 86, 99 [133 Cal.Rptr. 649].)</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Finally, Kern urges us to consider the absence of a retroactive provision in light of the established rule a statute effecting a substantive change will not be retrospectively applied unless legislative intent to the <em>contrary is </em>clear. (See <em>DiGenova </em>v. <em>State Board of Education </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 167, 174 [18 Cal.Rptr. 369, 367 P.2d 865].) However, this canon of construction really has no application here because, as demonstrated above, the legislation did not effect a substantive change but rather clarified the law. (See <em>Balen </em>v. <em>Peralta Junior College Dist. </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 821, 828-829, fn. 8 [114 Cal.Rptr. 589, 523 P.2d 629].)</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">III<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">Kremer, P.

(See Stats. 1978, ch. 292, \u00a7 29; and Stats. 1978, ch. 332, \u00a7 26, p. 701.) Section 110.6 was repealed by the force of its own terms on July 1, 1979, and the Legislature subsequently enacted new statutory provisions, effective July 10, 1979, defining a \u201cchange of ownership\u201d for property tax limitation purposes. (See Stats. 1979, ch. 242, \u00a7 4, p. 506.) These provisions are contained in sections 60 through 67.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b386-12\"> We are not persuaded by Kern\u2019s purely speculative argument that because the regulation had been promulgated only months before the transfer here (the regulation went into effect June 10, 1982) that it did not reflect existing law but was designed to conform to an anticipated amendment to section 62. The operative fact we need to concern ourselves with is that on October 1, 1982, the administrative regulation was in effect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b387-8\"> Clearly, this is correct since the ownership interests of the shareholders after the transfer \u201cin each and every piece of real property transferred\u201d did not \u201cremain the same after the transfer.\u201d (\u00a7 62, subd. (a)(2).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b387-9\"> With respect to this third point, Kern argues that we should consider the following: (1) Assembly Bill No. 3194, the bill that originally included the amendments to section 62, included a section that explicitly gave the bill retrospective effect, but that section of the bill was deleted when the provisions of Assembly Bill No. 3194 were amended into Assembly Bill No. 3382; and (2) in other legislation implementing Proposition 13, the Legislature had established a course of conduct of inserting a section on retrospective effect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b388-9\"> On our own motion, and over the objection of Kern, we take judicial notice of the legislative committee reports dealing with Assembly Bill No. 3382.
