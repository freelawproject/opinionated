The judgment on count three was suspended, presumably as a result of the double punishment prohibition of section 654. Mockel was sentenced on count four to 90 days in Kern County jail plus a fine of $390 converted to 13 days\u2019 additional jail time, all to run concurrently with the sentence in count one.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">On appeal Mockel contends the sentencing court committed several errors. In the unpublished portion of this opinion we will agree with Mockel that the maximum term agreed upon as part of a plea bargain was 10 years, and we will specifically enforce the bargain by modifying the judgment accordingly. We will also agree that the sentence on count four should be stayed under section 654, but we will reject a similar contention with respect to count two. In the published portion of the opinion we hold that the sentencing court did not err in receiving and considering letters from friends and acquaintances of the victim urging imposition of the maximum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">The following facts were obtained from the probation officer\u2019s report:</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">On September 8, 1989, in Bakersfield, Mockel rear-ended a car driven by David Cohn who was stopped at a traffic light on Rosedale Highway at Fruitvale Avenue. Cohn suggested the police be called and Mockel responded, \u201cAre you sure you want to do that?\u201d When Cohn insisted, Mockel agreed to move his 1982 Ford truck to the side of the roadway in front of Cohn\u2019s vehicle and out of traffic. Mockel pulled in front of Cohn and traveled slowly up Fruitvale for approximately 100 yards. Cohn followed. Mockel stopped. Cohn turned off his ignition and exited his car, walking towards Mockel\u2019s truck. As he did so, Mockel sped away heading north on Fruitvale. Cohn jumped back into his car and followed, attempting to obtain Mockel\u2019s license number. Mockel was traveling at high speeds estimated in excess of 80 miles per hour. During the chase, Cohn observed Mockel throw beer cans out of his truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">The two vehicles approached Olive Drive. Mockel entered the intersection and tried to execute a sharp right turn but lost control of his vehicle. The vehicle crossed over the center divider and \u201claunched\u201d into a 1986 Isuzu Trooper driven by Bruce White. White died from injuries sustained in the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>Mockel\u2019s blood-alcohol level two hours after the crash was .18 percent. Mockel was not wearing corrective glasses or contact lenses when driving although his license required him to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">At the time of the accident Mockel was on probation imposed as a result of a DUI conviction in February 1987. He also had suffered two other related convictions: a DUI conviction in February 1983 and a hit-and-run conviction in January 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">A., B.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">C. The Court Properly Allowed Submission of the Letters</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">Mockel complains that the trial court improperly allowed submission of letters from numerous family members and friends of the victim expressing their views on the appropriate sentence to be imposed. He claims the letters denied him a fair hearing and violated the statutes governing matters to be considered at a sentencing hearing. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">Mockel\u2019s first assignment of error is that sections 1191.1 and 1191.15 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark>are \u201cclearly exclusive and limit\u201d participation on behalf of a deceased victim to one person. The statutes cannot be read so narrowly.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>Section 1191.1 was enacted by initiative in 1982 as part of \u201cThe Victims\u2019 Bill of Rights.\u201d Section 1191.15 was added by the Legislature in 1988. These sections are not restrictive and should not be read to exclude all other sources of information for consideration in sentencing. Before the passage of Proposition 8, the sentencing court had discretion to allow statements by the victim and/or family and friends and to consider them, where relevant, in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Arbuckle </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 749, 754 [150 Cal.Rptr. 778, 587 P.2d 220, 3 A.L.R.4th 1171]; see also Cal. Rules of Court, rule 419(a)(7).) However, the court was not required to allow a victim to participate in the proceeding nor was there any requirement that a victim receive notice of sentencing. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Zikorus </em>(1983) 150 Cal.App.3d 324, 331 [197 Cal.Rptr. 509].)</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Section 1191.1 codified the Victims\u2019 Bill of Rights and requires that the victim or a family representative be notified of all sentencing proceedings and be given an opportunity to appear and express views concerning the crime. The statute mandates that the court consider the victim\u2019s statement. (150 Cal.App.3d at pp. 331-332.) The statute restricts the number of individuals a court <em>must </em>hear; it does not restrict the number of individuals a court <em>may </em>hear. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The obvious rationale for limiting the scope of the right to be heard is to protect against overburdening the court. The court remains free, however, to exercise its discretion to hear and consider additional witnesses where appropriate. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">The language of section 1191.15 similarly limits the <em>right </em>of individuals to be heard and considered in sentencing. The section provides the opportunity for a victim, or the victim\u2019s representative, to address the court by means other than personal appearance. Other than describing the method by which victims\u2019 rights may be exercised, the limiting language of section 1191.15 is identical to that of section 1191.1. We see no reason to interpret the language in the two sections differently.  It is well established that a specific provision should be construed with reference to the entire statute. <em>(Bowland </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 479, 489 [134 Cal.Rptr. 630, 556 P.2d 1081].)</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Mockel\u2019s second point of argument is that allowing what he classifies as the fruits of \u201can effort ... to incite community outrage over this tragic event\u201d denied him due process of law and his right to a fundamentally fair hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">It is well settled that allowing statements from the friends and family of the victim of a violent crime does not violate due process or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>defendant\u2019s right to confront and cross-examine witnesses so long as the defendant had notice that the statements would be accepted and had an opportunity to respond. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Birmingham </em>(1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 180, 183-185 [265 Cal.Rptr. 780]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sewell </em>(1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 1447, 1449 [259 Cal.Rptr. 34] and cases cited therein.)  Mockel was given an opportunity to read and respond to all of the letters submitted. Mockel\u2019s counsel requested a continuance of the sentencing hearing so he could review the letters received. The request was granted. Mockel has not shown any denial of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The United States Supreme Court, while finding the submission of victim statements to a <em>jury </em>in a <em>capital </em>case violated the Eighth Amendment, acknowledged facts about the victim and his or her family may be relevant and admissible in noncapital cases. <em>(Booth </em>v. <em>Maryland </em>(1987) 482 U.S. 496, 507-509 [96 L.Ed.2d 440, 451-452, 107 S.Ct. 2529].)  Well-established decisional law in California allows the sentencing court to consider responsible out-of-court or unsworn statements concerning the circumstances of the crime and/or the characteristics of the defendant relevant to sentencing. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Arbuckle, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 754; <em>People </em>v. <em>Zikorus, supra, </em>150 Cal.App.3d at p. 333.) Here the court considered both the letters received from family and friends of the victim and letters received on behalf of Mockel. There was nothing fundamentally unfair about the sentencing hearing. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Birmingham, supra, </em>217 Cal.App.3d at pp. 184-185.)</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Next, Mockel argues the letters were not relevant and were submitted solely to invoke the emotion of the court. Some of the information contained in the various letters is irrelevant and much of it is cumulative of the information already found in the probation report. However, as the court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Sewell, supra, </em>noted, judges spend much of their professional lives separating the wheat from the chaff and have extensive experience in sentencing, along with the legal training necessary to determine an appropriate sentence. (210 Cal.App.3d at p. 1449.) It is unlikely a judge would respond to the type of expression found in the letters here challenged. Moreover, the statement most likely to invoke an emotional response was the one statement the court had a duty to hear and consider\u2014the grief-stricken statement of the victim\u2019s wife, Beverly White.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Additionally, Mockel was required to raise an objection to the statements at the hearing when the sentencing court could respond accordingly. Because no objection was made, Mockel has waived his right to complain and may not raise the issue for the first time on appeal. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Birmingham, supra, </em>217 Cal.App.3d at p. 183, citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Evans </em>(1983) 141 Cal.App.3d 1019, 1021 [190 Cal.Rptr. 633]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Zikorus, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number><em>supra, </em>150 Cal.App.3d at p. 333 [Defendant objected on relevancy grounds to a portion of victim statement. Objection was sustained.].)</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Lastly, Mockel contends the receipt and consideration of the letters not expressly authorized by sections 1191.1 and 1191.15 violate section 1204\u2019s<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> prohibition against accepting any verbal or written statement in aggravation or mitigation of punishment except as provided in the statute. Although at first blush Mockel\u2019s argument appears to have merit, a closer review of the governing statutes establishes otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">The language of section 1204 applies only to evidence of mitigating and aggravating factors, not generic victim statements. If we were to read section 1204 as applicable to statements from family, friends, and witnesses concerning the victim and the tragic circumstances of the crime, the section would directly prohibit well-established practices recognized as being within the discretion of the sentencing court and would undermine the intent of the Victims\u2019 Bill of Rights.  The Victims\u2019 Bill of Rights was obviously intended to ensure that victims of crime and/or their families and friends may participate in sentencing proceedings even if for no other reason than to vent their anger and pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">We find no cases on point. However, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Zikorus, supra, </em>150 Cal.App.3d at pages 333-334, the court noted that although existing law allowed consideration of a victim statement without cross-examination and confrontation, there were important exceptions to the rule. The court noted in footnote 3 that ex parte communications by the prosecutor are prohibited and <em>evidence offered in aggravation or mitigation of a state prison term </em>must comply with section 1204. Thus at least one other court recognizes the distinction we suggest between victim statements and the evidence described in section 1204.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">Another reason supporting the court\u2019s receipt and consideration of the letters here is that they were attached to the probation report and thus fell within the expressed exception to section 1204. They were submitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>pursuant to a statutorily established procedure with proper procedural safeguards.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Mockel argues that section 1203 does not authorize the inclusion of victim statements in a probation report and thus the exception in section 1204 does not apply. We are not persuaded.  Section 1203 mandates inclusion of certain information in the report but does not purport to identify all information which may be included. We do not read the statute as a definitive listing of all contents of a probation report. Many items routinely included in probation officer reports are not identified in the statute but are identified in the applicable Rules of Court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 419.)</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">The judgment is modified to reflect that the sentence imposed on count two shall run concurrent with the sentence on count one and that execution of the sentence imposed on count four is stayed pending completion of the sentence on count one and permanently thereafter. The court below shall issue an amended abstract of judgment reflecting the modifications ordered herein. As so modified the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">Martin, Acting P.
