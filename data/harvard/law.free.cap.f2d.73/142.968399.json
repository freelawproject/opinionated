An aetion had been brought in that conrt to secure judgment against the Judith Basin Irrigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>Distriet upon certain outstanding bonds issued by the district which were issued and sold in 1921. A judgment had been rendered in that action. The petition for writ of mandamus was filed in that action for the purpose of enforcing the judgment which was rendered on the 19th of October, 1931 in the sum of $77,716. It is alleged in the petition that the distriet had no property subject to execution and that there are no funds in the county treasury of Fergus county in which the irrigation distriet is situated applicable to the payment of the judgment. It is alleged that the petitioners and judgment creditors are the owners of all the bonds of the district ex-\u2122m^;red f \u2019 27i 39\u2019 a*d <em>]}9 </em>for $1,000 each. The judgment was for the principal of the first 40 bonds, to wit, $40,-000 and for the unpaid coupons excepting bonds numbered 21, 27, and 391. The judgment does not cover bonds to 160, which the petitioners alleged they now own. The bonds, by their terms, accrue at different times, ten or twelve bonds, as the cas\u00e9 may be, being payable annually until January 1, 1940'. It would follow that since the rendition of the judgment other bonds now owned by the plaintiff in that action have matured and other interest coupons have matured upon the bonds whieh are not yet due. The county commissioners are acting ex officio as commissioners for the irrigation distriet. All the property within the limits of the irrigation district, amounting to 4,253.35 acres, has been sold at tax sales by the county treasurer of said county to Fergus county for</p>\n<p id=\"Arp\">\u00ab * * * delinquent taxes or assessments levied by said irrigation distriet and dp-li-ngnerit general taxes, together with penalties and interest, constituting liens thereon, and certificates of tax sales were issued to said county by said treasurer and filed in his office.</p>\n<p id=\"AKm\">\u201c13. That .the time for redemption from said tax sales and all thereof having expired, and no part of said lands having been redeemed, tax deeds were issued by said county treasurer to said Fergus County, conveying to said county all of said lands, and said county is now in possession and holding title to all of .said lands by virtue of said tax deeds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A43\">. ,, . , It is alleged that the board. of county commissioners have fixed the * fair market value of said land and parcels thereof for the purpose of such sale upon the assumption that said lands are not subject to future irrigation district taxes or assessments for the payment of any part of the principal or interest of said bonds, and threaten to and will, unless otherwise commanded by this court, notify and advise the purchaser, or purchasers, of the lands at said sale that the said lands will be sold and conveyed by said county free and clear from any and all liability to future taxation for the payment of any part of the principal or interest of said bonds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AER\">It is further alleged that the price fixed by the county commissioners is less than the amount due and to become due upon the bonds by over $50,006.</p>\n<p id=\"AHna\">n ig d tbat tbe e0lmt commissi(m_ erg bave advertised a\u00edld offered said lands \u00a3or gale ag ^ b seeticm 223\u00f1 o\u00a3 tbe <em>^ </em>vised Codes of Montana of 1921, as amended b seetkm g e gg ^ o\u00a3 Mont 1927&lt; T]mt seeti(m ^ tbat tbe sale sball not be made &amp;r legg than ^ <em>maxkgb ^</em></p>\n<p id=\"AqZE\">, _ It is further alleged that the county comraissidners <em>\u201c * * </em>* claim and assert that the purchaser, ^ or purchasers, of said lands when so sold will obtain title thereto free and \u00b0tear from any and all liability for future taxes or assessments to pay the principal and interest said bonds which may remain unPaid after tke distribution and application of the proceeds of said sale as provided in said section 2235 as amended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ATy\">That section (2285) was subsequently amended by the Legislature of Montana in 1929 (chapter 162) by providing that the sale should be made to the highest bidder, but the Supreme Court of Montana, in State ex rel. Malott v. Board of County Commissioners, 89 Mont. 37, 296 P. 1, held that this amendment was unconstitutional, in that it violated the contract rights of the bondholders of irrigation districts because it impaired the obligation of the contract between the distriet and the bondholders. They are further \u201ccornmanded, in the event a levy of the taxes or assessments shall not be made for said Irrigation District by the Commissioners of said Distriet for any year, to ascertain the total amount necessary to be raised for all purposes \u00b0I sai^ distriet, and make a levy for that year for said distriet as provided in chapter 59 of the Laws of Montana, 1931, and furnisR the county clerk and recorder of said county with a list of said lands and the am0lmt o\u00a3 ^ t\u00a3m;s Qr assessmellte, as re_ quired by section 7246 of the Revised Codes q\u00a3 Montana; 1921 until tbe judgment in this actkm and gaid ^ fuUy id \u201e</p>\n<p id=\"AGH\">The basic question in this case is as to the nature of the obligation of the distriet upon the bonds issued and sold by it. At the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>time of the issuance of the bonds there were* no decisions by tlie Supreme Court of Montana as to whether or not the bonds wore the\u2019 general obligation of the district. Later the matter came before that court in Cosman v. Chestnut Valley Irr. Dist., 74 Mont. 111, 238, P. 879, 40 A. L. R. 1344, and in Clark v. Demers, 78 Mont. 287, 254 P. 162, and the case of Drake v. Schoregge, 85 Mont. 94, 277 P. 627. In these eases it was held that the bonds of the irrigation district were general obligations of the district. Later, however, the matter was again presented to the Supreme Court of Montana in State ex rel. Malott v. Board of County Commissioners, 89 Mont. 37, 296 P. 1, supra. The Supreme Court of Montana expressly overruled its previous decisions and decided the bonds were not the general obligation of the district, but merely a charge against the lands within the district, and that each tract of land was only liable for its proportion of the entire bonded indebtedness. It wa,s also held in that case that when the land ... had been sold for taxes and conveyed to tlie <em>. </em>, . . . . .. ... county by tax deed and subsequently sold to the county, as provided by law, that the purchaser acquired the lands free and clear from any lien of the bonds or any future taxation for the payment thereof. Ordinarily, it is the duty of the federal court to follow the deeisions of the state court with reference to state legislation. But one of the exceptions to this rale is that when there is no decision of the state court interpreiing a statute and that statute has been the basis for the issua.nee of obligations the statute becomes a part of the contract between the purchaser of the bond and the political corporation issuing the same and the federal courts will exercise their independent judgment in determining the proper construction of the state statute regardless of subsequent decisions of the Supreme Court of the state upon the question, leaning strongly, however, to the adoption of such interpretation if reasonably possible, This case presents a situation of that nature. At the time the bonds involved in this action were issued and sold there was no interpretation of the statute by the Supreme Court of Montana. Under these circumstances this court must exercise its own independent judgment as to the meaning of the statute under which the bonds were issued. Davenport v. Lord, 9 Wall. 409, 19 L.

As stated by the Supreme Court of Montana in Re Crow Creek Irrigation District, 63 Mont. 293, 207 P. 121, 122; \u201cIn its general legislative plan, our statute is modoled after the Wright Law of California (O\u2019Neill v.

In view of the fact, however, that we are not wit\u00edl <em>the </em>general frame work ^e Wright Act, but with the specific provisions based thereon which had been enacted by tbe Legislature of Montana, and also with the general taxing system of\u2019that state as enacted b7 tbe Legislature, and the mter-relation of these two ^sterns of taxation, we think *ba* farther comment upon the most \u00b0f oftb?

We proceed, therefore, to a brief consideration of some of the propositions involved in the determination of whether or not the bonds were the general obligations of the district:</p>\n<p id=\"b175-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number> 1. In ihe first place, where the Legislaturc authorizes a municipality to issue bonds, the bonds thus evidenced are agreements to pay certain amounts therein speeified by the municipality to the holder of the bond and are on their face a general obligation of the municipality. The bonds in question were issued in that form and the law clearly contemplates that they should he so issued. Authority to issue the bonds implies ar* authority to levy a tax to pay them.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">2. It seems to us an insuperable obstacle to the declaring that the bonds constitute a lien only upon the lands of the district that no method is provided by Ihe law of Montana for the apportionment of the debt upon ihe several pieces of land within the district. The only segregation provided is that which results from the imposition of the annual tax to pay interest and principal of the bonds American Falls Reservoir Dist. v. Thrall, 39 Idaho, 105, 228 P. 236. I'his tax was to be levied upon the irrigable land of the district and apportioned according to the irrigable acreage and not ad valorem.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">3. The bonds were sold to various individuals'. The amount of the bond does not represent a lien upon any particular piece of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-12\"><em>, </em>rm_ , \u2022, ,, . j. , . , 4. The bonds on their face purport to be ... <em>j , a </em>ihe obligation of the district and not of any <em>\u25a0 n \u25a0 j. , n </em>specilie piece ox property or ox any owner <em>\u201e </em>. .. , . <em>i </em>, ox any individual piece ox property. <em>J r r r j</em></p>\n<p id=\"b175-21\">5. The purchaser of a bond cannot enforce it against any particular piece of property nor can tho owner of any particular piece of property pay the bond and thus discharge his land from the lien. The purchaser of the bond must rely solely upon the annual assessments and collection of those assessments by the public authorities. .</p>\n<p id=\"Asl\">6. The bond expressly provides for the annual levy of a tax to pay the installments of interest due upon tho bond and to pay the bond itself when due. Tho Revised Code of Montana of 1921, \u00a7 7232, provides as follows: \u201cTax or assessment to pay bonds and interest. All bonds and the interest thereon issued hereunder * * \u201d shall be paid by revenue derived from a special tax or assessment levied as hereinafter provided upon all illo lands included in the district, except upon such lands as have boon included in such district on account of the exchange or substitution of water under the provisions of section 720G) if any there be; and all the lands in tho district at the time said bonds are issued, and all lands subsequently ineluded which are so chargeable under the provisions of this act, shall be and <em>remain Viable </em>to be taxed and assessed for the paymont of said bonds and interest. * * * It shall be the duty of the board of eommissioners of the district, in the order or resolution authorizing and directing the issuance of bonds of the district, mentioned in section 7210, to provide for the annual levy and collection of a special tax or assessment upon all the lands included in the district and subjoot taxation and assossmolJit as aforesaid, gllfgeion^ jn am0nnt to meet the interest on said b(&gt;nds promptly when and as the same aeomcS) and to discbarg,e tbe prineipal there-o\u00a3 at tbcir maiurity? or respcetive maturities, \u00ab, , * A certified copy of such resolution s\u00f1all bo flled wii}l tbo ekrk of the board of eouid;y commissioners of each county in which tho landg of the irrig.ation dist\u00f3et lie; and tbo special tax or assessment therein provided for sbajj bn \u00a1eded and co]jeeb;d as hereinafter prcseribod) and when so collected shall, by the county treasurer having custody of the funds 0\u00a3 \u00a3jie digbc[et, hg piaeed jn a special fund and used solely for the payment of all amounts due or to become due to the United States * * * and for the payment of the interest on and principal of said bonds when due, <em>so long </em>as any of said bonds or the interest coupons ,, , , . . . x , . .. \u201d , thereto appertaining remain Outstanding and \u2022 j v , ,, . \u201e 65 unpaid. In the event that for any reason any \u2022 , , , , . , <em>J </em>special tax or assessment hereinabove pro- \u201e I . JIT-T T vided tor cannot or shall not be levied and collected in time to meet any interest falling due on any bonds issued hereunder, then the board of commissioners shall have the power and authority, and it shall be their duty, to provide for and pay such interest when duo, either out of any of tho funds in hand in the treasury of the district not otherwise appropriated, or by warrants (which may bear intercst at a rato not to ^ceed six per centum Pcr ammm) drawn against the next district ta* \u201d assessment levied or to be levied.\u201d (Italles ours-)</p>\n<p id=\"ADA\">It will be noted that the provision that the amounts due on the bonds should be paid from any money in tho treasury of the district is inconsistent with the idea that the bonds are not an obligation of the district. In sections 7251 and 7253 of the Revised Code of Montana the bonds are referred to as an \u201cindebtednoss of the district.\u201d In section 7251 it is said, \u201cprovided, however, that this limitation shall not apply to the indebtedness for which bonds have been or may be issued as provided for by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>Section 7253, supra, providing for the dissolution of the district, where \u201cno bonded indebtedness has been incurred,\u201d provides if, upon said hearing, the court finds that no bonded indebtedness of the district has been created, and all the expenses of organization and all other indebtedness have been paid,\u2019 e^c-</p>\n<p id=\"AnjU\">These statutes recognize the indebtedness as an obligation of the district.

Paul, 274 U. S. 175, 181, 47 S. Ct. 561, 71 L. Ed. 982. This view is not in accord with the most recent decisi\u00f3n of the Supreme Court (Roberts v. Richland Irr. Dist., 289 U. S. 71, 53 S. Ct. 519, 521, 77 L. Ed. 1038) dealing with the distlet \u201cd state of Washington, where said: Norwood <em>v. </em>Baker 172 U. S. 269, <em>19 </em>S. <em>Ct. </em>187, 43 L. Ed. 443, and similar cases, has no apP1^10? her\\ Appellant\u2019s land will be assessed meet a general obhgation of the corporation and the mere tact that the apportioned burden will exceed estimated beneg\u00a3yeg no color to the claim of confiscation, _^g p0in\u00a3ed out the eases cited lands may be taxed to pay for local improvements although they receive no actual benefits. Never? ag \u00a3be Supreme Court of the state has said, was appellant entitled to the segregation of bis sbare af the corporate obligation. The gtatute -did n0,t eontempiate that assessments agains\u00a3 any tract should be limited to payment of its increased value. A general obligation was created and every tract subject thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ArB\"> This ease was originally argued upon t<em>h</em>e theory that a determination or the basic q<em>u</em>estion as to whether or not the bonds or an lrrigation district were the general obligation the district or merely a lien upon all t<em>h</em>e lands m the district was determinative of the appeal, and that if the obligations were general obligations of the district that the order 0f the District Court appealed from should be affirmed. Upon an examination of the questions involved and the legislation of Montana relating thereto, we concluded that before the matter was determined we should ask the attorneys for further briefs and argument bearing particularly upon the statutory law of Montana. These briefs have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>filed and the ease has been reargued. We do not deem it necessary to discuss many of the questions raised by us. One of the questions was as to whether or not the statutory law of Montana contemplated that after a deed had been issued to the county for unpaid state, county, and irrigation district taxes it was contemplated that subsequent irrigation district taxes should be levied from year to year pending the sale hv the county of the lands thus acquired. On the argument it is stated that there is no decision of the Supreme Court of Montana upon that subject. In the absence of such decision it would seem that the duty to assess the tax is clearly imposed by section 7232 of the Revised Codes, which authorizes the issuance of irrigation district bonds, and provides that when the bonds are issued provision should be made for the annual levy of the tax. We also suggested that the question of the disposition of the funds derived by the sale of lands deeded'to the county for state, county, and irrigation district taxes suggested by the Supreme Court of Montana in its dictum in the ease of State ex rel. Malott v. Board of County Commissioners, supra, was in conflict with the statutory rule (Rev. Code Mont. 1921, \u00a7 2235, subd. 1, as amended by Laws 1927, c. 85, \u00a7 3) in relation thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">Having determined the basic question in favor of the appellee, for the reasons above stated, it is unnecessary to discuss this matter. Wo are also satisfied with the fact that there are other outstanding' bonds and that these bonds were included in the order directing the sale and further assessment therefore does not impair the power of the court to enforce the rights of the petitioning bondholders. See Freeman on Judgments (5th Ed.) vol. 1, pp. 952, 957, 1098; New Orleans v. Citizens\u2019 Bank, 167 U. S. 371, 17 S. Ct. 905, 42 L. Ed. 202; Gunter v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 200 U. S. 273, 26 S. Ct. 252, 50 L. Ed. 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">In our request to counsel for further argument we suggested a discussion of whether or not it was an improper interference with the discretion of the Board of Commissioners to direct that the board fix a different market value of the property to he sold by them from that already fixed. We are satisfied that the writ was proper where the market value was fixed by the hoard because of an erroneous interpretation of the law. The market value was fixed by them upon the theory that the land in the hands of a purchaser would not be liable for the outstanding and unpaid bonds. According to the law, as we interpret it, the land would still be subject to the outstanding bonds and the market value should be fixed with that fact in mind as directed by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
