All counts charged an attempt to rob a postal clerk. On the first and second counts he was sentenced to serve 25 years, but, as the sentences were suspended, they are not material. Appellee is held under a sentence of 10 years\u2019 imprisonment on the third count, which is as follows: \u201cThird Count: And the grand jurors aforesaid, upon their oath aforesaid, do further present that L. A. Kenna, Rudolph Heimel and Bill Sehiltz, late of Mecklenburg County, in said district, on the 9th day of August, 1930, unlawfully, wilfully and feloniously did attempt to rob M. E. Pierce, Clerk in Charge Chadwick Station of <em>the </em>Charlotte, North Carolina postoffiee, a duly authorized post-office of the United States, who had in Ms custody Fifty Dollars ($50.00) in cash, lawful money of the United States, said money being United States postoffice funds; contrary to the form of the statute in such ease made and provided, and against the peace and dignity of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-23\">The District Court held there is no federal statute making an attempt to rob a postal clerk an offense, and ordered the prisoner discharged. Counsel for the warden concedes that there is no federal statute denouncing as an offense an attempt to rob a postal clerk, but seeks to sustain the validity of the conviction and sentence under the provisions of section 197, Criminal Code (18 USCA <em>\u00a7 </em>320), which, so far as pertinent, provides: \u201cWhoever shall assault any person having lawful charge, eontrol, or custody of any mail <em>matter, </em>with <em>intent to rob, </em>steal, or purloin such mail matter or any part thereof, or shall rob any such person of such mail or any part thereof, shall, for a first offense, be imprisoned not more than ten years. \u00ae * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-24\">It is argued that \u201can attempt to rob\u201d and \u201cassault with intent to rob\u201d are synonymous terms, and therefore the defect is merely on\u00a9 of form, and the indictment should be considered sufficient under the provisions of R\u00bb S. \u00a7 1025 (18 USCA \u00a7 556).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-25\">We do not agree with the contention of appellant. An <em>attempt to rob is not </em>necessarily an assault, and the terms are not interchangeable. There could be no doubt that the indictment does not charge a crime under any statute of the United States. This is a matter of substance and not of form, and does not come under the provisions of R. S. \u00a7 1025. U. S. v. Carll, 105 U. S. 611, 26 L. Ed. 1135; Evans v. U. S., 153 U. S. 584, 14 S. Ct. 934, 38 L. Ed. 830; U. S. v. Standard Brewery, 251 U. S. 210, 40 S. Ct. 139, 64 L. Ed. 229.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-26\">As the indictment does not charge an offense, the verdict thereon amounted to nothing, and the court was without j urisdiction to impose a sentence. Greene v. Henkel, 183 U. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>S. 249, 22 S. Ct. 218, 46 L. Ed. <em>177; Henry </em>v. Henkel, 235 U. S. 219, 35 S. Ct. 54, 59 L. Ed. 203; Mackey v. Miller (C. C. A.) 126 F. 161; Manning v. Biddle (C. C. A.) 14 F. (2d) 518; White v. Levine (C. C. A.) 40 F. (2d) 502; Brown v. White (C. C. A.) 24 F.
