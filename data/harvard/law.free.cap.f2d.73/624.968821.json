These applications were each filed on May 30\u2019, 1930. Thereupon the appellee, S. S. S. Company, a corporation existing under and by virtue of the laws of the state of Georgia, and having its residence in the city of Atlanta, in said state, gave notice of opposition to both attempted registrations, alleging the continuous use of, first, the letter \u201cS,\u201d and thereafter the letters \u201cS S S,\u201d as trade-marks, for over fifty years, and from a period prior to the year 1879, upon a medical preparation or remedy for the cure of blood and skin diseases, and for purifying the blood. The opposer alleged that the goods of opposer and the appellant were of the same descriptive properties, and that the use of appellant\u2019s marks, which it here proposes to register, would be likely to cause confusion in trade and deception of the public to the damage and injury of the opposer. Testimony was taken by both parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-24\">The marks proposed to be registered by the appellant are properly described by the Examiner of Interferences as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b652-25\">\u201cThe drawing of application serial number 301,763, discloses a mark consisting of the relatively large letters \u2018S. M. S.\u2019 displayed within concentric circles divided by radial lines intersecting at right angles. The disclaimed words \u2018Spring,\u2019 \u2018Summer,\u2019 \u2018Autumn\u2019 and \u2018Winter,\u2019 \u2018for All Tear Round Use\u2019 appear in association with the features described.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-26\">\u201cApplication serial number 301,764, discloses a mark consisting of the same letters, \u2018S. M. S.,\u2019 displayed against a background simulating a keystone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-27\">The dominating portions of the marks of appellant and appellee are \u201cS'M'S\u201d and \u201cS. S. S,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-28\">The two oppositions were consolidated by the Examiner of Interferences, and have both been disposed of at the same time by the tribunals of the Patent Office, and will be so disposed of herei.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>As a result of the consideration of the record, ihe Examiner of Interferences was of the opinion that confusion would be likely to result from the registration of the proposed trade-marks and sustained the oppositions. On appeal, the commissioner affirmed the decision of the Examiner of Interferences. Before the commissioner, the point seems to have been presented by the applicant t hat the opposer did not come into court with clean hands, alleging a misrepresentation by the opposer of the properties of its remedy. As to this, the commissioner was of the opinion that even if the commissioner had jurisdiction of such subject-matter, sufficient proof had not been offered in the record upon which any decision c-ould be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">The appellant has appealed to this court, contending in his brief that the commissioner was in error in finding that confusion was likely to result; that, as a matter of fact, no confusion had ever existed; and that the op-poser is not entitled to relief because it does not come with clean hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">The facts of the case, as shown by the record, are, briefly, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">In 1878 one C. T. Swift registered in the United States Patent Office a trade-mark consisting of a monogram composed of the letters \u201cSSS\u201d placed in the center of a circle, above which were ornamental scrolls on which were the words \u201cSwift\u2019s Syphilitic Specific and Blood Purifier.\u201d It is admitted that, at that time, this remedy was used for the cure of certain blood and skin diseases, and that especially it was adopted and used for the treatment of syphilis. The business after-wards was conveyed through successive conveyances to the present corporation, known as the \u201cS. S. S. Co.,\u201d which now manufactures the product by the same formula as that originally used by Swift. The record further shows that the mark first used was the letter \u201cS,\u201d and various registrations through the years show first the letter \u201cS\u201d and then the three S\u2019s used as the continuous trade-mark for the business. Sometimes the \u201cSSS\u201d was written without periods, and at others \u201cS. S. S.,\u201d which is and was the form used at the time notices of opposition were filed herein. The record shows that after the discovery of salvarsan or \u201c606,\u201d and perhaps sooner because of prohibitive state laws, the remedy of the opposer was not advertised or recommended for the relief of venereal diseases. It is alleged by counsel for appellant that the opposer has, at various times, claimed its product to be a remedy for cancer. We find no such fact appearing in the record. As this statement repeatedly appears in appellant\u2019s brief, it seems proper for the court to suggest that this statement is made through unfamiliarity with the contents of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">On the part of the applicant, it appears from the record that its business originated in Mrs. Helen Sehymanski, who resides at 1869 North Daman avenue, in Chicago, and who has been engaged in manufacturing a general tonic for approximately twenty-five years. At first she sold this tonic under the name \u201cWonderful Home Remedy,\u201d but, about .1925, she adopted as a trade-mark the letters \u201cS'M'S.\u201d At the time of the taking of the testimony in this cause in 1932, she had several stores in the city of Chicago where she was selling this remedy. It was sold under the marks of \u201cS'M'S\u201d and the \u201cHerb-NuTonie.\u201d There is considerable testimony in the record to the effect that Mrs. Sehymanski, together with her son, Dr. Peter B. Schyman, advertised this product very extensively by window displays, artificial figures, circulars, and otherwise. In addition, Mrs. Sehymanski herself conducted one of these stores, and was very active in attempting to push the sale of the remedy. Very considerable sales of this medicine occurred. The sales of both the S. S. S. of the opposer, and the S'M'S of the applicant were, to a substantial extent, made among people of the more illiterate class. Especially was this true in the city of Chicago, where large sales were made, as the record shows, in parts of the city where such illiterate classes predominate.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-11\">On the part of the opposer it is shown that, on various occasions, substitutes wore made of S'M'S for S. S. S. by druggists, and that the S 'M'S was at times palmed off for S. S. S. In addition, it is shown that the selling price of the S'M'S to jobbers, retailers, and to the public, was much less than that of the S. S. S.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-12\">The applicant insists that the opposer has committed fraud upon the public in misrepresenting its remedy to be a specific for syphilis and for various other diseases. This question is not raised by the reasons for appeal and will not be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-13\">It is shown that the S. S. S. Company has spent many millions in advertising, and has built up a very large business, amounting to sales of over $2,000,000' a year; that its business extends throughout the United States, and is one productive of extensive profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-14\">It seems quite evident that the tribunals in 1he Patent Office came to the proper conclusion about this matter. It is apparent that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>if, in the same establishment, bottles of the S. S. S. preparation were placed side by side with goods of the same descriptive properties, as these are, in similarly shaped bottles marked \u201cS-M'S,\u201d the opportunities for confusion are very great. Especially is this true among the illiterate and ignorant, and those who cannot be expected to exercise the same care and caution which might be exercised by those of another degree of information or intelligence. It is true that such confusion would not be so likely to exist in some localities, or with some classes of purchasers. However, it would exist to some extent in all localities.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">Counsel for appellant cites, although no particular comment is made thereon, Dollfus-Mieg et Cie v. Richardson Silk Co., 55 App. D. C. 226, 4 F.(2d) 302, 303. In that case appellee sought to register the letters \u201cR. M. C.\u201d as a trade mark for cotton thread and yarns. Appellant opposed, claiming the pri- or use of the trade-mark \u201cD. M. C.\u201d upon goods of the same\u2019 descriptive properties. The opposition was dismissed by the Patent Office, and such action was sustained by the Court of Appeals, the court holding that \u201cno one has the right, by adopting a combination of figures or letters, to exclude others from the adoption and use of different combinations of either.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">However, the court added: \u201cOf course, the second combination may not so closely approximate the first in subject-matter and accessories as to lead to confusion.\u201d It seems quite evident that the court there intimated that it would, in a proper case of likelihood of confusion, sustain, such an opposition. This is further evidenced in Guggenheim v. Cantrell et al., 56 App. D. C. 100, 10 F.(2d) 895, in an infringement suit, where the same court, speaking through the same judge, affirmed a decree of the lower court enjoining the further use of the trade-mark and name \u201cG <em>&amp; </em>G\u201d upon ginger ale, upon the bill of a prior user of the trade-mark \u201cC &amp; C,\u201d upon the same product.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Other federal courts have had similar views. See Godillot v. American Grocery Co. (C. C.) 71 F. 873, where the mark \u201cA. G.\u201d was held infringed by the use of \u201cA. G. Co.\u201d; American Tin Plate Co. v. Licking, etc., Co. (C. C.) 158 F. 690, where a mark consisting of the letters \u201cM. F.\u201d in a monogram, inclosed in a circle, was held to be infringed by the use of the mark \u201cM. F. H.,\u201d on identical goods; Smith <em>&amp; </em>Wesson v. Galef (D. C.) 292 F. 314, where the mark \u201cST. W.,\u201d in connection with firearms and ammunition, was held to be an infringement of the mark \u201cS. &amp; W.\u201d; Omo Mfg. Co. v. Mystic Rubber Co. (D. C.) 225 F. 92, where the mark \u201coMo\u201d on dress shields was held to be infringed by the mark \u201cDM])\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">In the Patent Office practice, if letters, or combinations thereof, used as trade-marks, are so alike that their concurrent use upon goods of the same descriptive properties is thought to be likely to cause confusion in the minds of purchasers, the office has not failed to sustain the oppositions thereto. Craver\u2019s Sons v. Conklin &amp; Son, 1 T. M. Rep. 135; Ex parte Ray, 5 T. M. Rep. 114; Keys Piston Ring Co. v. Metal Prod. Co., 8 T. M. Rep. 465; Goldman <em>&amp; </em>Bros. v. Goldstein, 125 Misc. 737, 211 N. Y. S. 872, 15 T. M. Rep. 540.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-10\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
