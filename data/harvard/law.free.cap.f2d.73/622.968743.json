A glass tank furnace composed of a plurality of bloeks, each block in the side walls of said tank having the major portion of its outer surface covered with heat-insulating material and the seams between said blocks in the said side walls being exposed to provide recesses overlying the seams, which recesses open directly to the atmosphere at one side.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-23\">\u201c8. The method of insulating a glass tank furnace composed of a plurality of blocks which comprise covering the major portions of the outer surfaces of each of the said bloeks with insulation, and leaving recesses overlying the seams between said bloeks which recesses are opened to the atmosphere at one side thereof, to facilitate the freezing of glass penetrating between said bloeks and to concentrate the attack of molten glass on the inner surfaces of the bloeks toward the centers thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-24\">The references cited are:</p>\n<p id=\"b650-25\">Murphy, 555,964, March 10, 1896.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-26\">Good, 1,421,211, June 27, 1922.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-27\">Brownlee, 1,695,528, December 18, 1928.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-28\">Appellant discloses a construction of tank furnaces and bloeks therefor, in which furnaces glass is melted. One of the drawings shows a furnace whose bottom and sides are formed of the blocks. The side blocks are shown to be covered with heat-insulating material which extends to near the seams between the blocks. The seams themselves are, by this construction, left exposed over a space which the specification recites as being \u201csuitably\u201d about one-fourth inch in width. There is thus shown a construction in which, as stated by the Board of Appeals, \u201cThe insulating material is divided into panels by spaces between the panels, the spaces registering with the seams in the tank * *</p>\n<p id=\"b650-29\">The purpose of the application of the heat insulation is to prevent the cooling of the blocks from exposure to the atmosphere,, while the purpose of the open spaces over the seams is to expose them and- thus facilitate the cooling or \u201cfreezing\u201d of such molten glass <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>as penetrates through the joints from within tho furnace tank.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">One of the drawings of the patent to Murphy, which is for a glass tank furnace, disclo\u00edses a structure having a tank whose bottom and ends are surrounded by outer blocks. Opening's designated in the specification as \u201ccold air ports\u201d are shown in the outer bottom blocks. The specification recites that these air ports are located \u201cimmediately beneath and opposite the joints forming the sides and bottom of said tank, also at the sides of tho same, whereby tho liquid glass exuding therefrom in the, event of an opening at such point is cooled and solidified, forming a vitreous joint at such place or point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">The patent to Good shows a tank having heat-insulating material extending from its bottom up to a point adjacent the level of the molten glass within the tank. The specification of the patent discloses a tank whose sides and bottom are composed of \u201cflux blocks.\u201d The tank is surrounded by an \u201cinsulation space\u201d which is \u201cpreferably filled with sand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">The patent to Brownlee refers to the preservation of a more equal temperature of the glass \u201cpartly by adding insulations around the deeper portions of the refining tank to decrease the heat loss in this portion of the furnace, and partly by positively heating the shallower tank portion.\u201d There is shown a draw-pot and a certain tank or trough which is \u201csubstantially a continuation of the draw-pot.\u201d Eaeh of these is \u201cmounted over and carried by\u201d what is designated a \u201cheating furnace.\u201d Between these heating furnaces there is left a cooling space \u201cto assist in cooling the joint\u201d between tho draw-pot and the trough. Another cooling space is shown between the heating furnace upon which the trough portion rests, and another tank described in the specification as \"the refining-tank.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">In the decision of the Board of Appeals it is said, in effect, that the \u201cwarming portions\u201d beneath the draw-pot may be considered to correspond to appellant\u2019s insulating panels, and that the spaces above described as lying adjacent the heating furnaces may be considered to cool (together with certain cooling pip\u00edes) the seams in the draw-pot in much the same manner and for the same pur2\u00bbose as indicated in the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">It is conceded, as of course it must be, that no one of the referonees, of and by itself, discloses the structure of appellant. The posilion of the tribunals of the Patent Office is that the features which have been above described, when taken together, anticipate appellant\u2019s teachings and prevent the allowance of the patent sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-10\">It is pointed out on behalf of appellant, in substance, that Murphy does not anywhere disclose in his patent the use of insulating material or insulation, nor does he use these terms within the four comers of his patent; that the supporting blocks at the bottom, in which are found the \u201cair ports\u201d of the sj\u2019ceification, are not referred to in the patent as \u201cinsulation\u201d or as \u201cheat-insulating material\u201d ; that these lower blocks are, in fact, only for the purpose of supporting the tank bottom; that the outer blocks at the two ends of the tank do not contact the tank itself except at the very top edges of the end wall blocks above the normal glass level; that the full areas of all sides of the tank are wholly uncovered and uninsulated; that the structure shown is <em>designed </em>to create passages <em>for </em>the enforced cooling of tho entire area of the side walls, and it is urged that Murphy \u201cis the antithesis of appellant both in construction and function.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-11\">As to the Good patent, appellant's counsel points out that it simply shows a glass furnace tank whose insulating feature is solid\u2014\u2022 that is, there are no openings in the insulation which permit the exposure of <em>the </em>tank block joints, or any portion of the tank, to tho atmosphere.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-12\">With respect to the Brownlee patent, the argument for appellant is, in effect, that such actual insulation as Brownlee discloses is the solid insulation of the refining tank; that there is no insulation whatever of the chamber comprising tho draw-pot with its appurtenant tank, or trough, in which the actual melting apparently takes place; that in the heating furnaces underneath the draw-pot heat is generated and, when desired, is applied in addition to the normal heat which reaches the glass from other sources; and that it is not tenable to consider these heating furnaces as corresqjonding to appellant\u2019s panel insulation, the purpose of which is to conserve heat, not generate it.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-13\">The Mocks at the end walls and beneath the bottom of Murphy\u2019s structure, if they have any insulating effect whatever, which may be doubtful, in view of their placement, certainly do <em>not meet </em>appellant\u2019s insulating structure, and such insulation as is taught by tho other references is solid insulation, without spaces thereiu. Furthermore, we are unable to agree that tho heating' furnaces of Brownlee by means of which the flowing, mol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>ten glass is \u201cpositively heated,\u201d as the specification declares, are equivalents, in a patentable sense, of appellant\u2019s insulated blocks.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">Appellant\u2019s application is the only art before us which shows structure having insulation with spaces therein, and it is our view that the advancement shown over the prior art, disclosed in the combination of references, may properly be held to constitute invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Accordingly, the decision of the Board of Appeals denying patentability over the pri- or art is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
