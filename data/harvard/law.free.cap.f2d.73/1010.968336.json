United States (C. C. A.) 72 F.(2d) 772, decided August 16,1934. The decision in this case is controlled by the cases of United States v. Chambers <em>&amp; </em>Gibson, 291 U. S. 217, 54 S. Ct. 434, 78 L. Ed. 763, 89 A. L. R. 1510; Massey v. United States, 291 U. S. 608, 54 S. Ct. 532, 78 L. Ed. 1019; McClure et al. v. United States (C. C. A.) 70 F.(2d) 519; and the Matoil Case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-9\">Accordingly the decrees forfeiting the 146,157 gallons of alcohol are reversed, with directions to dismiss the libels filed heroin and discharge the alcohol from the custody of the United States District Court and return it, or the proceeds of the sale, if sold, to the claimant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
