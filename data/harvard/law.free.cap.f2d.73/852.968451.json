The judgment of the court below sustained the action of the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-22\">On January 29, 1931, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue asserted against appellant a deficiency in income taxes for the calendar year 192-8 in the sum of $5,807.54. Within sixty days appellant appealed from the Commissioner\u2019s determination to the Board of Tax Appeals, and that appeal has not yet been decided by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-23\">On March 3, 1932, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue asserted against appellant, a resident of Kentucky, a deficiency in income taxes for the calendar year 1929 in the sum of $10,126.37. On May 14, 1932, appellant, under protest, paid that sum, with interest, to the collector of internal revenue in Kentucky, and thereafter brought suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky against the collector for the refund of alleged overpayment of 1929 taxes in the amount of $9,693.23, with interest. Cole v. Helburn, 4 F. Supp. 230. On April 7,1933, the District Court in Kentucky entered judgment in favor of the taxpayer in the sum of $8,269.03, with interest from May 14,1932, until paid, and the court also entered a certificate of probable cause therein. Appeal by the collector from this judgment was dismissed on October 4, 1933, on motion of the collector.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-24\">On April 8, 1933, appellant filed a claim for refund for the amount of the judgment ($8,269.03), interest, and costs. On July 17, 1933, the Commissioner issued a certificate of overassessment for $1,548.66 in partial settlement of the judgment, withholding $6,838.79 in connection with the alleged deficiency for 1928. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b880-25\">Thereupon, on October 3, 1933, appellant instituted the present action' to compel the issuance of a certificate of overassessment for $6,838.79, with interest from May 14, 1932, until paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-26\">Section 322 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1928, c. 852, 45 Stat. 791, 26 USCA \u00a7 2322 (a), relating to refunds and credits, provides: \u201cWhere there has been an overpayment of any tax imposed by this title, the amount of such overpayment shall be credited against any income, war-profits, or excess-profits tax or installments thereof then due from the taxpayer, and any balance shall be refunded immediately to the taxpayer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b881-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>A substantially similar provision in the Revenue Aet of 1926 (see. 284 (a,), 44 Stat. 9, 66, 26 USCA \u00a7 1065 (a) was involved and passed upon by this court in McCarl v. U. S. ex rel. Leland, 59 App. D. C. 362, 42 F.(2d) 346, certiorari denied 282 U. S. 839, 51 S. Ct. 30, 75 L. Ed. 745. In that case the Commissioner of Internal Revenue had notified the taxpayer that a deficiency tax of $60,190.16 was assessed for certain years and that there was an overassessmont of $30,828.43. The taxpayer thereupon appealed from the ruling\u2019 as to the deficiency tax; and in the refund proceeding contended that, because the refund could not be credited to the deficiency assessment until the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals had become final, the deficiency tax was not <em>\u201cthen due\u201d when </em>the Commissioner determined the overassessment, and that therefore the refund should have been made immediately. We ruled that prima facie at the time the Commissioner made the determination the amount of the deficiency assessment was \u201cthen due,\u201d but that owing to the taxpayer\u2019s appeal final balancing of the account could not be had until the determination of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-4\">The ruling in that case was reaffirmed in Lucas v. U. S. ex rel. Blackstone Mfg. Co., 59 App. D. C. 389, 45 F.(2d) 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">On the authority of the two cases to which we have just referred, we affirm <em>the </em>judgment in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
