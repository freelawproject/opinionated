In that complaint, Casale asked the district court to enjoin his former wife, Martha Tillman, from domesticating several Georgia state court contempt orders in Alabama state court because those orders violated the Uniformed Services Former Spouses\u2019 Protection Act (\u201cFSPA\u201d), 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1408. Because the district court correctly found that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1283-13\">Casale and Tillman were divorced in 1991 by decree of the Superior Court of Chatham County, Georgia. At the time of the divorce, Casale was an active-duty warrant officer with the United States Army. The divorce decree awarded Tillman half of Casale\u2019s military retirement pay and noted that Casale \u201cshall not pursue any course of action that would defeat\u201d Tillman\u2019s right to receive her portion of that pay. It also provided that if Casale took a new job that caused \u201ca merger\u201d of his military retirement pay, he would be directly responsible for paying Tillman the same monthly amount she would have otherwise received from his retirement benefits. The decree did not address how the retirement payments to Tillman would be affected if Casale reentered the military.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-14\">Casale eventually retired from active duty and began drawing retirement pay, which he split with Tillman as required by the divorce decree. When Casale returned to active duty in 2002, however, he stopped receiving retirement pay and stopped making the related payments to Tillman. In 2003 Tillman sought and received a Georgia state court order holding Casale in contempt for his failure to make the military retirement and child support payments required by the decree. Between 2003 and 2004 the Georgia state court issued three more contempt orders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1260\">*1260</page-number>for Casale\u2019s continued failure to pay. Ca-sale does not argue that he is, or ever has been, unable to appeal the contempt orders within the Georgia state court system.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1284-4\">At some point after the judgment that resulted from the contempt orders, Casale moved to Alabama. In late 2007, Tillman attempted to domesticate in Alabama the Georgia judgment. Instead of raising his defenses in Alabama state court, Casale filed a lawsuit in district court seeking to enjoin Tillman from pursuing the Alabama action. Casale argued that the FSPA preempted a state court\u2019s ability to compel members of the military to retire, which he asserted was the effect of the Georgia state court\u2019s decision to hold him in contempt for discontinuing retirement payments to his ex-wife. Given that preemption, he argued, the Georgia court judgment violated federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-5\">The district court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to decide Casale\u2019s case because, among other reasons, the <em>Rook-er-Feldman </em>doctrine barred federal court review of state court final judgments \u2014 a function reserved in the federal system for the United States Supreme Court. <em>See D.C. Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 482, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 1315, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983); <em>Rooker v. Fid. Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 415-16, 44 S.Ct. 149, 150, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923). It noted that Ca-sale\u2019s claim was \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the Georgia judgment because that claim was based on his belief that the state court\u2019s ruling was wrong, and it essentially asked the district court to \u201creview and reverse the Georgia court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-6\">Citing our decision in <em>Powell v. Powell, </em>80 F.3d 464 (11th Cir.1996), the district court emphasized that Casale should have raised his preemption arguments during the Georgia proceedings because a state court\u2019s \u201cinterpretation of federal law is no less authoritative than that of the [corresponding] federal court of appeals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 467 (internal quotation marks omitted). That principle of federalism is well settled. Id.; <em>see also Lockhart v. Fretwell, </em>506 U.S. 364, 376, 113 S.Ct. 838, 846, 122 L.Ed.2d 180 (1993) (Thomas, J., concurring); <em>Anders v. Hometown Mortgage Servs., Inc., </em>346 F.3d 1024, 1033 (11th Cir.2003) (\u201cState and federal courts are free to decide federal law issues for themselves (unless and until the United States Supreme Court settles the matter).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s finding that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Dale v. Moore, </em>121 F.3d 624, 626 (11th Cir.1997). The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine makes clear that federal district courts cannot review state court final judgments because that task is reserved for state appellate courts or, as a last resort, the United States Supreme Court. <em>See Feldman, </em>460 U.S. at 482, 103 S.Ct. at 1315. The doctrine applies both to federal claims raised in the state court and to those \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the state court\u2019s judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 482 n. 16, 103 S.Ct. at 1315 n. 16. It does not apply, however, where a party did not have a \u201creasonable opportunity to raise his federal claim in state proceedings.\u201d <em>Powell, </em>80 F.3d at 467 (internal quotation marks omitted). A claim is inextricably intertwined if it would \u201ceffectively nullify\u201d the state court judgment, <em>id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted), or it \u201csucceeds only to the extent that the state court wrongly decided the issues.\u201d <em>Goodman ex rel. Goodman v. Sipos, </em>259 F.3d 1327, 1332 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"ACfq\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1261\">*1261</page-number>While the Supreme Court\u2019s recent <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>decisions have noted the \u201cnarrowness\u201d of the rule, <em>see Lance v. Dennis, </em>546 U.S. 459, 464, 126 S.Ct. 1198, 1201, 163 L.Ed.2d 1059 (2006), they have also confirmed that it continues to apply with full force to \u201ccases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.\u201d <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 284, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 1521-22, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005). Other circuits have recognized an exception to the doctrine where the state court judgment is \u201cvoid <em>ab initio </em>due to the state court\u2019s lack of jurisdiction,\u201d <em>see, e.g., 4901 Corp. v. Town of Cicero, </em>220 F.3d 522, 528 (7th Cir.2000); <em>In re James, </em>940 F.2d 46, 52 (3d Cir.1991), but our circuit has never adopted that exception.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A7SW\">Casale now contends that <em>Exxon </em>and <em>Lance </em>have narrowed the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine to the point where it is inapplicable to his case. He argues that his FSPA claim is not inextricably intertwined with the state court judgment because it challenges only the state court\u2019s jurisdictional authority and not the merits of that decision. Because the FSPA preempts a state court\u2019s ability to \u201ccompel or coerce\u201d military personnel to retire, Ca-sale asserts not that the court decided incorrectly \u2014 as in the typical <em>Rooker-Feld-man </em>situation \u2014 but that the court was wrong to decide at all.</p>\n<p id=\"AQi\">Casale\u2019s arguments fail. We do not agree that the Georgia state court ordered Casale to retire or to forgo his return to active duty. Instead, the state court judgment only required him to get current on the payments identified in the divorce decree. His attempt to characterize an order requiring payment as one directing him to retire from his employment is unpersuasive. Although the divorce decree did not specifically address how Tillman\u2019s payments would be affected if Casale reentered the military, it did address what would happen if Casale became employed again: he would be responsible for making payments to Tillman in the amount she otherwise would have received. Any argument that active-duty pay should be treated differently under the state court decree than pay from civilian jobs \u2014 and thus should cut off retirement payments to Tillman during Casale\u2019s new tour of duty\u2014 was for the state appellate court to decide in a direct attack by Casale on the validity of the contempt orders.</p>\n<p id=\"AyV\">The state court clearly had jurisdiction over Casale and Tillman\u2019s divorce, including the power to create remedies to enforce the decree. If Casale believed the state court\u2019s result was based on a legal error, the proper response was the same one open to all litigants who are unhappy with the judgment of a trial court: direct appeal. We are not a clearinghouse for Casale\u2019s overstock arguments; if he did not offer them to the state courts \u2014 or if the state courts did not buy them \u2014 he cannot unload them by attempting to sell them to us. Casale is just the sort of \u201cstate-court loser[ ]\u201d the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine was designed to turn aside. <em>See Exxon, </em>544 U.S. at 284, 125 S.Ct. at 1521\u201422. The district court\u2019s grant of Tillman\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1283-10\">. The district court noted two other reasons it could not consider Casale's complaint: because Casale's claim did not arise under federal law as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 and because the Anti-Injunction Act prohibits federal courts from enjoining state court actions unless one of three narrow exceptions, not applicable in his case, applies. Due to our <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>holding, we need not address Casale\u2019s arguments on these issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1284-7\">. In fact, Tillman claims that Casale actually has appealed \u2014 all the way to the Georgia Supreme Court. <em>See Casale v. Tillman, </em>No. 1:07-cv-774-WKW, at 2, 2008 WL 2782740 (M.D.Ala. July 15, 2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"A0K\">. Because, as we will explain, the state court had jurisdiction to issue its judgment, we have no occasion to decide whether there should be an exception where jurisdiction is lacking.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
