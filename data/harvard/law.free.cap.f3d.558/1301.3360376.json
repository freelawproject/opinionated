Leib argues that the HCPTC violated his due process and equal protection rights, and that the Commission\u2019s rules are unconstitutionally vague and im-permissibly burden interstate commerce. The district court dismissed Leib\u2019s complaint under Rule 12(b)(6). After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-12\">Leib owns and operates TB Limo.com, a limousine service in the Tampa Bay area. Seeking to offer customers an \u201cenvironmentally-friendly\u201d alternative to traditional limousines, Leib bought a Prius. In order to operate the Prius as a limousine within Hillsborough County, Leib had to obtain a permit from the HCPTC, the administrative agency charged by the Florida State Legislature with regulating the operation of public vehicles on Hillsborough County\u2019s public highways. Act of May 25, 2001, Ch.2001-299, \u00a7 2(1). The Commission denied Leib\u2019s request on the ground that the Prius did not qualify as a \u201cluxury\u201d vehicle, and thus did not meet the definition of \u201climousine\u201d in HCPTC Taxi Rule 1.15, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1328-13\">\u201cLimousine\u201d means any motor vehicle for hire not equipped with a taximeter, with the capacity for 15 passengers or less, including the driver. This definition consists of vehicles which are recognized by the industry as \u201cluxury\u201d vehicles, that are considered as high-end luxury vehicles by the manufacturer and vehicles that have been uniquely modified so as to provide \u201cluxury\u201d limousine service. The \u201cluxury\u201d quality of vehicles will be determined by assessing aesthetics of the interior and exterior of the vehicle, amenities provided to the passenger, spaciousness and comparison to current industry standards for vehicles performing limousine service in Hills-borough County.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1328-14\">Leib subsequently applied for a waiver of Rule 1.15\u2019s \u201cluxury\u201d requirement. At an August 2007 meeting, however, the HCPTC considered the request and denied it. The Commission based its decision on HCPTC Taxi Rule 15.5, which explains the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1305\">*1305</page-number>circumstances under which waivers and variances are to be granted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1329-4\">Variances and waivers shall be granted when the person subject to the rule demonstrates that the purpose of the underlying statute will be or has been achieved by other means by the person and when application of a rule would create a substantial hardship or would violate principles of fairness. For purposes of this section, \u201csubstantial hardship\u201d means a demonstrated economic, technological, legal, or other type of hardship to the person requesting the variance or waiver. For purposes of this section, \u201cprinciples of fairness\u201d are violated when the literal application of a Rule affects a particular person in a manner significantly different from the way i[t] affects other similarly situated persons who are subject to the Rule.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1329-5\">After his waiver request was denied, Leib filed the instant suit seeking an injunction allowing him to use his Prius as a limousine. The complaint alleges that the Commission violated his right to earn a living under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments (Count I), and his right to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment (Count II). In addition, the complaint alleges that the Commission violated Leib\u2019s right to due process by arbitrarily and capriciously denying his request to use the Prius as a limousine (Count III), by exercising its police power unlawfully (Count IV), and by granting \u201cunbridled discretion\u201d to administrative officials (Count VI). Finally, Leib\u2019s suit alleges that the Commission\u2019s rules are unconstitutionally vague (Count V), and that they place an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce (Count VII).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Each count asserts both a facial and an as-applied challenge to the Commission\u2019s rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, accepting the allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Mills v. Foremost Ins. Co., </em>511 F.3d 1300, 1303 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-11\">We first reject Leib\u2019s argument that the district court erred in dismissing his equal protection claim in Count II.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Equal Protection Clause requires the government to treat similarly situated persons in a similar manner. <em>Gary v. City of Warner Robins, Ga., </em>311 F.3d 1334, 1337 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1306\">*1306</page-number>(11th Cir.2002). \u201cWhen legislation classifies persons in such a way that they receive different treatment under the law, the degree of scrutiny the court applies depends upon the basis for the classification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If a law treats individuals differently on the basis of race or another suspect classification, or if the law impinges on a fundamental right, it is subject to strict scrutiny. <em>Eide v. Sarasota County, </em>908 F.2d 716, 722 (11th Cir.1990). Otherwise, the law need only have a rational basis \u2014 i.e., it need only be rationally related to a legitimate government purpose. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1330-4\">Because Leib makes no allegation that he belongs to a suspect class or that the HCPTC\u2019s rules violate a fundamental right,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> his equal protection claim is subject only to rational basis review. The rational basis test asks (1) whether the government has the power or authority to regulate the particular area in question, and (2) whether there is a rational relationship between the government\u2019s objective and the means it has chosen to achieve it. <em>Cash Inn of Dade, Inc. v. Metro. Dade County, </em>938 F.2d 1239, 1241 (11th Cir.1991). This standard is easily met. As the Supreme Court has held, under rational basis review, a state \u201chas no obligation to produce evidence to sustain the rationality of a statutory classification.\u201d <em>Heller v. Doe by </em>Doe,509 U.S. 312, 320, 113 S.Ct. 2637, 125 L.Ed.2d 257 (1993). Rather, a statute is presumed constitutional, and the burden is on the one attacking the law to negate every conceivable basis that might support it, even if that basis has no foundation in the record. <em>Id. </em>Under rational basis review, a court must accept a legislature\u2019s generalizations even when there is an imperfect fit between means and ends. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1330-7\">Rule 1.15 easily survives rational basis review. Because Leib does not contest the government\u2019s power to regulate public transportation, we need consider only whether the Rule, and in particular its \u201cluxury\u201d requirement, has any rational basis. We agree with the district court that a multitude of rational bases might be adduced in support of the requirement. Thus, for example, without the requirement, any old jalopy might be passed off as a limousine. The luxury requirement is rationally related to preventing such misrepresentations and confusion. Leib contends that the district court erred by failing to accept the allegations in his complaint as true, but this is simply incorrect. Quite to the contrary, the court concluded that, even assuming that all of his allegations were true, Leib was unable to show that Rule 1.15 and its luxury requirement lacked a rational basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-8\">We also reject the \u201cclass of one\u201d equal protection argument asserted in Count II alongside Leib\u2019s traditional equal protection claim. A \u201cclass of one\u201d equal protection claim does not allege discrimination against a protected class, but rather asserts that the plaintiff \u201chas been intentionally treated differently from others similarly situated and that there is no rational basis for the difference in treatment.\u201d <em>Young Apartments, Inc. v. Town </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1307\">*1307</page-number><em>of Jupiter, Fla., </em>529 F.3d 1027, 1032 n. 1 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Griffin Indus. v. Irvin, </em>496 F.3d 1189, 1202 (11th Cir.2007)). To prove a \u201cclass of one\u201d claim, the plaintiff must show (1) that he was treated differently from other similarly situated individuals, and (2) that the defendant unequally applied a facially neutral ordinance for the purpose of discriminating against him. <em>Id. </em>at 1045. Leib\u2019s \u201cclass of one claim\u201d fails to meet either requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-4\">With respect to the first prong, we have frequently noted that the \u201csimilarly situated\u201d requirement must be rigorously applied in the context of \u201cclass of one\u201d claims. <em>See, e.g., Douglas Asphalt Co. v. Qore, Inc., </em>541 F.3d 1269, 1275 (11th Cir.2008); <em>Griffin, </em>496 F.3d at 1207. Employing \u201c[t]oo broad a definition of \u2018similarly situated\u2019 could subject nearly all state regulatory decisions to constitutional review in federal court and deny state regulators the critical discretion they need to effectively perform their duties.\u201d <em>Griffin, </em>496 F.3d at 1203. Indeed, even in run-of-the-mill discrimination cases, we have emphasized that plaintiffs are not permitted simply to \u201crely on broad generalities in identifying a comparator.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1204.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-5\">Furthermore, we have observed that where the challenged governmental decision is simple or one-dimensional \u2014 for example, where the decision involves the application of a single criterion to a single issue \u2014 making out a \u201cclass of one claim\u201d is generally easier than in cases where governmental action is \u201cmulti-dimensional, involving varied decisionmaking criteria applied in a series of discretionary decisions made over an extended period of time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1203; <em>cf. Engquist v. Oregon Dep\u2019t of Agric., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2146, 2153, 170 L.Ed.2d 975 (2008) (noting the difficulty of establishing \u201cclass of one\u201d equal protection claims where discretionary authority is exercised \u201cbased on subjective, individualized determinations\u201d). The decisions at issue in this case are of the latter variety because the Commission\u2019s determinations concerning Rule 1.15\u2019s \u201cluxury\u201d requirement involve the discretionary application of a variegated set of factors (e.g., aesthetic considerations, comparison with industry standards). In short, establishing a \u201cclass of one\u201d equal protection claim can be an onerous task, and properly setting forth a \u201cclass of one\u201d claim should not be regarded as a perfunctory matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-9\">Leib\u2019s \u201cclass of one\u201d claim undeniably falls far short of the mark. Indeed, his complaint makes only the barest concluso-ry assertion that the HCPTC\u2019s rules \u201cunreasonably required the Plaintiff to submit to controls not imposed on other similarly situated businesses or properties.\u201d Given the complaint\u2019s complete lack of factual detail regarding the \u201csimilarly situated\u201d requirement, Leib\u2019s \u201cclass of one\u201d claim was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-11\">Leib\u2019s substantive due process claims fare no better than his equal protection claims. Indeed, because they are so poorly developed, the substantive due process claims fare worse. In Count III, for example, Leib asserts that the Commission\u2019s rules and decisions were \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d Although Leib appears to regard this as a straightforward substantive due process claim, the precise basis for the \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d cause of action is uncertain. In advancing the claim, he cites only our decision in <em>Eide v. Sarasota County, </em>908 F.2d 716 (11th Cir.1990). While <em>Eide </em>indeed recognized an \u201carbitrary and capricious due process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1308\">*1308</page-number>claim\u201d as one of several closely related substantive due process claims, the dispute at issue in that case involved a zoning ordinance. We specifically \u201cconsidered] only the standards that would be applied to a claim which involves a grievance similar to Eide\u2019s,\u201d and we expressly refrained from offering any \u201copinion as to what the standards would be for other types of claims such as physical taking and procedural due process claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 720 n. 6. Leib\u2019s failure to articulate the basis of his arbitrary and capricious due process claim is a sufficient ground for its dismissal. <em>See, e.g., Tyler v. Runyon, </em>70 F.3d 458, 465 (7th Cir.1995) (\u201c[I]f an appellant fails to make a minimally complete and comprehensible argument for each of his claims, he loses regardless of the merits of those claims as they might have appeared on a fuller presentation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-4\">Even putting aside its uncertain doctrinal basis, Leib\u2019s arbitrary and capricious due process claim fails. Like equal protection claims, substantive due process claims are subject to rational basis review, so long as they do not infringe fundamental rights and are not discriminatory. <em>In re Wood, </em>866 F.2d 1367, 1371 (11th Cir.1989) (\u201cThe standard for evaluating substantive due process challenges to social and economic legislation is virtually identical to the \u2018rational relationship\u2019 test for evaluating equal protection claims.\u201d). Since the Commission\u2019s rules survived rational basis review for purposes of Leib\u2019s equal protection claim, it follows <em>a fortiori </em>that the rules survive rational basis review here as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-5\">Against this, Leib again contends that the district court dismissed his arbitrary and capricious claim because it failed to accept the allegations in his complaint as true. Specifically, he claims that the complaint\u2019s \u201callegations of his vehicle\u2019s safety, the fact that the Prius can operate on the highways of Hillsborough County under the \u2018taxicab\u2019 label, and the emergence of the Prius as a limousine in major metropolitan areas, assuming such allegations are accepted as true, show that the challenged regulations are not substantially related to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare.\u201d But the test is not whether the luxury Rule is <em>substantially </em>related to health, safety, or the general welfare; it is whether the Rule is <em>rationally </em>related to a legitimate governmental purpose. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, as explained above, Leib is simply incorrect in asserting that the district court failed to accept his allegations as true.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-8\">The foregoing line of analysis also applies to Leib\u2019s police power claim in Count IV. Leib argues that the Commission unlawfully exercised its police power by adding the \u201cluxury\u201d requirement to the definition of \u201climousine\u201d in Rule 1.15. It is true that the definition of \u201climousine\u201d in the HCPTC\u2019s enabling act does not include a luxury requirement. Act of May 25, 2001, Ch. 2001-299, \u00a7 3(17) (defining \u201climousine\u201d as \u201cany motor vehicle for hire not equipped with a taximeter, with a capacity for 15 passengers or less, including the driver\u201d). But this hardly suggests that the requirement is contrary to the legislature\u2019s intent. Rather, in creating the Commission, the legislature gave it the authority to \u201c[r]egulate and supervise the operation of public vehicles upon the public highways and in all other matters affecting the relationship between such operation and the traveling public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5(l)(a). In adding the luxury requirement to the definition of \u201climousine,\u201d the HCPTC was doing precisely what it was created to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1309\">*1309</page-number>Leib further contends that the luxury requirement fails rational basis review, arguing that luxury vehicles are no safer than non-luxury vehicles, and that, as a result, there is no rational relationship between the luxury requirement and public safety. But the Commission need not show that luxury vehicles are <em>always </em>safer than other vehicles; it need only show a rational relationship between luxury and safety (say, on the theory that luxury vehicles are generally larger and that larger vehicles are generally safer). The Rule survives rational basis review even if it \u201cseems unwise ... or if the rationale for it seems tenuous.\u201d <em>Romer v. Evans, </em>517 U.S. 620, 632, 116 S.Ct. 1620, 134 L.Ed.2d 855 (1996). More importantly, there is no need to show that the Rule specifically promotes <em>safety, </em>so long as it promotes the general welfare or some other legitimate governmental aim. We are therefore unpersuaded by Leib\u2019s police power claim and conclude that the district court was correct to dismiss it as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-5\">We are also unpersuaded by Leib\u2019s claim in Count VI that Rule 15.5 gives the Commission \u201cunbridled discretion\u201d in the enforcement of its rules. As noted above, Rule 15.5 provides that \u201c[vjariances and waivers shall be granted when the person subject to the rule demonstrates that the purpose of the underlying statute will be or has been achieved by other means,\u201d or \u201cwhen application of a rule would create a substantial hardship or would violate principles of fairness.\u201d Leib argues that \u201cthe purpose of the underlying statute\u201d is too nebulous a standard to provide any guidance in ruling upon waiver requests, and that the Rule therefore gives the Commission unbridled discretion in making decisions. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-6\">As an initial matter, we note once again that Leib fails to articulate the precise nature of this claim or to indicate the way in which it differs from other claims asserted in the complaint. <em>Cf. Lindquist v. City of Pasadena, Tex., </em>525 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.2008) (although asserted independently, plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cunbridled discretion\u201d claim was not distinct from their equal protection and due process claims). In particular, it is difficult to distinguish Leib\u2019s \u201cunbridled discretion\u201d claim from his void-for-vagueness claim. Leib\u2019s chief argument in support of the unbridled discretion claim is that the \u201cpurpose of the underlying statute\u201d standard is too nebulous for people of ordinary intelligence to comply with \u2014 which, as is discussed more fully in the next section, is the gravamen of a void-for-vagueness claim. Yet Leib separately advances a void-for-vagueness claim in Count V the complaint. In short, as with his arbitrary-and-capricious due process claim, Leib has not asserted his \u201cunbridled discretion\u201d claim clearly enough to permit our review. <em>See, e.g., Tyler, </em>70 F.3d at 465.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-7\">Yet even on the merits, Leib\u2019s unbridled discretion claim is unpersuasive. His argument in support of the claim rests almost entirely on <em>VFW John O\u2019Connor Post # 4833 v. Santa Rosa County, Fla., </em>506 F.Supp.2d 1079 (N.D.Fla.2007). There, a zoning ordinance provided that a requirement could be waived \u201cupon a proper showing,\u201d but gave no further guidance as to what might count as such a showing. The district court held that the \u201cproper showing\u201d standard was void for vagueness because it was not \u201cset out in terms that the ordinary person exercising ordinary common sense can sufficiently understand and comply with.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1092 (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-9\">Leib argues that Rule 15.5\u2019s \u201cpurpose of the underlying statute\u201d waiver standard is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1310\">*1310</page-number>no more definite than the \u201cproper showing\u201d waiver standard of the local zoning ordinance examined in <em>VFW John O\u2019Con-nor. </em>We disagree. The \u201cunderlying statute\u201d to which Rule 15.5 alludes \u2014 the enabling act under which the HCPTC was created \u2014 gives substance to the \u201cpurpose of the underlying statute\u201d standard. At the most general level, for example, the statute makes clear that the Commission was established to ensure the orderly and efficient \u201coperation of public vehicles upon the public highways of Hillsborough County and its municipalities.\u201d <em>See </em>Act of May 25, 2001, Ch. 2001-299, \u00a7 2(1). Plainly, granting waivers will be consistent with the orderly regulation of public vehicles in some circumstances but not in others. In this case, for example, granting Leib a dispensation from Rule 1.15\u2019s requirements might well undermine orderly and efficient regulation because the Prius simply does not have the features necessary to qualify as a limousine. If Leib were granted a waiver, it is unclear why a waiver should not be given for virtually any other vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-4\">Moreover, Leib ignores the fact that the \u201cpurpose of the underlying statute\u201d is only one of the criteria mentioned in Rule 15.5. The Rule goes on to say that a waiver may be granted when application of a rule would \u201ccreate a substantial hardship\u201d or would \u201cviolate principles of fairness.\u201d Notably, Leib does not contest the definiteness of either of the latter standards. Indeed, the Rule goes on to define \u201csubstantial hardship\u201d as \u201ca demonstrated economic, technological, legal, or other type of hardship to the person requesting the variance or waiver,\u201d and to explain that \u201cprinciples of fairness\u201d are violated \u201cwhen the literal application of a Rule affects a particular person in a manner significantly different from the way i[t] affects other similarly situated persons who are subject to the Rule.\u201d Even assuming that the \u201cpurpose of the underlying statute\u201d criterion left the Commission with potentially too much discretion when considered in isolation, the Commission\u2019s discretion cannot be considered unbridled in light of the additional limits imposed by the \u201csubstantial hardship\u201d and \u201cprinciples of fairness\u201d standards. Hence, the district court was correct in dismissing Leib\u2019s \u201cunbridled discretion\u201d claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-6\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-7\">For largely the same reasons, we reject Leib\u2019s suggestion in Count V that the term \u201cluxury\u201d in Rule 1.15 is unconstitutionally vague. To overcome a vagueness challenge, statutes must \u201cgive the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly,\u201d and \u201cmust provide explicit standards for those who apply them.\u201d <em>Grayned v. City of Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 108, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972). The Supreme Court has explained that the \u201cdegree of vagueness that the Constitution tolerates ... depends in part on the nature of the enactment.\u201d <em>Vill. of Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., </em>455 U.S. 489, 498, 102 S.Ct. 1186, 71 L.Ed.2d 362 (1982). In particular, the Court has \u201cexpressed greater tolerance of enactments with civil rather than criminal penalties because the consequences of imprecision are qualitatively less severe.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 498-99, 102 S.Ct. 1186. Indeed, a civil statute is unconstitutionally vague only if it is so indefinite as \u201creally to be no rule or standard at all.\u201d <em>Seniors Civil Liberties Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Kemp, </em>965 F.2d 1030, 1036 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-8\">Rule 1.15 is not unconstitutionally vague. Consumers and travelers have a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1311\">*1311</page-number>common-sense understanding of what counts as a \u201climousine\u201d and what counts as a \u201cluxury\u201d vehicle. Rule 1.15 gives these concepts even further content and meaning by specifying additional criteria \u2014 the vehicle\u2019s interior and exterior aesthetics, its spaciousness, the amenities it provides to passengers, its comparison to current industry standards \u2014 in terms of which \u201cluxury\u201d is to be judged. True, there is an inherent degree of imprecision in making \u201caesthetic\u201d judgments. But \u201cthe Constitution does not require precision; all that is required is that the language conveys sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding.\u201d <em>This That and Other Gift &amp; Tobacco, Inc. v. Cobb County, Ga., </em>285 F.3d 1319, 1325 (11th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Commission\u2019s definition of \u201cluxury\u201d easily meets this standard. Accordingly, the district court properly dismissed Leib\u2019s void-for-vagueness claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-4\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-5\">Lastly, we reject Leib\u2019s contention in Count VII that the HCPTC\u2019s rules impose an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce. The Constitution\u2019s Commerce Clause gives Congress the power to regulate commerce among the states. U.S. Const, art. 1, \u00a7 8, cl. 3. Correlatively, \u201cthe Commerce Clause also forbids a state or municipality from impeding the flow of goods and services across state borders, or from favoring in-state economic interests at the expense of out-of-state economic interests.\u201d <em>S. Waste Sys., LLC. v. City of Delray Beach, Fla., </em>420 F.3d 1288, 1290 (11th Cir.2005). Since prearranged public transportation services constitute a form of interstate commerce, the HCPTC\u2019s regulations would be unconstitutional if they somehow burdened interstate commerce. <em>Nat\u2019l Solid Wastes Mgmt. Ass\u2019n v. Alabama Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Mgmt., </em>910 F.2d 713, 719-20 (11th Cir.1990). The first step in assessing violations of the Commerce Clause is to consider whether the law or regulation in question represents an overt form of protectionism, in which case the measure is generally invalid per se. <em>City of Philadelphia v. New Jersey, </em>437 U.S. 617, 624, 98 S.Ct. 2531, 57 L.Ed.2d 475 (1978). However, where a statute or rule \u201cregulates even-handedly to effectuate a legitimate local public interest, and its effects on interstate commerce are only incidental, it will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.\u201d <em>Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., </em>397 U.S. 137, 142, 90 S.Ct. 844, 25 L.Ed.2d 174 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-7\">HCPTC Rule 1.15 is not an overtly protectionist measure. On its face, the Rule purports merely to regulate travel in the Tampa Bay area. We doubt whether the Commission\u2019s rules place <em>any </em>special burden on interstate commerce at all. Leib emphasizes that under the rule <em>\u201call </em>passengers (including those engaged in interstate commerce) are <em>prohibited </em>from utilizing the economical and environmentally-friendly transportation services offered by Leib\u2019s Toyota Prius, thereby constituting an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce.\u201d But this suggests that Rule 1.15 burdens in-state and out-of-state commerce equally. Indeed, as the Commission points out, the Rule has not been challenged by an out-of-state business. Rather, Leib purports to challenge the Rule from within the state that is the supposed beneficiary of the putative burden on interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-8\">Moreover, Leib\u2019s argument rests on a factual mistake: he argues that \u201cenviron<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1312\">*1312</page-number>mentally-friendly passengers that desire to utilize ecologically superior transportation are left with no alternative options whatsoever as a result of the HCPTC\u2019s complete prohibition of eco-friendly vehicles for use as limousines.\u201d This is simply false: an environmentally-friendly vehicle may qualify as a limousine so long as it meets Rule 1.15\u2019s luxury and other requirements. Accordingly, Leib\u2019s interstate commerce claim was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-4\">In sum, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed Leib\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1329-6\">. The HCPTC made changes to certain of its rules that became effective on January 2, 2009. Minor changes were made to Rule 15.5\u2019s text but none of these is important for purposes of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1329-7\">. In addition to the claims arising under \u00a7 1983, the complaint asserts a claim under Florida\u2019s Administrative Procedure Act, Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 120.68. Having dismissed all of Leib\u2019s federal claims, the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over his state law claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367. Because we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Leib's federal claims, we also find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s decision not to retain jurisdiction over the state law claim. <em>See, e.g., Parker v. Scrap Metal Processors, Inc., </em>468 F.3d 733, 738 (11th Cir.2006) (district court\u2019s decision not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims is reviewed for abuse of discretion).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1329-13\">.We begin with Count II of the complaint because Leib\u2019s appeal makes no mention of Count I (which alleged a violation of his right to earn a living under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments) and we accordingly deem Count I to have been waived. <em>Access Now, Inc. v. Southwest Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2004) (legal claims not briefed before the court are deemed abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1330-5\">. As noted previously, while Leib's complaint alleges a violation of his right to earn a living, he has abandoned that claim on appeal. The claim would have failed in any event given our holding that employment rights do \u201cnot enjoy substantive due process protection\u201d because such \"rights are state-created ..., not 'fundamental' rights created by the Constitution.\u201d <em>McKinney </em>v. <em>Pate, </em>20 F.3d 1550, 1560 (11th Cir.1994). Nor does Leib claim that any of the other rights invoked in his complaint are fundamental. On the contrary, all of his arguments on appeal presuppose that his claims are subject only to rational basis review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
