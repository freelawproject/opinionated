In his first appeal, we vacated his original sentence of 110 months\u2019 imprisonment upon holding that it was procedurally unreasonable because the district court based it on an impermissible factor \u2014 its disagreement with how the Guidelines\u2019 career offender provision, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, applied. <em>United States v. Vazquez, </em>240 F. App\u2019x 318 (11th Cir.2007) (unpublished). In this appeal, Vazquez argues that his new sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court refused to consider this factor on remand, which, he says, it now may do under recent Supreme Court case law. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-16\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether a defendant effectively waived his right to appeal. <em>United States v. Bushert, </em>997 F.2d 1343, 1352 (11th Cir.1993). We review the sentence imposed by a district court for \u201creasonableness,\u201d which \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)). In reviewing sentences for reasonableness, we perform two steps. <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190. First, we must \u201c 'ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> selecting a sentence based on clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1227\">*1227</page-number>erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence\u2014including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). If we conclude that the district court did not procedurally err, we must consider the \u201c \u2018substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard,\u2019 \u201d based on the \u201c \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597).</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-6\">As an initial matter, we agree with Vazquez that he may proceed with this appeal, despite the sentence appeal waiver included in his plea agreement. Waivers of appeal rights are effective if they were knowingly and voluntarily made. <em>Bushert, </em>997 F.2d at 1351. The waiver can include the waiver of the right to appeal \u201cdifficult or debatable legal issues or even blatant error.\u201d <em>United States v. Frye, </em>402 F.3d 1123, 1129 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted). If a waiver was not effective, the proper remedy is for it to be severed from the agreement. <em>See Bushert, </em>997 F.2d at 1353. \u201cPlea agreements are interpreted and applied in a manner that is sometimes likened to contractual interpretation,\u201d but this analogy is not perfect. <em>United States v. Jefferies, </em>908 F.2d 1520, 1523 (11th Cir.1990). We do not accept a \u201crigidly literal approach\u201d or a \u201chyper-technical reading of the written agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Also, \u201cthe written agreement should be viewed against the background of the negotiations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Finally, ambiguities are construed against the government. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1251-7\">Vazquez\u2019s waiver, providing that if the government appealed \u201cthe sentence imposed,\u201d then Vazquez would be \u201creleased from the waiver\u201d and could appeal \u201cthe sentence,\u201d was ambiguous. Because the government appealed Vazquez\u2019s original sentence, it is arguable that the exception to the sentence appeal waiver was triggered, thereby allowing him to appeal his new sentence. On the other hand, it is also arguable that Vazquez may appeal only the particular sentence that the government has appealed. In light of this ambiguity, we construe the provision in Vazquez\u2019s favor, and conclude that this appeal may proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-12\">Turning to the merits, Vazquez essentially argues that his new sentence is procedurally unreasonable, <em>see Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 575-76, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007) (analyzing the district court\u2019s consideration of relevant factors and finding that the court committed no procedural error), because the district court refused to consider its disagreement with U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, the Guideline provision that increases penalties for career offenders, in imposing his sentence. We are unpersuaded. We previously addressed this very issue in <em>United States v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353 (11th Cir.2006), where the district court had based its decision, in part, on its disagreement with Section 4B1.1. In reaching our decision, we noted that Section 4B1.1 encapsulates the congressional policy articulated in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(h) that \u201crepeat drug offenders receive sentences \u2018at or near\u2019 the enhanced statutory m\u00e1ximums set out in \u00a7 841(b),\u201d and that by disregarding Section 4B1.1, the district court imper-missibly \u201cignored Congress\u2019s policy of targeting recidivist drug offenders for more severe punishment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1370. Because the district court ignored this con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1228\">*1228</page-number>gressional policy, among other things, we ultimately vacated Williams\u2019 sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Applying <em>Williams </em>here, then, the district court properly refused to consider its disagreement with the Guidelines\u2019 treatment of career offenders when it imposed its sentence on Vazquez, a repeat drug offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-3\">Vazquez now claims that <em>Williams </em>is no longer binding precedent following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Kim-brough. </em>\u201cUnder our prior panel precedent rule, a later panel may depart from an earlier panel\u2019s decision only when the intervening Supreme Court decision is clearly on point.\u201d <em>Atlantic Sounding Co. v. Townsend, </em>496 F.3d 1282, 1284 (11th Cir.2007) (quotations omitted). Because <em>Kim-brough </em>is not \u201cclearly on point,\u201d and rather, supports the reasoning we employed in <em>Williams, </em>Vazquez\u2019s argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-4\">In <em>Kimbrough, </em>the Supreme Court held that a sentencing court may consider the Guidelines\u2019 disparate treatment of crack and powder cocaine offenses as part of its consideration of \u00a7 3553(a)(6), the need to avoid sentencing disparities. <em>United States v. Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d 1235, 1238 (11th Cir.2008). The Supreme Court based its decision in part on its conclusion that Congress did not explicitly direct the Sentencing Commission to adopt Guidelines that punish crack and powder cocaine offenses according to a particular ratio. <em>Kimbrough, </em>128 S.Ct. at 570-73. In contrast, the Court noted that \u201cCongress has specifically required the Sentencing Commission to set Guidelines sentences for serious recidivist offenders \u2018at or near\u2019 the statutory maximum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 571 (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(h)). It then concluded that (1) the cocaine Guidelines, \u201clike all other Guidelines, are advisory only\u201d; (2) \u201cthe Court of Appeals erred in holding the crack/powder disparity effectively mandatory\u201d; and (3) district courts may consider the disparity when determining whether a within-range sentence is \u201cgreater than necessary\u201d to serve the objectives of sentencing. <em>Id. </em>at 564.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-7\">As this discussion reveals, <em>Kimbrough </em>does not gut our analysis in <em>Williams. </em>To the contrary, the Supreme Court expressly made a distinction between the Guidelines\u2019 disparate treatment of crack and powder cocaine offenses\u2014where Congress did <em>not </em>direct the Sentencing Commission to create this disparity\u2014and the Guideline\u2019s punishment of career offenders\u2014which was explicitly directed by Congress. Because <em>Kimbrough </em>highlights this distinction, it cannot be read to create a conflict with our <em>Williams </em>decision, nor to suggest that district courts may base their sentencing decisions on any disagreement they may have with the policy behind the career offender guidelines, which are directly driven by congressional pronouncement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-8\">Several of our sister circuits have reached similar conclusions. In these cases, the courts were confronted with defendants that were sentenced as career offenders under Section 4B1.1, though the underlying convictions involved crack cocaine. <em>See United States v. Harris, </em>536 F.3d 798, 812 (7th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Clay, </em>524 F.3d 877, 878-79 (8th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Jimenez, </em>512 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.2007). Yet even in these cases, the courts rejected the defendants\u2019 claims that their sentences were invalid in light of <em>Kimbrough. </em>In <em>Harris, </em>for example, the Seventh Circuit clarified that \u201ca sentence entered under the career offender guideline, \u00a7 4B1.1, raises no <em>Kimbrough </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1229\">*1229</page-number>problem because to the extent it treats crack cocaine differently from powder cocaine, the disparity arises from a statute, not from the advisory guidelines.\u201d 536 F.3d at 813; <em>see also Clay, </em>524 F.3d at 878-79 (\u201cAlthough the recent amendments to the sentencing guidelines lowered the offense levels associated with crack in the drug quantity table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, they did not change the career offender provision in \u00a7 4B1.1....\u201d); <em>Jimenez, 512 </em>F.3d at 9 (\u201cthe decision in Kimbrough\u2014 though doubtless important for some cases \u2014 is of only academic interest [in a case arising under the career offender guideline]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-5\">Indeed, since the Supreme Court issued <em>Kimbrough, </em>we have held that it did not overrule our prior precedent prohibiting courts from considering sentence disparities caused by \u201cfast-track\u201d programs which only some districts employ to provide lesser sentences to alien defendants who agree to quick guilty pleas and uncontested removals. Vega<em>-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d at 1238-39. We explained that <em>Kimbrough </em>addressed a district court\u2019s discretion to vary from the Guidelines \u201cbased on a disagreement with <em>Guideline, </em>not Congressional, policy,\u201d and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1253-6\">[T]he most that could possibly be argued is that <em>Kimbrough </em>overruled the following: prior precedents holding that a district court cannot vary from the advisory Guidelines based on a disagreement with a Guideline, even where Sentencing Commission policy judgment, not Congressional direction, underlies the Guideline at issue, and even where that policy judgment did not arise from the Commission\u2019s exercise of its characteristic institutional role.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1253-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 1239 (emphasis in original, quotations omitted); <em>see also United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 563 (5th Cir.2008) (\u201c[A]ny sentencing disparity resulting from fast track disposition programs is not unwarranted as the disparity was also intended by Congress.... [This] holding[] that a district court may not vary from the Guidelines on the basis of sentencing disparity intended by Congress w[as] not called into question by <em>Rita </em>or Kimbrough.\u201d). In other words, because the fast-track disparity was expressly driven by Congress, a district court may not \u25a0 consider its disagreement with this policy in making its sentencing decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-9\">The same result is warranted here. As the district court aptly recognized, the Guideline at issue in Vazquez\u2019s sentence, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 \u2014 which was the result of \u201cdirect congressional expression\u201d \u2014 is distinguishable from Kimbrough\u2019s crack cocaine Guidelines, which were the result of implied congressional policy. The district court therefore did not procedurally err when it declined to mitigate Vazquez\u2019s sentence due to its concern over the application of the career offender provision. Moreover, since the district court imposed a below-range sentence, it clearly understood its discretion to apply the Guidelines in an advisory manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-10\">Accordingly, we affirm Vazquez\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1250-13\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training or medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1227\">*1227</page-number>care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1252-5\">.
