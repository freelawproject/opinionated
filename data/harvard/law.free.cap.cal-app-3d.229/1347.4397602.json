(Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 451, subd. (b), 187; all further undesignated section references are to the Penal Code.) The jury found the alleged special circumstance of multiple murders to be true (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(3)) and that defendant used a deadly weapon (a knife) to commit the killings (\u00a7 12022, subd. (b)). This same jury found defendant sane during the commission of the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-8\">The prosecution did not seek the death penalty. Sentenced to three consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole, defendant appeals asserting (1) the evidence is insufficient to support the convictions and sanity findings, (2) the prosecutor committed misconduct, and (3) the trial court erred (a) in refusing to give voluntary manslaughter instructions, an instruction distinguishing guilty and innocent motive, a particular insanity instruction, and an instruction on uncontradicted expert testimony; and (b) in denying defendant\u2019s motions for exclusion of extrajudicial statements and certain prejudicial evidence, for new trials, and for a different jury at the sanity phase. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-9\">The nature of the crimes, jury findings, and contentions made on appeal requires an extensive recitation of pertinent facts. We first examine the guilt phase of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-10\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-11\">Shortly before noon on April 5, 1987, the Sacramento Fire Department responded to a fire at defendant\u2019s apartment located within a public housing complex. Firefighter Robert Johnson entered the burning premises and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1423\">*1423</page-number>found defendant\u2019s three children\u2014Dianeka H. (eight months), Tashima T. (four years), and Jacoby T. (six years)\u2014on a bed in the upstairs bedroom. All three had been stabbed. There were no vital signs on the two youngest and medical intervention failed to resuscitate the third. A butcher knife was found on the bed and bloody water was found in the upstairs bathtub.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-5\">A resident of the complex, Susan Brown, saw defendant in flames run out the back door of her apartment. While another resident doused the flames, Brown heard defendant say, \u201c[H]e made me kill \u2019em. They made me\u201d and \u201c[T]hey killed my family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-6\">After Firefighter Johnson removed the children, fire apparatus operator Paul Steinkamp was directed to defendant by the crowd which had gathered. When defendant indicated she was the mother, Steinkamp asked her what happened. She told him she had stabbed her kids and set her apartment on fire. Steinkamp thought defendant also said, \u201c \u2018He made me do it.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-7\">According to Johnson, while defendant was being attended to by ambulance personnel, she rocked ceaselessly and repeated words like \u201c T wish I were dead\u2019 \u201d or \u201c T want to be dead\u2019 \u201d to no one in particular.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-8\">The fire was determined to have been intentionally set; splash and burn patterns on the downstairs couch indicated the use of a flammable liquid. An empty can of charcoal lighter fluid was found in an upstairs bedroom on top of a bassinet. The structural area behind the couch had been burned.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-9\">Defendant was taken to the hospital for treatment of deep second and third degree bums on her feet, thigh, and buttocks. About six hours later, she waved for (guard) Deputy Sheriff Richard Bankie to enter her room. Bankie entered and with defendant looking straight at him, she said, \u201c \u2018Can you take me to the morgue. I want them to cut me up like I did those babies. It\u2019s my turn to die now.\u2019 \u201d After Bankie explained she was in custody, she said, \u201c 1 don\u2019t deserve to live. I cut those babies up and then set my place on fire. I cut my own babies up. I want to be cut up too.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-10\">About an hour after defendant made her statements to Deputy Sheriff Bankie, she was interviewed at the hospital by Detective Frank Fermer. The interview was tape-recorded and transcribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1424\">*1424</page-number>After defendant stated her name, age, date of birth, address, and the fact she had no phone, Fermer \u201cMirandized\u201d her.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant answered \u201cyes\u201d when asked whether she understood her <em>Miranda </em>rights and whether, having those rights in mind, she wished to talk.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-4\">When Detective Fermer asked defendant \u201cwhat happened out there,\u201d she provided the following incoherent response, \u201cThose, like, uh, those, like the whole projects harassing me, and I had went to jail for assault and battery, and one was like this porno movie (inaudible) Chinese guy in Zerdo (inaudible) . . . . [fl] Newport running a porno movie at\u2014. . . Captain. [T]hen I got caught up in the black mafia gang, um, the Midnight Star, and they was harassing me around the playground and he said that they would kill me, they would kill my kids and burn us in the front yard, if, um, I didn\u2019t kill them, ...[1\u00a1] Take an extinguisher and singe and burn my kids, (sobs) I killed my kids so they wouldn\u2019t kill them and kill me then .... [^f] So they wouldn\u2019t kill my kids and me, and then I jumped off the house, and I jumped into the fire to burn myself up, and then the dude came on me with the extinguisher trying to burn me up and his name was Joe Johnson . ... ffl] [H]e was at the prison . . . . [fl] Lerdo [which is] in Bakersfield and Midnight Star the singing group . . . . fl[] . . . they killed my family, Rene Carthen, Kim Carthen, and burnt them in some body bag.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-5\">Defendant then said she and the kids got up about 7 a.m. on the day of the killings; she told Fermer the children\u2019s names and where they slept.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-6\">She then stated that Midnight Star and Joe Johnson came to her house the night before the killings and put \u201csome . . . kind of drug\u201d into her hands. All of the people in the complex knew about it and they were harassing her. Her family was going along with it because they were making a movie. They were trying to kill her because she had witnessed a \u201cdrug hit this murder\u201d \u201cat martial, the Chinese book (inaudible) because they was running porno ring.\u201d When Detective Fermer asked defendant if she and the children were alone in the house at the time of the killings, she replied that \u201c[n]o one else was in the house because they said they was going to come back and kill me and my kids and I had went to the store and bought myself some ether because they were coming to kill us.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-7\">Asked to tell about the killings, defendant stated she killed the children \u201cone by one\u201d with a butcher knife \u201cbecause they said they was going to . . . come back\u2014okay, they killed my family, shot them up in the street. Said they were going to burn their bodies .... Come join them becaiuse we\u2019re <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1425\">*1425</page-number>going to kill you and your kids later anyway.\u201d She then described the order in which the children were killed. Although her children asked her not to kill them, she told them \u201cthat they was going to have a worser death.\u201d After being stabbed, the children were still alive so she \u201cdrowned them in the bathtub.\u201d She then laid the children on her bed and started the apartment on fire by placing a living room couch pillow on the stove, starting the kitchen on fire, and throwing the lighted pillow back onto the couch.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-5\">After starting the fire, defendant got on the bed with her children. She then \u201cyelled out the window to tell the people next door to get out of the house because I started my house on fire and everybody started running.\u201d To confirm this point, Detective Fermer inquired, \u201cSo, you yelled this out the window?\u201d Defendant replied, \u201cOut [the] upstairs window at my kids and everybody in the apartment was with the people that were trying to kill me and then, like I went back off and up inhaling the smoke, but it was taking too long to kill me. I wanted to die with them, ...\u201d Defendant continued to relate a variety of delusional predicates for the methodical killing of her children and torching of her apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-6\">Defendant stated she had lived at her apartment for 15 months, that Dianeka\u2019s father was Clarence Haynes, a 28-year-old Black male employed by Creative Landscaping. The father of her other two children was Tim Tate, who had attended Hiram Johnson and McClatchy High Schools, graduating in 1979. Defendant graduated from McClatchy in 1980. Defendant added that she killed Tim Tate \u201ctwo days ago ... in my front yard . . . . Midnight Star took his body away.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-7\">Defendant said she just started killing the kids \u201cbecause they said they were going to kill them.\u201d She reiterated the order of killing, the manner of killing, and how she started the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-8\">Defendant told Fermer her father was Alan Bobo and she gave a phone number for him as well as a phone number for her sister Kim Carthen. She also provided the name of her welfare social worker. She then added that Joe Johnson, Midnight Star, and Judge Wapner killed her father \u201c[t]his morning or either last night because there\u2019s a whole bunch of them. They were trying to talk him out of not killing me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-9\">Joe Johnson had said he was going to kill her and rape and molest her children in front of everyone and burn them to the bone \u201c \u2018just like we burnt your family.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-10\">When Detective Fermer asked defendant what she did with the butcher knife, she replied, \u201cI had it in my hand and then Midnight Star with black <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1426\">*1426</page-number>mafia and then talking about, we\u2019re gonna burn you with the extinguisher (very rushed, frantic) . ... [U] ... I couldn\u2019t even speak and they were drugging me. They were raping my kids. They got the [preschool] teacher doing it.... [H] They killed my whole family. They killed my grandmother, my uncle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-4\">Defendant told the detective that she killed her kids \u201cabout one or twelve because that\u2019s when they said they were coming back.\u201d Asked if \u201cthey\u201d were, \u201cJoe Johnson and the Midnight Star,\u201d she said, \u201cYes.\u201d Midnight Star works at Pak \u2019N Save; \u201c[t]heir daddy owns the store.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-5\">Contrary to defendant\u2019s account, her family and Tim Tate had not been killed; moreover, her references to Judge Wapner and the Midnight Star were demonstrated to be totally delusional.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-6\">Autopsies were performed on defendant\u2019s three children on April 6,1987. Each appeared well nourished and well developed. Dianeka had eight stab wounds to her chest and abdomen with seven superficial cuts. The superficial cuts were described by forensic pathologist Robert Anthony, M.D., as \u201chesitation\u201d cuts, that is, indicating a degree of hesitation on the attacker\u2019s part when the attacker realizes that a good deal of force is required to achieve penetration. Dianeka was partially eviscerated. There was but a single stab wound to Tashima\u2019s heart, and four stab wounds to Jacoby, as well as a couple of \u201cdefensive wound\u201d cuts on his finger and wrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-7\">Defendant\u2019s sisters Renee and Kimberly as well as her father Alan Bobo all testified she was a loving mother but described delusional incidents and unfounded paranoid ramblings on her part (consistent with her statements to Detective Fermer) that began in January or February 1987. Neither Renee nor Kimberly thought defendant had a mental problem. Alan was not sure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-8\">Defendant\u2019s neighbor and friend Constance Smith described several instances when defendant indicated a desire to kill her children. Another neighbor, Ann Carter, described a similar instance, adding that defendant also stated she wanted to kill herself. Neither took the statements seriously. Smith also described numerous paranoid ramblings from defendant, and both Smith and Carter noted defendant seemed depressed because of overwhelming responsibilities. Carter, however, did not think defendant had a mental problem requiring outside help.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-9\">After the killing and fire, defendant was treated at University of California Davis Medical Center for deep second degree burns which necessitated grafting. Janet Lambertsen was the emergency room nurse on duty when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1427\">*1427</page-number>defendant was first brought in. Defendant had a \u201cflat affect.\u201d But defendant more than once told Lambertsen that she killed her children before the group Midnight Star could kill them; defendant also stated she started the fire because she killed the kids.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-5\">Ruby Chandler-Smith was the clinical social worker on duty in the emergency room on April 5. She noted that defendant was oriented to person, place, and time. When Chandler-Smith asked what happened, defendant replied, \u201cI killed my children,\u201d and \u201c \u2018These people put something in my cigarettes. And, they poured embalming fluid down my throat and my kids\u2019 throat. Then they said that the kids would have to die and I would have to die too. [fl] They told me I had to kill my kids. So, I killed my kids. They told me I had to kill myself, too.\u2019 \u201d When asked about calling her family, defendant responded, \u201c \u2018Those people killed all my family, too. My family is not there. I guess they\u2019re dead. Those people killed them, too.\u2019\u201d After providing the phone number of her sister, defendant apparently responded to an internal stimuli, grabbed Chandler-Smith\u2019s paper and said, \u201c \u2018They told me to take and keep this paper.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-6\">Dr. William Green, a board certified psychiatrist on the University of California Davis Medical Center staff, examined defendant about 24 hours after the incident because defendant\u2019s treating physicians suspected a psychiatric disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-7\">Defendant reported hearing voices and receiving special messages from her television set about the Midnight Star, Judge Wapner, and Joe Johnson; the three of them were threatening to sexually abuse her and her children and then kill the children. Also involved in this conspiracy were the President and the Governor, the latter having laced four of her cigarettes by injecting them. Defendant explained that two or three days before April 6, she had become increasingly fearful and paranoid because of these threats.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-8\">During the guilt phase of trial, Dr. Green characterized defendant\u2019s delusions as \u201cgrossly] bizarre,\u201d \u201cvery complex\u201d and \u201csystematized.\u201d From the history provided by defendant, Dr. Green concluded that these thoughts had begun approximately three years before, with some remission, and recurred about thirteen months prior to the acute episode on April 5. According to Green, people with such delusions are often reluctant to disclose them to others, because the paranoia aspect produces not only fear of others but fear of being labeled crazy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-9\">Dr. Green was also of the opinion that defendant was in a delusional state on April 5, which impaired her judgment; he diagnosed her condition as paranoid schizophrenia, acute exasperation. According to Green, defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1428\">*1428</page-number>experienced auditory hallucinations on the fateful day and acted on the basis of an intense fear about what outsiders were going to do to her children. Green\u2019s initial diagnosis was confirmed through his eight or nine subsequent visits with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-4\">In arriving at his opinions, Green basically relied on defendant\u2019s characterization of the events preceding his April 6 examination. He did not have collateral reports but would have been surprised had close family members not noticed some changes in her functional behavior or failed to report some unusual thoughts or statements. He added that it is common for family members to not view such unusual behavior or statements as a mental disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-5\">Green could not accept the prosecution\u2019s theory that defendant was depressed and suicidal on April 5, that she loved her children and did not want to leave them to an unknown fate, so she carefully decided to kill them before committing suicide, and, bungling the suicide, she <em>then </em>went mad. Green did not think defendant had the intellectual capacity and knowledge to invent particular delusions to deliberately confuse him in diagnosing her. Nor did he think she was sophisticated enough to report such delusions as an excuse for her behavior. Furthermore, a major depression with this degree of psychosis is uncommon. Nor did Green believe that such a complex and advanced delusional system would manifest itself so quickly\u2014that is, she did not suddenly go mad after the killings. Green acknowledged that at the time of his April 6 examination, the most important fact with which defendant was attempting to deal was that she had killed her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-6\">Dr. Green did not prescribe antipsychotic medication for defendant until April 13, when her medical care was being adversely affected because she had started incorporating hospital personnel and patients into her delusional system.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-7\">Also for the guilt phase of the trial, Dr. Paul Mattiuzzi, a psychologist, was appointed by the court to evaluate defendant\u2019s present mental state and her mental state at the time of the killings. (\u00a7\u00a7 1026, 1027.) Dr. Mattiuzzi examined defendant on September 24, 1987, for some four hours. Defendant was somewhat apprehensive about being examined, preferring instead to return to her dreams. Mattiuzzi administered three psychological tests, including a mental status exam. He also reviewed defendant\u2019s postincident medical records, her audiotaped statement to Detective Fermer (on which he placed great reliance), police and investigative reports, defendant\u2019s preliminary hearing transcript, and statements from Alan Bobo, Kimberly Carthen, Renee Carthen, Constance Smith, Carolyn Farrar (Tashima\u2019s preschool teacher), and personnel from the Florin Road Pak \u2019N Save Store.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1429\">*1429</page-number>Dr. Mattiuzzi was of the opinion that defendant was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, early adult onset. He further stated it was \u201chighly likely\u201d defendant suffered from the same disorder and was delusional when she killed her children. He was \u201cquite certain\u201d of his opinion as to defendant\u2019s mental disorder at the time of the offenses, but less so of his conclusion regarding the disorder\u2019s duration of less than two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-5\">Dr. Mattiuzzi described schizophrenia as a thought disorder involving abnormal thought content (e.g., delusions) and the breakdown of the association process (e.g., not understanding that a chair is more like a couch than an automobile) and the perception process (e.g., visual or auditory hallucinations). He noted the other aspects of the disease, including disorder of affect (e.g., flat affect or inappropriate affect), disturbed sense of self (e.g., belief that others control you), disturbances in volition (e.g., poor impulse control), and disturbed psychomotor control (e.g., extreme withdrawal). Genetic factors, biochemical elements, and developmental experiences play roles in the development of the disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-6\">Mattiuzzi then went on to explain that defendant\u2019s case presented a \u201cclassic\u201d example of paranoid schizophrenia. According to Mattiuzzi, defendant thought it necessary to kill her children on April 5 to protect them from a variety of people and conspirators who were going to do unspeakable acts to them and to her. By the September 24 examination, Clarence Haynes, defendant\u2019s boyfriend, had started to appear in defendant\u2019s delusional scheme\u2014he had actually killed the children while she stabbed dolls; Haynes did not want the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-7\">Dr. Mattiuzzi completely disagreed with the prosecutor\u2019s suggestion that defendant \u201cdeveloped [her] delusion in order to delude herself into thinking it was all right to kill her children.\u201d And he disagreed with the prosecutor\u2019s suggestion that defendant was suffering a reactive psychosis consequential to murdering her children. Defendant\u2019s delusional system was too elaborate\u2014it was not the type which developed quickly in response to an act or event. Furthermore, a reactive psychosis would not last as long as defendant\u2019s sufferings. He also noted there was no evidence of a major mood disorder. Mattiuzzi acknowledged he had not studied infanticide, although this was such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-8\">Dr. Mattiuzzi was aware that certain relatives and friends of defendant\u2019s had stated they did not think she had a mental problem prior to the killings. But Mattiuzzi noted that these same people had responded as if being asked for a diagnosis; and they had observed odd behavior and heard strange utterances from defendant, some of which were delusional in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1430\">*1430</page-number>Defendant\u2019s motion for a different jury for the insanity phase of trial was denied, and it was stipulated that the jurors could consider the guilt phase evidence during the insanity phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-4\">Dr. Mattiuzzi, the psychologist, along with three psychiatrists\u2014Alfred French, Nicholas Cornes, and Fred Rosenthal\u2014testified at the insanity phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-5\">Dr. Mattiuzzi concluded it was \u201chighly unlikely\u201d that defendant\u2019s perception of reality was accurate on April 5, 1987. While defendant may have known \u201cin a most basic sort of way\u201d that stabbing her children and placing them in the bathtub would result in their deaths (i.e., defendant had the capacity to know of the physical act), Mattiuzzi did not believe defendant could understand the significance of those acts. Mattiuzzi was also of the opinion that defendant lacked the capacity to consider what she was doing and how it related to the rights of her children; defendant\u2019s paranoid schizophrenia precluded her from understanding the nature and quality of her acts or understanding the acts were wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-6\">Reiterating his guilt phase testimony, Dr. Mattiuzzi discounted the theory that defendant\u2019s psychosis was simply a way of dealing with the killings. He also opined that certain elements of her delusional scheme remained constant while others varied because she was actively psychotic, in spite of medication, and continued to exhibit a disturbed thinking process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-7\">Dr. Mattiuzzi explained it was common for people to suffer from paranoid schizophrenia without others being aware of it. The very nature of the disease keeps its victim guarded and secretive. Similarly, family members often do not appreciate the significance of the strange behavior they have observed on occasion. Mattiuzzi explained that the statements of defendant\u2019s family members and friends were suggestive of the prodromal phase of the illness\u2014the phase of deterioration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-8\">While defendant\u2019s statement to Deputy Sheriff Bankie that she did not deserve to live could fairly be said to reflect an ability to distinguish right from wrong, Mattiuzzi explained that such a distinction presupposes a consideration of consequences that defendant\u2019s irrational thought process precluded her from making at the time of the killings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-9\">Mattiuzzi acknowledged that the ultimate issue of legal sanity was not one for psychiatrists or psychologists, but that such professionals could help the fact finder understand whether or not someone was or is mentally ill.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-10\">Dr. French, an expert in forensic psychiatry, interviewed defendant on five occasions in 1987\u2014April 9, 14, 15, 16, and August 6. The first four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1431\">*1431</page-number>interviews disclosed a woman (defendant) \u201calmost uniquely disturbed among people who I\u2019ve interviewed and it would be virtually impossible to have an illness of that severity crop up within a matter of hours or a matter of days.\u201d During the initial interviews, defendant was so disturbed it was essentially impossible to conduct an ordinary structured examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-5\">In arriving at his opinions, Dr. French relied on his interviews as well as defendant\u2019s postincident medical records, the coroner\u2019s investigation, statements from Clarence Haynes, Ann Carter, Thomas Brown, Susan Brown, Paul Steinkamp, and a witness who had observed the fire, and defendant\u2019s preliminary hearing transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-6\">His opinion was that defendant suffered from paranoid schizophrenia, which he described in a manner similar to Dr. Mattiuzzi\u2019s description in the guilt phase. Dr. French did not \u201chave any problem\u201d concluding that defendant was delusional when she killed her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-7\">Dr. French described defendant\u2019s behavior as an \u201cextraordinary massive storm of craziness\u201d and that she was in a frenzy of fear in the context of her delusion. Being so overwhelmed by fear, she was unable to distinguish right and wrong. Beyond knowing that certain acts would kill her children (i.e., the stabbings), defendant could not know much else; she had no idea as to the quality of her acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-8\">French disagreed with the prosecutor\u2019s theory that defendant first decided to commit suicide and secondarily decided to kill her children, noting that his conclusion of overwhelming fear provided a more sensible explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-9\">At a hearing on February 4, 1988, as to whether defendant gave informed consent to be interrogated by Detective Fermer on April 5, 1987, Dr. French testified he doubted defendant had such capacity but without asking certain questions there was no way to tell the effect of her delusion at that moment. At trial, French noted that this testimony concerned solely the issue of informed consent at a particular time, a different issue than those at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-10\">Dr. French also admitted there was no psychosis indicated from the tests he had administered, and admitted penning the statement that, based on his interviews with defendant, \u201cone either does or does not accept her report of a delusional system.\u201d But French administered his tests on August 6 when defendant was on medication. And the statement about accepting defendant\u2019s report was limited to the information derived from her interviews; Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1432\">*1432</page-number>French noted there was a lot of information aside from defendant\u2019s interviews supporting the conclusion that she had a delusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-4\">Dr. Cornes evaluated defendant in September 1987 under court appointment. (\u00a7 1027.) His diagnosis: chronic paranoid schizophrenia somewhat controlled by medication at the time of his interview. He also concluded that defendant was suffering from an acute exasperation of that condition on April 5 and felt compelled to comply with visual and auditory hallucinations which were command in type. On that date, according to Dr. Cornes, the logical and coherent nature of defendant\u2019s thinking was disturbed. As a result, defendant\u2019s ability to perceive reality and predict the consequences of her acts was clearly reduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-5\">The primary basis for Dr. Comes\u2019s opinion was his clinical interview of defendant. Defendant told Dr. Cornes her mental problems began when she broke up with Haynes in January 1987. Defendant told Dr. Cornes Midnight Star killed her children; later, she said a Chinese man killed them; still later, she said she killed them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-6\">Dr. Rosenthal evaluated defendant on six occasions: April 18, May 15, July 2 and 24, and September 17, 1987, and January 25,1988. His diagnosis: paranoid schizophrenia. Dr. Rosenthal had treated and seen \u201chundreds and hundreds\u201d of schizophrenics in his medical career and found defendant\u2019s history consistent with how the disease develops. According to Rosenthal, paranoid schizophrenia\u2019s development is insidious, and it is common for friends and relatives not to realize the existence of the disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-7\">Dr. Rosenthal\u2019s opinion was that at the time of the incident, defendant was \u201cacutely psychotic\u201d; she was hallucinating, delusional, and operating in a completely irrational state of mind and could not control her behavior. While defendant may have known that by stabbing her children, she would kill them, she could not know or understand the nature and quality of her actions, nor was she able to distinguish right from wrong at that time. Instead, she perceived extreme danger to her children from people that were in her house. According to Dr. Rosenthal, a psychosis is similar to dreaming in which the nature of one\u2019s actions is not appreciated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-8\">Dr. Rosenthal rejected the prosecutor\u2019s theory that defendant was depressed and suicidal and decided to kill herself and her children. Dr. Rosenthal testified that from his clinical experience, a psychotic state would be required for the decision to kill the children\u2014such a decision is not consistent with mere suicidal depression. Furthermore, the way the children were killed is inconsistent with a mere depression or mood disorder but consistent with a much more severe loss of touch with reality. After so testifying, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1433\">*1433</page-number>Dr. Rosenthal added, \u201cBut, I don\u2019t find that I would not be able to explain this episode in the way that you are proposing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-5\">After receiving his M.D. degree, Dr. Rosenthal worked for a number of years as a research physiologist in neurophysiology, studying the physiological functioning of the brain. He explained that schizophrenia develops because of a chemical imbalance in the brain. This imbalance can be treated with a powerful antipsychotic drug called Prolixin. A person who does not suffer from that chemical imbalance cannot tolerate the severe side effects of Prolixin. Dr. Rosenthal\u2019s opinion that defendant was psychotic when she killed her children was further supported when he noted that defendant\u2019s psychotic symptoms varied inversely with the dosage of Prolixin given her. Coupling these scientific facts with \u201call the history,\u201d Rosenthal proceeded to his diagnosis, although he admitted he was \u201cnot saying that I know for a certainty that\u2019s what happened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-6\">The defense then called Detective Fermer to reiterate statements Constance Smith, Renee Carthen, and Alan Bobo had made to him substantively consistent with their trial testimony. Fermer further testified that Clarence Haynes told him the last time he saw defendant was the Wednesday before the children were killed, and everything was \u201cfine\u201d at that time. Haynes also informed Fermer that defendant on occasion would simply drift out of a conversation; \u201c[s]he even would go away from him\u201d as if going into her own shell.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-7\">The prosecution presented no evidence at the insanity phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-9\">Defendant claims there is insufficient evidence that she harbored malice or that the killings were premeditated and deliberate. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-10\">In reviewing these claims, we must consider the entire record in the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether any rational trier of fact could have found, beyond a reasonable doubt, the disputed elements. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Guerra </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 377, 385 [220 Cal.Rptr. 374, 708 P.2d 1252]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 557, 576-577 [162 Cal.Rptr. 431, 606 P.2d 738, 16 A.L.R.4th 1255].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-11\">Express malice requires simply an intent unlawfully to kill. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Stress </em>(1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 1259, 1268 [252 Cal.Rptr. 913]; \u00a7 188; see Discussion II, <em>post) </em>Express malice can be compatible with a killing that is the result of a bizarre and delusional motive. <em>(Ibid) </em>In the present case, there is an abundance of evidence that defendant intended to kill her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1434\">*1434</page-number>children and such evidence is not limited to defendant\u2019s statements to Detective Fermer. Defendant\u2019s actions in stabbing and then immersing her children speak louder than do her ramblings to Fermer. Moreover, defendant\u2019s mental illness evidence indicated she killed her children to save them from a perceived worse fate. No legal justification or excuse for the killings was offered. <em>(Stress, supra, </em>at p. 1268.) As we shall see, there is no mitigation theory in the law applicable to the evidence here. (See Discussion II, <em>post.) </em>Thus, there was sufficient evidence defendant harbored malice. <em>(Stress, supra-, </em>\u00a7 188.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-4\">Reduced to its essence, defendant\u2019s claim regarding deliberation and premeditation is that her delusional, psychotic system was incompatible with the careful thought and weighing of considerations necessary to find those two elements. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-5\">In 1981 the Legislature added the following sentence to the statutory definition of first degree murder (\u00a7 189): \u201cTo prove the killing was \u2018deliberate and premeditated,\u2019 it shall not be necessary to prove the defendant maturely and meaningfully reflected upon the gravity of his or her act.\u201d The 1981 amendment to section 189 was part of the legislative package abolishing the diminished capacity defense. (Stats. 1981, ch. 404, \u00a7 7, p. 1593; see Discussion II, <em>post.) </em>\u201cMature and meaningful reflection was clearly the California Supreme Court\u2019s shorthand way of applying the concept of diminished capacity to the elements of deliberation and premeditation [see <em>People </em>v. <em>Wolff </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 795, 821 [40 Cal.Rptr. 271, 394 P.2d 959]].\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Stress, supra, </em>205 Cal.App.3d at p. 1270.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-6\">Based on this amendment to section 189, <em>Stress </em>concluded that \u201c[a] finding of deliberation and premeditation is not negated by evidence a defendant\u2019s mental condition was abnormal or his perception of reality delusional unless those conditions resulted in the failure to plan or weigh considerations for and against the proposed course of action. The mental process necessary for a finding of deliberation and premeditation is not dependent on the motivation for the act. [A first degree murderer need not have a rational motive for killing. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lunafelix </em>(1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 97, 102 [214 Cal.Rptr. 33].)] Nor is the necessary mental process lacking when the considerations reflected on by the defendant were the product of mental disease or defect.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Stress, supra, </em>205 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1270-1271.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-7\">Even though the defendant in <em>Stress </em>suffered from a paranoid delusional psychosis, the court found sufficient evidence that he committed a deliberate and premeditated killing. Stress was enveloped within a delusional crusade to expose a national conspiracy that ensured professional athletes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1435\">*1435</page-number>escaped military service during the Vietnam War. At his wits\u2019 end concerning how to deal with the conspiracy, Stress decided to kill his wife to gain the attention he needed to expose the plot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-5\"><em>Stress </em>instructs that a delusional, psychotic system can be compatible with the premeditation and deliberation required for a first degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-6\">The type of evidence which the California Supreme Court has found sufficient to sustain a finding of premeditation and deliberation falls into three basic categories: \u201c \u2018(1) facts about how and what defendant did <em>prior </em>to the actual killing which show that the defendant was engaged in activity directed toward, and explicable as intended to result in, the killing\u2014what may be characterized as \u201cplanning\u201d activity; (2) facts about the defendant\u2019s <em>prior </em>relationship and/or conduct with the victim from which the jury could reasonably infer a \u201cmotive\u201d to kill the victim, which inference of motive, together with facts of type (1) or (3), would in turn support an inference that the killing was the result of \u201ca pre-existing reflection\u201d and \u201ccareful thought and weighing of considerations\u201d rather than \u201cmere unconsidered or rash impulse hastily executed\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thomas, supra, </em>25 Cal.2d 880, at pp. 898, 900, 901 [156 P.2d 7]); (3) facts about the nature of the killing from which the jury could infer that the <em>manner </em>of killing was so particular and exacting that the defendant must have intentionally killed according to a \u201cpreconceived design\u201d to take his victim\u2019s life in a particular way for a \u201creason\u201d which the jury can reasonably infer from facts of type (1) or (2). [fl] Analysis of the cases will show that this court sustains verdicts of first degree murder typically when there is evidence of all three types and otherwise requires at least extremely strong evidence of (1) or evidence of (2) in conjunction with either (1) or (3).\u2019\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lunafelix, supra, </em>168 Cal.App.3d at pp. 100-101, quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1968) 70 Cal.2d 15, 26-27 [73 Cal.Rptr. 550, 447 P.2d 942], italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-7\">Viewing the entire record before us in the light most favorable to the judgment, we find evidence of all three categories.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-8\">As to planning activity, the defendant and her children were awake together for nearly five hours before the killings. There was a can of charcoal lighter fluid found on the baby\u2019s bassinet, and defendant told Detective Fermer she had gone to the store and bought some ether. Defendant stabbed and drowned the children to ensure their deaths. While the guilt phase testimony of Dr. Mattiuzzi and Dr. Green indicates that defendant\u2019s crimes were the product of a paranoid delusion, there was substantial evidence that defendant, like the defendant in <em>Stress, </em>was purposefully planning and acting in the context of that delusion. The purpose of defendant\u2019s plans and actions was to save her children from a perceived worse fate. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1436\">*1436</page-number>jury could reasonably infer from the evidence that defendant\u2019s delusional system did not preclude a planning or a weighing of considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-4\">As to motive, defendant had stated on a number of occasions that her children were getting on her nerves, making her sick, and that she felt like killing them. While these statements were apparently hyperbole, defendant had told Ann Carter that she felt like killing herself as well. Additionally, the evidence was extremely strong that defendant harbored an irrational motive\u2014to kill her children to save them from a worse fate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-5\">Finally, the manner in which the children were killed\u2014in sequential order, starting with the youngest\u2014was a particular and exacting one, and their deaths were assured when defendant submerged each of them in water after stabbing them.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1112-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-7\">Citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Molina </em>(1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 1168 [249 Cal.Rptr. 273], defendant contends the trial court erroneously refused to instruct on voluntary manslaughter. We disagree with the analysis in <em>Molina </em>and determine, on these facts, there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-8\">In <em>Molina, </em>a psychotic mother experiencing auditory hallucinations killed her 18-month-old son by strangling him, stabbing him, and then starting several fires in their residence. The trial court refused the mother\u2019s requested instructions on manslaughter and instructed only on first and second degree murder. Paralleling the case before us, the second degree murder theory in <em>Molina </em>was an intentional killing without sufficient evidence of premeditation and deliberation. (202 Cal.App.3d at p. 1172; CALJIC No. 8.30.) Molina was convicted of second degree murder while using a knife and found not guilty by reason of insanity. (202 Cal.App.3d at p. 1170.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-9\">The court in <em>Molina </em>noted that without manslaughter instructions the jurors had no option but to acquit if they determined that, because of her mental illness, defendant did not actually form malice or the intent to kill; a reversal was required because the issue of manslaughter had not been resolved adversely to Molina under the instructions which were given. (202 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1170, 1172-1175; \u00a7\u00a7 25, 28, 29.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-10\">The conclusion in <em>Molina </em>resulted from an analysis of sections 25, 28 and 29. (202 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1172-1174.) Section 25 states in pertinent part: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1437\">*1437</page-number>\u201c(a) The defense of diminished capacity is hereby abolished. In a criminal action, . . . evidence concerning an accused person\u2019s . . . mental illness . . . shall not be admissible to show or negate <em>capacity to form </em>the particular purpose, intent, motive, malice aforethought, knowledge, or other mental state required for the commission of the crime charged.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-5\">Section 28, subdivision (a), provides in pertinent part that evidence of mental illness \u201cshall not be admitted to show or negate the <em>capacity to form </em>any mental state,\u201d but \u201cis admissible solely on the issue of whether or not the accused <em>actually formed </em>a required specific intent, premeditated, deliberated, or harbored malice aforethought, when a specific intent crime is charged.\u201d (Italics added.) Subdivision (b) of that section abolishes the defenses of diminished capacity, diminished responsibility, and irresistible impulse as \u201ca matter of public policy . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-6\">Section 29 provides: \u201cIn the guilt phase of a criminal action, any expert testifying about a defendant\u2019s mental illness, mental disorder, or mental defect shall not testify as to whether the defendant had or did not have the required mental states, which include, but are not limited to, purpose, intent, knowledge, or malice aforethought, for the crimes charged. The question as to whether the defendant had or did not have the required mental states shall be decided by the trier of fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-7\">Based on these sections, <em>Molina </em>concluded: \u201cThe apparent meaning of the statutory language is that evidence of mental problems is inadmissible to show that a defendant <em>lacked the capacity to form </em>the requisite mental state, but is admissible to show that the defendant <em>actually lacked the requisite mental state. </em>An expert may testify regarding the defendant\u2019s mental condition so long as the expert gives no opinion on the ultimate question of whether or not the defendant actually had the requisite mental state.\u201d (Italics in original, 202 Cal.App.3d at p. 1173.) According to <em>Molina, </em>\u201c[t]he inclusion of the language in [section 28] subdivision (a) regarding the actual formation of [premeditation and deliberation, specific intent, or malice] shows that the Legislature did not foreclose the possibility of a reduction from murder to voluntary manslaughter where malice is lacking due to mental illness, or a further reduction to involuntary manslaughter where intent to kill is not present for the same reason.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1174.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-8\">The analysis in <em>Molina, </em>however, fails to account for an amendment to the definition of express malice aforethought enacted as part of the legislative package adding sections 28 and 29 to the Penal Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-9\">Sections 28 and 29 were part of the 1981 legislative package (hereafter, 1981 legislation) abolishing the diminished capacity defense. (Stats. 1981, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1438\">*1438</page-number>ch. 404, \u00a7\u00a7 1-7, pp. 1591-1593, subsequently amended nonsubstantively for our purposes.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But the 1981 legislation did not stop at abolishing this defense; it also amended sections 188 (defining malice aforethought) and 189 (defining first degree murder) as well as three other sections not pertinent here. (\u00a7\u00a7 21, 22, 26.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-4\">Through the pertinent amendments, a second paragraph was added to the original definition of malice in section 188, and a third paragraph was added to section 189.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section 188 now provides: \u201cSuch malice may be express or implied. It is express when there is manifested a deliberate intention unlawfully to take away the life of a fellow creature. It is implied, when no considerable provocation appears, or when the circumstances attending the killing show an abandoned and malignant heart. [(j] When it is shown that the killing resulted from the intentional doing of an act with express or implied malice as defined above, no other mental state need be shown to establish the mental state of malice aforethought. Neither an awareness of the obligation to act within the general body of laws regulating society nor acting despite such awareness is included within the definition of malice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-5\">The second paragraph added to section 188 clearly provides that once the trier of fact finds a deliberate intention unlawfully to kill, no other mental state need be shown to establish express malice aforethought. The question of whether a defendant acted with a wanton disregard for human life or with some antisocial motivation is no longer relevant to the issue of express malice. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Stress, supra, </em>205 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1267-1268; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rosenkrantz </em>(1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 1187, 1203 [244 Cal.Rptr. 403]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Croy </em>(1985) 41 Cal.3d 1, 18-19, fn. 12 [221 Cal.Rptr. 592, 710 P.2d 392].) This conclusion becomes manifest when the last sentence of section 188 is analyzed. That sentence directly repudiates the holding in <em>People </em>v. <em>Conley </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 310 [49 Cal.Rptr. 815, 411 P.2d 911], that the statutory definition of both express and implied malice includes an awareness of the obligation to act within the general body of laws regulating society. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 321-323; <em>People </em>v. <em>Fusselman </em>(1975) 46 Cal.App.3d 289, 299 [120 Cal.Rptr. 282].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-6\"><em>Conley </em>was a diminished capacity case that surveyed several decades of precedent to conclude that malice is characterized by a wanton disregard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1439\">*1439</page-number>for human life or an antisocial motivation. (64 Cal.2d at p. 322; <em>People </em>v. <em>Croy, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d at p. 18.) According to <em>Conley, </em>\u201c[a]n intentional act that is highly dangerous to human life, done in disregard of the actor\u2019s awareness that society requires him to conform his conduct to the law, is done with malice . . . (64 Cal.2d at p. 322.) \u201cIf because of mental defect, disease, or intoxication, however, the defendant is unable to comprehend his duty to govern his actions in accord with the duty imposed by law, he does not act with malice aforethought and cannot be guilty of murder in the first degree.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1115-6\">Because of <em>Conley </em>and its progeny\u2014most notably, <em>People </em>v. <em>Poddar </em>(1974) 10 Cal.3d 750, 759-760 [111 Cal.Rptr. 910, 518 P.2d 342], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Fusselman, supra, </em>46 Cal.App.3d at pages 298-301\u2014the law prior to the 1981 legislation recognized that a person \u201cmay deliberate, premeditate and intend to kill his victim, yet not act with malice aforethought so that the maximum offense of which he could be found guilty would be voluntary manslaughter.\u201d (46 Cal.App.3d at p. 299.) After the 1981 legislation, express malice and an intent unlawfully to kill are one and the same. (\u00a7 188; <em>People </em>v. <em>Stress, supra, </em>205 Cal.App.3d at p. 1268; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rosenkrantz, supra, </em>198 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1202-1203.) On the issue of express and implied malice encompassing a societal obligation component, <em>Conley, Poddar, </em>and <em>Fusselman </em>have been abrogated by the 1981 legislation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, the mere intent to kill remains distinct from a deliberate and premeditated intent to kill, the latter still required more understanding and comprehension of the character of the act. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Van Ronk </em>(1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 818, 823 [217 Cal.Rptr. 581].) In this way, the distinction between first and second degree murder\u2014in the absence of other statutory circumstances (e.g., murder by poison, torture, etc.\u2014see \u00a7 189)\u2014is maintained. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 822.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-7\">But what about the distinction between murder and voluntary manslaughter, both of which require the same specific intent to kill? <em>(People </em>v. <em>Van Ronk, supra, </em>171 Cal.App.3d at p. 824.) If such an intent equates with express malice, does the offense of voluntary manslaughter continue to exist in California? Initially we note that the statutory definition of voluntary manslaughter survived the passage of both Proposition 8 and the 1981 legislation. According to section 192, voluntary manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human being without malice upon a sudden quarrel or heat of passion; the requirement of provocation is implicit in the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1440\">*1440</page-number>definition of the crime. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 823-824, fn. 3.) Moreover, the absence of malice in section 192 is theoretical, not factual. According to one widely quoted commentator, \u201cfrom a strictly realistic point of view, [section 192, voluntary manslaughter] is likewise <em>malicious-, </em>but, according to common law tradition, the malice is presumed to be wanting in [a killing resulting from a sudden quarrel or heat of passion upon sufficient provocation], the act \u2018being rather imputed to the infirmity of human nature.\u2019 \u201d (Pike, <em>What Is Second Degree Murder in California? </em>(1936) 9 So.Cal.L.Rev. 112, 113, quoting 1 Mitchie, Homicide (1914) \u00a7 21, p. 130 (italics in original); see <em>People </em>v. <em>Holt </em>(1944) 25 Cal.2d 59, 84-85 [153 P.2d 21]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Van Ronk, supra, </em>171 Cal.App.3d p. 823.)  Consequently, section 188\u2019s equation of express malice and intent unlawfully to kill does not abrogate the statutory crime of voluntary manslaughter. Although <em>Conley\u2019s </em>judicial formulation of a diminished capacity voluntary manslaughter is no longer tenable, the statutory \u201csudden quarrel or heat of passion\u201d strand of the offense is still recognized.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-4\">Distinct from both diminished capacity and \u201csudden quarrel or heat of passion\u201d is another type of mitigation that has been recognized in California which can negate malice aforethought and reduce an intentional killing from murder to voluntary manslaughter. That mitigation theory applies when one kills under an honest but unreasonable belief in the necessity to defend against imminent peril to life or great bodily injury\u2014the so-called \u201cimperfect self-defense\u201d doctrine. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Flannel </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 668, 672, 674-675, 677-680 [160 Cal.Rptr. 84, 603 P.2d 1].) As we shall see, this theory is inapplicable to our facts. We therefore need not decide whether Proposition 8 and the 1981 legislation abrogated the <em>Flannel </em>concept of voluntary manslaughter, and we proceed on the assumption the concept still exists. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 678-680.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-5\">Another aspect of the subject of murder versus manslaughter concerns the section 188 express malice language \u201cdeliberate intention unlawfully.\u201d From the time it was enacted in 1872, section 188 has stated that malice is express \u201cwhen there is manifested a deliberate intention unlawfully\u201d to kill. One might argue that the word \u201cdeliberate\u201d has a significance in the distinction between murder and manslaughter. That argument would be mistaken.  As noted in <em>In re Thomas C. </em>(1986) 183 Cal.App.3d 786, 796-797 [228 Cal.Rptr. 430]; \u201cIn <em>People </em>v. <em>Valentine </em>(1946) 28 Cal.2d 121 [169 P.2d 1], our Supreme Court pointed out that it was \u2018incorrect [to differentiate] manslaughter from murder on the basis of <em>deliberate </em>intent.... Deliberate intent ... is not an essential element of murder, as such. It is an essential element of one class only of first degree murder and is not at all an element of second degree murder.\u2019 <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 131-132; [citations].) Indeed, the standard CALJIC instruction (No. 8.11 (1983 rev.)) has been held to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1441\">*1441</page-number>a correct definition of express malice aforethought, despite the fact that it does not use the word \u2018deliberate\u2019 as used in Penal Code section 188, but merely states that \u2018[m]alice is express when there is manifested an intention unlawfully to kill a human being.\u2019 (CALJIC No. 8.11.) In short, \u2018deliberate intention,\u2019 as stated in Penal Code section 188, merely distinguishes \u2018express\u2019 from \u2018implied\u2019 malice, whereas premeditation and deliberation is one class of first degree murder.\u201d (See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Van Ronk, supra, </em>171 Cal.App.3d at p. 824.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-5\">Moreover, as defined in cases predating <em>Conley </em>and <em>Conley's </em>foundational <em>pillars\u2014People </em>v. <em>Wells </em>(1949) 33 Cal.2d 330 [202 P.2d 53], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Gorshen </em>(1959) 51 Cal.2d 716 [336 P.2d 492]\u2014the concept of malice aforethought was manifested by the doing of an unlawful and felonious act intentionally and without legal cause or excuse. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Balkwell </em>(1904) 143 Cal. 259, 263 [76 P. 1017]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Fallon </em>(1906) 149 Cal. 287, 289-290 [86 P. 689]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Coleman </em>(1942) 50 Cal.App.2d 592, 596 [123 P.2d 557]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Bender </em>(1945) 27 Cal.2d 164, 181 [163 P.2d 8].) The adjective \u201cdeliberate\u201d in section 188 consequently implies an intentional act and is essentially redundant to the language defining express malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-6\">The adverb \u201cunlawfully\u201d in the express malice definition means simply that there is no justification, excuse, or mitigation for the killing recognized by the law. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Stress, supra, </em>205 Cal.App.3d at p. 1268.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-7\">Thus, in the wake of the 1981 legislation, voluntary manslaughter encompasses only an intentional killing resulting from a sudden quarrel or heat of passion (with adequate provocation), and perhaps a killing arising from an honest but unreasonable belief in the need to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-8\">Now, how is this narrowed definition of express malice aforethought in section 188 (intent unlawfully to kill) reconciled with the language of section 28, subdivision (a)? The latter section makes evidence of mental illness admissible solely on the issue of whether the accused \u201cactually formed a required specific intent, premeditated, deliberated, or harbored malice aforethought, when a specific intent crime is charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-9\"><em>Molina </em>ignored the language of section 188 but did conclude from the language of section 28, subdivision (a), \u201cthat the Legislature did not foreclose the possibility of a reduction from murder to voluntary manslaughter where malice is lacking due to mental illness, or a further reduction to involuntary manslaughter where intent to kill is not present for the same reason.\u201d (202 Cal.App.3d at p. 1174.) <em>Stress </em>did not mention section 28 but concluded that \u201c[t]he clear words of section 188 provide that once the trier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1442\">*1442</page-number>of fact finds a deliberate intent to unlawfully kill, no other mental state need be shown\u201d to establish express malice. (205 Cal.App.3d at p. 1268.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-4\">We think <em>Stress </em>presents the better approach. The addition of the second paragraph to section 188 makes clear the definition of express malice aforethought. Not only was the <em>Conley-Fusselman </em>engraftment of an awareness of societal obligation excised from that definition, but the statute reiterates that no other mental state need be shown to establish express malice than an intention unlawfully to kill. Once such an intention is proved in the context of an actual killing, the offense can be no less than murder unless the killing resulted from a sudden quarrel or heat of passion upon adequate provocation, or (perhaps) an honest but unreasonable belief in the need to defend. Aside from these two types of mitigation, an intent unlawfully to kill and express malice are the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-5\">If section 28, subdivision (a), read \u201cintent unlawfully to kill\u201d and \u201cexpress malice aforethought\u201d in the place of \u201cspecific intent\u201d and \u201cmalice aforethought,\u201d our equation above would be obliterated. But section 28, subdivision (a), is a general statute covering all specific intent crimes. Leeway in the language is needed to ensure such coverage. Moreover, malice aforethought can be either express or implied. Nothing is generalized about the definition of express malice in section 188 and no leeway in the language is needed for that precise definition. Furthermore, evidence of mental disease, disorder, or defect is still admissible on the issue of whether the accused actually formed an intent unlawfully to kill\u2014i.e., whether the accused actually formed express malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-6\">Because of this admissibility, there are no due process problems with section 188 narrowing the concept of express malice. Two principles are involved in this issue.  The first principle is that if a crime requires a particular mental state, the Legislature <em>cannot </em>deny a defendant the opportunity to prove he did not entertain that state. The second principle, however, is that the Legislature <em>can </em>limit the mental elements included in the statutory definitions of crimes and thereby curtail the use of mens rea defenses. (\u00a7 6.)  It has been judicially established that the 1981 legislation abolishing the diminished capacity defense and limiting admissible evidence to actual formation of various mental states does not violate the due process right to present a defense. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1984) 152 Cal.App.3d 961, 967-970 [199 Cal.Rptr. 848]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lynn </em>(1984) 159 Cal.App.3d 715, 731-733 [206 Cal.Rptr. 181]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Whitler, supra, </em>171 Cal.App.3d at pp. 340-341.) In amending section 188 in 1981, the Legislature equated express malice and an intent unlawfully to kill. Since two distinct concepts no longer exist, some narrowing of the mental elements included in the statutory definition of (express-malice) murder has evolved. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1443\">*1443</page-number>But a defendant is still free to show that, because of his mental disease, defect, or disorder, he did not in fact intend unlawfully to kill (i.e., did not in fact have express malice aforethought). (\u00a7 28, subd. (a); <em>People </em>v. <em>Whitler, supra, </em>171 Cal.App.3d at p. 343 (cone. opn. of Sims, J.).) If a reasonable doubt arises from such a showing, the killing (assuming there is no implied malice) can be no greater than involuntary manslaughter (i.e., an unjustified or unexcused killing lacking both malice and an intent to kill). (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Mosher </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 379, 391 [82 Cal.Rptr. 379, 461 P.2d 659].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-5\">In light of our foregoing analysis, we conclude the trial court did not err in refusing to instruct on voluntary manslaughter. The evidence of defendant\u2019s mental disease showed she intended to kill her children to save them from unspeakable acts at the hands of others.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> No theory applied to mitigate her intent to kill. The theory of \u201csudden quarrel or heat of passion\u201d was inapplicable because defendant\u2019s subjective mental state could not be used to meet the objective element of sufficient provocation. <em>(In re Thomas </em>C, <em>supra, </em>183 Cal.App.3d at p. 798.) Nor is there any evidence that defendant\u2019s children provoked her, and the requisite provocation must be from the victim. <em>(Ibid.; People </em>v. <em>Spurlin </em>(1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 119, 125-126 [202 Cal.Rptr. 663].) The <em>Flannel </em>theory of imperfect self-defense does not logically encompass the victim being killed so as to be saved from imminent death or great bodily injury. And there is no justification or excuse that applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-6\">The defendant, then, is in the same position as the paranoid psychotic defendant in <em>Stress. </em>While her motive for the killing was bizarre and delusional, she clearly intended to kill without a legal mitigation, justification, or excuse. <em>(Stress, supra, </em>205 Cal.App.3d at p. 1268.) Voluntary manslaughter instructions were therefore inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-7\"><em>Stress </em>contains a particularly appropriate passage on which to close this discussion: \u201c[Defendant] would decry this conclusion, believing it fails to properly relate intuitive moral conclusions concerning the culpability of the mentally ill to determinations of criminality. It is undoubtedly true that the demise of the defense of diminished capacity and the narrowing of mental elements will reduce the class of offenders whose criminal acts will be excused or mitigated because of mental disease or defect. However, whether this is wise or will make for a more workable criminal justice system must be left to public rather than judicial debate.\u201d (205 Cal.App.3d at p. 1271.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1444\">*1444</page-number>III-XIII<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1120-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-5\">Puglia, P.
