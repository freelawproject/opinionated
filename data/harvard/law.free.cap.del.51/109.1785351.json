C. </em>\u00a7 990 here involved is -unconstitutional for violation of the guaranty against double jeopardy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That Statute provides in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-18\">\u201cThe Attorney General of the State, in an action before the Court brought for the purpose of determining whether there has been desertion, willful neglect, or failure to support a wife or a child or both under chapter 5 of Title 13, ** * * shall have the right of appeal from any decision of the Court, in which the defendant in any of the actions is found not guilty, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>or in which decision the amount of support fixed hy the Family Court for the benefit of such wife, child or mother is deemed insufficient by the Attorney General.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">The defendant was tried and acquitted by the Family Court upon a charge of failure to support a minor illegitimate child in violation of 13 <em>Del. C. </em>\u00a7 502.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The State took an appeal to this Court under \u00a7 990 and it has filed here an information containing the very same charge upon which the defendant was tried and acquitted in the Family Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">The defendant pleads double jeopardy contending that he may not be tried a second time in this Court upon the same criminal charge for which he was tried in the Court below. The State argues that a proceeding under \u00a7 502 is a civil proceeding fundamentally and that, therefore, the double jeopardy guaranty does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\"> The basic question, therefore, is whether a proceeding under \u00a7 502 is civil or criminal. I am of the opinion that such proceeding is sufficiently criminal in nature as to require application of the double jeopardy provision of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">It is settled that this type of proceeding is not an ordinary criminal proceeding and that it has a dual nature and objective. In the case of <em>In re Alexander, </em>3 <em>Terry </em>461, 36 <em>A. </em>2d 361, this Court stated that one purpose of the controlling Statute is to punish the criminal wrong committed by one who fails to sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>port a legal dependent while the other clear purpose is enforcement of the continuing liability to provide such support. See <em>Donaghy v. State, </em>6 <em>Boyce </em>467, 100 <em>A. </em>696. The dual nature of this kind of proceeding was carefully considered in <em>State v. Savastini, </em>14 <em>N. J. </em>507, 103 <em>A. </em>2d 249, 254, where the Court said of the similar New Jersey Statute, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A: 100-1 <em>et seq.:</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-6\">\u201cThe statutory scheme initiates two separate and distinct proceedings by a single complaint, one a civil proceeding and the other a criminal proceeding. \u2018The criminal prosecution could go on without the award of money for support, and maintenance could be enforced without the criminal prosecution.\u2019 \"\" *. The law\u2019s primary and ultimate objective is to secure an adequate support order, the criminal charge supplying coercive pressure to that end. * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">While its hybrid characteristics are thus well recognized, the criminal aspect of this type of proceeding is predominant under our practice. The following incidents of a criminal prosecution are noteworthy: The proceeding must be commenced by a criminal information having the requisites of other criminal informations. See <em>State v. Harris, </em>6 <em>Terry </em>377, 75 <em>A. </em>2d 214; <em>Harris v. State, </em>7 <em>Terry </em>111, 82 <em>A. </em>2d 387. Such cases were tried in the Court of General Sessions before the establishment of the present court structure and they are now included in the criminal calendar of this Court. The presumption of innocence is invoked and the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is imposed as in other criminal cases. See <em>Bradfield v. State, </em>5 <em>Boyce </em>262, 92 <em>A. </em>988; <em>State v. Richardson, </em>1 <em>W. W. Harr. </em>14, 110 A. 660. The Statute of Limitations for criminal offenses is applied. See <em>State v. Cordrey, </em>10 <em>Terry </em>281, 114 <em>A. </em>2d 805. Special care has been exercised to prevent conjecture and speculation by the jury because the defendant\u2019s liberty may be at stake. See <em>State v. Walters, </em>8 <em>Terry </em>155, 89 <em>A. </em>2d 135. Moreover, our Court of Chancery has distinguished criminal proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>under 13 <em>Del. C. </em>\u00a7 502 from enforcement of the civil obligation for support imposed by 13 <em>Del. C. </em>\u00a7 702. See <em>Spruance v. Spruance, Del. Ch., </em>113 <em>A. </em>2d 877.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">In view of the foregoing, it would be a meaningless contradiction to say that a proceeding under \u00a7 502 is not a criminal proceeding. Our treatment of this type of case as strictly criminal in character, when we know it to be anomalous, may be explained by the evolution of the present Statute from the Act of 1887 which was a regular penal Statute. See <em>In re Alexander, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The State relies upon <em>State v. Liles, </em>134 <em>N. C. </em>735, 47 <em>S. E. </em>750. That case is inapposite because the North Carolina Statute, Code 1883, \u00a7 32, is not comparable.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">It is concluded, therefore, that the charge against the defendant is a criminal charge; that the defendant is entitled to the immunity from double jeopardy guaranteed by the Constitution; and that 10 <em>Del. C. </em>\u00a7 990 is null and void insofar as it purports to deny that immunity to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the information will be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b122-19\">DeIaware Constitution, Art. I, Sec. 8, <em>Del. C. Ann., </em>provides: \u201c* * * no person shall be for the same offense twice put in jeopardy of life or limb * * * \"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b123-10\"> 13 <em>Del.

The parent of any illegitimate child or children, under the age of 18 years, shall provide for the support and maintenance of such illegitimate child or children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">The related 13 <em>Del. C. </em>\u00a7 506, provides that a support order may be imposed in lieu of the penalties \u201cbefore the trial, with the consent of the defendant, or at the trial on entry of a plea of guilty, or after conviction.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b124-9\">Compare 13 <em>Del.
