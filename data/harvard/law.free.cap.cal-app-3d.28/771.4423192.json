Proceedings were suspended and he was granted probation for five years. In 1971, as the result of his conviction in case No. A-0648.07, probation was revoked and he was sentenced to state prison, the sentence to run consecutively with that imposed in case No. A-064807.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">He has appealed; we affirm. Although, as we point out below, we modify the judgment on one count in case No. A-064807, there is no reason to believe that that modification would cause any judge to do other than revoke probation and impose the sentence now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">\n<em>Case No. A-064807</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">Defendant was charged, jointly with James E. Portland, Jr., with two counts of robbery; the information charged the use of a pistol in the commission of the robberies. After a jury trial, both men were found guilty of robbery in the first degree, the allegation as to .use of a pistol being found to be true. Defendant Higgins was sentenced to state prison, the sentence on the two counts to run concurrently, but consecutively with the sentence in case No. A-238196. He has appealed; we modify the judgment and affirm it as modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">At about 1:30 p.m. on October 25, 1971, three Negro men, in a white Cadillac, drove into a parking lot on Sunset Boulevard; they sought and received permission to park the car there for five minutes. Two of them exited the car and walked in an easterly direction on Sunset; about ten minutes later the two men returned, \u201ctrotting,\u201d entered the Cadillac and the car drove off. The Cadillac belonged to codefendant Portland\u2019s father and one of the two men wore a jump suit similar to one admittedly owned by Portland,</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">At about the same time, two Negro men entered a shoe store on Sunset east of the parking lot. One of them was identified as Portland and Portland was wearing a jump suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-11\">Two young women were clerks in the store. One, Paula, approached Portland, whom she recognized as a former customer. Portland asked her to change a dollar bill, and she went to the cash register for that purpose. In the meantime, the other clerk, Carolyn, had been approached by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>second man, whom she identified as Higgins. Seeing Paula at the cash register, Carolyn asked what Paula was doing and was told that she was making change. When Carolyn looked up, she saw Higgins holding a pistol aimed at her. Carolyn\u2019s account of the subsequent events was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-4\">\u201cQ. When you saw him pointing the gun at you, did you say anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-5\">\u201cA. Well, I asked him what he wanted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-6\">\u201cQ. Did he respond?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-7\">\u201cA. He said, \u2018You know what I want.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-8\">\u201cQ. And what did you do when he said that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-9\">\u201cA. Well, I looked at Paula and she said, \u2018He wants money,\u2019 and by that time he had walked around the desk in front of the desk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-10\">\u201cQ. What was the defendant Portland doing while Higgins held the gun at you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-11\">\u201cA. He was just standing there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-12\">\u201cQ. Did he look at anything in particular?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-13\">\u201cA. He was watching what was going on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-14\">\u201cQ. Watching you -and Miss Angelus?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-15\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-16\">\u201cQ. Now, as Higgins and Portland stood there, what did you and Miss Angelus do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-17\">\u201cA. We were giving him the money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-18\">\u201cQ. Did you take some of the money yourself out of the cash drawer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-19\">\u201cA. Yes, I took the twenties and tens and Paula was giving me the fives and ones and I was putting them on top of the counter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-20\">\u201cQ. What happened after you put them on top of the counter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-21\">\u201cA. Well, Mr. Higgins stuck them into his pocket.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-22\">The two men left the store, heading west.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-23\">As we have indicated above, Paula was definite in her identification of Portland; she was unable to identify Higgins as the second robber. However, Carolyn was definite in her identification of Higgins and, on this appeal, it is not contended that her testimony does not support the finding that Higgins was the principal robber. The contentions now made to us are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>(1) That, under <em>People </em>v. <em>Guerin </em>(1972) 22 Cal.App.3d 775 [99 Cal.Rptr. 573], there was only one robbery; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-4\">(2) That the trial court erred in admitting evidence as to Higgin\u2019s conduct during a period immediately prior to the robbery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">We agree that Higgins could properly be convicted only of one robbery\u2014that of Carolyn. Consequently, as we did in <em>Guerin, </em>we reduce the conviction on the other count to assault with a deadly weapon upon Paula.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">In <em>Guerin, </em>defendant had held up a supermarket, taking money from two different cash registers, presided over by two different clerks. We sustained robbery convictions on separate counts involving each clerk, but reversed a robbery conviction naming the store manager. The case at bench is not one of two takings each from a different victim but a single taking from Carolyn out of a single cash drawer. While, under the authorities discussed by us in <em>Guerin, </em>the People might lawfully have convicted on a robbery from Paula, had she been selected by the People as the only victim, they cannot inflate this single robbery into two offenses merely because the loot passed (in part) through two innocent hands. We affirm the conviction on count I (which involved Carolyn); we reduce the conviction on count II (which involved Paula) to a violation of subdivision (a) of section 245 of the Penal Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">Higgins testified, denying participation in the robbery and tendering an alibi, supported by testimony from his family. The prosecution was allowed to examine him (a process in which the trial court actively participated) to show that he: (a) had a criminal record (see our discussion of case No. A-238196 above); and (b) that he was without funds. While some of that testimony might well have been omitted, the major purpose was to show that Higgins had a motive for robbery. Higgins was positively identified by Carolyn, who had him under direct observation for almost 15 minutes. Even without the questioned testimony, his conviction was assured. Whatever error was committed in admitting the testimony under attack, it was not prejudicial beyond any reasonable doubt. <em>(Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 87 S.Ct. 824, 24 A.L.R. 3d 1065].)</p>\n<p id=\"b650-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>The judgment on count I is affirmed; the judgment on count II is modified by reducing the conviction to one of violation of subdivision (a) of section 245 of the Penal Code; as so modified, it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">Jefferson, Acting P. J., and Dunn, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">A petition for a rehearing was denied December 20, 1972.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
