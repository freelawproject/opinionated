Filley <em>vs. </em>Lucinda Angell, executrix.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b75-8\">In an action against an executor on a lost promissory note alleged to have been signed by the testator, the answer denied the signature, and none of the witnesses, called at the trial, saw the testator sign it or knew his handwriting. <em>Held, </em>that no acts or declarations of third persons in the testator\u2019s absence were competent to prove that he signed the note.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b75-9\">Testimony that after the death of a testator the witness presented to the executor, for payment, a promissory note purporting to be signed by the testator; that the executor did not make any objection to the note on the ground that the signature was not genuine; and that the witness could not tell what reason the executor gave for not paying the note; is insufficient to prove an admission by the executor that the signature was genuine.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-10\">Contract, brought originally by John C. Wolcott, and prosecuted afterwards by his assignee in bankruptcy, against the executrix of the will of Samuel Angell, on a promissory note described in the declaration as dated May 14, 1863, and signed by Samuel D. Angell and Samuel Angell, promising jointly and severally to pay to the bearer seventy-five dollars and interest, one year after date. Writ dated November 29, 1864. The answer denied the making of such a note by the defendant\u2019s testator. The case was referred, under a rule of the superior court, to an arbitrator, who made an award, of which the following are the material parts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-11\">\u201c The note was alleged to be lost, and Wolcott, the bankrupt, by whom the action was originally brought, was admitted to testify, (the defendant objecting to his competency,) and by him the existence of the note in his hands, and its subsequent loss, were proved to the satisfaction of the referee. Wolcott further testified that the note was signed by Samuel D. Angell, with whose handwriting he was familiar; that he did not know the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>handwriting of Samuel Angel\u00ed, but the signature Samuel Angel' was that of an old man, \u2014 a tremulous hand.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-4\">\u201c Charles N. Emerson testified (the defendant objecting) that, about the time the note in suit purported to have been executed, he was counsel for the wife of Samuel D. Angel\u00ed in a suit brought by her for a divorce; that the parties finally agreed on terms of separation, and the suit was <em>discontinued; </em>that, by the terms of the settlement, Samuel D. Angel\u00ed was to pay to the libellant $150, in two notes of $75 each; that the witness insisted upon security, and it was agreed that if the notes should be executed by Samuel Angel\u00ed, the defendant\u2019s testator, who was the father of Samuel D. Angel\u00ed, it would be satisfactory security ; that the notes were drawn and taken away by Samuel D. Angel\u00ed, and were afterwards, on the same day, returned by him, signed with the names of Samuel D. Angel\u00ed and Samuel Angel\u00ed, and were accepted in the settlement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-5\">\u201c The referee was satisfied that the note in suit was one of the notes described by this witness.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-6\">\u201c Daniel Chapman testified that, at the request of some one, and at some time, he presented to the defendant a $75 note, signed Samuel D. Angel\u00ed and Samuel Angel\u00ed, for payment, after the decease of Samuel Angel\u00ed; and that she did not make any objection to the note as not being genuine, and he could not state what reason she gave for not paying it. He thought he received it from the wife of Samuel D. Angel\u00ed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-7\">\u201c Samuel Angel\u00ed was advanced in years at the time when the note\u2019in suit purported to be executed. The wife of Samuel D Angel\u00ed is dead. The defendant is the widow of said Samuel Angel\u00ed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-8\">\u201c There was no other evidence in the case; none being offered by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-9\">\u201c And the said referee doth award and determine, that the defendant do have and recover of the plaintiff the costs of this . reference and the costs of the court. If, however, in the opinion of the court, the c\u00e1se discloses evidence, competent and rightfully admitted, (supposing such competent evidence to be true,) sufficient in law to raise a presumption of the execution of said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>note by the defendant\u2019s testator, and so to make it competent for the referee to find thereon that said note was so executed; then the referee, in the place of his award above stated, doth finally award and determine in the premises, that the plaintiff do recover of the defendant,\u201d &amp;e.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-5\">On this award, the superior court ordered judgment for the plaintiff, and the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b77-6\"><em>M. Wilcox, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMD\">1. Wolcott was a competent witness, all his right of action having vested in his assignee in bankruptcy. He was no longer a party to the action. \u2022</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b77-7\">2. No one who saw the note signed was living at the time of the trial and known to the plaintiff. Nor was he aware of any living person, acquainted with the handwriting of the defendant\u2019s testator, who had seen the note; and the note itself was lost and could not be produced.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b77-8\">The question is, whether the evidence, as given before the referee, had any tendency to establish the genuineness of the signature of the note as the signature of the defendant\u2019s testator. The law requires that the plaintiff should prove it by the best evidence; but this rule only excludes that evidence which of itself indicates the existence of more original sources of information. 1 Greenl. Ev. \u00a7 82. The facts put in evidence by the plaintiff were manifestly the best evidence in his power, and were sufficient to warrant a finding in his favor.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b77-9\"><em>P.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ayq\">The question presented to the court in this case is, whether the legal evidence, as reported, would be sufficient in law to authorize a jury to find that the note declared upon was signed by Samuel Angel\u00ed.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-11\">Neither of the witnesses saw him sign it, and neither of them was able to testify to his handwriting. Nor are the acts done or declarations made by third persons, in the absence of a party, competent evidence against him, they being merely <em>res inter alios. </em>1 Phil. Ev. <em>c. </em>10, \u00a7 3. It is immaterial whether the third persons are, or are not, related to him. This principle excludes the evidence of Wolcott a\u00a1id Emerson as tending to prove the signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>The testimony of Daniel Chapman does not prove any admission of the signature by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendmt.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
