The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants concealed the injury and prevented them from entering said shaft to ascertain its amount; sought to recover damages for the injury; and prayed for an injunction and discovery, and that the plaintiffs, by their agents or by propet officers appointed by the court, might have free access into the said shaft and any drifts and excavations accessible therefrom, in order to make full survey of all the excavations into the plaintiffs\u2019 land complained of, and might be authorized to make all such surveys, explorations and discovery, and do all such acts, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>in the premises were rightful and proper to be made or done.

The master, at the request of the parties, abstained from passing upon the question of concealment by the defendants, and upon the question of costs or of the liability for expenses of the view.

Pingree, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-9\">Chapman, C. J. The plaintiffs are the owners of a tract of 'and called the Leet farm, and formerly owned by Nathaniel Leet. It bounds easterly by land of the Cone Iron Works, the line being the centre of the Benton road, so called. In August 1826, Leet, being then the owner of the farm, made a lease to Isaac Nicholson and Eli Richmond, for nine hundred and ninety-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>nine years, of the right of digging ore in a lot of land described by metes and bounds, arid being a part of the farm, bounding on the Benton road, and containing the Leet ore bed, so called; also the right of drawing and depositing the ore on the lot, and of ingress and egress thereon for the purposes aforesaid \u2014 yielding and paying therefor every year, half yearly, the sum of thirty-seven and one half cents for each and every ton of ore dug on the premises. The lessees covenanted to occupy and improve the ore bed in a proper manner, and dig and take therefrom, from year to year, such quantities of ore as should be considered as improving the same in a good, husbandlike and thorough manner, and keep a true account of the ore they should dig, and for each and every ton of ore, when the same should have been weighed and taken from the premises, .to pay the sum named. They also covenanted to keep up the fences; and it was agreed that if the rent should be in arrears and \"unpaid for the space of three months, or if the lessees should \u201c neglect to improve said ore bed in the manner above described,\u201d or underlet without the consent and approbation of the. lessor, he might reenter the premises, and again have, repossess and enjoy them as of his first estate. The covenants of each party were made for themselves, their heirs and assigns.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b91-5\">Between the year 1865 and June 2, 1867, and long after the plaintiffs became owners of the title of Leet, the defendants sank a shaft on their land near the Benton road, and, by means of excavations underground, obtained a large quantity of ore from the Leet ore bed, and from the farm northerly of the leased land. The report finds that this was not done wilfully, but by gross negligence, and states the quantity and value of the ore thus taken. No question is raised as to the liability of the Cone Iron Works for the injury done to the plaintiffs\u2019 land not included in the lease; but it is contended that, as to the premises included in the lease, the plaintiffs have only a reversionary interest, and cannot maintain this action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b91-6\">The master finds, subject to the opinion of the court, that, at the time of the taking of the ore by the defendants, the plaintiffs were the owners of the Leet ore bed, subject only to a lease <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>of a part of the same which they had made to one Pierson, and that they were in possession of the lot by their tenants. This implies that the lease to Nicholson and Richmond had been terminated. The plaintiffs contend that the lessees and their assigns forfeited the estate by breach of the condition contained in the lease, and that the plaintiffs had a right to terminate it, and have done so. The defendants, on the other hand, contend that no one but the lessor and his heirs had power to take advantage of a breach of the condition, and terminate the estate for fotfeiture; and, even if the plaintiffs had the right, they have done no act that is sufficient to terminate it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b92-5\">It is true that, by the common law, only the grantor or his heirs or executor could enter for breach of a condition. Comyn, Landl. &amp; Ten. 285. <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Worcester Railroad Co. </em>12 Allen, 141. But by the St. of 32 Hen. VIII. <em>c. </em>34, an assignee of a lessor\u2019s estate may have the same remedy. He can-' not take advantage of a breach of every condition; for the statute is held to refer only to conditions to do anything incident to the reversion, and not to conditions to do or not to do collateral acts. Comyn, Landl. &amp; Ten. 286. The distinction is thus expressed in Co. Lit. 215 <em>b: </em>\u201c The grantees or assignees shall not take the benefit of every forfeiture by force of a condition, but only of such conditions as either are incident to the reversion, as rents, or for the benefit of the estate, as for not doing of waste, for keeping the houses in reparations; for making of fences, scouring of ditches, for preserving of xvoods, or such like ; and not for the payment of any sum in gross, delivery of corn, wood, or the like; so as other forfeiture shall be taken for other forfeitures, like to those examples which were there put [that is, in the statute] of payment of rent, and not doing of waste, which are for the benefit of the reversion.\u201d Underletting without consent has been held to be not within the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b92-6\">It was not contended at the argument that the lease was forfeited for underletting without consent, though this ground was taken at an earlier stage of the case; but it is contended that the lease became forfeited by a breach of the covenants respecting the payment of rent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b93-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>The report finds that, from 1854 until May 1867, there was no ore taken from the Leet ore bed, and no mining operations were carried on thereon except by the defendant corporation, as hereafter stated, which was not a taking under the lease, but was tortious. It would not have been profitable to mine the ore bed at the stipulated royalty during any part of the time from 1854 to the end of 1861; but from January 1862 to May 1863 it would have been profitable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b93-5\">The terms of the lease were unlike those of the lease stated in <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Shears, </em>7 C. &amp; P. 346, cited by the defendants\u2019 counsel. The lessees in that case were to work the mine so long as it was fairly workable; and it was held that under those words they were not obliged to work at a dead loss. But the lease in this case required the lessees to dig and take the ore and pay the royalty from year to year, without making any reference to profit or loss, and the rent was payable semiannnally. The im-' provement of the mine in a good, husbandlike and thorough manner evidently refers to the manner of carrying on the business, so as to secure a reasonable rent. And certainly the neglect to carry it on from January 1862 to May 1863, while it would have been profitable to the lessees, and thereby depriving the landlord of all rent, was such a breach of condition as subjected the estate to forfeiture.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b93-6\">But it is contended that, even if this were so, the plaintiffs have done nothing to regain the estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b93-7\">After the action of <em>ejectione firma </em>was superseded by the action of ejectment in England, an actual entry for forfeiture was treated as a mere matter of form, and became unnecessary. .In xirder to be admitted to defend, the tenant was obliged to confess it in his pleadings by admitting the fictitious statement contained in the declaration. But in this Commonwealth some act is held to be necessary. There must be an entry or possession with intent to bold the property for forfeiture; and there must be some manifestation of this intent. <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>9 Cush. 95. <em>Hubbard </em>v. <em>Hubbard, </em>97 Mass. 188. The facts found by the master are sufficient to authorize him to find both the possession and the expression of the intent. The lessees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>abandoned the possession, and the plaintiffs entered, and occupied the surface of the ground by their tenants, thus cutting off the lessees\u2019 access to the ore, and made a written lease of a portion of the mine to Pierson. In May 1863, their agent delivered to an agent or one of the owners of the Lenox Iron Company, and to the bookkeeper in the office of the Richmond Iron Company, a notice that the plaintiffs had entered for a breach of the conditions of the lease, and to terminate the same. These companies had worked the mine previously to 1854. It does not appear whether other parties had ever worked it under the lease, but since 1854 no one had worked it. No parties appear to have wonted it down to the present time, as lessees, and no parties except the Cone Iron Works have claimed title as lessees ; and their only claim of title is under a lease from several of the heirs of Eli Richmond, dated June 24, 1867, after the defendants had ceased to take ore from the mine, and including three fourteenth parts of the lessees\u2019 interest. The court are of opinion that the finding of the master was warranted by the facts proved.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-5\">The lease to Pierson constitutes no objection to the present action; for the value of the ore per ton, as found by the master, is less than the royalty which the plaintiffs were to receive from Pierson. The injury to their reversionary interest is therefore at least equal to the damages which they will recover under the finding.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-6\">The result to which we are thus led is, that the plaintiffs are entitled to recover against the Cone Iron Works, on the ground that the taking of the ore and the injury done to the property were tortious ; and they are also entitled to have the injunction made perpetual. \u2022 The value of the ore is to be estimated as it lay in the bed, and not as it was after the defendants had increased its value by removing it. To this is to be added the damage done to the real estate. The plaintiffs are also entitled to costs, including the expense of the view.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-7\">The bill is to be dismissed as to the defendant Cone, but without costs, as it was his duty, he being the defendants\u2019 agent, to prevent the workmen from digging beyond the defendants line.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b95-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>As to the defendant Pomeroy, the bill is to be dismissed with costs. <em>Decree accordingly.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b95-5\">After the entry of a decree in accordance with the above opinion, costs were taxed by the clerk, and from his taxation the defendants appealed. The only items, the allowance of which was objected to, were the expenses of the view, amounting to $4841.07, which had been advanced by the plaintiffs, and interest on this amount from the time it had been so advanced until the date of the final decree.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b95-6\">At the hearing of this appeal at September term 1870, before <em>Gray, </em>J., it appeared that the operations of the view had been carried on at the plaintiffs\u2019 request; that to reach and examine the places of the alleged trespass the plaintiffs proposed to make an excavation from a shaft on their own land near the Benton road; that the viewers deemed that it was the wisest and best course to permit the plaintiffs to do the work, and it was reasonable that this excavation should be made; and that the expenses of the view, as stated in the item of costs, included a sum allowed to the plaintiffs for the use of their shaft and the machinery connected therewith, and also all the actual expenses of the operations, as well as allowances to the viewers for their personal services.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b95-7\">One of the viewers was a witness at the hearing, and, on being asked \u201c whether the viewers merely permitted these operations, or whether they authorized them to be carried on as absolutely essential to the execution of the order of the court,\u201d answered that, <em>\u201c </em>so far as he could now at this period tell what the operations of his own mind were, the explorations and excavations were made at the request of the plaintiffs, and the viewers permitted them to make the explorations and excavations which they requested, and which seemed to the viewers to afford probably some light on the case, without deciding whether it was absolutely necessary that they should be made.\u201d He also testified that all the moneys expended by the viewers, and included in the item of costs objected to, were judiciously and economically expended.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>The defendants contended that the authority given to the plaintiffs to examine the mine by viewers was permissive only, and the expenses incurred thereby were of the nature of preparation for trial, by discovery and collection of evidence, and not allowable as costs; that the services and personal expenses of the viewers were all that could be recovered as costs; and that, at any rate, the expense of investigations on the plaintiffs\u2019 own land, (including the charge for use of the shaft,) which they could have made without any order from the court, ought not to be allowed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-5\">But the judge found as. matter of fact that all acts included in the expenses as taxed by the clerk were reasonably necessary to effect the purpose of the order appointing viewers, and affirmed the taxation,' with costs. The defendants objected that the evidence did not as matter of law warrant the finding, and appealed to the full court.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b96-6\"><em>T. P. </em>Pingree, for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b96-7\">S. <em>Bartlett, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b96-8\">Chapman, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ay-\">The defendants\u2019 counsel contends that the evidence did not as matter of law warrant the finding of the justice who heard the cause on the appeal from the master\u2019s taxation of costs; and he refers not only to the order appointing the viewers, but to the bill itself, as sustaining his position, on the ground that the viewers were not authorized to order all the explorations that were made by their direction. But this position is not sustained by reference to the bill and order. The plaintiffs complain that the defendants dug a shaft on their own .and, near the line of the plaintiffs\u2019 land, and thence excavated drifts extending underground into the \"plaintiffs\u2019 land, and took out the ore which they found there. They ask that these drifts may be viewed. The order directs not only that the drifts may be examined by pumping the water out of the shaft and going into it, and that the drifts may be examined which lead towards the plaintiffs\u2019 land, and also those which are under it, but that they may be cleared so far as may be necessary in order to ascertain what iron ore or other mineral has been taken from the land of the plaintiffs and under the surface thereof, and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>viewers may do all acts that may be reasonably necessary to be done to effect the purposes of the decree. If the viewers found that it would facilitate and cheapen their explorations to excavate an entrance to one of the drifts which they had discovered by digging from the surface of the plaintiffs\u2019 land, it would be proper to do so, within the terms of the order and the prayer of the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The master\u2019s report finds that the defendants took a very large quantity of iron ore (being 6640 tons) from the plaintiffs\u2019 land by means of these underground passages; and though it was not done wilfully, yet they were guilty of gross negligence in not taking proper precautions to avoid digging or carrying away ore from the plaintiffs\u2019 land. This result tends to show the importance of the view; and moreover it is to be presumed that the proceedings of these, officers of the court were proper, unless the contrary appears. The testimony of the viewer, at the hearing, that the viewers ordered the explorations without deciding that it was absolutely necessary that they should be made, is referred to by the defendants\u2019 counsel, who contends that the expense of making the explorations should not be allowed because they were not necessary. But it need not appear that they were absolutely necessary. It is sufficient if they were reasonably necessary ; and it sufficiently appears that they were so.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">It is contended that the power of the court in allowing costs depends on Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>156, \u00a7 16, and that this section does not authorize the allowance of these expenses. But courts of law have power to allow the reasonable expenses of surveys and views in proper cases, and the fee bill does not apply to the expense of such proceedings. Mines are so situated that special and peculiar proceedings are sometimes necessary in order to attain the reasonable ends of justice in regard to the underground passages by which access to them may be obtained by trespassers.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">It is contended that the court has no power to allow interest on the moneys expended under the order for the view. The mm thus expended was large, and must be advanced before<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>hand; and the case has been delayed a long time; and though it is never the practice to allow interest on fees taxed according to the fee bill, yet we think the court has power to include interest on money advanced as a necessary part of the expense of the view in a case like the present, and that it is equitable to make such allowance. <em>Taxation of costs affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
