Bullard was chairman; and that on April 6, 1868, a committee, consisting of Estus Lamb and two others, were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>chosen by the town \u201c to examine into the expediency of moving the town-house down to the village, with the view of erecting thereunder a lockup for the use of the town, and report their doings at some future meeting.\u201d The plaintiff was allowed to testify, against the objection of the defendants, that in March 1868 he notified Bullard that he was ready to proceed with his contract, and Bullard told him not to do anything more until further orders, as the town could not get a place upon which to build the lockup, and further told him that they were not going to build such a lockup as they had contracted for, and thought of building one under the town-house; that the first notice he got was through his father from Bullard; and that afterwards Lamb told him that they were not going to build the lockup named in the contract. The plaintiff\u2019s father testified that Bullard told him that he wanted the plaintiff to know that they had given up building the lockup.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-5\">The judge gave to the jury the following instructions: \u201c The first question is, whether there is any valid written contract. To be such, the instrument must have been delivered, and in determining whether there was a delivery, you must look at the whole evidence in the case. The town authorized the selectmen to erect a lockup. That would authorize the selectmen to contract. They might make their contract either verbally, by simple writing, or under seal. This is enough to bind the town if delivered. To constitute a delivery, \"it is not necessary there should be any set form of words, or particular act done. If the parties do anything or say anything with the understanding that it should operate as a delivery, that would do. If they should meet, not knowing that delivery was necessary, and do the same acts, not intending that they should operate as a delivery, it would not be a good delivery. There is no express evidence here that they knew that a delivery was necessary. But it is the presumption of law that they knew what the law was, and knew that a delivery was necessary. No particular place was necessary. If they go off and leave it on the table, if they understand that is enough to make a delivery, that will do. If it is put into the hands of a third person to do any act, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>as to carry to the registry of deeds, and understood that that shall operate as a delivery, that will do. In determining this question, you will look at the conduct of the parties and see whether they acted afterwards as if there was any subsisting contract between them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-5\">\u201c If you find a delivery, then you will inquire if there was any hindering. The contract required the plaintiff to finish the building some time in June. The contract does not fix any place. No place being mentioned, it was the duty of the town to furnish a place. To constitute a hindering, you must find he was prevented by some act or failure to act on the part of the town. If you find there was no place pointed out, and that was the reason he did not go on, that would be a hindering. If you find the plaintiff delayed because he was talking with officers of the town, and hoped to get a new contract, that would not render the town liable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-6\">\u201c If one selectman, undertaking to act for the board, did anything, the jury may consider his act as the act of the board.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-7\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, and the defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b354-8\"><em>G.

The agreement declared on purports throughout the body of it to be the agreement of the town of Blackstone and not the personal contract of the selectmen. The selectmen were authorized by vote of the town to make the agreement in behalf of the town. The signature was sufficient in form to render this agreement binding on the' town as a simple contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>The agreement was not of a nature which required a seal. It is therefore unnecessary to inquire whether either of the seals affixed to it could be deemed the seal of the town ; for, if not the deed of the town, it is certainly neither the deed nor the simple contract of the agent; if it acquires no validity, it certainly loses none, by the affixing of the seals; and, if the seals have no effect, they may be disregarded, and the agreement held to bind the town as a simple contract. <em>Sherman </em>v. <em>Fitch, </em>98 Mass. 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">2. There was evidence tending to show that the agreement was written and signed on behalf of both parties in an attorney\u2019s office, and, after being thus completed, was left with him for the purpose of having a duplicate made and sent to the plaintiff. This was sufficient evidence to warrant the jury in finding a delivery of the agreement; and it was submitted to them with proper instructions. Anything done or said by the parties, with the understanding that it shall operate as a delivery, will have the effect intended. Leaving the instrument on the table, or in the hands of a third person, both parties understanding that it shall operate as a delivery, is sufficient, even in the case of a deed. Shep. Touch. 58. <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Mansfield, </em>3 Met. 412. <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Hayward, </em>7 Cush. 170. <em>Kidner </em>v. <em>Keith, </em>15 C. B. (N. S.) 35. <em>Parmelee </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>5 Wallace, 81, 86. The presumption is that the parties knew that a delivery was required by law to give effect to the agreement. This presumption was not stated to the jury as conclusive; but they were expressly told that if the parties \u201c should meet, not knowing that delivery was necessary, and do the same acts, not intending that they should operate as a delivery, it would not be a good delivery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">3. The agreement did not fix the spot upon which the building was to be erected. It was therefore the duty of the town to furnish a place. If the town unreasonably omitted to perform this duty, it was as much a hindering and preventing of the performance of the agreement by the plaintiff, as if the town had expressly refused to select a place, or had done any other affirmative act to interrupt his performance of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">4. The vote authorizing the selectmen to erect the building for the use of the town necessarily involved an authority to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>select a place for the building, as well as to make a contract for its erection. The declarations of the chairman of the selectmen, in conversation with the contractor, or with his father as his agent, after the making of such a contract, were therefore rightly admitted in evidence against the town, as admissions of an agent while negotiating about the contract and within the scope of his agency. <em>Morse </em>v. <em>Connecticut River Railroad Co. </em>6 Gray, 450. <em>Burgess </em>v. Wareham, 7 Gray, 347. As applied to these declarations, which seem to have been the only acts of one selectman of which there was any evidence, the instruction that \u201c if one selectman, undertaking to act for the board, did anything, the jury may consider his act as the act of the board,\u201d would seem to afford no ground of exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">5. But the declarations of Lamb were improperly admitted, because the authority of the committee of which he was a member was limited, by the terms of the vote appointing them, to examining into the expediency of erecting the building and reporting their doings at a future meeting of the town. <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Framingham, 12 </em>Cush. 287. As we cannot know that the jury were not influenced by this evidence in finding a verdict for the plaintiff, upon this single point the</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">\n<em>Exceptions are sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
