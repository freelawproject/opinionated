In the superior court she was defaulted; Henry King &amp; Son, copartners, summoned as trustees, disclosed in their answer that on June 20, 1868, at the time of the service of th\u00e9 writ on them, they owed her $273.33, \u201c said sum being due to her for board and lodging furnished by her to said trustees; \u201d and Charles P. Field was admitted to claim the- credits thus disclosed, by force of an instrument in writing, dated April 24, 1868, in which she, \u201c in consideration of present indebtedness,\u201d and of his agreement to sell goods <em>lo </em>her on credit, assigned to him \u201c all money now due and ai\u201d money which may within six months from the date hereof b,i come due to me from Henry King &amp; Son for board and lodgir g furnished and which may hereafter within the term aforesaid he furnished by me for the said Henry King &amp; Son to men eraployed or to be employed within said term by the said Hen*y King &amp; Son, to have and to hold the same to said Field for the purpose of securing to him payment for all goods and money for which I am or may become indebted to him within the term aforesaid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-7\">At the hearing, before <em>Putnam, </em>J., it appeared that Field after April 24, 1868, sold to the principal defendant on credit goods of a value equal to the credits disclosed by the trustees; but that all the board and lodging furnished by her to the trustees, from which the said credits due from them arose, were also furnished after that date; and that her assignment to Field was not recorded. The judge ordered judgment charging the trustees, and the claimant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b243-8\"><em>J. M. Stebbins, </em>for the claimant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3R\">argued that the provision of the St. of 1865, <em>c. </em>43, \u00a7 2, that unrecorded assignments of future earnings should be invalid against a trustee process, applied only to assignments of wages.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b244-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number><em>T. M. Brown, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b244-5\">Wells, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AKe\">We are of opinion that the word \u201c earnings,\u201d in the St. of 1865, c. 43, \u00a7 <em>2, </em>was used for the purpose of embracing a larger class of credits than would be included in the more common term \u201c wages.\u201d It involves' the idea of compensation for services rendered, but is not limited to gains from merely personal labor. Money due from time to time from an employer to a third party, for board and lodging of his workmen, is in the nature of compensation for services rendered to such employer. It may involve, to such third party, expenditures for provisions, house room and other matters besides labor. But to the employer, or to those who receive the board, it is not a sale of the food and rent of the lodgings. The result of the whole is a service rendered, for which the compensation is measured by the time of its continuance. The return due for such service may properly be called \u201c earnings.\u201d The term applies to the whole reward for the service, and not merely to the profits therefrom. We think the statute was intended to apply to credits of this nature. As the assignment was not recorded, it is invalid against the trustee process, and the result must therefore be <em>Trustees charged.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
