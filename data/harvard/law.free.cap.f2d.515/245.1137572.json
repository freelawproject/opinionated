Claiming default in payments, Robert repossessed the vessel by self-help, along with Elbert\u2019s personal property thereon. Elbert sued in admiralty to recover it, swore out a warrant of arrest in rem, and had the vessel seized by the United States Marshal.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-21\">Pleading ensued. Elbert took a non-suit. Our district court issued a standard writ of restitution to the Marshal, directing him to return Old Drifter to Robert, from whom he had seized it. The Marshal escorted Robert to the vessel, which was locked to the mooring with Elbert\u2019s chain, stated \u201cIt\u2019s your boat,\u201d and decamped. After an hour\u2019s or so performance with a hacksaw, Robert was about to leave with the boat when Elbert appeared with local gendarmerie, who threatened Robert with arrest if he moved the vessel. Elbert has now apparently made away with the vessel, and Robert wishes us to rectify the Marshal\u2019s failure to restore it to his <em>effective </em>control, from which he took it. The district court, viewing the matter as concluded, declined to intervene. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-22\">The Marshal should have effectively restored the boat to Robert, having taken it from him. But it was not his failure to do so which brought about Robert\u2019s present plight, rather Robert\u2019s unwillingness to hold his ground in the face <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>of the menaced arrest. Presumably he would have been as unwilling to do so had the Marshal removed the lock and the locals arrived at that time. It was not the Marshal\u2019s place to champion Robert against the police after Robert had recovered effective control of Old Drifter. This he had done \u2014 albeit by self-help \u2014 when lastly dispossessed. Had the Marshal then been present he could properly have done nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
