Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., 5 Cir. 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b952-18\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b952-19\">Rocky Fontaine appeals from a judgment of the district court dismissing without prejudice his in forma pauperis suit for damages against the Fort Worth Chief of Police and two of his men based upon alleged physical mistreatment. Fontaine is presently incarcerated in the Tarrant County Jail, awaiting trial on a charge of capital murder. His complaint asserts jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2201-02, and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1983, and 1985. We understand Fontaine to allege two factual bases for imposing liability: (1) excessive force by officer Hudson while conveying appellant from one place to another in the jail, and (2) improper conduct by the police in placing Fontaine in solitary confinement and holding him incommunicado for over forty-eight hours. The district court referred initial consideration of appellant\u2019s complaint to a magistrate. Citing Younger v. Harris, 1971, 401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 and Alexander v. Emerson, 5 Cir. 1973, 489 F.2d 285, the magistrate recommended that the action be dismissed without prejudice on the ground that all of Fontaine\u2019s contentions could and should be presented first to the state courts. The district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s recommendation and dismissed Fontaine\u2019s complaint. We vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-21\">Unlike the \u201cwrongful imprisonment\u201d suit involved in Alexander v. Emerson, <em>supra, </em>this action is not a thinly disguised collateral attack on the plaintiff\u2019s criminal conviction. Appellant has not been convicted of anything; there has been no trial. Nor is Fontaine\u2019s suit in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>substance a petition for writ of habeas corpus: he seeks neither outright release from confinement nor a shorter period of incarceration. <em>See </em>Preiser v. Rodriguez, 1973, 411 U.S. 475, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439; <em>cf. </em>Granville v. Hunt, 5 Cir. 1969, 411 F.2d 9. Appellant\u2019s action is nothing more, and nothing less, than a classic \u00a7 1983 damages suit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hence, the exhaustion requirement applicable to ha-beas corpus actions is not relevhnt here. Preiser v. Rodriguez, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">Because we disagree with the lower court\u2019s reasons for dismissing appellant\u2019s complaint, we vacate its judgment and remand for further proceedings. <em>See </em>Hines v. Askew, 5 Cir. 1975, 514 F.2d 673. We express no view whatever on the substance of appellant\u2019s claims or on appellees\u2019 contention that this cause is liable to summary disposition on the merits. These matters must be taken up in the first instance in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b953-23\">. This is not a case \u201cwhere disposition of the damage action would involve a ruling implying that a state conviction is or would be illegal.\u201d Guerro v. Mulhearn, 1 Cir. 1974, 498 F.2d 1249.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
