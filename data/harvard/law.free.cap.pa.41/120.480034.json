That said messuage and tract of land produces an annual rent, clear of taxes and deductions, of about $200, and are free from all incumbrances, trusts, and charities, and are the property of all the said grandchildren as heirs at law and next of kin of said John McNutt, deceased, according to their respective interests therein under the intestate laws of the state.

W. F. White, </em>for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQy\">conceding that there was no allegation of fraud in the guardian, and'that he and all the heirs honestly believed that the five children of Dorcas Thompson owned only a moiety of the property, argued that the title of William W. Rodgers' was' defective, because, 1. There Avas such an evident mistake on the face of the record as to vitiate it. The guardian had evidently acted on the supposition that the five Thompson children had only the <em>moiety </em>Avhen they had the <em>five-sevenths </em>of the property. At the value he fixed upon the property, their interest was worth $7865.71, instead of $6000.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b127-12\">2. The Orphans\u2019 Court had no power to decree a <em>private </em>sale in such a case. The 4th section of the Act of 18th April 1853, authorized private sales of <em>undivided interests </em>only in those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>cases where other parties in interest, competent to act for themselves, <em>joined in the conveyance. </em>And in all other cases there must be <em>cause shown </em>by the report of an auditor, or other satisfactory evidence, before the court could order a private sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b128-6\">3. There were fatal defects in the proceedings of the Orphans\u2019 Court. The order of sale was granted August 11th 1860, and not returned till April 3d 1861, nearly eight months afterwards, and after two entire terms of the court had intervened. And the report of the guardian as filed April 3d 1861, was neither signed by him nor sworn to.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b128-7\">But, although mere irregularities would not affect the validity of the sale nor impair the title held by Rodgers, there was a mistake against the interest of the minors apparent on the face of the record, and of which he therefore had notice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b128-8\">Gilmore, the conditional purchaser, stands precisely in the place of Rodgers and his sister, who are the children of Mrs. Rodgers, and the cousin of full age of these minors. He is not a <em>bond fide </em>purchaser for value without notice \u2014 he has paid no cash, and his bond is upon condition that a good title shall be made to him. There is no pretence of improvements, &amp;c., so that the case is as if between the original parties. Chess may not have known what the interest of these minors were, and they too Were probably ignorant of our intestate law, for they were minors residing in Missouri. But Rodgers and Gilmore were not ignorant of- the extent of the interest which these minors had in this land. On the day the deed of Chess was delivered to Rodgers the latter sold, to Gilmore, not for cash, but for a bond, which recited a doubt as to the title, and was only to be enforced after the title should be declared good.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b128-9\"><em>J. F. Shale </em>contended that the Act of April 18th 1858, under which this sale was made, was one of immense utility, and was indispensably necessary for relieving real estate in Pennsylvania from the estates, limitations, and remainders with which the various owners thereof had from time to time burdened and encumbered them, securing to purchasers titles that were unquestionably valid, thereby insuring to the owners full and fair prices, and substituting the proceeds of sale for the real estate sold, so far as the ownership and enjoyment thereof is concerned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b128-10\">2. That the Orphans\u2019 Court had power to order the sale in this case. Being the sale of an undivided interest, it was clearly within the discretion of the court to order a <em>private </em>sale : Act of Assembly, April 18th 1853, \u00a7 4, Purd. Dig. p. 700. To require the concurrent action of all parties owning interests in the land would defeat the object of the act in authorizing a private sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b128-11\">There was no error in the proceedings which will vitiate the sale. Tfie proceedings are regular in form, and even if they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>were not, the act itself cures all errors in the proceedings: Act April 18th 1853, \u00a7 5.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ALB\">November 18th 1861,</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-6\">It is alleged that a mistake was made as to the amount of interest held by the Thompson children. There is no allegation of fraud upon the part of any who were interested in the sale. There is no mistake evident upon the proceedings. If a mistake was made by the parties as to the interest of the minors, it is a mere mistake of law, and against such the court will not grant relief. If the guardian and .his counsel knew the rights of the children and disregarded them, or if they, through carelessness, failed to guard the interest of their wards, it might afford a ground of action against the guardian, but will not be sufficient to divest the title of the purchaser.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-7\">It might be sufficient to arrest the proceedings by appeal, but after the time for taking an appeal has passed, the court cannot, .even for the protection of minors, wrest the title from a purchaser to protect a guardian from the consequences of his improper or improvident acts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-8\">The Act of April 18th 1853, \u00a7 8, provides that; after a decree has been carried into effect, a reversal of the proceedings shall not affect the title of the purchaser.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b129-9\">The opinion of the court was delivered,</p>\n<author id=\"Ao9\">by Thompson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ArmL\">Unless we can, on some principle, or rule of practice, treat these decrees of sale and confirmation of the Orphans\u2019 Court as nullities, we cannot reach the error claimed as existing, and relied on as invalidating the title to Gilmore; for it lies, if any where, in the order of sale and its subsequent confirmation. Can we do so ?</p>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">The error alleged does not reach to the jurisdiction of the court: that is not controverted; but is claimed to consist partly in law and partly in fact, in making those decrees. This is the character of it if -we may treat it as appearing at all, which we may do for the present at least.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-12\">The Orphans\u2019 Court is and has been for a long time by statute a court of record, whose judgments and decrees, like those of any other court of record, are final and conclusive. See Act of 29th March 1832, \u00a7 2, P. L. 190, in which it is expressly declared that its decrees \u201cin all matters within its jurisdiction, shall not be reversed or avoided collaterally in any other court.\u201d Numerous cases cited in Merklein <em>v. </em>Trapnell <em>et al., </em>10 Casey 42, notice this; and the exceptions to its conclusiveness must be, as in other courts, fraud and want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-13\">Now, conceding an error here, how can we impeach the decree collaterally? That jurisdiction of the subject-matter of this decree, as well as of the proper parties, did exist is not denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>nor doubted, nor could it be. Standing unreversed and unappealed from, and the time for an appeal having gone by, which, by the eighth section of the act in question is twenty days, the decree is now, so far as it appears in this case, unimpeachable; and hence we are driven to the conclusion that the title resting on it is not defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">It was argued that the court had no power to order a private sale of the premises. But the argument was experimental only, for the second section of the Act of- 18th April 1853 is express, that it may be done on a petition by \u201cany trustee, guardian, or person interested; clearly setting forth the facts needful for the information of the court under oath or affirmation.\u201d The court may determine for themselves, or through the aid of an auditor, of the propriety of the sale on the terms proposed. The accuracy of all this is adjudicated upon and determined by the decree which follows. Error in these preliminaries cannot be redressed excepting by a reversal of the decree itself in some legal form. The decree binds until set aside. The Act of April 18th 1853 is a remedial statute, and is to be benignly expounded. The right to decree a private sale does not depend at all upon the existence of other undivided interests in the land, and the exhibition in the application of a willingness on part of other parties interested to take a given sum. That, by the statute, is one mode of determining on the propriety of the proposed sale, but it is not the only mode. The court or auditor may determine this question for themselves, and must do so always where the other joint owners are unwilling either to buy or sell. If this were not so, an obstinate co-tenant could virtually repeal the statute itself. The court had undoubtedly the power to decree \u25a0as they did here.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">We do not think the alleged mistake is patent in these proceedings. About $60 per acre, according to the best estimate of the petitioner, as he states, would be the value of the land. After setting out the interest proposed to be sold, the names of the heirs, the supposed necessity for the sale, and that Rodgers would purchase the \u201csame at the sum of $6000,\u201d payable on terms, he prays a sale. On this petition, accompanied by the request of the father and all the heirs, the court order and decree the sale \u201cfor the sum of $6000,\u201d without reference to the price per acre, and the return upon the order was \u201c sold unto W. W. Rodgers for the sum of $6000\u201d in bulk. It was claimed that the order was a sale at $60 por acre, and that this would have produced the gross amount coming to the Thompson heirs of $7865.71; and that this en-or resulted from a mistake in law, in supposing that the heirs of McNutt took <em>per stirpes, </em>and not <em>per capita. </em>Concession and admission may make out an error in this way, but I would construe the petition, order, and return, all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>having reference to a sale for $6000, and which was accordingly made, confirmed, and executed by a conveyance in due form. Whether or not this was the understanding of the parties most interested, we have no other proof than the significant silence of themselves, and their natural as well as official guardian, and the full release by an heir since come of ago on the receipt of the purchase-money.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">The time for the correction of the error has long since elapsed, and, for anything that appears before us in this case, the title of the plaintiff is not defective, and he must pay his bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b131-8\">Read, J., dissented.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
