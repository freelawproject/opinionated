To take the case out of the statute, plaintiff offered in evidence a due-bill, authenticated by witness, dated May 1st 1857, by Abraham Shaffer to John Shaffer, for $17.40, \u201c on settlement of a note as interest,\u201d together with an endorsement, in plaintiff\u2019s handwriting, on back of the note in suit, also dated May 1st 1857, \u201cReceived two years\u2019 interest, to April 1st 1857.\u201d Signed John Shaffer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-12\">Defendant objected to this evidence as incompetent to go to the jury.

These authorities dispose of the case, so far as the admissions of Abraham Shaffer are concerned.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AgJ\">October 31st 1861,</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-4\">The due-bill of May 1st 1857, and the endorsement on the note, were improperly sent to the jury. The former did not refer to the latter, but to \u201ca\u201d note which was <em>''settled.\u201d </em>The evidence was vague, uncertain, and dangerous. The credit on the note was in the handwriting of the plaintiff, and was within the time necessary to give validity to the note, without proof of when it was put there: 2 Gr. Ev. \u00a7 444; Adams <em>v. </em>Seitzinger, 1 W. &amp; S. 243; Cremer\u2019s Estate, 5 W. &amp; S. 331. Alone, neither of them was evidence. Admitted jointly, they were sufficient, but the credit on the note is valueless without proof of when it was made, which the due-bill does not establish, for it <em>may </em>have been made after suit brought. The case stands then on. the due-bill alone, which is insufficient: Suter <em>v. </em>Sheeler, 10 Harris 310; Shitler <em>v. </em>Bremer, 11 Harris 413; Burr <em>v. </em>Burr, 2 Casey 284.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b54-5\"><em>E. H. </em>Stowe, for defendant</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4j\">in error, cited and relied on Burr <em>v. </em>Burr, 2 Casey 284, and argued that the evidence was for the jury, to whom the case was properly submitted, under the ruling of this court in Vanhorn <em>v. </em>Scott, 4 Casey 317.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b54-6\">The opinion of the court was delivered,</p>\n<author id=\"AQ-\">by Strong, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ayx\">The question presented by this record, is whether the due-bill of Abraham Shaffer, dated May 1st 1857, and the endorsement of the same date on the note in suit, made in the handwriting of the plaintiff, either separately or together, take the case out of the Statute of Limitations. It is admitted that payment of interest on the note in suit, made May 1st 1857, would be an answer to the defendant\u2019s plea, because such an act would have been inconsistent with any other supposition than that the defendant then acknowledged his continued liability. The question in debate therefore may be stated thus: \u2014 Do the due-bill and the endorsement furnish any evidence, that should be submitted to a jury, from which they might find that the defendant paid interest on the note in suit on the first day of May 1857 ? It is clear that the endorsement alone was not proper to go to the jury. It was in the handwriting of the plaintiff, and there was no proof that it was made at the time of its date, unless such proof was furnished by the due-bill. Endorsements \u2019 made by the pfoinissee, before the statute has closed upon the right to maintain suit, are undoubtedly evidence of corresponding .payments-, to remove the bar of the statute, in this state, though no longer in England, but it has always been held that they are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>not evidence at all, unless proved to have been made while the statute was running: Addams <em>v. </em>Seitzinger, 1 W. &amp; S. 243; Cremer\u2019s Estate, 5 W. &amp; S. 331. They are evidence made by a plaintiff for himself, and upon general principles would not be receivable at all. The exception is admitted because endorsements by the plaintiff are declarations against his own interest, when made within six years from the promise. When made afterwards, the reason for their admission entirely fails. It is equally clear that the due-bill of itself was insufficient to prove that interest was paid on the note, at any time, much less on the 1st of May 1857. The due-bill acknowledges the defendant\u2019s indebtedness to the plaintiff in $17.40, \u201c on settlement of a note as interest.\u201d Now construing this as an admission of indebtedness for interest on a note (the most favourable construction for the plaintiff), it still does not identify the note. It does not point plainly and unmistakeably to that in suit. It may have been interest on a different note. It will not ansAver to say that this was a question for the jury. Not so. The modern authorities are uniform to the contrary. The statute itself does not contemplate any removal of the bar by an acknowledgment, or even a new promise. And although such an effect has been alloAYed to them by the courts, yet it is now everywhere held, that \u201c Avhere the bar of the statute is sought to be removed by a new promise, the promise, as a new cause of action, ought to be proved in a clear and explicit manner, and be in its terms unequivocal and determinate:\u201d 2 Greenleaf\u2019s Ev. \u00a7 440. Mr. Greenleaf has collected a considerable number of eases, and he deduces from them the doctrine, that if there be circumstances accompanying an acknoAvledgment, \u201c which repel the presumption of a promise or intention to pay, or if the expressions be equivocal, vague, and indeterminate, leading to no certain conclusion, but at best to possible inferences Ayhich may affect different minds in different Avays, it has been held that they ought not to go to a jury as evidence of a neAV promise to revive the cause of action;\u201d \u00a7 440. This is assuredly settled in this state. Thus in Morgan <em>v. </em>Walton, 4 Barr 321, Which Avas <em>assumpsit </em>for a book account, the proof Avas that the defendant had said to the son of the plaintiff, \u201cI OAYe your father, but tell your father I cannot pay him this fall, nor before next spring; but next spring I intend to settle with your father, and pay him Avhat I OAve him. Either pay him what I OAYe him, or his account.\u201d The witness was not sure Avhich. This was held insufficient, because it left an uncertainty whether the debtor referred to the part of the account not barred by the statute, or to the AYhole together. In Suter <em>v. </em>Sheeler, 11 Harris 308, it Avas held that if the evidence proves no recognition of an amount, or of the instrument of indebtedness, or other circumstances of identification, the debt in suit cannot be regarded as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>revived. A similar doctrine was held in Shitler <em>v. </em>Bremer, 11 Harris 413. In Burr <em>v. </em>Burr, 2 Casey 284, the evidence was that the plaintiff, who sued on a note, had said to the defendant, \u201c Israel, can thee let me have a little money on that note which I hold of thine ?\u201d To which he replied, \u201c How much would thee .like, mother?\u201d Upon her answering, \u201cfour or five dollars,\u201d he gave her seven, saying, \u201cIs that sufficient?\u201d She answered, \u201cIt is for the present.\u201d This was ruled insufficient, because it was not proved unequivocally that the payment was made on <em>the </em>note in suit. This court held, therefore, that the jury were not at liberty to find that it ivas. The evidence was more direct and pointed in that case than it is in the present. These rulings abundantly prove that the due-bill given in evidence by the plain\u2022tiff, could not avail to take his case out of the statute. It did :not prove that a payment was made on the note in suit on the 1st of May 1857.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">And if it did not prove a payment on the note then, how could it prove that the endorsement by the plaintiff was then made ? The endorsement is important only as evidence of a payment, \u2022'for it is a payment and not an endorsement which constitutes an acknowledgment. The defendant\u2019s declaration made in his due-bill, is entirely consistent with the endorsement having been made even after suit was brought. When a plaintiff offers his own declarations as evidence to rebut the plea of the statute, he must show that they were made when it was against his interest .to make them. He must not leave this to inference, or in doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">We think, therefore, the court erred in entering judgment upon the reserved points for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">The judgment is reversed, and judgment is entered upon the reserved points for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
