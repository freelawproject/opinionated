If this were so, it would follow that they could not be returned to the principal, without applying to the creditor, and obtaining his consent to the surrender; a conclusion so extreme as to show that the principle which leads to it must be an error. But while such securities are not in any just sense of the word trusts, unless made so expressly, they are, notwithstanding, charged with duties and obligations which may render it necessary to award them to the creditor, as the only means of doing justice between the principal and the surety. For although the surety may, under ordinary circumstances, consent that they shall be applied to other debts of the principal, instead of that which they were meant to secure, or the principal release all claim upon them in favour of the surety, without giving any just ground of complaint to the creditor; this is true only so long as the parties are solvent, and the securities remain in the hands of the parties, and subject to their disposition, and ceases to be so when they are turned into a fund for the payment of debts by an assignment or execution. The duty of appropriating them then devolves on the law, which will act with due regard to the claims both of the principal and the surety, and not suffer the fund to be diverted from the debt, in which they have a common interest, to any collateral purpose. To borrow an illustration from mechanics \u2014 the ease is, then, that of a body impelled by two forces, which cannot pursue the direction of either without conflict with the other, and must therefore move in that of their resultant, which will conduct it directly to the pocket of the creditor. This will be apparent on referring to the decision of Judge Cadwalader, in the case of Winter <em>v. </em>Ludlow, where the cases are examined and methodized with a fulness and precision which will leave the reader little to learn by extending his researches in other quarters.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>\u201c It is a necessary consequence of these principles that where land, bound by a judgment given as an indemnity, is sold under a subsequent judgment against the principal, the proceeds cannot be awarded to the surety without prejudicing the principal, who would be deprived of the means of paying the debt, nor to the principal or the plaintiff in the subsequent judgment without depriving the surety of his indemnity, and must be applied to the payment of the debt for which the surety has made himself answerable, as the only mode of disposing of them consistent with equity. If, therefore, the contest here lay solely between a judgment obtained against A. and B. for a debt due by A. as pi\u2019incipal, and B. as surety, and a prior judgment given by A. to B., as a protection against the debt, B. could not turn the judgment held by him from its true object, and use it as a means of preventing the satisfaction of an obligation which he was bound to fulfil. But the peculiarity of the case is, that B.\u2019s -judgment was given not only as an indemnity for the debt which he owed jointly with A., but also for a debt which A. owed to him, and it is said that so far as this latter debt is concerned he is free from any equity, and may use his prior lien as a means of obtaining payment. 1$ iowever, plain that a man who sets up a lien or hold on thejfelsll of another, as a reason why it should not go to the paymeiRrdff a debt for which they are both jointly bound, sins against th$oiprinciples of justice, which require that all rights which are, or partake of the nature of rights of property, should be used for the purpose of satisfying, and not of preventing the satisfaction of the debts of those who hold them. That property which has been taken in execution under a judgment against two defendants belongs to both of them, is obviously no reason why the proceeds should not be paid to the creditor, and the case is substantially the same when one of the defendants holds a lien or encumbrance on the property in question, and the other its body or <em>corpus, </em>unless the circumstance that the right of the former is less, puts him in a better position than if it were greater, and exonerates him from the operation of the jn\u2019inciple that rights are to be postponed to duties and obligations. And no court should permit a defendant to say to a plaintiff, it is true, I owe you the money for which you have obtained judgment against me, and also true that you have levied on the effects of my co-defendant, who also owes it, but I have a prior lien on those effects for another debt, and will use it, not to facilitate the levy, but to defeat it <em>pro tanto, </em>or altogether, by diverting the proceeds from your pocket to my own, where they will be, and perhaps remain beyond the reach of any remedy that the law can give you. But it is unnecessary to examine the question on principle,' because the eases of Erb\u2019s Appeal, 2 Penna. R. 296, and Heims <em>v. </em>Barnitz, 8 Watts 89, only differ from that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>now before us in the fact that the first judgment was originally obtained and held by a third person, by whom it might unquestionably have been enforced to the exclusion of the second; and the decision of the court that it lost its priority by passing into the hands of one of the defendants in the second judgment, and could not be used by him for the purpose of preventing the collection of the debt out of the property bound by its lion, applies d <em>fortiori </em>in the present instance, where the elder judgment was designed in part as an indemnity against the obligation of the younger.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-6\">\u201c The exceptions to the report of the auditor are sustained, and the balance of the fund in court awarded to William C. Richardson and James 0. Pease, as being the parties equitably entitled to it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-7\">The case was then removed into this court, where the following errors were assigned:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-8\">1. The learned court erred in awarding the balance of the fund to Richardson &amp; Pease.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-9\">2.

To secure to plaintiff the repayment of money already loaned and advanced by him on defendant\u2019s account. When that was accomplished, then, 2d. To secure the plaintiff against endorsements made by him on behalf of the defendant; and then, 3d. To secure the balance which might be made by sale to the other creditors of defendant. Appellant, therefore, became a trustee for the two latter purposes mentioned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b531-13\">There -were then two executions levied upon the personal property of Washington M. Worrall, of which the appellant\u2019s was first by twenty-two days.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b531-14\">The proceeds of the sale were not enough to satisfy the first of the three purposes for which the first judgment was given, for there is due from Washington to William P. Worrall $2021.84, while the balance for distribution is only $1241.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b531-15\">The case is precisely the same as if appellant had taken three separate judgments for the three separate objects mentioned, and had proceeded only on the first; or one judgment for the money he was actually out of pocket: and therefore the principles invoked by the court below in the determination of the case are inapplicable. It is not pretended that the fund for distribution wras raised-out of any security which had been placed in appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>la'nt\u2019s hands by W. M. Worrall, to indemnify him against his position as surety; and therefore the cases of Erb\u2019s Appeal, Heims <em>v. </em>Barnitz, and Winter <em>v. </em>Ludlow, cited by the court, cannot influence the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b532-6\">In distributing the proceeds of the sale of the personal property of Washington M. Worrall, is it enough to deprive appellant\u2019s writ of its twenty-two days\u2019 priority, to say that the appellant was a defendant in appellee\u2019s writ ? Is the writ of Richardson airy more operative as against the property of W. M. Worrall, because W. P. Worrall is a co-defcndant, as to whom the sheriff returns <em>\u201cnulla bona?\u201d </em>The law is, that the earliest writ has priority as to personal property. This is subject to qualification, when there is collusion between the plaintiff in the earlier writ and the defendant. The fraud takes aAvay the priority. Is it necessary that circumstances like the present should extend the qualification? The writ of the appellant was fully operative, but the judgment of the court belowr renders it a nullity, and for no fraud or irregularity whatever, nor because appellant was one of the defendants in appellee\u2019s writ. It ignores appellant\u2019s priority as against the property of W. M. Worrall, on the one hand, while on the other, in the pursuit of a claim against W. P. Worrall, it gives appellees all the advantages of an attachment upon an ordinary <em>fi. fa. </em>As against W. M. Worrall\u2019s property, his execution is <em>second, </em>and must be postponed; as against W. P. Worrall, he cannot take at all out of W. M. Worrall\u2019s property, upon a <em>fi. fa.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b532-7\">Nor have the appellees any equity which entitles them to priority. The appellant claims the right of distributing his own assets among his creditors in his own way, unless the law clearly puts the same out of his power. The appellees purpose availing themgelves of a preference to which it is urged they have no legal right. .</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b532-8\"><em>John Q. Bullitt, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARk\">The case is controlled by the established principle in equity, that when two persons become jointly bound to a third person, one as surety to the other, and the principal debtor gives to the surety any securities for indemnity to him against such obligation, then, in case of the insolvency of the joint obligors, the \u201c creditor is entitled to all the securities taken by the surety of his debtor, either for the purpose of securing the payment of the debt to the creditor, or for the purpose of indemnifying himself against the payment of it:\u201d Story\u2019s Eq. Jur. vol. 1, p. 569; Cornwell\u2019s Appeal, 7 W. &amp; S. 308; Himes <em>v. </em>Barnitz, 8 Watts 45; Erb\u2019s Appeal, 2 Penna.

But if awarded to the appellant the appellees will be injured, as it deprives them of a legal right to the money raised by the sale, and subject to distribution by the court. No other mode can be adopted by which to work out the equity of the appellees. William P. Worrall is insolvent. If awarded to him, the appellees inevitably lose the whole amount. Equity avoids circuity of action when it can reach directly what might be done indirectly.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ACg\">February 17th 1862,</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-6\">The appellees have a right to compel William P.

Worrall is estopped by his.position as defendant in the appellees\u2019 execution, from denying their right to the money raised by a sale under it.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b533-8\">The opinion of the court was delivered,</p>\n<author id=\"Aa5\">by Woodward, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZz\">W. P. Worrall having bound himself as surety for the debt of W. M. Worrall to Richardson &amp; Pease, took a judgment against his principal, Wm. M. Worrall, for an amount of actual indebtedness, and for his indemnity against this and other liabilities, which he had assumed for the benefit of W. M. Worrall. On this judgment W. P. Worrall issued a <em>ft. fa. </em>August 3d 1859, and levied it on the goods of W. M. Worrall.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">The instrument of suretyship given by W. P. Worrall to Richardson &amp; Pease was a joint judgment against himself and W. M. Worrall, and on this judgment <em>ajft. fa. </em>was issued August 25th 1859, and levied on the same goods of W. M. Worrall as the prior writ above named. The goods were sold under both writs, and the question is, to which of them shall the proceeds of sale be applied ? It is part of the case that W. P. Worrall was insolvent on the 3d August 1859, and still is.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-11\">The auditor awarded the money to W. P. Worrall, on account of the priority of his execution, but the court reversed the auditor\u2019s distribution, and gave the money to Richardson &amp; Pease. The reasons of the learned judge are satisfactory to us. His ruling is justified by-the principle that was asserted in Erb\u2019s Appeal, 2 Ponna. R. 296, and in Himes <em>v. </em>Barnitz, 8 Watts 39. The funds for distribution in these cases arose from sales of real estate: in this case the fund is raised from personalty, hut this circumstance cannot affect the application of the equitable principle which forbids a joint debtor, who is insolvent, to divert a fund from a creditor to whom he owes it, into his own irresponsible pocket. True, W. P. Worrall\u2019s prior lien on the goods was a legal right, superior to any right which Richardson &amp; Pease <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>acquired to the goods. But their right to demand the debt of W. P. Worrall was as legal and complete as his right to the proceeds of sale. The money is here for distribution, and equity will take notice of the legal rights of both parties. It will not overlook the fact that W. P. Worrall is attempting to intercept the fund by means of a judgment and execution, which were, in part at least, his indemnity against this very claim of Richardson &amp; Pease, and that if the fund be awarded to him, it will, by reason of his insolvency, be lost to Richardson &amp; Pease. To enforce his right under such circumstances, to the defeat of his obligation, would be inequitable and unjust. He is no better entitled to receive the fruits of the sale than he is bound to pay them over to Richardson &amp; Pease. As it would be equitable for him to hand over the money to Richardson &amp; Pease as soon as it should come into his hands, equity will take care to secure this result by not letting the money go into his hands at all, but will dispose of it as it would be his duty to apply it.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">The decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
