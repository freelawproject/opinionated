St. Hugh Williams filed in a Florida court a complaint that, while working onboard the <em>MJV </em>Norwegian Sky, he was injured as a result of the negligence and other tortious conduct of the owner of the ship, NCL (Bahamas) Ltd. <em>See </em>46 U.S.C. \u00a7 30104. NCL removed the action to the district court on the ground that Williams was contractually bound to arbitrate his complaint under the United Nations Convention on Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 205, but Williams moved to remand the action to state court. The district court ruled that the arbitration clause was unenforceable, <em>see Thomas v. Carnival Corp., </em>573 F.3d 1113 (11th Cir.2009), and then the district court granted Williams\u2019s motion to remand. NCL appealed, and this Court later held, in <em>Lindo v. NCL (Bahamas) Ltd., </em>652 F.3d 1257 (11th Cir.2011), that an agreement to arbitrate under the Convention is enforceable. Williams argues that this Court lacks jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d), but we have jurisdiction to review the denial of the motion to compel under <em>City of Waco </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1171\">*1171</page-number><em>v. U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>293 U.S. 140, 55 S.Ct. 6, 79 L.Ed. 244 (1934). We reverse the order denying the motion to compel of NCL, vacate the order remanding Williams\u2019s complaint to state court, and remand with instructions to compel arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-5\">We may review the denial of the motion of NCL to compel arbitration under an exception to section 1447(d). In <em>Waco, </em>the Supreme Court held that an appellate court may review a decision of the district court that \u201cin logic and in fact ... preceded that of remand\u201d and that, \u201cif not reversed or set aside, is conclusive upon\u201d the appellant. 293 U.S. at 143, 55 S.Ct. at 7. Waco \u201callows [an appellate court] to review district court orders that lead to, but are separate from, orders of remand and have a conclusive effect upon the ensuing state court action.\u201d <em>Aquamar, S.A v. Del Monte Fresh Produce N.A., Inc., </em>179 F.3d 1279, 1286 (11th Cir.1999). The ruling that the arbitration clause was unenforceable was separate from and led to the order of remand. The district court resolved the merits of the motion to compel and then ruled that it lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the dispute between Williams and NCL. The ruling also \u201cchanges the contours of the state court action after remand.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under Florida law, collateral estoppel applies when the identical issue has been \u201cfully litigated\u201d between the identical parties and \u201cdetermined in a contest that resulted] in a final decision of a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d <em>City of Oldsmar v. State, </em>790 So.2d 1042, 1046 n. 4 (Fla.2001). On remand to a Florida court, NCL would be barred from compelling Williams to arbitrate his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-6\">The district court erred when it denied the motion of NCL to compel Williams to arbitrate his complaint. The district court based its ruling on our decision in <em>Thomas v. Carnival, </em>573 F.3d at 1122-24, where we refused to enforce an agreement to arbitrate under the United Nations Convention on the ground that it was \u201cnull and void as a matter of public policy\u201d because the complainant could not assert statutory claims for relief. We have since ruled in <em>Lindo </em>that <em>Thomas </em>is inconsistent with our prior precedent in <em>Bautista v. Star Cruises, </em>396 F.3d 1289, 1302 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cTo the extent <em>Thomas </em>was applying Article II\u201d of the Convention, <em>Thomas </em>\u201cfailed to follow our precedent in ... <em>Bautista </em>\u201d by recognizing public policy as an additional defense to enforcement of an arbitration agreement. <em>Lindo, </em>652 F.3d at 1277-78. Our precedent dictates that a court must enforce an agreement to arbitrate under the Convention unless that agreement is \u201cnull and void\u201d as being \u201cobtained through those limited situations, such as \u2018fraud, mistake, duress, and waiver,\u2019 constituting \u2018standard breach-of-contract defenses\u2019 that \u2018can be applied neutrally on an international scale.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1276 (quoting <em>Bautista, </em>396 F.3d at 1302). Williams did not assert any of these grounds in response to the motion to compel, and NCL was entitled to compel Williams to arbitrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-8\">We REVERSE the order denying the motion to compel of NCL, VACATE the order remanding this action to state court, and REMAND with instructions to compel Williams to arbitrate his dispute with NCL.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
