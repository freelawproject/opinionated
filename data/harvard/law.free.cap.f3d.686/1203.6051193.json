He contends that Amendment 759 to the sentencing guidelines, U.S.S.G. App. C, amend. 759 (Nov. 2011), abrogates our holding in <em>United States v. Mills, </em>613 F.3d 1070 (11th Cir.2010), and gives the district court authority to reduce his sentence as a result of Amendment 750, which revised the crack cocaine quantity tables in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 to conform to the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. App. C, amend. 750 (Nov. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-13\">In 2005, Glover pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute crack cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A), and \u00a7 846, and one count of possession with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of crack cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A). The presentence investigation report recommended a base offense level of 38 under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l) (Nov. 2004) because the offense involved 2 kilograms of crack cocaine. The PSR recommended a 3-level decrease for acceptance of responsibility under \u00a7 3E1.1, which resulted in a total offense level of 35. It determined that Glover had a criminal history category of II. That total offense level, combined with that criminal history category, normally leads to a guidelines range of 188 to 235 months in prison. Glover, however, was subject to a mandatory minimum life sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) because he had at least two \u201cprior convictions for a felony drug offense.\u201d Because the statutory mandatory minimum sentence was greater than the otherwise applicable guidelines range, the statutory mandatory minimum of life imprisonment became the guidelines range of life in prison. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b). This is important. Glover did not have a guidelines range of 188 to 235 months in prison. Instead, because of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1205\">*1205</page-number>prior drug offenses, he had a guidelines range of life in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-4\">That is the guidelines range the PSR recommended, and the district court adopted that recommendation. The government filed a motion under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 stating that Glover had provided \u201csubstantial assistance\u201d to the government. Based on that motion, the district court departed downward from Glover\u2019s guidelines range of life in prison and sentenced him to 204 months in prison on each count, with each sentence to run concurrently. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) (\u201cUpon motion of the Government, the court shall have the authority to impose a sentence below a level established by statute as a minimum sentence so as to reflect a defendant\u2019s substantial assistance ....\u201d); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. Glover did not file a direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-5\">In November 2011, the United States Sentencing Commission promulgated Amendment 750 to the sentencing guidelines, which, among other things, lowered the base offense level from 38 to 34 for crack cocaine offenses like Glover\u2019s that involve 2 kilograms of crack cocaine. U.S.S.G. App. C, amend. 750; <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(3) (Nov. 2011). The Sentencing Commission also made that part of Amendment 750 retroactive. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-6\">Glover filed a <em>pro se </em>motion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce his sentence, contending that under Amendment 750 his new total offense level is 31 (a base offense level of 34 with a 3-level decrease for acceptance of responsibility), his criminal history category is still II, making his new guidelines range 121 to 151 months in prison. The district court denied that motion after \u201cconcluding] that [Glover] is not eligible for a reduction under Amendment 750.\u201d Glover filed a motion for reconsideration, which the district court also denied. This is Glover\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-9\">We turn first to the government\u2019s contention that Glover\u2019s appeal is untimely. We review <em>de novo </em>whether an appeal should be dismissed as untimely. <em>See United States v. Lopez, </em>562 F.3d 1309, 1311 (11th Cir.2009). A criminal defendant has 14 days from the date that an order or judgment is entered to file a notice of appeal. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A). \u201cAlthough a motion for reconsideration of a district court order in a criminal action is not expressly authorized by the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,\u201d the filing of such a motion within the 14-day period for filing a notice of appeal \u201ctolls the time for filing a notice of appeal and the time begins to run anew following disposition of the motion.\u201d <em>United States v. Vicaria, </em>963 F.2d 1412, 1413-14 (11th Cir.1992) (citing <em>United States v. Dieter, </em>429 U.S. 6, 8-9, 97 S.Ct. 18, 19-20, 50 L.Ed.2d 8 (1976)). \u201cUnder the \u2018prison mailbox rule,\u2019 a <em>pro se </em>prisoner\u2019s court filing is deemed filed on the date it is delivered to prison authorities for mailing.\u201d <em>Williams v. McNeil, </em>557 F.3d 1287, 1290 n. 2 (11th Cir.2009); <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(c)(1) (\u201cIf an inmate confined in an institution files a notice of appeal in either a civil or a criminal case, the notice is timely if it is deposited in the institution\u2019s internal mail system on or before the last day for filing.\u201d). Unless there is evidence to the contrary, like prison logs or other records, we assume that a prisoner\u2019s motion was delivered to prison authorities on the day he signed it. <em>See Washington v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 1299, 1301 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-10\">The district court denied Glover\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion on December 22, 2011, and Glover signed his motion for reconsideration 14 days later on January 5, 2012, which tolled the period for filing a notice of appeal. <em>See Vicaria, </em>963 F.2d at 1413-14. The district court denied the motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number>reconsideration on January 17, 2012, which restarted Glover\u2019s 14-day period for filing a notice of appeal. <em>See id. </em>Glover signed a notice of appeal 7 days later on January 24, 2012, so his appeal is timely.</p>\n<p id=\"Auf\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"ACt\">Now for the merits issue. Glover contends that the combined force of Amendments 750 and 759 to the sentencing guidelines makes him eligible for a sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusion that a defendant is not eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See Mills, </em>613 F.3d at 1074.</p>\n<p id=\"AoA\">A district court may reduce the prison sentence of a \u201cdefendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment <em>based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered </em>by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (emphasis added). Any reduction must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Commission\u2019s policy statement on \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reductions explains that \u201c[a] reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is not consistent with th[e] policy statement and therefore is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) <em>if ... an amendment ... does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B) (Nov. 2011) (emphasis added). The commentary to that policy statement further explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Axo\">[A] reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and is not consistent with th[e] policy statement if ... an amendment ... is applicable to a defendant but <em>the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of </em>the operation of another guideline or statutory provision <em>(e.g., a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Amr\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A) (emphasis added). So, the statutory provision, the Sentencing Commission\u2019s corresponding policy statement, and the commentary to that policy statement all make it clear that a court cannot use an amendment to reduce a sentence in a particular case unless that amendment actually lowers the guidelines range in that case. It is that simple.</p>\n<p id=\"AaD\">And it makes sense. The purpose of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is to give a defendant the benefit of a retroactively applicable amendment to the guidelines. That provision gives the defendant an opportunity to receive the same sentence he would have received if the guidelines that applied at the time of his sentencing had been the same as the guidelines that applied after the amendment. But he is not to receive a lower sentence than he would have received if the amendment had been in effect at the time of his sentencing. The goal is to treat a defendant sentenced before the amendment the same as those sentenced after the amendment. That is why an amendment that alters the initial calculation of a guidelines range is not to be applied in a case where the difference in the initial calculation would have made no difference because a mandatory minimum would have trumped the initial calculation and dictated the final guidelines range anyway.</p>\n<p id=\"ACeH\">In <em>Mills, </em>we held that \u201c[t]he law is clear that a sentencing court lacks jurisdiction to consider a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, even when an amendment would lower the defendant\u2019s otherwise-applicable Guidelines sentencing range, when the defendant was sentenced on the basis of a mandatory minimum.\u201d 613 F.3d at 1078. That holding controls here. Glover was sentenced based on a guidelines range of life in prison because he was subject to a statutory mandatory minimum life sentence as a re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number>suit of his prior felony drug convictions. Because his guidelines range was based on a statutory mandatory minimum, Amendment 750 did not lower Glover\u2019s guidelines range. Because Amendment 750 did not lower his guidelines range, Glover is not eligible for a sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See Mills, </em>613 F.3d at 1078 (\u201c[T]he provision governing the Defendants\u2019 sentences, and the provision from which the district courts granted substantial assistance departures, was the range set by the statutory mandatory minimum, not the Guidelines sentencing range for crack cocaine offenses that was subsequently changed by Amendment 706.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 1079 (\u201cThe statutory mandatory m\u00ednimums to which Defendants were subject meant that they were not sentenced \u2018based on a sentencing range\u2019 subsequently lowered by Amendment 706.\u201d (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2))).</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-5\">Glover contends that Amendment 759 to the guidelines abrogated our holding in <em>Mills </em>and similar decisions and gave the district court authority to lower his sentence because he provided substantial assistance to the government, even though neither that amendment nor any other amendment lowered his actual guidelines range. He is wrong. Amendment 759, which the Commission promulgated after we decided <em>Mills, </em>amended <em>U.S.S.G. </em>\u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. App. C, amend. 759. Section 1B1.10(b)(2)(A) provides that a district court may not \u201creduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) ... to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range.\u201d Before Amendment 759, an exception to that limitation allowed a district court to lower a defendant\u2019s prison sentence below the amended guidelines range if the original sentence was, for any reason, below the original guidelines range. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(B) (Nov. 2010). After Amendment 759, however, a district court may lower a defendant\u2019s sentence below the amended guidelines range only if the original sentence was below the original guidelines range because the defendant provided substantial assistance to the government. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(B) (Nov. 2011) (\u201cIf the term of imprisonment imposed was less than the term of imprisonment provided by the guideline range applicable to the defendant at the time of sentencing pursuant to a government motion to reflect the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance to authorities, a reduction comparably less than the amended guideline range determined under subdivision (1) of this subsection may be appropriate.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-9\">Amendment 759 did nothing more than limit a district court\u2019s authority to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence below the amended guidelines range.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Contrary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1208\">*1208</page-number>Glover\u2019s argument, the amendment does not permit a court to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence based on a guidelines amendment that does not lower his guidelines range. Instead, as we have discussed, a court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on a retroactive amendment to crack cocaine base offense levels if and only if that retroactive amendment actually lowers the defendant\u2019s guidelines range. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (\u201c[I]n the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment <em>based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered </em>by the Sentencing Commission ... the court may reduce the term of imprisonment .... \u201d (emphasis added)); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A) (\u201c[A] reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and is not consistent with th[e] policy statement if ... the amendment <em>does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guidelines range </em>because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision <em>(e. g., a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment)\u201d </em>(emphasis added)); <em>Mills, </em>613 F.3d at 1078. Glover\u2019s guidelines range was \u2014 and still is \u2014 life in prison. Neither Amendment 750 nor 759 changes that. And because neither amendment changes his guidelines range, Glover is not entitled to resentencing under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1199-6\">. The Sentencing Commission explained its reasoning behind the change:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1199-7\">The [pre-amendment] version of \u00a7 IB 1.10 ... dr[ew] a ... distinction for cases in which the term of imprisonment was less than the minimum of the applicable guideline range, one rule for downward departures (stating that \"a reduction comparably less than the amended guideline range ... may be appropriate\u201d) and another rule for variances (stating that \"a further reduction generally would not be appropriate\u201d). <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B 1.10(b)(2)(B).... The Commission has determined that, in the specific context of \u00a7 IB 1.10, a single limitation [to sentence reductions below the amendment guidelines range] applicable to both departures and variances furthers the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities and avoids litigation in individual cases. The limitation that prohibits a reduction below the amended guideline range in such cases promotes conformity with the amended guideline range and avoids undue complexity and litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1199-11\">U.S.S.G. App. C, amend. 759, reason for amend. The Commission decided to allow the district court to reduce a defendant's sentence below the amended guidelines range only if that defendant was originally sentenced below the original guidelines range <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1208\">*1208</page-number>based on substantial assistance, reasoning that ''[t]he guidelines and the relevant statutes have long recognized that defendants who provide substantial assistance are differently situated than other defendants and should be considered for a sentence below a guideline or statutory minimum even when defendants who are otherwise similar (but did not provide substantial assistance) are subject to a guideline or statutory minimum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Glover argues that the Commission's emphasis on substantial assistance in its reasoning undermines our holding in <em>Mills, </em>but it does not. Our holding in <em>Mills </em>controls this case because Glover's guidelines range is the same after the amendment as it was before.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
