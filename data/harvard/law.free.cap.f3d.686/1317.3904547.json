On appeal, Lawson argues that, based on the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), he was entitled to a sentence reduction under Amendment 750. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Lawson\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-8\">A jury convicted Lawson of knowingly and intentionally distributing a mixture and substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine base, also known as crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C). Prior to sentencing, a probation officer completed a presentence investigation report, in which Lawson was assigned a base offense level of 20, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(3). The adjusted offense level was increased to 34, pursuant to \u00a7 4Bl.l(b), because Lawson was a career offender. Due to Lawson\u2019s career-offender status, he was assigned a criminal history category of VI, under \u00a7 4B1.1. Based on a total offense level of 34 and a criminal history category of VI, Lawson\u2019s guideline range was 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment. At sentencing, the district court considered the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and sentenced Lawson to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-9\">In November 2011, Lawson filed a <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on Amendment 750. The district court denied the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because Lawson\u2019s guideline range, based on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, had not been lowered by Amendment 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-12\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008). We are bound by a prior panel opinion until the opinion\u2019s holding is overruled by the Supreme Court or by our Court sitting <em>en banc. United States v. Kaley, </em>579 F.3d 1246, 1255 (11th Cir.2009). A Supreme Court decision does not overrule one of our prior opinions unless the Supreme Court decision is \u201cclearly on point.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). The Supreme Court decision must actually conflict with, and not \u201cmerely weaken,\u201d our opinion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1311-13\">A court may only modify a term of imprisonment in limited circumstances, including where a defendant \u201chas been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Amendment 750, effective November 1, 2011, made permanent an amendment lowering the base offense levels for particular crack cocaine quantities in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amends. 748, 750. Neither Amendment 748 nor Amendment 750 made any changes to \u00a7 4B1.1, the career-offender guideline. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1311-14\">The offense level for a career offender is determined by \u00a7 4Bl.l(b), rather than \u00a7 2D1.1, and a career offender automatically receives a criminal history category of VI. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1320\">*1320</page-number><em>Moore, we </em>explained that, because the defendants had been sentenced as career offenders under \u00a7 4B1.1, their \u201cbase offense levels under \u00a7 2D1.1 played no role in the calculation of [their guideline] ranges.\u201d 541 F.3d at 1327. We held that, \u201c[w]here a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1330. Thus, the defendants in <em>Moore </em>were not entitled to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief because only their base offense levels, and not their guideline ranges, were affected by the relevant sentencing amendment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1312-4\">In <em>Freeman, </em>the question before the Supreme Court was whether defendants who entered into Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreements were eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. 131 S.Ct. at 2690. A plurality of the Court determined that, when a district court\u2019s decision to accept a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea was based on the Sentencing Guidelines, the defendant was eligible to seek relief under \u00a7 3582(e)(2). <em>Id. </em>at 2695 (plurality opinion). The plurality explained that, although Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreements included binding sentencing recommendations, before accepting such a recommendation, a district court was required to evaluate \u201cthe recommended sentence in light of the defendant\u2019s applicable sentencing range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2692 (plurality opinion). The court could then accept that the sentence, whether it was within or outside of the guideline range, so long as the sentence was appropriate under the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>(plurality opinion). Thus, where a court accepted a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea, that \u201cacceptance ... itself [was] based on the Guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(plurality opinion). \u201cWhere the decision to impose a sentence [was] based on a range later subject to retroactive amendment, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) permits a sentence reduction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2690 (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-7\">Justice Sotomayor concurred in the judgment only. <em>Id. </em>at 2695 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in the judgment). Justice Sotomayor explained that a sentence imposed pursuant to a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement was based on the plea agreement itself, not on the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range. <em>Id. </em>(Sotomayor, J., concurring in the judgment). Nonetheless, where a plea agreement expressly applied a guideline range, Justice Sotomayor agreed that the plea agreement was based on that guideline range. <em>Id. </em>(Sotomayor, J., concurring in the judgment). If that guideline range was later lowered by the Sentencing Commission, the defendant was eligible to seek \u00a7 3582(c) relief. <em>Id. </em>(Sotomayor, J., concurring in the judgment). Finally, Justice Sotomayor determined that, based on the language in the plea agreement at issue, the defendant\u2019s sentence was based on the guideline range determined by the quantity of drugs in the case, the defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility, and the defendant\u2019s criminal history category. <em>Id. </em>at 2699-700 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in the judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-8\">The district court did not err in denying Lawson\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1321\">*1321</page-number>First, <em>Moore </em>remains binding precedent because it has not been overruled. <em>See Kaley, </em>579 F.3d at 1255. Neither the plurality opinion nor Justice Sotomayor\u2019s concurrence<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in <em>Freeman </em>addressed defendants who were assigned a base offense level under one guideline section, but who were ultimately assigned a total offense level and guideline range under \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>See generally Freeman, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2690-700. Thus, <em>Freeman </em>is not \u201cclearly on point\u201d to the issue that arose in <em>Moore, </em>where the defendants were assigned a base offense level under one guideline section, but then assigned a total offense level and guideline range under a different guideline section. <em>Kaley, </em>579 F.3d at 1255 (quotation omitted); <em>see Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-5\">Additionally, the district court correctly denied Lawson\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because his guideline range was not lowered by Amendment 750. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327, 1330. Like the defendants in <em>Moore, </em>Lawson was initially assigned a base offense level under \u00a7 2D1.1. <em>See id. </em>at 1327. His total offense level and guideline range, however, were based on \u00a7 4B1.1, not \u00a7 2D1.1, because he was a career offender. <em>See id. </em>Lawson\u2019s base offense level under \u00a7 2D1.1 did not affect the calculation of his guideline range. <em>See id. </em>Thus, Amendment 750, which reduced base offense levels in \u00a7 2D1.1, but not in \u00a7 4B1.1, did \u201cnot alter the sentencing range upon which [Lawson\u2019s] sentence was based, [and] \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1330; <em>see </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amends. 748, 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Lawson\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1312-5\">. The government asserts, and Lawson disputes, that plain error review applies to this appeal. As the district court's order was not erroneous, plain or otherwise, we do not determine whether plain error review is applicable. <em>See United States v. Jackson, </em>613 F.3d 1305, 1307 n. 1 (11th Cir.2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1677, 179 L.Ed.2d 622 (2011) (declining to decide whether plain error review applied because the standard of review did not affect the outcome of the appeal).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1313-6\">. Generally, when a Supreme Court decision lacks a majority opinion, \"the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.\u201d <em>Marks v. United States, </em>430 U.S. 188, 193, 97 S.Ct. 990, 993, 51 L.Ed.2d 260 (1977) (quotation omitted). Under <em>Marks, </em>Justice Sotomayor\u2019s concurring opinion can be viewed as the holding in <em>Freeman. </em>Nonetheless, even if the plurality opinion contained the holding, <em>Freeman </em>would not overrule <em>Moore.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
