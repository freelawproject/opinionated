Ellen Cooney was injured while attempting to alight from a street car of the \u25a0 appellant company, upon which car she was a passenger. A suit was also brought by Ellen to recox-er her damages, and an appeal from a judgment in her favor xvas considered and disposed of by this court. The facts as recited in the opinion of the court upon that appeal apply equally here, and that decision may be here referred to in lieu of a detailed statement of facts. C. C. Ry. Co. v. Cooney, 95 Ill. App. 471.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-4\" pgmap=\"199\">Upon the trial of this cause a verdict was returned for appellee, assessing his damages at $500.

We are of opinion that it did not. There is evidence as to the amount actually expended by appellee in this behalf, but there is no evidence whatever that such expenditures were the ordinary and reasonable cost of such medical services as were procured. Appellant preserved its exception to the introduction of the testimony. The court, by the ninth instruction, permitted the jury to include these items in their assessment of the damages, without any limitation as to the reasonable cost of the same. The amounts expended by appellee for these purposes aggregate $300. It is impossible to determine from the record how much thereof was a reasonable expense. It is also impossible to determine that the jury did not allow the $300 which appellee had paid out for medical services as a part of their award of damages.</p> <p id=\"b199-9\" pgmap=\"199(82) 200(15)\">The error in the giving of the ninth instruction, by which the jury were permitted to include elements of damages for which there was no support in the evidence, can not be safely said not to have been prejudicial to appellant. Therefore the judgment can not be permitted to stand in its entirety. If the appellee shall remit from the judgment the amount of $300 within ten days, the judgment will be affirmed. Otherwise it will be reversed and' the cause will be remanded. In either \u00e9vent appellant will recover its costs. Reversed and remanded July 2,1901.</p> <author id=\"b200-8\" pgmap=\"200\">Mb. Justice Wihdes:</author> <p id=\"b200-9\" pgmap=\"200\">Notwithstanding the errors mentioned in the majority opinion, I think the evidence, aside from that relating to appellee\u2019s expenses, sustains the amount of the judgment; that substantial justice is done, and that the judgment should be affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
