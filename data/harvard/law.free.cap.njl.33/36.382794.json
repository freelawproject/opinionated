Vanderbeck, late of the township of New Barbadoes, in the county of Bergen, deceased,\u201d and not by their individual names. It has been held by this court, that an assessment of damages to the land owners whose lands are taken for a public highway, should specify the names of the persons whose lands are so taken, and the amount of damages assessed to each. <em>State </em>v. <em>Oliver et al., </em>4 <em>Zab. 133; State </em>v. <em>Fischer, </em>2 <em>Dutcher </em>129. In the first named ease, the assessment was to William Edgar and others; and in the other, to Messrs. J. <em>&amp; </em>J. W. Meeks. Both were held bad. The assessment before us is still worse. It neither mentions the names of the individual owners, or any of them, the amount assessed to each, nor whether they are joint tenants, tenants in common, or in severalty. An assessment to heirs or devisees by that designation alone, is neither in consonance with the statute, <em>(Nix. Dig. </em>748) nor according to the doctrine of the cases referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">The return of the surveyors must, therefore, be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-11\">Cited in <em>State, Charlier, pros., </em>v. <em>Woodruff, 7 Vr. </em>205; <em>State, Swanton, pros., </em>v. <em>Pierson, </em>8 <em>Vr. </em>368.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
