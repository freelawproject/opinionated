This case appeared upon the Trial Term calendar for trial for Monday, June 17th. The calendar was published in the Law Journal on Saturday, June 15th, on which day counsel for the defendant called up the plaintiff\u2019s counsel by telephone and said, \u201cI suppose you will be ready for trial on Monday,\u201d to which plaintiff\u2019s counsel replied, \u201cYes, I will be ready.\u201d Upon Monday, upon the call, counsel for both sides appearing, the case was marked \u201cready.\u201d At the opening of court, after recess, the calendar was again called, and the case again marked \u201cready.\u201d On June 18th the case was the sixth on the day calendar and was marked \u201cready.\u201d On June 19th it appeared as the third case on the day calendar. Counsel for plaintiff answered, \u201cReady,\u201d and counsel for defendant presented an affidavit of the president of the defendant company, which the judge presiding declared to be insufficient to obtain an adjournment, in which he was clearly right, and directed a jury to be impaneled. Counsel for the defendant then said, \u201cI refuse to go on with the case,\u201d and left the courtroom. Thereafter, and before the case was opened, he returned with the attorney of record, who stated that he had an undefended divorce case at the Special Term, Part III, for trial. The justice presiding at the Trial Term sent to the justice presiding at the Special Term, who agreed to hold the undefended divorce case until the termination of the trial of this action. The trial justice then directed defendant\u2019s counsel to examine the jury, whereupon defendant\u2019s attorney stated, \u201cYour honor will note the defendant declines and will not take part in the examination of the jury,\u201d and thereupon left the courtroom with counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-8\"><bracketnum>[1,2]</bracketnum> It is apparent that the defendant suffered a deliberate default, and the moving papers disclose no satisfactory reason why it should be relieved of said default. The setting aside of the judgment and reinstating the case for trial was, therefore, an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-9\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion to vacate denied, with $10 costs, and the judgment reinstated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
