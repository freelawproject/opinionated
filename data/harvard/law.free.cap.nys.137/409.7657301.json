Laws 1909, c. 40). Upon his arraignment in the Court of Special Sessions of the city of Albany, held by the recorder of said city, he appeared specially and moved to dismiss the information upon the ground of insufficiency, which motion was granted, and its propriety was thereafter attempted to be raised by this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> As to the merits of the appeal thus taken, we may say, in brief, that as the recorder has handed down no opinion we are at a loss to know in what respect he considered the information in question defective. Nor are we aided in this matter by the points of respondent\u2019s counsel, although it is therein stated that the recorder followed the case of People v. Miller, 81 App. Div. 255, 80 N. Y. Supp. 1070, which, however, seems clearly distinguishable from the case at bar. But, even if this information was in fact insufficient, and might be so held upon demurrer, we think its insufficiency was , not so apparent and free from doubt as to require the recorder to dismiss it upon motion. The rule is thus laid down by the Court of Appeals in People v. Davis, 56 N. Y. 95, at page 100:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-12\">\u201cIt is in the discretion of the court whether or not to set aside a defective indictment upon motion; and unless the question is free from doubt, the court ought not to do it, but leave the counsel to his demurrer, or motion in arrest of judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-13\">See, also, Abbott\u2019s Trial Brief in Criminal Cases, pp. 65, 66, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-14\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> But, whatever may be our views as to the sufficiency of this information, we find no provision for an appeal from the determination of the recorder upon this point. By section 23, c. 284, Laws of 1872, appeal in the Recorder\u2019s Court is made similar to appeals \u2022 in a Court of Sessions, and the powers of the former Courts of Sessions are now vested by the Constitution in the County Courts. The Code of Criminal Procedure, by section 515, has abolished writs of error and of certiorari in criminal actions, and by section 518 has provided that the people may appeal in two cases only, neither of which is an appeal from an order dismissing an indictment or information. We accordingly think that the granting of the motion to dismiss was not reviewable upon appeal. See, also, People v. Petrea, 1 N. Y. Cr. R. 198, at page 203, and Abbott\u2019s Trial Brief, cited supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-15\">Appeal dismissed, without costs. Motion granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
