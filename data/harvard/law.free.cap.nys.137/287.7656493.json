The learned court at Special Term has granted defendant\u2019s motion for a bill of particulars regarding some matters alleged in 'the complaint, but denied the following, among others:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-9\">(1) \u201cIn what respects was the use, management, control, and operation of the machine at which she was employed, dangerous?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-10\">(2) \u201cWhat instruction was required in the use, management, control, and operation of said machine, in order that the same might be used and controlled with safety?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">Negligence is alleged in both of these particulars, but, as was said in Higgins v. Erie Railroad Co., 140 App. Div. 222, 124 N. Y. Supp. 1082\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-12\">\u201cin such a general way as to make it practically impossible to determine what issues are to be met, and it is no answer to defendant\u2019s demand for a bill of particulars that defendant is in a position to know the facts. The question to be determined is what the plaintiff claims are the facts; that is the issue to be tried, and the defendant has a right to be informed of the issues by the pleadings, a bill of particulars being a part of such pleadings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-13\">We are of the opinion that this rule requires a compliance with defendant\u2019s demands as quoted above, and the order is modified, by including within its requirements the two particulars, and, as so modified, affirmed, without costs to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-14\">THOMAS and WOODWARD, JJ., concur. JENKS, P. J., and BURR, J., dissent as to the second requirement. \u25a0 '</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
