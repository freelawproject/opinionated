Laws 1909, c. 40), in that he admitted certain children, unaccompanied by parents or guardians, to his moving picture show, contrary to the provisions of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-19\">There is no dispute about the facts. The defendant admitted three boys, each one of. them under the age of 16 years, upon their purchasing tickets. There was some evidence that the defendant asked the older of the three boys, and the one who purchased the tickets, how old he was, and that the boy replied that he was 16; that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number><em>16 </em>\"last week.\u201d But there is no pretext that there was anything said about the ages of his two companions, who were 9 and 11 years of age, respectively, and the boy who claimed to be 16 years of age was, in fact, only 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The statute forbids permitting children under 16 to frequent these places unless accompanied by a parent or guardian, and, if it should be assumed that it was an excuse for the violation of the statute that the child falsely declared his age, the case now before us does not come within the requirement, for there is no suggestion that any inquiry was made as to the two younger boys, and there is no suggestion that there was anything about their appearance to indicate that they were older than their ages as established by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">The judgment appealed from should be affirmed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
