This question involved the question whether the price to be paid for making a certain garment in defendant\u2019s factory had been \u201cfixed\u201d by and between defendant\u2019s foreman and a price committee of the workmen. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel, in summing up, commented on the failure of defendant to call as witnesses the members of the price committee, adding thereto, \u201cDoubtless they are still in the employ of defendant.\u201d At the close of the case, after the judge\u2019s charge, defendant\u2019s counsel requested the court to charge the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-10\">\u201cBy reason of some comment made in summing up, I also ask your honor to charge that no inference may be drawn against the defendant by reason of his failure to call the price committee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b780-11\">This the court refused to charge, and the defendant duly excepted. On settlement of the case, the remarks, of .plaintiff\u2019s counsel, hereinabove referred to, were stricken from the record. They should, in my opinion, be included therein, as the point sought to be raised by appellant on the appeal in respect thereof is substantial; and in his request to charge defendant referred to and sufficiently identified the portion of the summing up intended to be designated.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-12\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the learned judge below directed to resettle the case in accordance with the above. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
