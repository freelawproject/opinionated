He was inexperienced in business. On one of his returns to this city, when he was 22 years of age, he sought from defendants his share in the estate of his grandfather\u2014the father of the defendants. They told him that his interest was one-twelfth in certain houses, and that it was worth only $300, and that if he did not take that he would not get anything, whereupon he deeded his interest to one of them for that amount. Subsequently he learned that the property was worth some $10,000, and that even its assessed valuation at the time he made the transfer was $7,800.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-4\">The learned trial justice appears to have dismissed the complaint on the theory that a representation as to value is merely an opinion; but, under the circumstances disclosed by plaintiff\u2019s testimony, the defendants\u2019 statements were not of an opinion, but of a fact. The value of the property, in reference to which the representation was made, was peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendants, and the relationship of the parties was such that the plaintiff had the right to trust and confide in the statements of the defendants. Simar v. Canaday, 53 N. Y. 298, 13 Am. Rep. 523; Daiker v. Strelinger, 28 App. Div. 220, 50 N. Y. Supp. 1074.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">Furthermore, plaintiff\u2019s inexperience, and his relations to his uncles, as shown by his undisputed evidence, warranted his making no further inquiries in the matter. Eaton v. Avery, 83 N. Y. 31, 39, 38 Am. Rep. 389; Clark v. Rankin, 46 Barb. 570, 575; 20 Cyc. 126; Hall v. Perkins, 3 Wend. 627.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
