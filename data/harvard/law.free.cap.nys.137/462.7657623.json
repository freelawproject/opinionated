At a preceding town meeting the vote upon local option had resulted in the negative as to questions 1, 2, and 3, and in the affirmative as to question No. 4. The vital question involved upon this appeal is whether the respondent, who was the holder of a liquor tax certificate is<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>sued, under subdivision 1 of section 8, to a person in connection with the business of keeping a hotel, was authorized to traffic in liquors not to be drunk on the premises where sold, when the majority of the votes cast upon the second question was in the negative. While the vote was against question No. 1, as to the selling of liquor to be drunk on the premises where sold, and also against question No. 2, as to the selling of liquor not to be drunk on the premises where sold, yet the affirmative vote upon question No. 4 modified the negative decision upon question No. 1, as to selling liquors to be drunk on the premises where sold, by reason of the condition contained in question No. 4, \u201cif the majority of the votes cast on the first question submitted are in the negative,\u201d to the extent of permitting liquor to be sold, to be drunk on the premises where sold, in connection with the business of keeping a hotel; but, question No. 4 containing no such condition as to question No. 2, said vote in no way whatever modified the negative decision as to question No. 2, as to selling liquors not to be drunk on the premises where sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">But it is claimed by respondent that he had the right to traffic in liquors not to be drunk on the premises where sold by reason of the following provision of subdivision 1 of section 8: \u201cThe holder of a liquor tax certificate under this subdivision is entitled to traffic in liquors as though he held a liquor tax certificate under subdivision two of this section, subject to the provisions of section thirteen of this chapter.\u201d In section 13, entitled \u201cLocal option to determine whether liquor shall be sold under the provisions of this chapter,\u201d we find this provision: \u201cIf the majority of the votes shall be in the negative * * * no person shall thereafter so traffic in liquors or apply for or receive a liquor tax certificate under the subdivision or subdivisions of section eight, referred to in the question or questions upon which * * * the majority of the votes cast shall have been cast in the negative.\u201d Subdivision 2 of section 8 was referred to in question 2 as follows: \u201cShall any person be authorized to traffic in liquors under the provisions of subdivision two of section eight of the liquor tax law, namely, by selling liquor not to be drunk on the premises where sold?\u201d The vote upon question 2 having been in the negative, the above-quoted provision of section 13 constituted a positive restriction of the right of the respondent to traffic in liquors under subdivision 2 of section 8, and negatived any right which respondent might claim to have to traffic in liquors by reason of the provisions of subdivision 1 of section 8, hereinbefore quoted. Prior to the passage of chapter 485 of the Laws of 1910, and since the amendment of section 13, then section 16, by chapter 312 of the Laws of 1897, the keeper of a hotel, who was the holder of a liquor tax certificate, had the right to traffic in liquors to be drunk in the hotel, and also off the premises, by reason of the following provision of section 13: \u201cBut if the majority of the votes cast on the fourth question submitted is in the affirmative, and a majority of the votes cast on the first question submitted is not in the affirmative, a liquor tax certifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>cate may be granted under subdivision one of section eight to the keepers of hotels, who may traffic in liquor to be drunk in the hotel and off the premises, though the majority of the votes cast on the second question submitted is not in the affirmative.\u201d By chapter 485 of the Laws.of 1910, which went into effect June 14th of that year, the Legislature repealed this provision of section 13, since which time there has been no provision of law authorizing the holder of a liquor tax certificate under subdivision 1 of section 8 to traffic in liquors in towns in which the majority vote on question No. 2 was in the negative, as though he held a liquor tax certificate' under subdivision 2 of section 8. Attention may be called to the amendment of section 36 by chapter 485, Laws of 1910, by the insertion of the words, \u201cby reason of the result of a vote on the local option questions,\u201d as further indicative of the intent of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-3\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The objection that the indictment is defective upon the ground that it stated that the four questions were \u201cduly submitted,\u201d instead of expressly alleging the various preliminary steps requisite to the legal submission of such questions, is without merit-. The words \u201cduly submitted\u201d imply the existence of every fact essential to the regularity of the proceedings. Hall v. People, 90 N. Y. 498; Brownell v. Town of Greenwich, 114 N. Y. 518, 527, 22 N. E. 24, 4 L. R. A. 685; Baxter v. Lancaster, 58 App. Div. 380, 68 N. Y. Supp. 1092.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Eor the foregoing reasons, we are led to the conclusion that the facts stated in the indictment constituted a crime; and hence that the judgment allowing the demurrer should be reversed, the demurrer disallowed, and the defendant required to plead. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
