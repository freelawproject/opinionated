Defendant\u2019s claim is that the business was undertaken on behalf of a corporation of which defendant was the president, and that plaintiff was well advised to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-15\">The plaintiff\u2019s testimony is discursive to an abnormal degree, and his evidence of the extent and amount of the disbursements and receipts is too vague and general to sustain a judgment. Moreover, on an examination of the entire record and of the exhibits, I cannot escape the conclusion that a judgment implying defendant\u2019s personal responsibility, rather than that of the corporation, is against the weight \u2022of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-16\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant' to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
