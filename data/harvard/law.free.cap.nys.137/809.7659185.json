Riglander and Sevilla Reineman. The answer is a general denial, except that it admits the exchange of the property. Defendant served a demand for a bill of particulars, specifying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-12\">\u201c1. When plaintiff was employed by defendant <em>to </em>effect the exchange of the properties mentioned in paragraph first of the complaint, specifying the day and place of said alleged employment and the name of the officer, agent, or representative of defendant by whom plaintiff claims to have. been so employed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-13\">In response to which the plaintiff answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-14\">\u201cAbout March 10, 1910, at No. 907 Broadway, New York City, by Mr. Hess.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-15\">\u201c2. When and where defendant undertook and faithfully promised to pay the plaintiff the commission of 1 per cent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-16\">To which the response was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-17\">\u201cAbout March, 1910, at No. 907 Broadway, New York City.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-18\">\u201cWhen and where the exchange value of defendant\u2019s premises for the purposes of said exchange was determined to be $1,500,000, and by whom it was so determined, as alleged in paragraph second of said complaint.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-19\">\u201cAbout May, 1910, at No. 49 Maiden Lane, New York City, by Mr. Hess.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-20\">\u201c3. What officer, agent, or representative of defendant plaintiff claims to have introduced to Jacob W. Riglander and when and where such introduction took place.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-21\">To which plaintiff responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-22\">\u201cMr. Hess, some time between April, 1910, and November, 1910, at 49 Maiden Lane, New York City.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>Defendant was not satisfied, and made a motion for a bill of particulars. In answer thereto plaintiff served an affidavit, in which he averred that he was 74 years of age, and, although his memory for facts and circumstances was still good, his recollection for dates had been impaired by age and sickness; referring to request No. 1, that he was unable to state more definitely than he had already done in the bill of particulars the precise date when the defendant engaged him, or when the defendant promised to pay him the commission of 1 per centum, and when the exchange value on defendant\u2019s premises was determined; referring to request No. 3, that he was unable to state more definitely than he had already the precise date when he introduced the agent or representative of the defendant to Jacob W. Riglander.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-4\">\u201cThe name o\u00ed the officer, agent, or representative of the defendant was Mr. Hess, but I do not know and have no available, means of informing myself of what his first name was, although I know that his address, as stated in the bill of particulars, is 907 Broadway, New York Oity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Notwithstanding the said affidavit, the court granted the motion requiring the plaintiff to give the full name of Hess and to specify with more particularity the date when it is alleged Mr. Hess was introduced to Mr. Riglander, and from said order plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">It seems to us that upon these papers the defendant is sufficiently advised of the facts upon which the plaintiff bases his claim, and that it is unreasonable to require him to specify the first name of defendant\u2019s agent, which is unknown to him; such alleged agent having been sufficiently identified for the information of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
