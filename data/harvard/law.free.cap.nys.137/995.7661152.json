However, the point does not appear to have been raised, and, as the amended complaint is recited in the order appealed from, the motion is doubtless to be regarded as relating to it, and not to the pleading which it superseded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-22\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> So far as appealed from, the order requires the plaintiff to annex to the complaint a copy of the assignment under which it claims, and to state the dates of. the allowance of certain claims for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>\u25a0excess customs duties, so far as such dates \u201care matters of record in the office of the United States Board of General Appraisers at the city of New York, or in the custom house at the city of New York, or in any other public office within the said city.\u201d The plaintiff cannot be required to search public records for information for his adversary, and, while the respondent thinks that he might be in a position to demur to the complaint if the order is complied with, that does not justify an order to make more definite and certain a complaint which contains a plain and concise statement of the facts constituting the cause of action, or to require the plaintiff to annex to such a complaint copies of a written document; instead of properly pleading it, as was done in this case, according to its legal effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">The order, in so far as appealed from, is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion to that extent denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
