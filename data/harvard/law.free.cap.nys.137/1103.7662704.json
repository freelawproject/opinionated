The complaint contains the allegations usual in such cases, as to what defendant is doing and has done. The answer consists mainly of denials, except as to some rel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1104\">*1104</page-number>atively unimportant matters, which are admitted, and embraces no affirmative defense. As was said by this court in Oakes v. Star Co., 119 App. Div. 358, 104 N. Y. Supp. 244:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1130-5\">\u201cIt is still necessary to show,' by the recitation of affirmative facts and circumstances, that the testimony sought to be elicited is material and necessary for the party making the application, and it is incumbent upon the party seeking the examination to make this fact apparent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1130-6\">In this regard the defendant has. wholly failed. He does not suggest, and we cannot imagine, what evidence he can expect to extract from plaintiff which will be necessary to his defense. The only apparent purpose for such an examination is to discover in advance of the trial what evidence plaintiff has to support his complaint. This is not the legitimate purpose of such an examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-7\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
