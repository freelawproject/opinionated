In his main' charge the learned trial court instructed the jury only generally that, in order to find a verdict in behalf of the plaintiff, they must find that the killing of her intestate was the result of negligence on the part of the defendant. There was no instruction as to the degree of care which the law imposed upon the defendant as master, nor was there any attempt to define the character of negligence which would render it liable. At the close of the charge the defendant\u2019s counsel requested the court to further instruct the jury that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-21\">\u201cThe defendant in this action was not the insurer of the safety of the deceased. It was only obliged to use reasonable care for his safety.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>In response to this request the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-3\">\u201cI will charge that the defendant was not the insurer of the deceased.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">And the defendant excepted to the refusal to charge as requested. It is not claimed that this request did not embody the correct rule of law; but it is urged that, because the court did charge that the defendant was not an insurer of the safety of the deceased, the jury must have understood that the defendant\u2019s duty was measured by reasonable care only. We do not think the jury could have received such an impression, either from the main charge, or from the separation by the court of the request made by defendant\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> There was a further request made by defendant\u2019s counsel as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-6\">\u201cI ask you to charge that, before they [the jury] can find a verdict against the defendant, they must find the defendant was guilty of some act of negligence, and that that act was the proximate cause of the deceased losing his life.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">The court refused this request, except to say that the jury must find some act of negligence on the part of the defendant. This request embodied a correct rule of law; but, strictly speaking, it was not applicable to the facts proved. There was no intervening cause which might have produced the death of the intestate. His death was caused either by the negligence of the defendant (in the absence of carelessness on the part of the intestate, which under the proofs the jury were justified in finding was not the fact) or by unavoidable accident. There was no intervening agency or act which could have been the proximate cause of his death. If the request was intended to instruct the jury that they must specify by their verdict some one of the negligent acts which the plaintiff asserted the defendant had been guilty of, still the request was properly denied. It was the duty of the jury to determine that the defendant was actually guilty of negligence in some definite particular, and that such act or omission was the proximate cause of the injury; but they need not announce by their general verdict which particular act or omission they regarded as negligent. The refusal of the court to charge as requested constitutes, therefore, no ground for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">For the error in refusing to charge the other request, however, the judgment and orders must be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b577-9\">BETTS, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAV\">(dissenting). The jurors, by the form of their verdict in this case, have shown that they were neither deceived nor misled by the charge of the court. They brought in a sealed verdict, in which they found \u201cthe defendant guilty of negligence in not having the car covered, and shaft not equipped with light, and the wires not being properly adjusted.\u201d None of these matters of negligence, which the jury found had been committed by the defendant, required anything more than reasonable care on de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>fendant\u2019s part to provide for the safety of its employes, including the deceased. Hence the jurors\u2019 verdict showed that they,did not charge the defendant with the exercise of any high degree of care in providing a reasonably safe place for its employ\u00e9s in which to do its work.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Speculation as to what the jury might possibly have done under the court\u2019s charge is idle, where, as here, the court has before it what they actually did do in the sealed verdict returned, signed by each of the jurors. Neither the parties nor the courts should be burdened with the additional unnecessary labor, expense, and delay of another trial in this case, upon the judicial refinement shown to be absolutely without merit in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">I think the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
