As a separate defense the defendant sets up that the Caroline Leather Compdny was a copartnership, in which he was a partner; that, subsequent to the making of the notes in suit, the copartnership executed an assignment of certain assets to trustees for the benefit of creditors, upon the condition that all the creditors, who became parties thereto, took whatever dividends accrued in full payment of all claims \u201cagainst the defendant and his copartners, or any of them\u201d; that the plaintiff took such dividend, \u201cwhich said sum the plaintiff accepted as a full and final payment of any and all claims which he then had <em>against the Caroline Leather Company, </em>of which the defendant was a copartner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b959-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The appeal is based on the fact that the learned court below dismissed the separate defense. 'The motion for a dismissal of the complaint was not very clear.' If plaintiff meant to claim therein that the notes in suit were the notes of Harry Caroline, individually, and not the notes of the partnership, the Caroline Leather Company, the claim cannot be sustained. The notes were not signed by Harry Caroline, and the complaint itself alleged that they were made by the Caroline Leather Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> If, however, plaintiff is to be understood as having meant that defendant pleaded a discharge of the partnership only, and not that of the individual defendant as indorser, then it must be noted that the terms of the agreement, into which plaintiff entered, are pleaded in the defense as constituting a satisfaction and discharge of <em>the defendant </em>and his copartners, or any of them, and that it is alleged as a fact that plaintiff became a party to such agreement. The mere incident that defendant has, in a further portion of the defense, pleaded, as a legal conclusion merely, that the partnership was discharged, does not limit the effect of the allegation of fact hereinabove referred to.
