The action was brought by a servant against his master to recover damages for personal injuries, caused by-the alleged negligence of the defendant in failing to furnish to the plaintiff a reasonably safe place in which to work. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>plaintiff had been in the employment of the defendant for about IS months before the happening of the accident. The defendant carried on a large business of converting various substances into glycerine. In its factory were located a number of large iron stills, heated by steam. In them were distilled from various substances the desired glycerine. After the process of distillation was completed, and the pure glycerine run off into other receptacles, the still was emptied into a vat located underneath it for the purpose of removing the impurities, which had resulted from the process of distillation, and which were called \u201cfoots.\u201d A pipe ran from the bottom of the still into the uncovered vat beneath. This vat, which was of iron, was about 5 feet in depth and about 15 feet in circumference. Its top was over 4 feet from the floor level. During all the period of the plaintiff\u2019s employment, he had been engaged, either at night or in the daytime, in emptying the stills. The one in question was surrounded with a meshwork of pipes, with an opening through which the operator could gain access to the still and vat. He had a long tool, which served as a key to open a valve in the pipe which emptied the still.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">At the time of the accident, according to the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, he turned the valve slowly with the key, and allowed' some of the impure material to run into the vat; then, as he testified, there came a sudden splashing from the pipe and vat, and the material splashed over him, causing him to be severely burned. He had never seen such a splashing before during his employment on this work. At various times theretofore some small drops of the material had splashed on his hands and other parts of his body, causing slight bums. No explanation was offered as to the cause of the splashing which resulted in the accident to the plaintiff, nor was any attempt made to show that there was any defect in the machinery, as to which the defendant was negligent. The whole claim of the plaintiff was <em>to the </em>effect that the vat in question should have been so guarded by a cover as to prevent any splashing of the heated material descending into it from the still. Reliance is had by the plaintiff on section 81 of the Labor Law (Consol. Laws 1909, c. 31), which provides in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-6\">\u201cAll vats, pans, saws, planers, cogs, gearing, belting, shafting, set-screws and machinery, of every description shall be properly guarded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-7\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> 'Evidence was given by the plaintiff, through a witness, Calvert, who had been a foreman in the place, that on various occasions, when the still was opened, the contents had splashed 3 or 4 feet, and on one occasion 12 feet, and that said Calvert had called the attention of his superiors to the danger likely to result from such splashing. The learned trial court was of the opinion that the words \u201cproperly guarded,\u201d used in the statute in relation to a vat, meant some barrier which would prevent an employe from accidentally falling into the vat, and did not apply to any precautionary device to prevent the contents of still or vat from splashing out over those at work near by.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\"><bracketnum>[2,3]</bracketnum> We think that the words \u201cproperly guarded\u201d were not used in this statute in such a restricted sense. Whatever guard was re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>quired by the statute was one proportionate to the reasonably expectable danger arising from, the ordinary use of the machinery or receptacle in question. In this case there could have been no probable danger of an employ\u00e9 accidentally falling into the vat. Whether any precautionary device should have been used to prevent a danger of the material in question splashing out on an employ\u00e9 at work near by, would depend on whether or not a man of reasonable prudence, in the exercise of ordinary care, should have anticipated the likelihood of such a happening. That question is primarily one for a jury, unless-no inference of negligence was permissible. If there had been splashing for a considerable distance at various times in the use of these stills and vats, and this fact was brought home to the attention of the master, then it was a question for the jury to determine whether, in, view of such circumstances, some device by way of a guard should have been employed for the protection of employ\u00e9s from the danger of such splashing. And if such a guard was properly required, then the machinery in question was defective, within the meaning of the Employer\u2019s Liability Act. Proctor v. Rockville Center Milling Co., 205 N. Y. 508, 99 N. E. 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> The plaintiff set up in his complaint and proved the service-of a notice sufficient to bring his action within the remedial provisions-of the statute above cited. If for any reason it was impracticable, in-the proper use of these appliances, to guard this vat against the likelihood of a splashing, then it was incumbent upon' the defendant to offer such proof. Scott v. International Paper Co., 204 N. Y. 49, 97 N. E. 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">We are of opinion, therefore, that on the record now before us it was error for the trial court to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. The questions of the defendant\u2019s negligence and the plaintiff\u2019s assumption, of risk should have been submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted; costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">WOODWARD and RICH, JJ\u201e concur. HIRSCHBERG and. BURR, JJ., dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
