He is corroborated in this regard by Goldstein, who swears that the envelope was opened in his presence; also by the affidavit of one Benjamin Aug, another clerk in the bank, who swears that the envelope in question, which he identifies, was handed to him on the morning of August 19th by a young man who asked for Mr. Lewis; that he told the young man that Lewis was out of the bank, and would not return till later in the day, whereupon he handed the envelope to Aug, and asked Aug if he would not deliver it to Lewis; that Aug said he would see that Lewis got the letter;- that he (Aug) then took the envelope and laid it upon his desk in the check book department, and he afterwards saw Louis Aug, another clerk, take it to the nore teller\u2019s department. Louis Aug also makes affidavit to finding the letter in the check book department and taking it to the note teller\u2019s department. Another clerk in the employ of the bank, one Kaplan, makes affidavit that he was present and saw the envelope left with Benjamin Aug, and corroborates Aug as to the conversation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>that took place at that time; that Aug thereupon took the envelope and left it on his desk, and Louis Aug subsequently took it to the note teller\u2019s department. We think it clear, on all the proof, that no personal service was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">The judgment must therefore be reversed, with costs, and the complaint dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
