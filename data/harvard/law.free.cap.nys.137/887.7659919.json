Kingsland as mortgagee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The cause of action is based on section 122 of the Insurance Law, which provides that a fire- insurance company \u201cshall cancel any policy of insurance upon the request of'the insured,\u201d and shall return the amount of the premium paid less the short rate premium. When she applied for repayment of the premium, she presented no authorization from the mortgagee; nor did she have, nor undertake to surrender, the policy. It is quite evident that \u201cthe insured,\u201d under section 122, includes a mortgagee, for whose benefit a mortgagee clause has been inserted in the policy. Indeed, the principle is well settled that, so far as any interference by the original assured may be concerned, the mortgagee holds an independent contract with the insurer. Hastings v. Westchester Fire Ins. Co., 73 N. Y. 141, 147, 154; Eddy v. London Assurance Co., 143 N. Y. 311, 38 N. E. 307, 25 L. R. A. 686.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">Respondent cites Griffey v. N. Y. C. Ins. Co., 100 N. Y. 417, 3 N. E. 309, 53 Am. Rep. 202, as authority for the proposition that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-7\">\u201cSuch a provision <em>in a policy </em>is at most a mere appointment to receive, a direction to the company to pay, in the event of loss.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b914-8\">This reference is utterly irrelevant, for not only was there no such provision <em>in the policy </em>in the Griffey Case, but the statement of fact, referring to the transfer of the policies as collateral security, says, at page 418 of 100 N. Y. and page 310 of 3 N. E. (53 Am. Rep. 202) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-9\">\u201cThe consent of the defendant [insurance company] was not indorsed upon the policy, nor does it appear to have been given or asked for.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b914-10\">Plaintiff\u2019s other reference (Lewis v. Guardian Ins. Co., 181 N. Y. 397, 74 N. E. 224, 106 Am. St. Rep. 557) is unfortunate, because the point held in that case, namely, that the mortgagee\u2019s interest w\u00e1s so complete and vested as that he must be made a party to a suit by the insured upon the policy, confirms the view which I have taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-11\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Plaintiff seems also to make some point of a claim that the company had without her consent transferred, on its books or elsewhere, her interest.in the policy to some other person. Without expressing any view on the question whether that might give her a right to obtain some decree in equity \"fixing her interest in the policy, it certainly does not constitute \u2022 the basis of an action for the return of the premium, nor do I see how plaintiff has been damaged thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-12\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to 'appellant to abide the. event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
