Pursuant to those telegrams, the plaintiff went to Los Angeles, and on July'19th commenced playing at the theater of which the defendant was manager, and continued for 7 weeks, at the end of which time he was discharged, as far as appears, without cause. While a number of reasons are urged by the respondent to support the dismissal of the complaint at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, only two require discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-6\"><bracketnum>[ 1 ]</bracketnum> Whether the telegrams made out a contract for a definite term depended on the meaning of the words \u201cregular engagement\u201d in the first telegram. The evidence of the plaintiff tends to show that those words had a definite meaning in the theatrical business, and that as applied to an engagement in a theater like the defendant\u2019s, which ran throughout the year, meant an engagement for 52 weeks. The telegrams themselves furnish internal evidence to show that the engagement contemplated by the defendant was at least for some definite period extending beyond the summer. We think the case was one which justified proof of the meaning of the words \u201cregular engagement,\u201d as used by the defendant, and that, as explained by the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, the telegrams were sufficient to make out a contract for a definite term of 52 weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-7\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The defendant pleaded, in effect, that at the time of the contract he was to the knowledge of \"the plaintiff acting as general manager of the Blackwood-Belasco Company, a corporation, and that the plaintiff was employed by said company, through the defendant as agent. The defendant was allowed to offer certain evidence, during the presentation of the plaintiff\u2019s side of the case, bearing upon the claim that he was acting as agent for a disclosed principal. It would be sufficient to show the error of the court on this branch of the case to state that, when the complaint was dismissed, it had not been proved that there was in fact any such company or corporation as the Blackwood-Belasco Company. But, assuming that that had been proved, and that it appeared that the defendant was acting as agent for it in employing the plaintiff, there is no evidence whatever that the plaintiff knew that fact. The telegrams were sent by the defendant in his own name, and, to show knowledge on the part of the plaintiff, he relies upon a letter written to Mrs. Packard six months before on an entirely different matter. Assuming that that letter was sufficient to show knowledge on the part of Mrs. Packard, that knowledge was not chargeable to the plaintiff. In the first place, the knowledge did not come to Mrs. Packard in the course of her employment, or even at a time when she was acting as agent for the plaintiff. Moreover, the evidence shows that she was a mere go-between, an agent of both parties. She was the defendant\u2019s agent to communicate his offer to the plaintiff, \u00e1nd she was the latter\u2019s agent to communicate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1064\">*1064</page-number>his acceptance to the defendant. Anything she may have learned at a different time, and wholly unconnected with her agency for the plaintiff, was not chargeable to him. The evidence, showing any knowledge acquired by the plaintiff after the contract of employment was made, could not have the effect of changing the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-5\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
