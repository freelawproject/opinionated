There was no evidence that the husband had authority to purchase articles for defendant, except the affirmative answer of defendant to the question :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-17\">\u201cAs a rule people know the two of you as attending to the business most of the \"time?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b882-18\">This answer, in the form in which it was given, and particularly when read in the context of the testimony preceding it and following it, fails to justify a finding that the husband was the wife\u2019s agent. We may add that such authority is repeatedly denied by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-19\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs'to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
