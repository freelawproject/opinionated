Hence the exceptions to the charge, whose discussion takes up so large a part of defendant\u2019s brief, are not material now. The exceptions to be considered on this motion are those taken to rulings upon motions to direct a verdict. Defendant\u2019s first and most confident contention is that it is entitled to a reduction of the verdict to $2,307.50. The action is brought upon a contract for excavation under water along the East River front, for purposes of a new bulkhead. The price is $9.35 per cubic yard. The amount actually paid before suit is $92,882.90. The estimated expense at the time of making the contract was $90,657.60.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-16\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> Defendant claims that the latter sum, plus 5 per cent, thereof, is the extreme limit of plaintiff\u2019s possible recovery. Its counsel says: \u201cIn order to make the contract definite and certain, certain clauses were inserted as follows: \u2018Art. 2. The engineer\u2019s estimate of the quantities of material to be excavated and removed is as follows: Total of all material 9,696 cubic yards, neat measurement.\u2019 This clause is followed by what is commonly known as the 5 per cent, clause, which reads as follows: \u2018No payment shall be allowed for any work in excess of the amount set forth, plus five (5) per cent, thereof.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-17\">If the specifications read as here stated, defendant\u2019s position would be impregnable ; but the clause last quoted does not immediately follow the other. There is a long paragraph between headed \u201cNote.\u201d This states that the 9,696 cubic yards estimate \u201cis approximate only, and forms no part of this contract\u201d; that bidders must \u201cjudge for themselves of the amount and other circumstances affecting the cost of the work\u201d; that <em>said estimated amount is not to he used for measurement or payment; </em>that, on the contrary, all material is to be measured in accordance with certain <em>data, </em>part of which will not be obtainable until after completion of the work. In paragraph F of the contract to which the specifications are attached there is provision made for \u201cadditional work\u201d that may be \u201cdone or furnished under a written order from the commissioner\u201d for a price that \u201cshall not exceed five (5) per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>cent. of the contract price or total cost of the work and materials.\" I think that the 5 per cent, clause in the specifications refers to the \u201cadditional work\u201d that might be done under the contract, and that the \u201ctotal cost of the-work and materials\u201d upon which the 5 per cent, is to be computed is the cost by actual measurement, not, as defendant now contends, a provisionally estimated cost, which \u201cis not to be used for measurement or payment.\u201d The 5-per cent, clause relates to extra work. Plaintiff claims nothing for extra, work.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Defendant contends that this construction makes the contract illegal because by the last clause of section 1541 of the Greater New York Charter (Laws 1901, c. 466) no expense can be incurred in excess of a previous appropriation ; but this clause does not apply to contracts at a fixed rate per yard for work whose exact expense is necessarily as yet indeterminable. Such contracts are provided for in section 149, which requires them to be-indorsed by the comptroller with a certificate that there is a balance of appropriation \u201csufficient to pay the estimated expenses of executing such contract, as certified by the officer making the same.\u201d \u2018 The cases relied upon by defendant relate to claims for extra work, and their - resemblance to the-present ease is superficial only. Matter of Morris &amp; Cumings Dredging Co., 116 App. Div. 257, 101 N. Y. Supp. 726; Donlon Don. Co. v. City, 64 Misc. Rep. 471, 119 N. Y. Supp. 617; Dady v. City, 65 Misc. Rep. 382, 121 N. Y. Supp. 860.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-6\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> Passing now to the main question in the case, it is first necessary to-consider the true construction of the specifications (which were drawn by an assistant engineer in the Dock Department) as to the amount to be excavated. The inner line of the new bulkhead for which the excavation was to be made was to be 9 feet inshore from the established bulkhead line. Its-base was to be 15 feet below mean low-water mark. In order to be sure that, enough room should be blasted out, the contractor was to be paid for whatever he might excavate as far as the 10-foot line inshore and the 16-foot line beneath; that is, an extra foot in each direction. The material to be excavated was to be solid ledge rock below, with generally an upper stratum of loose rock. The same formation generally extended for some distance inshore from the 10-foot line. Hence it was necessary to provide in the contract for getting out and carrying away the loose rock immediately adjacent to that line, for, if the loose rock should slide into the excavation while the-work was going on, it would increase the amount which would have to be-dug up and. carried away; while, if it should slide into the excavation after-the work had been finished and accepted, then the city would have to hire-the contractor' or somebody else to excavate again. This extra expense was-therefore bound to be provided for, either as so much more cubic, yardage, or by an increase in the compensation demanded by the bidders for the contract. Thus arose the provision for the 45-degree line. Forty-five degrees is-the angle of safety. Hence if an imaginary 45-degree line be taken at each given point where the loose rock overlies the ledge rock on the inner line-of the excavation, and running upwards and inshore, and if the loose rock be removed from above that line, the parties are fully protected.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-7\">Unfortunately, according to the undisputed evidence here, the location of the springing point cannot be accurately ascertained by soundings taken before the work commences. The so-called disc soundings show only the top of the loose rock The so-called rod soundings are really made not with a rod, but with a pipe. When the loose stones are at all large, the pipe manifestly cannot go down very far through them, except with extraordinary luck. Hence an accurate cross-section cannot be taken at that time by soundings which can be relied upon as furnishing even approximately the location of the proper springing point of this forty-five degree line. The main specification as to the westerly limit of the excavation is as follows: \u201cThe westerly limit shall be a line nine (9) feet inshore from and parallel with established bulkhead line. * * * Payment shall not be made for material excavated at a distance inshore or westerly of the above described limits greater than one foot.\u201d Now, to provide against the loose rock, we have this exception appended to the extract which I have just quoted: \u201cExcept where <em>Imown </em>loose rock is shown in the cross-sections above the top grade of the <em>indicated </em>rock, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>at a line ten (10) feet westerly of and parallel to the bulkhead line, <em>allowance </em>\u25a0will be made <em>and paid for </em>to a positive line which is forty-five degrees to the horizontal.\u201d This exception is very clumsily drawn and raises various questions. \u201cKnown\u201d loose rock\u2014when and by what means is it to become known ? \u201cThe cross-sections\u201d\u2014what cross-sections? \u201cThe indicated rock\u201d\u2014when, where and how indicated? \u201cA positive line\u201d\u2014what is there positive about a line whose direction is stated, but whose starting and finishing points are not stated, whose angle may turn either up or down? I suppose that \u201cpositive\u201d must be taken in its third sense, as defined in the Century Dictionary\u2014 \u201carbitrarily laid down: determined by declaration, enactment or convention and not by nature.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-4\">Now, the very next sentence of the specifications relates to certain \u201ctypical sections,\u201d and the defendant insists that these are the cross-sections referred to in connection with the 45-degree line, and that the word \u201cindicated\u201d means indicated on these. I think that there are various answers to this suggestion. In the first place, there are only 16 \u201ctypical sections\u201d for over a quarter of a mile of river front, and the very fact that they are called \u201ctypical\u201d would indicate that they do not give complete information. In the second place, the specifications go on to say that \u201cthese sections are given <em>as a guide \u25a0only, </em>and show <em>approximately </em>what the contractor <em>may </em>expect to encounter in the prosecution of <em>the </em>work.\u201d The \u201callowance\u201d to the contractor is a payment to him, and at a previous point the specifications had stated that his \u2022payment would be \u201cmeasured by a comparison of <em>accurate\u2019 </em>cross-sections.\u201d In the third place, the \u201ctypical sections\u201d are represented by the city\u2014for the specifications are drawn by the city\u2014as giving information upon three subjects only: First, \u201cthe existing rock bottom,\u201d which is the top of the loose rock; second, \u201cthe corresponding theoretical sections to be obtained,\u201d which means the so-called 9-foot and 15-foot lines, and the inclosed space as far out .as \u201cthe <em>contour line, </em>fifteen (15) feet below mean low water\u201d; and, third, \u201cthe <em>\u25a0corresponding </em>limiting lines to which payment will be made <em>%ohen it is impossible to produce the theoretical sections,\u201d </em>which to my apprehension means the 10-foot and 16-foot lines. In the fourth place, it was impossible before the work began, at any point except where solid rock ledge came right up to or very close to the river bottom, to ascertain where it would be necessary for the 45-degree line to spring. The specifications expressly provide that \u201call material of every description under the contract is to be measured by a comparison of <em>accurate </em>cross-sections.\u201d In the entire absence of accuracy about this springing point, I do not see how the \u201ctypical sections\u201d can be regarded as the <em>\u201caccurate </em>cross-sections,\u201d which plaintiff was thus told he could rely upon.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-6\">But the city urged on the trial that these accurate cross-sections were only to be taken \u201cbefore the commencement and after the completion of the work.\u201d It asseverated that no intermediate cross-section can be considered. If so, we would be led to the result that the cross-section taken after the completion of the work is the one which must fix the springing point, add that it was error to exclude plaintiff\u2019s calculation based on that hypothesis, for, if the original and the final- soundings were the only ones that can be considered, then it seems clear that the original ones must be taken for the top surface of the excavation, and the final ones for the bottom surface of it, and the actual springing point is located at the bottom surface, while the point to which a pipe would pierce at the time when the top surface is being sounded has no relation to the proper springing point at all. But the plaintiff\u2019s hypothesis was rejected for two reasons: First, that it would subject the city to the danger of fraud; and second, that it would leave no function for the words \u201cknown\u201d and \u201cindicated\u201d in the specifications.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-7\">It seems to me impossible to reach a reasonable conclusion without assuming that there is some word in these specifications which is used with a double meaning, and a reasonable result can be reached if a double meaning is attributed to the word \u201cwork\u201d in the clause which I have last quoted. The first step taken by plaintiff was to go over the whole area with what is called a clamshell dredge and carry away all the loose rock which can easily be removed by that means. It is fair to assume that whatever loose rock \u2022was left after this operation either that it was so small in amount that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>was cheaper for plaintiff to let it slide into the excavation and scoop it out again without additional compensation than to go on clamshelling for it any more, or else so large that it had a good chance of staying where it was until the cavity was excavated and walled up again. As soon as the clam-shell work was completed, and (except in the locality as to which defendant has a verdict) before blasting began, the city made a careful series of measurements over the whole area with both disc and rod. I think that for the purpose of fixing the springing point the \u201cwork\u201d may be said not to have been begun until the blasting began. Then the junction between the loose rock and the ledge rock became \u201cknown\u201d within the meaning of the specifications, and it should have been so \u201cindicated\" upon the cross-sections which were made by the Dock Department after the whole work was completed. This was not done. The soundings made by the city after the clamshell dredging were not used by the assistant engineer in making up the computation upon which the chief engineer\u2019s certificate was based. Instead, he used the old pipe soundings made before the contract was let, and when the line between the loose rock and the ledge rock was impossible of ascertainment. This deprived the contractor of any compensation for a very considerable amount of work, no part of which was \u201cextra work\" or \u201cadditional work\u201d in any proper sense, but all of which work was necessitated and contemplated by the contract. It is not fair, and I do not think that it was good law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-5\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> So far as the chief engineer\u2019s certificate in this ca.se was based merely upon miscalculation, the jury was directed to find in favor\u2018of the defendant. But so far, and so far only, as it was based upon a palpable mistake of law\u2014 upon misconstruction by an assistant engineer of the specifications which he himself had been permitted to draw\u2014the direction was in favor of the plaintiff. Such a certificate is disputable for mistake of law. Burke v. Mayor, 7 App. Div. 128, 40 N. Y. Supp. 81. It has, indeed, been ruled that a mistake, in order to be the basis of relief, not only must be palpable, but \u201cin general * * * must appear on the face of the award or in some paper delivered-with it,\u201d and the rule is sometimes stated without the qualifying phrase \u201cin general.\u201d Sweet v. Morrison, 116 N. Y. 19, 32, 33, 34, 22 N. E. 276, 15 Am. St. Rep. 376; Smith v. Mayor, 12 App. Div. 391, 394-395, 42 N. Y. Supp. 522. But the question does not seem to have been necessary to the decision, and in the Burke Case the mistake does not seem to have been apparent upon the face of the certificate. The rule in a case like this may be somewhat different from that applicable to an award upon a voluntary arbitration between private parties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-6\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> The records of the Dock Department contain a set of cross-sections made up on the basis of these intermediate soundings, and while those cross-sections are erroneous in certain details, and never were approved by the chief engineer, and were not \u201cdelivered with\" the certificate, I think that their existence is sufficient to give jurisdiction to the court to consider the case. As to .that part of the work for which a verdict was directed there was no dispute\" of fact and no question proper for a jury to pass upon. The assistant engineer, who was responsible for the chief engineer\u2019s certificate, practically agreed with plaintiff in the computation when he used the method of' computation upon which the certificate had been based.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-7\"><bracketnum>[6]</bracketnum> All the evidence as to the measurements-upon which the certificate had been based, and as to the measurements made by the city after the clam-shelling was finished and before the blasting began, was dragged by plaintiff\u2019s counsel out of the city\u2019s archives and its employ\u00e9s. The only piece of evidence which to any extent rested upon other testimony was the date when blasting began; and this stands undisputed, although the city put upon the stand an inspector of the Dock Department who had followed and watched the plaintiff\u2019s employ\u00e9s during the entire' course of the work, taking and preserving accurate records of the date and location of every act of drilling and blasting by them. To put such a witness upon the stand, and then not to bring out the documentary evidence which he had prepared as to the dates in question, was to admit that plaintiff\u2019s evidence as to those dates was correct. See McGuire v. Hartford Fire Insurance Co., 7 App. Div. 575, 590, 40 N. Y. Supp. 300; Reehil v. Fraas, 129 App. Div. 564, 114 N. Y.
