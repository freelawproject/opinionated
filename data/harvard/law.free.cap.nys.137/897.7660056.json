If the statement of defendants in the claim was false, then plaintiff has shown in this action sufficient ground for a recovery against defendants in fraud and deceit.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-10\">In order to prove the falsity of defendants\u2019 statement in the claim, and presumably, also, defendants\u2019 knowledge that the same was false, plaintiff undertook to show by witnesses the entire proceedings in an action which defendants brought against Block (the president of the Block Company) in respect of these very goods; their claim in such action being that the goods were delivered by the plaintiffs therein, the defendants here, to Block, not on memorandum, but pursuant to an absolute sale on 60 days\u2019 credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-11\">The learned trial judge seems to have been of opinion that the evidence offered in regard to the other suit, constituted an attempt in some way to use the other suit as res judicata. Both his rulings during the trial and his opinion at the close thereof indicate that his exclusion of that evidence was on theories relating to the subject of res judicata, namely, that the action was between other parties and involved other issues than the case at bar. In this, however, I think that he was in error, which is best illustrated by his refusal to permit a witness to testify to statements made by one of the present defendants in the course of testimony given by him in the suit against Block. These statements, constituting, on the issues of the present case, admissions against interest, were plainly competent and material in any aspect of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-12\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to' abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
