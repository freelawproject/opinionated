J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3F\">This is a special proceeding, brought by Kelly as a beneficiary under the will of Rooney, and as a party interested in Rooney\u2019s estate, for revocation of letters to the executor and trustee for misconduct, waste, and irresponsibility. The executor filed a- \"demurrer,\u201d and then, as of course, an answer. The appeal is from the ' order of the surrogate \u201coverruling said executor\u2019s demurrer to the 1 sufficiency of the petition herein, and further directing said executor to file an intermediate account of his proceedings as such executor,\u201d and from \u201ceach and every part of said order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-7\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> We are not aware that in the procedure of the Surrogates\u2019 Courts there is any pleading technically known as a demurrer. Red-field on Law and Practice of Surrogates\u2019 Courts says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1126-8\">\u201cDemurrers, as distinct forms of pleading, are unknown to the procedure of Surrogates\u2019 Courts; but the end contemplated by a demurrer in a civil action may be reached by a formal motion to strike out a pleading for insufficiency appearing on its face. Indeed, an objection of that sort may be taken informally at any stage of the hearing, and the question of the sufficiency' of the pleading will then be determined; the theory in these courts being that pleadings are addressed to the surrogate, for him to pass upon before they are pleaded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1126-9\">Any objection which the person cited desired to make could have been taken by answer to the petition. Redfield on Law and Practice of Surrogates\u2019 Courts, \u25a0\u00a7\u00a7 87, 439. But we will consider, that the so-called \u201cdemurrer\u201d was by way of formal motion to 'Strike out, or of objection, aside from the matters put in issue by the answer. But the appellant had best look to it that the points raised by the \u201cdemurrer\u201d appear upon the record in technical form, if he desire to reserve his right of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-10\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Appeals from the surrogate and his court are both authorized and limited by statute. Article 4, tit. 2, c. 18, of the Code of Civil Procedure. As this appeal is not from a decree, it must, if available, be from an order affecting a substantial right. Section 2570, Code of Civil Procedure. But' we think that an order of the surro-. gate which in effect refuses to dismiss a special proceeding merely upon the issue joined does not affect a substantial right. See Matter of Soule, 46 Hun, 661; Matter of Phalen, 51 Hun, 208, 4.N. Y. Supp. .408; see, too, Susz v. Forst, 4 Dem. Sur. 346-349.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-11\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> We think that an order which simply directs an immediate account is not appealable. Although the point was considered, but not decided, in Matter of Hurlburt, 43 Hun, 311-313, yet it was said that there was no substantial right affected. In Matter of Gilbert, 104 N. Y. 200, 10 N. E. 148, the court, per Finch, J., held that the order in question did involve a substantial right, but in effect seemed in accord with our view, inasmuch as the court say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1126-12\">\u201cIt went beyond a mere direction to account where assets are admitted and their amount is the sole controversy, and adjudged, against the defendant\u2019s denial, that there were assets, and settled the only substantial point of the litigation, except the amount of damages to be awarded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1127-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1101\">*1101</page-number>For the ground of the substantiality in that case, that the administrator had denied that he had any assets in his hands, is absent from the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-5\">The surrogate had the power to order, sua sponte, an accounting. The order recites:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-6\">\u201cFrom which petition, affidavits, and exhibits, as well as from the records of this court, it appears that eighteen (18) months have elapsed since letters were issued to said William Paschal Langevin, and that no account has been filed by him as said executor, or as said trustee or alleged trustee, and that no special proceeding, on a petition for a judicial settlement of his account as said executor, or as said trustee or alleged trustee, is pending.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1127-7\">See subdivision 4, \u00a7 2725, Code of Civil Procedure; Matter of Kennedy, 143 App. Div. 839, 128 N. Y. Supp. 626; Redfield! on Surrogates, \u00a7 916.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-8\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> The mere fact that the surrogate adjourned the hearing of the petition until after the intermediate accounting did not aggrieve the .appellant. Estate of Henry, 9 Civ. Proc. R. 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-9\">The appeal is dismissed, with costs to the respondent, to be paid by the appellant personally. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
