Defendants offered evidence in support of this allegation of the answer, which evidence was excluded under defendants\u2019 exception. The ability or inability of the proposed purchaser to convey -a good title is a material issue in an action of this character (Norman v. Reuther, 25 Misc. Rep. 161, 163, 54 N. Y. Supp. 152; Wiley v. Kraslow Construction Co., 141 App. Div. 706, 708, 126 N. Y. Supp. 879), and the exclusion of such evidence was reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">The judgment must therefore be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellants to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
