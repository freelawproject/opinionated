One of these guys was composed of two cables, joined together by passing one of them through a loop in the other; this loop being lined with a \u201cthim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number>ble\u201d to prevent grinding. The free end of the cable thus passed through is then clamped to its upper portion by two steel bolts, about 9 and 15 inches, respectively, above the thimble. The splicing had been in position seven or eight weeks. The derrick thus constructed stood partly on the highway. Grant Stevens was in defendant\u2019s employ as a hoisting engineer upon the work referred to, and among his duties was the raising or lowering of the boom of the derrick in obedience to signals. While thus engaged, and at about 11:30 a. m. on the day in question, the derrick suddenly collapsed and fell upon him, causing his instant death.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-5\">Plaintiff produced proof upon the trial from which it appeared with reasonable certainty that the collapse of the derrick was due to the loosening of the clamps or bolts upon the spliced cable, thus freeing the two parts thereof, and causing the fall of the entire derrick in the opposite direction and upon Stevens. It also appeared that no other part of the derrick had broken or given way. It was shown that the clamps were examined and tested every morning by an employ! of defendant, as there was danger that they might be tampered with and loosened, whereupon the derrick would fall; but such examination was not made upon the morning in question, and it had been in use from 8 a. m. to the happening of the accident without any examination since the morning of the preceding day.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-6\">Under these conditions, the plaintiff was not obliged to rest upon the doctrine of \u201cres ipsa loquitur\u201d to justify a submission of the case to the jury. On the contrary, she had produced evidence from which it fairly appeared that the fall of the derrick was due to the loosening of the clamps upon the spliced guy rope, and that such splicing had not been tested or inspected for more than 24 hours. This proof brought the case within the provisions of section 18 of the Labor Law, which forbids a person employing another to perforpi labor of any kind \u201cin the erection, repairing, altering or painting of a house, building or structure\u201d from furnishing scaffolding, hoists, stays, ladders, or other mechanical contrivances which are unsafe, unsuitable, or improper. We think it would be a very narrow and forced construction of this provision to limit its application to such works as are above ground, and to. deny its extension to subterranean operations. While the opening of a trench would not in itself come within the scope of the section, in the case at bar the construction of a sewer involved much more than that. A structure is defined by Bouvier as including \u201cthat which is built or constructed.\u201d \u201cIn the widest sense, any production or piece of work artificially built up, or composed of parts joined together in some definite manner.\u201d Century Dictionary. It has been applied to poles \u2022 connected by wires for the transmission of electricity (Forbes v. Willamette Falls Electric Co., 19 Or. 61, 23 Pac. 670, 20 Am. St. Rep. 793); to a mine or pit (Helm v. Chapman, 66 Cal. 291, 5 Pac. 352); to a railroad track (Lee v. Barkhampsted, 46 Conn. 213); to a vessel (Chaffee v. Union Dry Dock Co., 68 App. Div. 578, 73 N. Y. Supp. 908); to an oil well with its derrick and other appliances (Haskell v. Gallagher, 20 Ind. App. 224, 50 N. E. 485, 67 Am. St. Rep.; 250). As was said in Caddy v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>Interborough Rapid Transit Co., 125 App. Div. 681, 110 N. Y. Supp. 162 (affirmed 195 N. Y. 415, 88 N. E. 747, 30 L. R. A. [N. S.] 30):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1052-5\">\u201cI do not think the Legislature had in mind any particular kind of structure when it passed said statute. The evident purpose of the statute was to insure better protection to workingmen, whose work requires them to use a scaffold, hoists, stays, ladders or other like mechanical contrivances, under such circumstances as would imperil life or limb if the contrivance used were unsafe or insecure, and the word \u2018structure\u2019 was intended to include all structures which, like unto a house or building, require the use of scaffolds, hoists, stays, or ladders in their construction, alteration, or repair,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1052-6\">So that it would seem clear that, whether the work to be done is above, on, or below the ground, where appliances of the kind enumerated are required for the proper doing of the work, they must be safe, for the protection of those working upon or around them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-7\">When, therefore, plaintiff had shown that defendant furnished ah unsafe derrick, evidenced by its collapse due to the giving way of the spliced guy rope, and without a suggestion of any other cause for the collapse, and with .no proof of any outside force acting upon it, she had sustained the burden of proof imposed upon her and was entitled to have the defendant put to its proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-8\">The dismissal of the complaint herein was erroneous, and the judgment and order appealed from must therefore be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
