If the delay and default of the defendant caused the plaintiff any damage, such damage was made up of expenses which it incurred because its men were idle, or had to be reassembled, or because material was spoiled or wasted or was more expensive to obtain; and, if any changes or alterations were made of the contract,. the damage suffered consisted of increased labor and material. The plaintiff cannot state his grievances to the jury and let them estimate his damage, nor is it a subject of expert opinion. He must, therefore, prove the items of his damage. The plaintiff knows what those are or what they are claimed to be, and it will greatly facilitate the trial and work no hardship, we think, to compel it to state in advance of the trial of what such claims consist. The plaintiff should, therefore, also be required to serve upon the defendant a bill of particulars of the changes and alterations from the contract made by the defendant, and the increased cost of material and labor caused thereby and by the defaults and delays of defendant. If there be any other element of damage which the plaintiff can lawfully prove, no bill of particulars need be given thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">The order should be modified requiring a further bill of particulars as indicated, and, as so modified, affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements'to the appellant to abide the event of the action.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
