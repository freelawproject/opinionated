Complainant city condemned a strip off the rear along the railroad, varying from 100 to 200 feet wide, for aqueduct purposes, the taking of which did not interfere with any of defendant\u2019s buildings, but only cut off a portion of a pond. Defendant, after purchasing the property, improved the lakes or ponds thereon, rebuilt the buildings, etc., so that the entire property cost him about \u00a7100,000. There was no dispute that, viewed as acreage property only, the value of \u00a71,500 per acre was substantially correct. Experts called by claimant testified that the property had doubled in value within a few months after its purchase, and was worth as a whole \u00a7200,000, and that the value of the residue after the taking of the unimproved strip was only \u00a775,000. <em>Held, </em>that an award of \u00a745,000 was so fanciful and extravagant as to require vacation, notwithstanding the rule that ordinarily the report of commissioners will not be disturbed, because the opinion of the court differs from that of the commissioners as to the amount of damage.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b355-12\">[Ed.

The only question in this case is whether the order shall be affirmed, or the appeal dismissed upon the ground that the order is not appealable, for the determination of the commissioners was clearly without justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> George W. Loft, the appellant, is the owner of a plot of ground bounded on the south by the Merrick road and on the north by the Long Island Railroad. It is approximately 1,200 feet wide in the front and in the rear, and about 1,170 feet deep on each side, and contains about 42 acres. The strip taken is in the rear, immediately adjoining the railroad. The width of the plot will not be diminished by the taking. Its depth will be reduced to about 1,000 feet. Appellant purchased this property from two former owners. The first piece, consisting of about 26 acres, was purchased by him in February, 1907; the second piece, consisting of about 16 acres, was purchased in September of the same year. Title to the land condemned vested in the city on December 15, 1908, a little more than a year thereafter. The aggregate purchase price of the property was $68,000. At the time of the purchase there was upon it a house, designed for and since used by the owner as a country residence, some outbuildings, and some ponds or- lakes. After purchasing it, the pres-' ent owner expended in improving the property between $30,000 and $40,000. The lakes were cleaned out, new coping put around them, new bridges built, some of the old buildings torn down and rebuilt, the icehouse repaired, a new bowling alley erected, and the interior \u2022of the dwelling house was \u201cgutted and reconstructed.\u201d There was also some grading done upon the ground. The exact amount of the expenditure therefor does not appear, nor the various sums paid for these various improvements, except that the sum of $8,000 was expended upon the plumbing in the main house. From this property the city takes about 7% acres in the rear, none of which, so far as appears, is occupied by any buildings, although a portion of one of the ponds upon this property is included in the strip taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">Appellant\u2019s entire holdings had been acquired by him within a few months prior to the passing of title in the city, at a cost of about $100,000. For the land taken, constituting about one-sixth of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>whole, in the least desirable part thereof, and unimproved so far as any buildings thereon are concerned, the commissioners awarded him $45,000. There is no substantial dispute that, viewed as acreage property only, the value placed upon it by the city\u2019s expert of $1,500 per acre, or $11,250 in all, was substantially correct. The residue of the award is for supposed consequential damages. The experts called by the claimant testified that this property within a few months had doubled in value, and was worth as a whole $200,000, but that the value of the residue, after taking this unimproved strip in the rear, abutting on the railroad, was only $75,000, or, in other words, that the value of the land taken and the consequential damages to the residue was $125,000. It is difficult to believe that these experts were even \u201chonestly mistaken.\u201d The allowance made by the commissioners equals nearly one-half of the cost of the entire property, although the house, two of the ponds, all of the improvements, and the entire frontage of the plot are unaffected. While we recognize the rule that ordinarily the report of the commissioners will not be disturbed because the opinion of the court differs from that of the commissioners as to the amount of damage, this sum is, as characterized by the Special Term, so \u201cfanciful and extravagant\u201d that the court was bound to interfere.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Upon the question of the appealability of the order, we think much might be said in favor thereof, within the reasoning of Matter of Manhattan R. Co. v. O\u2019Sullivan, 6 App. Div. 571, 40 N. Y. Supp. 326; affirmed on opinion below 150 N. Y. 569, 44 N. E. 1125. Notwithstanding this, we are of the opinion that the question is not an open one in this court. We see no escape from the binding force of the decision in Matter of City of New York\u2014Hamilton Place, 143 App. Div. 302, 128 N. Y. Supp. 283; and Matter of Commissioner of Public Works, 111 App. Div. 285, 97 N. Y. Supp. 503, affirmed 185 N. Y. 391, 78 N. E. 146. The Court of Appeals, in the very recent case of Matter of Simmons, 203 N. Y. 241, 96 N. E. 456, has reviewed the authorities upon this perplexing question; and while it held that, under the statute then construed (Laws of 1905, c. 724), an appeal would lie to the Appellate Division from an order which vacated an award made by commissioners of appraisal, such determination was made to depend upon words appearing in that statute which are wanting in the charter provisions now under consideration, to wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-6\">\u201cBut from any determination of the Special Term an appeal may be taken to the Appellate Division.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">There is a clear intimation in the opinion in that case that, but for these words, the court would \u201cbe compelled to hold that an appeal only lay from a confirmation of the report.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">The appeal should be dismissed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
