He brought this action to recover the damages alleged to-have been sustained. At the trial he had a verdict of $1,500, which was .set aside, on the ground of exceptions taken during the trial and that it was against the evidence. The statute in force at the time the accident occurred, provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-12\">\u201cChildren under sixteen years of age shall not be permitted to operate or assist in operating dangerous machines of any kind.\u201d Section 81, Labor Law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-13\">The statute has since been amended, and is now section 93 of the Labor Law, and provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-14\">\u201cNo child under the age of sixteen years shall be employed or permitted to work in operating or assisting in operating any of the following machines\u201d\u2014 specifying them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-15\">An embossing machine operated as the one was by the plaintiff at the time he was injured is not one of those named.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-16\"><bracketnum>[1,2]</bracketnum> The trial court submitted to the jury, and I think correctly, the question as to whether or not the machine were a dangerous one within the meaning of the statute first quoted. If the embossing\u2019 machine were a dangerous one within the meaning of the statute, then the proof established, prima facie at least, the defendants\u2019 negligence. The plaintiff was -under 16 years of age and to permit him to operate the machine was in violation of.the statute. Gallenkamp v. Garvin Machine Co., 91 App. Div. 141, 86 N. Y. Supp. 378, reversed on dissenting opinion of Ingraham, J., 179 N. Y. 588, 72 N. E. 1142; Marino v. Lehmaier, 173 N. Y. 530, 66 N. E. 572, 61 L. R. A. 811.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-17\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> The machine was not out of repair, nor was it inherently dangerous. If dangerous at all, it was by reason of the manner in which it was operated. The defendants sought to show that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>the machine had been in operation about a year and a half and during that time no accident, prior to the one in question, had happened. This proof was excluded, and an exception taken. They also sought to prove that for upwards of 20 years they had been using some 20 similar embossing presses, and during that time no accident had occurred upon any of them. This proof was also excluded, and an exception taken. I think the court erred in excluding this proof, and for that reason the verdict was properly set aside. Whether the machine wer\u00e9 dangerous depended upon whether, in the ordinary course of its operation, danger to the operator were to be reasonably anticipated (Gallenkamp v. Garvin Machine Co., supra), and as bearing upon that subject it is difficult to imagine what proof could be more cogent than that this machine, or similar ones, had been used for many years, during which time no operator had been injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> I am- also of the opinion that the court erred in not permitting the defendants\u2019 counsel to cross-examine the plaintiff on the question of his contributory negligence. The statute does not cr\u00e9ate the cause of action, nor does it provide that its violation, in case of injury, entitles the one injured to damages. A violation of the statute; as indicated, undoubtedly furnishes presumptive evidence of defendants\u2019 negligence; and as said in the Marino Case it\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-6\">\u201cin effect' declares that a child under the age specified presumably does not possess the judgment, discretion, care, and caution necessary for the engagement in such a dangerous avocation, and is, therefore, not as a matter of law chargeable with contributory negligence, or with having assumed the risk of the employment in such occupation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">So here, while it could not be said as matter of law that the plaintiff assumed the risk incident to operating the machine, or that he was guilty of contributory negligence in the manner in which he did operate it, nevertheless, if the court had permitted the defendants to cross-examine the plaintiff on those subjects, his testimony might have been of such a character as would have justified the jury in finding that he was, in fact, guilty of contributory negligence. The defendants\u2019 counsel duly excepted to the ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">For the errors thus committed, I am of the opinion the verdict was properly set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">The order appealed from, therefore, is affirmed, with costs to the respondents to abide the event of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">LAUGHLIN, CLARKE, and SCOTT, JJ., concur. INGRAHAM, P. J., concurs, on the ground that it was error to exclude evidence as to the prior use of the machine.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
