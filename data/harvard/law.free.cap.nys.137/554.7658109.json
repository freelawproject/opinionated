Such is the decision. Matter of Gilroy, 43 App. Div. 359, 60 N. Y. Supp. 200, affirmed 164 N. Y. 576, 58 N. E. 1087. The guard rails are incident to the highways, to promote their safe use, and on account of such relation the town must maintain them. If there can be no award for the principal thing, there can be none for the incidents. For the highway closed, another, safe and sufficient for the demands of the public, must be made, and, fully completed, delivered to the town without expense to it. Then the duty of the town begins, and all care and expense, saye as to bridges, on the part of the city ceases. It may be that the new road, on account of its length, elevation, and peculiarity of construction, as regards form or material, may impose upon the town increased cost of maintenance. But that burden the state has cast upon it. The city must deliver a way well and adequately constructed, else it has not complied with the statute. That is a condition that precedes the in-. ception of the duty of the town. But, when the city has delivered a legal road, it has no duty to keep it, or any part of it, or to preserve its safety in any regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">Section 24 of the act gives its definition of \u201creal estate,\u201d and in terms includes a highway, and provides that those owning or claiming interest therein \u201cshall not, directly or indirectly, be subject to expense, loss or damage, by reason of changing such route or location, but that such expense, loss or damage shall be borne by the city of New York.\u201d From this language it could be argued that, where the substituted highway entailed greater cost of maintenance, the town did become \u201csubject to expense, loss or damage by reason of changing such route or location.\u201d But in view of the decision in the Matter of Gilroy, supra, that is not an open question.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Section 24 also provides that the commissioners \u201cshall include in the amount of such compensation such sum as shall be sufficient to defray the expenses of making such change of route and location and of building said railroad or highway.\u201d This places the expenses of changing the location on the city, but not the expense of preserving in suitable condition the highway in the new location. It is illogical that the city should not oppose the confirmation of the award for the upkeep of the embankment, and oppose the further award for the repair and replacement of the guard rails. But the fact that it consents to an award of one sum does not estop it from insisting that such sum shall not be increased. In McConnell v. Allen, 120 App. Div. 548, 105 N. Y. Supp. 16, the inquiry related to the disposition of money paid under the same act by the city to a town \u201cas damages for the increased obligation imposed upon the town for maintenance of the highways substituted.\u201d Mr. Justice Miller wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-6\">\"The town and the city recognized that the latter was not bound to maintain said substituted highways, and it had been so held (Matter of Gilroy, 43 App. Div. 359 [60 N. Y. Supp. 200], affirmed 164 N. Y. 576 [58 N. E. 1087]); but the increased expense of maintaining guard rails and a greater length of highway was deemed sufficient to support a claim for damages.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>There w\u00e1s no decision that such payment was compulsory. It can only be said that the city fitfully allows or disallows such damages, and it seems necessary to approve the legality of its present opposition to such award.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">The order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
