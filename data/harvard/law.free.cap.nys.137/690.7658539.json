The answer, among other things, denied the making of the alleged contract, and averred that it was never subscribed by the defendant or its agent, and was and is null and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-15\">Plaintiff\u2019s moving affidavit alleged that the defendant\u2019s president had personal knowledge of all the facts relating to the making of the alleged contract, and plaintiff claimed that he as the defendant\u2019s executive officer was the proper witness by whom to prove the execution and authenticity of the alleged contract. The order was vacated on the ground that an inspection and discovery of the defendant\u2019s books was the proper remedy, also because its president\u2019s personal knowledge was insufficiently shown. The president as the defendant\u2019s executive officer was not only the proper witness, but the best witness by whom to prove whether the contract was executed or authorized by the defendant. The execution or nonexecution of a contract by a business corporation is a question of fact within the knowledge of its executive officers, rather than a matter of book entry or bookkeeping.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-16\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion to vacate denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
