On March 4th defendant entered, and on March 4th or 6th he served a copy of the usual order denying, his motion for a new trial, which recited that it was entered on motion of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney. This order was never served upon defendant, but was only served by defendant upon plaintiff. On March 30, 1912, defendant served a notice of appeal from both judgment and order.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-16\">The time to serve a notice of appeal from the judgment expired on March 12th (Code, \u00a7 3190); but the time to appeal from the order denying a motion for a new trial had not expired, because that order was never served upon the defendant- (Code, \u00a7 3190; Baylies on New Trials and Appeals, 173; Harnett v. Westcott [Super.] 2 N. Y. Supp. 10; Kolatch v. Wiltchik, L. J., March 16, 1909). Service by the loser upon the winner does not limit the former\u2019s time to appeal. Kilmer v. Hathorn, 78 N.
