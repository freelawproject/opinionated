The Judge below who heard the motion stated in his opinion that \u201cthe defendant deliberately permitted a default to be taken against him without adequate excuse,\u201d and with this we entirely agree. The practice of permitting defaults to be taken, and subsequently moving to open them, and upon a denial of such motion appealing from the order, has become too prevalent in the Municipal Court, works a delay and a hardship in many instances, and flimsy excuses for such defaults should not be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-9\">Order afflrmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
