Ruman v. Natl. Slavonic Society, 144 App. Div. 574, 129 N. Y. Supp, 603, in that it appears in this case that the parent society, a membership corporation organized under the laws of the state of Pennsylvania, has been authorized to do business in this state. But it is none the less a foreign corporation. The relator is a nonresident, and the subordinate lodge from which he was expelled is not a resident lodge of the state of New York. Under such circumstances, the courts of this state should decline jurisdiction, even if they have it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-15\">The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
