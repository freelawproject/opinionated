No opportunity was afforded the defendant to procure other trial counsel, nor should he have assumed, before the morning of the 18th, that his request to have the case held pending the completion of his trial counsel's engagement would have been denied. It is obvious that the default taken under these conditions must be opened, and the judgment taken thereunder vacated and set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1090\">*1090</page-number>The order appealed from is therefore reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, the cause to be restored to the preferred calendar of the court for trial as soon as it can be reached.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
