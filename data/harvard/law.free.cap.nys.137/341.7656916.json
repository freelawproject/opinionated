I will first consider the second parcel.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-13\"><bracketnum>[ 1 ]</bracketnum> Maher devised it to his wife during her widowhood, and added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-14\">\u201cBut if my said wife should die during the lifetime of my child or children, the said property hereby left to her shall revert and be divided between my two children, John and Katie Maher, and should any or either of these children die, the portion belonging to such deceased child shall revert to the next of kin.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-15\">The wife died in 1899, and both children before her. Hence nothing came to either child by the happening of the first condition named, viz., death of the wife before him or her. The second condition happened; that is, both children, first John, then Katie, died, and that, too, before the wife. Where did the property go ? Did it go to John and Katie by implication, by descent, or to the \u201cnext of kin\u201d of the child dying? I think the general rule, \u201cdying before the testator,\u201d should apply. Whatever alternative prevails, Katie took the property. The court has found that Katie and John took under the will, and the former inherited John\u2019s one-half. Let it be so.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-16\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Katie made a will whereby she gave the remainder to her children surviving her husband, life tenant. She had two children, Marie and Henry Second. The former one survived the life tenant and took the remainder, and the plaintiff, who was her half-brother, inherited nothing from her, as the land came from her ancestor. Justice Clark proceeds on the theory that, Henry Second not surviving the life tenant, Dr. McLean took one-half and that Marie inherited this from him, and that plaintiff could take it. I think that this is in clear violation of the very words of the will. The first parcel belonged to Katie and went under her will to Marie, to the exclusion\" of Henry Second. Hence, plaintiff is excluded from that.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-17\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> But it is urged that Henry Second was born after Katie\u2019s will was made, and the question is whether provision was made for him. If not, he took one-half of the land under the statute (Decedent Estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Law [Consol. Laws 1909, c. 13] \u00a7 26) and died; Marie inherited from him, and plaintiff inherits that one-half from Marie. Was Henry 'Second \u201cprovided for\u201d or \u201cin any way mentioned\u201d in Katie\u2019s will? He was not individualized, and, if that be necessary, he was neither mentioned nor provided for. But upon his birth he came under the word \u201cissue,\u201d and was vested with an undivided half of his mother\u2019s estate, subject to being divested thereof by his death before his father, so that provision was made for him in the class that would take it. Hence, the case is similar to that of Minot v. Minot, 17 App. Div. 521, 45 N. Y. Supp. 554. See, also, Wormser v. Croce, 120 App. Div. 287-290, 104 N. Y. Supp. 1090; Stachelberg v. Stachelberg, 124 App. Div. 232, 108 N. Y. Supp. 645, affirmed 192 N. Y. 576, 85 N. E. 1116; Tavshanjian v. Abbott, 200 N. Y. 374, 93 N. E. 978. Therefore, as he was mentioned and provided for in his mother\u2019s will, and took a vested estate, which he lost by not surviving her, his sister Marie inherited nothing from him; hence the plaintiff can inherit nothing from her.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">As to parcel No. 1, the! result is the same, for that land belonged to Mrs. McLean, and passed under her. will to her husband for life, with remainder to Marie and Henry Second, and, Henry Second dying, Marie took the whole under the will, and, as the plaintiff is not of the blood, he takes nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">The judgment should be reversed, and the defendants have judgment on the demurrer, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
