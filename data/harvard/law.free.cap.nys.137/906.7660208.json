Under the agreement sued upon the plaintiff\u2019s assignor had the <em>exclusive </em>right to sell $160,000 worth of stock of the defendant corporation, and was to receive therefor a commission of 15 per cent, on all sales of said stock. The agreement provided that, in so far as the plaintiff\u2019s assignor was concerned, \u201ca signed subscription and 2,5 per cent, in cash was to constitute a sale.\u201d The plaintiff proved that, before the exclusive right of his assignor .to sell stock had expired, the defendant sold over $6,200 worth of stock to various persons in exchange for merchandise and patent rights. The learned court below directed a verdict for the defendant, upon the ground that the plaintiff could not recover commissions for sales made by defendant, because those sales were not made upon the terms upon which, under the agreement, the plaintiff\u2019s assignor was limited to selling.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-9\">We think that this ruling was incorrect. The contract gave the plaintiff\u2019s assignor the exclusive right to sell stock. This right was inconsistent with any right on the part of the defendant to sell stock. The provision in the contract that a signed subscription and 25 per cent, payment in cash should constitute a sale was intended to limit the terms upon which the plaintiff\u2019s assignor was authorized to sell the stock. It was' not intended to mean that the defendant could sell stocks, provided it sold them upon different or less stringent terms than those upon which the plaintiff\u2019s assignor was required to sell. Such a construction of the contract would render the exclusive privilege to the plaintiff\u2019s assignor valueless. As we construe the contract, its meaning is that the plaintiff had the exclusive right to sell $160,000 worth of stock, and that he was only authorized to sell upon obtaining a subscription and 25 per cent, cash, and that, while this exclusive privilege was outstanding, the defendant had no right to sell stock, and, if it did sell, the plaintiff was entitled to recover damages equaling the commissions that he would have earned upon such sales, even though the defendant sold upon terms different from those upon which the plaintiff\u2019s assignor was limited to selling.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-10\">It follows that the judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
