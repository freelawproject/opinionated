O. D. to J. T. Saidy at Excelsior Springs, Mo., by the defendant, the Adams Express Company. On March 25, 1910, he modified the shipment to read, \u201cDeliver to M. A. Saidy, Denver, Colo., without C. O. D.,\u201d which was indorsed -on the express receipt. This did not relieve the consignee from the payment of the express charges, but only from payment of the value of the goods. The goods were never delivered or tendered to the consignee, but were returned to the plaintiff conditionally on his paying express charges back and forth, which were demanded by defendant and refused by plaintiff. The defendant company, having failed to perform its contract, was not entitled to demand payment of express charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-10\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The defense was that- the Wells Fargo Express Company is the only express company at Excelsior Springs, that both they and the defendant were gratuitous bailees, and defendant was not liable for the connecting carrier\u2019s error or nondelivery, if any. Under the Carmack amendment (34 U. S. Stat. at Large, 595, \u00a7 <em>7, </em>pars. 11, 12), a connecting carrier acts as agent for the initial carrier, which is made -liable as if it itself had done the- act complained of. The purpose of the Carmack amendment was to enable the shipper, in case of loss or damage to his goods to have recourse to the initial carrier, and leave athe initial carrier to its recourse, for whatever damages it might have 4\u00a9 pay to the connecting carrier doing the injury. If there is anythingjin the express receipt contrary to the Carmack amendment, it is in-valid. De Winter &amp;. Co. v. Texan Central R. R. Co., 150 App. Div. 612, 616, 617, 135 N. Y.
