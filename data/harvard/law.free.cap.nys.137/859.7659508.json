The pleadings were oral, and the answer a general denial. At the close of the plaintiff.\u2019s case, the defendant moved to dismiss the complaint, upon the ground that plaintiff had failed to prove damages, and also that the property shown to have been in the possession of the defendant was not the same property covered by the mortgage. This motion was denied, and the defendant thereupon rested, without giving any testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-9\">The court below rendered a judgment absolute against the plaintiff, and in favor of the defendant. A judgment of this character can only be given when it appears from the whole case that the plaintiff cannot recover as a matter of law. Section 249, Municipal Court Act (Laws 1902, c. 580); Sultan v. Misrahi, 47 Misc. Rep. 655, 94 N. Y. Supp. 519.
