S. 1, 6, 12 L. Ed. 2d 653. In <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California, </em>decided on April 28,1965, the court held that adverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>comment by a prosecutor or trial judge upon a defendant\u2019s failure to testify in a state criminal trial violates the federal privilege against compulsory self-incrimination, because such comment \u201ccuts down on the privilege by making its assertion costly.\u201d 380 U. S. 609, 614, 14 L. Ed. 2d 106. The question before us now is whether the rule of <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California </em>is to be given retrospective application.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">In the summer of 1961 the respondent was brought to trial before a jury in an Ohio court upon an indictment charging violations of the Ohio Securities Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The respondent did not testify in his own behalf, and the prosecuting attorney in his summation to the jury commented extensively upon that fact.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The jury found the respondent guilty, the judgment of conviction was affirmed by an Ohio court of appeals, and the Supreme Court of Ohio declined further review. <em>State </em>v. <em>Shott, </em>173 Ohio St. 542. The respondent then brought his case to this court, claiming several constitutional errors but not attacking the Ohio comment rule as such. On May 13, 1963, we dismissed the appeal and denied certiorari, Mr. Justice Black dissenting. <em>Shott </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>373 U. S. 240, 10 L. Ed. 2d 409. No petition for rehearing was filed. All avenues of direct review of the respondent\u2019s conviction were thus fully foreclosed more than a year before our decision in <em>Malloy </em>v. <em>Hogan, supra, </em>and almost two years before our decision in <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">A few weeks after our denial of certiorari the respondent sought a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, again alleging various constitutional violations at his state trial, but again not attacking the Ohio comment rule as such. The District Court dismissed the writ, and the respondent appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. On November 10,1964, the court reversed, noting that \u201cthe day before the oral argument of this appeal, the Supreme Court in <em>Malloy </em>v. <em>Hogan </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>* * * reconsidered its previous rulings and held that the Fifth Amendment\u2019s exception from self-incrimination is also protected by the Fourteenth Amendment against abridgment by the states,\u201d and reasoning that \u201cthe protection against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment includes not only the right to refuse to answer incriminating questions, but also the right that such refusal shall not be commented upon by counsel for the prosecution.\u201d 337 F. 2d 990, 992.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">We granted certiorari, requesting the parties \u201cto brief and argue the question of the retroactivity of the doctrine announced in <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California * * supra. </em>Since, as we have noted the original Ohio judgment of conviction in this case became final long before <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California </em>was decided by this court, that question is squarely presented.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">In <em>Linkletter </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>381 U. S. 618, 14 L. Ed. 2d 601, we held that the exclusionary rule of <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>367 U. S. 643, 86 Ohio Law Abs. 513, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1081, was not to be given retroactive effect. The <em>Linkletter </em>opinion reviewed in some detail the competing conceptual and jurisprudential theories bearing on the problem of whether a judicial decision that overturns previously established law is to be given retroactive or only prospective application. Mr. Justice Clark\u2019s opinion for the court outlined the history and theory of the problem in terms both of the views of the commentators and of the decisions in this and other courts which have reflected those views. It would be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>needless exercise here to survey again a field so recently and thoroughly explored.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Rather, we take as our starting point <em>Linkletter\u2019s </em>conclusion that \u201cthe accepted rule today is that in appropriate cases the court may in the interest of justice make the rule prospective,\u201d that there is \u201cno impediment \u2014 constitutional or philosophical \u2014 to the use of the same rule in the constitutional area where the exigencies of the situation require such an application,\u201d in short that \u201cthe Constitution neither prohibits nor requires retrospective effect.\u201d Upon that premise, resolution of the issue requires us to \u201cweigh the merits and demerits in each case by looking to the prior history of the rule in question, its purpose and effect, and whether retrospective operation will further or retard its operation.\u201d 381 U. S., at 628-629.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\"><em>Twining </em>v. <em>New Jersey </em>was decided in 1908. 211 U. S. 78, 53 L. Ed. 97. In that case the plaintiffs in error had been convicted by the New Jersey courts after a trial in which the judge had instructed the jury that it might draw an adverse inference from the defendants\u2019 failure to testify. The plaintiffs in error urged in this court two propositions: \u201c [f]irst, that the exemption from compulsory self-incrimination is guaranteed by the Federal Constitution against impairment by the states; and, second, if it be so guaranteed, that the exemption was in fact impaired in the case at bar.\u201d 211 U. S., at 91. In a lengthy opinion which thoroughly considered both the Privileges and Immunities Clause and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the court held, explicitly and unambiguously, \u201cthat the exemption from compulsory self-incrimination in the courts of the states is not secured by any part of the Federal Constitution.\u201d 211 U. S., at 114. Having thus rejected the first proposition advanced by the plaintiffs in error, the court refrained from passing on the second. That is, the court did not decide whether adverse comment upon a defendant\u2019s failure to testify constitutes a violation of the federal constitutional right against self-incrimination.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>The rule thus established in the <em>Twining case </em>was reaffirmed many times through the ensuing years. In an opinion for the court in 1934, Mr. Justice Cardozo cited <em>Twining </em>for the proposition that \u201c[t]he privilege against self-incrimination may be withdrawn and the accused put upon the stand as a witness for the state.\u201d <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>291 U. S. 97, 105, 78 L. Ed. 674, 90 A. L. R. 575. Two years later Chief Justice Hughes, writing for a unanimous court, reiterated the explicit statements of the rule in <em>Twining </em>and <em>Snyder, </em>noting that \u201c [t]he compulsion to which the quoted statements refer is that of the processes of justice by which the accused may be called as a witness and required to testify.\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>297 U. S. 278, 285, 80 L. Ed. 682. In 1937 the court again approved the <em>Twining </em>doctrine in <em>Palko </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>302 U. S. 319, 324, 325-326, 82 L. Ed. 288. In <em>Adamson </em>v. <em>California, </em>332 U. S. 46, 91 L. Ed. 1903, 171 A. L. R. 1233, the issue was once more presented to the court in much the same form as it had been presented almost 40 years earlier in <em>Twining. </em>In <em>Adamson </em>there had been comment by judge and prosecutor upon the defendant\u2019s failure to testify at his trial, as permitted by the California Constitution. The court again followed <em>Twining </em>in holding that the Fourteenth Amendment does not require a state to accord the privilege against self-incrimination, and, as in <em>Twining, </em>the court did not reach the question whether adverse comment upon a defendant\u2019s failure to testify would violate the Fifth Amendment privilege.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thereafter the court continued to adhere to the <em>Twining </em>rule, notably in <em>Knapp </em>v. <em>Schweitzer, </em>decided in 1958, 357 U. S. 371, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>374, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1393, and in <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Hurley, </em>decided in 1961, 366 U. S. 117, 127-129, 6 L. Ed. 2d 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">In recapitulation, this brief review clearly demonstrates: (1) For more than half a century, beginning in 1908, the court adhered to the position that the Federal Constitution does not require the states to accord the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. (2) Because of this position, the court during that period never reached the question whether the federal guarantee against self-incrimination prohibits adverse comment upon a defendant\u2019s failure to testify at his trial.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although there were strong dissenting voices,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the court made not the slightest deviation from that position during a period of more than 50 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Thus matters stood in 1964, when <em>Malloy </em>v. <em>Hogan </em>announced that the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment against abridgment by the states (378 U. S. 6). Less than a year later, on April 28, 1965, <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California </em>held that the Fifth Amendment \u201cin its bearing on the states by reason of the Fourteenth Amendment, forbids * <em>* </em>* comment by the prosecution on the accused\u2019s silence * * (380 U. S., at 615.)</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Thus we must reckon here, as in <em>Linkletter, </em>381 U. S., at 636, with decisional history of a kind which Chief Justice Hughes pointed out \u201cis an operative fact and may have consequences which cannot justly be ignored. The past cannot always be erased by a new judicial declaration.\u201d <em>Chicot County Drainage Dist. </em>v. <em>Baxter State Bank, </em>308 U. S. 371, 374, 84 L. Ed. 329. It is against this background that we look to the purposes of the <em>Griffin </em>rule, the reliance placed upon the <em>Twining </em>doctrine, and the effect on the administration of justice of a retrospective application of <em>Griffin. </em>See <em>Linkletter </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>381 U. S., at 636.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">In <em>Linkletter, </em>the court stressed that the prime purpose of the rule of <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio,</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>rejecting the doctrine of <em>Wolf </em>v. <em>Colorado</em><footnotemark>11</footnotemark> as to the admissibility of unconstitutionally seized evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>dence, was \u201cto deter the lawless action of the police and to effectively enforce the Fourth Amendment.\u201d 381 U. S., at 637. There we could \u201cnot say that this purpose would be advanced by making the rule retrospective. The misconduct of the police prior to <em>Mapp </em>has already occurred and will not be corrected by releasing the prisoners involved. \u2019 \u2019 <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">No such single and distinct \u201cpurpose\u201d can be attributed to <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California, </em>holding it constitutionally impermissible for a state to permit comment by a judge or prosecutor upon a defendant\u2019s failure to testify in a criminal trial. The <em>Griffin </em>opinion reasoned that such comment \u201cis a penalty imposed by courts for exercising a constitutional privilege. It cuts down on the privilege by making its assertion costly.\u201d 380 U. S., at 614. It follows that the \u201cpurpose\u201d of the <em>Griffin </em>rule is to be found in the whole complex of values that the privilege against self-incrimination itself represents, values described in the <em>Malloy case </em>as reflecting \u201crecognition that the American system of criminal prosecution is accusatorial, not inquisitorial, and that the Fifth Amendment privilege is its essential mainstay. * * * Governments, state and federal, are thus constitutionally compelled to establish guilt by evidence independently and freely secured, and may not by coercion prove a charge against an accused out of his own mouth.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> 378 U. S., at 7-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>Insofar as these \u201cpurposes\u201d of the Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination bear on the question before us in the present case, several considerations become immediately apparent. First, the basic purposes that lie behind the privilege against self-incrimination do not relate to protecting the innocent from conviction, but rather to preserving the integrity of a judicial system in which even the guilty are not to be convicted unless the prosecution \u201cshoulder the entire load.\u201d Second, since long before <em>Twining </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>all the states have by their own law respected these basic purposes by extending the protection of the testimonial privilege against self-incrimination to every defendant tried in their criminal courts. In <em>Twining </em>the court noted that \u201call the states of the union have, from time to time, with varying form, but uniform meaning, included the privilege in their Constitutions, except the states of New Jersey and Iowa, and in those states it is held to be part of the existing law.\u201d 211 U. S., at 92. See also 8 Wigmore, Evidence (McNaughton rev., 1961), Section 2252. It follows that such variations as may have existed among the states in the application of their respective guarantees against self-incrimination during the 57 years between <em>Twining </em>and <em>Griffin </em>did not go to the basic purposes of the federal privilege. And finally, insofar as strict application of the federal privilege against self-incrimination reflects the Constitution\u2019s concern for the essential values represented by \u201cour respect for the inviolability of the human personality and of the right of each individual \u2018to a private enclave where he may lead a private life,\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>any impingement upon those values resulting from a state\u2019s application of a variant from the federal standard cannot now be remedied. As we pointed out in <em>Linkletter </em>with respect to the Fourth Amendment rights there in question, \u201cthe ruptured privacy * * * cannot be restored.\u201d 381 U. S., at 637.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">As in <em>Mapp, </em>therefore, we deal here with a doctrine which rests on considerations of quite a different order from those underlying other recent constitutional decisions which have been applied retroactively. The basic purpose of a trial is the determination of truth, and it is self-evident that to deny a lawyer\u2019s help through the technical intricacies of a criminal trial or to deny a full opportunity to appeal a conviction because the accused is poor is to impede that purpose and to infect a criminal proceeding with the clear danger of convicting the innocent. See <em>Gideon </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>372 U. S. 335, 9 L. Ed. 2d 799; <em>Doughty </em>v. <em>Maxwell, </em>376 U. S. 202, 11 L. Ed. 2d 650; <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>351 U. S. 12, 100 L. Ed. 891; <em>Eskridge </em>v. <em>Washington Prison Board, </em>357 U. S. 214, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1269. The same can surely be said of the wrongful use of a coerced confession. See <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Denno, </em>378 U. S. 368, 12 L. Ed. 2d 908, 1 A. L. R. 3d 1205; <em>McNerlin </em>v. <em>Denno, </em>378 U. S. 368, 12 L. Ed. 2d 1041; <em>Reck </em>v. <em>Pate, </em>367 U. S. 433, 6 L. Ed. 2d 948. By contrast, the Fifth Amendment\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination is not an adjunct to the ascertainment of truth. That privilege, like the guarantees of the Fourth Amendment, stands as a protection of quite different constitutional values \u2014 values reflecting the concern of our society for the right of each individual to be let alone. To recognize this is no more than to accord those values undiluted respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">There can be no doubt of the states\u2019 reliance upon the <em>Twining </em>rule for more than a half century, nor can it be doubted that they relied upon that constitutional doctrine in the utmost good faith. Two states amended their constitutions so as expressly to permit comment upon a defendant\u2019s failure to testify, Ohio in 1912,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and California in 1934.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> At least four other states followed some variant of the rule permitting comment.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>Moreover, this reliance was not only invited over a much longer period of time, during which the <em>Twining </em>doctrine was repeatedly reaffirmed in this court, but was of unquestioned legitimacy as compared to the reliance of the states upon the doctrine of <em>Wolf </em>v. <em>Colorado, </em>considered in <em>Linhletter </em>as an important factor militating against the retroactive application of <em>Mapp. </em>During the 11-year period between <em>Wolf </em>v. <em>Colorado </em>and <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>the states were aware that illegal seizure of evidence by state officers violated the Federal Constitution.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In the 56 years that elapsed from <em>Twining </em>to <em>Malloy, </em>by contrast, the states were repeatedly told that comment upon the failure of an accused to testify in a state criminal trial in no way violated the Federal Constitution.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">The last important factor considered by the court in <em>Linhletter </em>was \u201cthe effect on the administration of justice of a retrospective application of <em>Mapp.\u201d </em>381 U. S. at 636. A retrospective application of <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California </em>would increase stresses upon the administration of justice more concentrated but fully as great as would have been created by a retrospective application of <em>Mapp. </em>A retrospective application of <em>Mapp </em>would have had an impact only in those states which had not themselves adopted the exclusionary rule, apparently some 24 in number.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> A restrospective application of <em>Griffin </em>would have an impact only upon those states which have not themselves adopted the no comment rule, apparently six in number.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> But upon those six states the impact would be very grave indeed. It is not in every criminal trial that tangible evidence of a kind that might raise <em>Mapp </em>issues is offered. But it may fairly be assumed that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>has been comment, in every single trial in the courts of California, Connecticut, Iowa, New Jersey, New Mexico, and Ohio, in which the defendant did not take the witness stand \u2014 in accordance with state law and with the United States Constitution as explicitly interpreted by this court for 57 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">Empiracal statistics are not available, but experience suggests that California is not indulging in hyperbole when in its <em>amicus curiae </em>brief in this case it tells us that \u201cPrior to this court\u2019s decision in <em>Griffin, </em>literally thousands of cases were tried in California in which comment was made upon the failure of the accused to take the stand. Those reaping the greatest benefit from a rule compelling retroactive application of <em>Griffin </em>would be [those] under lengthy sentences imposed many years before <em>Griffin. </em>Their cases would offer the least likelihood of, a successful retrial since in many, if not most, instances, witnesses and evidence are no longer available. \u2019 \u2019 There is nothing to suggest that what would be true in California would not also be true in Connecticut, Iowa, New Jersey, New Mexico, and Ohio. To require all of those states now to void the conviction of every person who did not testify at his trial would have an impact upon the administration of their criminal law so devastating as to need no elaboration.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">We have proceeded upon the premise that \u201cwe are neither required to apply, nor prohibited from applying a decision retrospectively.\u201d <em>Linkletter </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>381 U. S. at 629. We have considered the purposes of the <em>Griffin </em>rule, the reliance placed upon the <em>Twining </em>doctrine, and the effect upon the administration of justice of a retrospective application of <em>Griffin. </em>After full consideration of all of the factors, we are not able to say that the <em>Griffin </em>rule requires, retrospective application.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The judgment is vacated and the case remanded to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit for consideration of the claims contained in the respondent\u2019s petition for habeas corpus, claims which that court has never considered. It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">\n<em>Judgment vacated and case remanded with directions.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b107-8\">Mr. Justice Black, with whom Mr. Justice Douglas joins, dissents for substantially the same reasons stated in his dissenting opinion in <em>Linkletter </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>381 U.

S. 618, 14 L. Ed. 2d 601, the <em>Griffin </em>rule is not to be applied retroactively in those states. <em>In re Gaines, </em>Cal., 45 Cal. Rptr. 865, 404 P. 2d 473; <em>Pinch </em>v. <em>Maxwell, 3 </em>Ohio St. 2d 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">As in <em>Linkletter, </em>the question in the present case is not one of \u201cpure prospectivity.\u201d The rule announced in <em>Griffin </em>was applied to reverse Griffin\u2019s conviction. Compare <em>England </em>v. <em>Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners, </em>375 U. S. 411, 11 L. Ed. 2d 440. Nor is there any question of the applicability of the Griffin rule to cases still pending on direct review at the time it was announced. Cf. <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>382 U. S. 286, 15 L. Ed. 2d 337. December 13, 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">The precise question is whether the rule of <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California </em>is to be applied to cases in which the judgment of conviction was rendered, the availability of appeal exhausted, and the time for petition for certiorari elapsed or a petition for certiorari finally denied, all before April 28, 1965.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b100-6\"> See <em>Linkletter </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>381 U.

We do not pass upon the conflict, because, for the reasons given, we think that the exemption from compulsory self-incrimination in the courts of the states is not secured by any part of the Federal Constitution.\u201d 211 U.
