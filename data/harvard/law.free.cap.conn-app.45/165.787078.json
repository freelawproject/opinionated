We are unpersuaded and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. On December 23, 1988, at about 4 p.m., the plaintiff Alicia Eisenbach was operating a 1984 Dodge four door automobile on Fairfield Avenue in Bridgeport. The plaintiff Jennifer McClure was a passenger in the Eisenbach vehicle and was sitting in the front passenger seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">The defendant Aaron A. Downey was operating a 1986 Chevrolet van owned by the defendant Michael Jackson on Martin Terrace near its intersection with Fairfield Avenue. At that intersection, the traffic on Martin Terrace must stop at a stop sign, while traffic on Fairfield Avenue does not stop. Fairfield Avenue is divided by a center esplanade with two lanes of traffic in each direction. Martin Terrace has a single lane of traffic in each direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Intending to cross Fairfield Avenue, Downey cut in front of the Eisenbach vehicle and the two vehicles collided. The Eisenbach vehicle had the right-of-way at the intersection. Downey was obligated to stop at the stop sign and to yield the right-of-way to vehicles that were in the intersection or approaching so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard. This he failed to do. Further, although it was dusk and drizzling, Downey failed to display proper headlights, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-96 (a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>As a result of this collision, Eisenbach suffered multiple injuries including a disc herniation at L5-S1 with encroachment on both lateral recesses. She also suffered an injury to her neck and other parts of her body and incurred a permanent partial disability of 8 percent to her low back and 5 percent to her neck. She incurred substantial medical and other expenses and lost considerable time from her employment with a resultant loss of income. She will incur medical and other expenses in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">As a result of the collision, McClure suffered injuries to her neck, low back and left knee. She incurred a permanent disability of 5 percent to the lumbar spine and 5 percent to the neck. While she was in the acute stage following her injury, she lost use of her whole spine to the extent of 36 percent and in the chronic stage she lost use of 14 percent of her spine as a whole. She incurred substantial medical and other expenses and lost some time from her employment. She will also incur medical and other expenses in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">The case was submitted to the jury with interrogatories as to each plaintiff.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The jury returned a verdict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>of $219,747.29<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in favor of Eisenbach and a verdict of $67,231.80<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in favor of McClure. The defendants filed postverdict motions to set aside the verdicts and for remittitur. The trial court denied both motions. Eisenbach filed a motion for interest pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 350, which was granted by the trial court. This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">The defendants first assert that the trial court improperly refused to excuse James R. Platko, a venireperson, for cause, thereby violating the defendants\u2019 constitutional right to trial before an impartial jury. They also claim that the trial court\u2019s failure to excuse the venireperson for cause constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">Certain additional facts are necessary to an understanding of our resolution of this claim. Platko was called for voir dire examination and was questioned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>first by the defendants, then by the plaintiffs. In the course of the plaintiffs\u2019 voir dire, statements were elicited that indicated that the venireperson was familiar with Robert Russo, Jr., a radiologist, who was to be a witness on behalf of one of the plaintiffs. Examination by the plaintiffs revealed that Platko\u2019s wife had seen Russo for a mammogram five or six years prior to the trial, and that Platko had cleaned house for Russo when Platko had been operating a house cleaning service. Platko explained that when he worked for Russo he seldom saw him. Platko stated that the fact that he knew Russo would not cause him to believe or disbelieve Russo more than any one else and that it would not cause aproblem for him to judge Russo\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">After the venireperson left the courtroom, the defendants addressed the trial court concerning Platko.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>defendants moved that Platko be excused for cause. The trial court denied this motion and, as the defendants had exhausted their peremptory challenges, Platko was accepted by the plaintiffs and became a member of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The defendants first argue that in declining to excuse Platko for cause, the trial court violated the defendants\u2019 constitutional right to a trial before an impartial jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The Connecticut constitution provides that \u201c \u2018[i]n civil and criminal actions tried by a jury, the parties shall have the right to challenge jurors peremptorily . . . .\u2019 Conn. Const., art. I \u00a7 19, as amended by art. IV . . . .This constitutional enactment reflects the abiding belief of our citizenry that an impartial and fairly chosen jury is the cornerstone of our criminal justice system.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hancich, </em>200 Conn. 615, 625, 513 A.2d 638 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">A trial court\u2019s refusal to remove a juror for cause is reversible error only if the party has exhausted all of his or her peremptory challenges and \u201can additional challenge is sought and denied.\u201d <em>State </em>v. Esposito, 223 Conn. 299, 310-11, 613 A.2d 242 (1992). Here, the defendants had exhausted all of their peremptory chal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>lenges at the time that they moved to excuse Platko for cause, but they failed to request an additional peremptory challenge with which to remove Platko. On the basis of the holding in <em>Esposito, </em>we conclude that the trial court\u2019s refusal to remove Platko for cause did not constitute reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">The defendants did not request the trial court\u2019s permission to reinquire of Platko. They started by saying that they had intended to do so, but, in response to a direct inquiry from the trial court, failed to make such a request. In fact, the defendants responded that they simply wanted to make \u201ca statement for cause.\u201d The trial court, therefore, did not address the claim now before us because the defendants failed to request that they be permitted to conduct a further inquiry of Platko. We will not usurp the prerogative of the trial court by reviewing this claim. See <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Cordisco, </em>37 Conn. App. 515, 526, 657 A.2d 230, cert. denied, 234 Conn. 907, 659 A.2d 1207 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">The defendants further assert that \u201c[i]t is reversible error to deny a motion to excuse \u2018for cause\u2019 when the appellant shows that a purportedly biased or unsuitable juror actually sat on the final jury which rendered the unfavorable result.\u201d Although not raised as clearly before the trial court, as is preferred, this claim appears to have been at least colorably raised and ruled on.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">The trial court\u2019s determination as to the competency of a juror to serve in the trial of a case is within its broad discretion. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Cubano, </em>203 Conn. 81, 88-89, 523 A.2d 495 (1987). In challenging the competency of a juror to sit on the panel, the defendants bear the burden of raising a claim of actual bias from speculation to fact. To satisfy that burden of proving actual bias, the party challenging for cause must show that the juror\u2019s state of mind and opinion were fixed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>See <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>New Britain General Hospital, </em>203 Conn. 570, 582, 525 A.2d 1319 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">A review of Platko\u2019s answers to questions addressed to him on the voir dire fails to establish any bias or prejudice on his part. Platko explained that he had cleaned Russo\u2019s house years previous but had little personal contact with him, and that his wife had consulted Russo for a mammogram but had not seen him for a number of years. Further, Platko stated that his past association with Russo would not cause him to believe or disbelieve him, and that these facts would cause him no difficulty in weighing Russo\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">On the basis of our review of the record, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendants\u2019 motion that Platko be excused for cause because the defendants failed to meet their burden of establishing the existence of an actual bias or prejudice on the part of Platko toward the witness Russo. The defendants\u2019 claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">The defendants next assert that the trial court improperly admitted into evidence medical reports and bills from medical doctors and chiropractors without the proper foundation to establish the requisite causal connection. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">The defendants assert that there was evidence that Eisenbach and McClure had received injuries on prior occasions, and that the reports and bills \u201cdid not consider, and therefore could not eliminate as a cause, the prior injuries.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, they posit that the reports and bills were not admissible in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 52-174 (b)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cpermits a signed [physician\u2019s or chiropractor\u2019s] report [and bill] to be admitted as a business entry. The business records statute, General Statutes \u00a7 52-180, allows the admission of any writing as evidence of the act or event it describes provided the record was made in the regular course of business and that it was the regular course of business to make such a writing within a reasonable time alter the occurrence of the event in question. Section 52-174 (b) creates a presumption that the doctor\u2019s signature is genuine and that the report [and bill were] made in the ordinary course of business. . . . Thus, once the statutoiy requirement that the report [and bill] be signed by a treating physician is met, the evidence in that report [and bill] is admissible .... Information that is relevant to the treatment of the patient... is admissible.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Aspiazu </em>v. <em>Orgera, </em>205 Conn. 623, 626-28, 535 A.2d 338 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">\u201cRelevant evidence is evidence that has a logical tendency to aid the trier in the determination of an issue. . . . [E]vidence need not exclude all other possibilities [to be relevant]; it is sufficient if it tends to support the conclusion [for which it is offered], even to a slight degree. . . . [T]he fact that evidence is susceptible of different explanations or would support various inferences does not affect its admissibility, although it obviously bears upon its weight. So long as the evidence may reasonably be construed in such a manner that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>it would be relevant, it is admissible. ...\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>44 Conn. App. 307, 314, 689 A.2d 494 (1997). \u201cThe trial court has broad discretion in determining the relevancy of evidence. ... Its ruling will only be overturned if there is an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Aspiazu </em>v. <em>Orgera, </em>supra, 205 Conn. 634.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Here, the medical reports and bills were signed by the treating physicians, and thus fell under \u00a7 52-174 (b). Moreover, regarding the medical reports and bills at issue, either the treating physician specifically stated that the injuries resulted from the 1988 car accident, or it is evident that the physician believed the injuries to be the result of that car accident. \u201cThe causal relation between an injury and its later physical effects may be established by the direct opinion of a physician . . . .\u201d <em>Boland </em>v. <em>Vanderbilt, </em>140 Conn. 520, 525, 102 A.2d 362 (1953). In addition, we have previously held that a treating physician\u2019s belief that the injuries are the result of a specific accident also establishes a sufficient causal connection to render his medical reports and bills relevant. See <em>Wilson v. R.F.K. Corp., </em>19 Conn. App. 548, 551, 563 A.2d 738 (1989). Concerns regarding the reporting physicians\u2019 knowledge of prior injuries goes to the weight given the reports, not their admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">We conclude, therefore, that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the medical reports and corresponding bills were relevant and admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">The defendants next assert that the trial court improperly admitted into evidence Eisenbach\u2019s and McClure\u2019s treating chiropractors\u2019 expert opinions in violation of the Connecticut standard of \u201creasonable medical certainty.\u201d Specifically, the defendants argue that the reports and expert testimony of the treating chiro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>praetors, Donald Lawlor, Nicholas Bogannam and Michael Showah, should have been excluded because chiropractors are not medical doctors and thus cannot testily as to medical opinions or \u201cmeet the time-honored standard of reasonable medical probability.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">\u201cThe trial court has wide discretion in ruling on the qualification of expert witnesses and the admissibility of their opinions. . . . The court\u2019s decision is not to be disturbed unless [its] discretion has been abused, or the error is clear and involves a misconception of the law. . . . Generally, expert testimony is admissible if (1) the witness has a special skill or knowledge directly applicable to a matter in issue, (2) that skill or knowledge is not common to the average person, and (3) the testimony would be helpful to the court or jury in considering the issues.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>199 Conn. 473, 476, 507 A.2d 1387 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Our legislature and Supreme Court have determined that chiropractors are competent to testily as expert medical witnesses within their area of expertise. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-149a;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> see also General Statutes \u00a7 52-174 (c);<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Struckman </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>205 Conn. 542, 553-55, 534 A.2d 888 (1987); <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Drouin, </em>183 Conn. 189, 193 n.3, 438 A.2d 863 (1981). Thus, a chiropractor\u2019s expert opinion, as long as it is based on reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>probabilities rather than mere speculation or conjecture, will satisfy the requisite standard of reasonable medical probability. See <em>Struckman </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>supra, 553-56. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the reports and expert testimony of the treating chiropractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">The defendants next assert that \u201cthe trial court improperly admitted hearsay evidence concerning [Eisenbach\u2019s] medical diagnosis, prognosis and possibility of future surgery and improperly allowed Eisenbach to express medical opinions as a lay-witness.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">Certain additional facts are necessary to an understanding of our resolution of this claim. Eisenbach\u2019s chiropractor, Lawlor, testified at trial that Ahmed Cur-rim, a physician, called Lawlor and asked that he see Eisenbach, explaining to Lawlor that Eisenbach had a herniated disc. Later, Lawlor testified that in making his diagnosis, he relied on Eisenbach\u2019s statement that Daniel Nijensohn, a neurosurgeon, had told her that she needed surgery. Defense counsel objected to both of the statements repeated by Lawlor on the ground that they constituted inadmissible hearsay. The trial court overruled both of the hearsay objections. Immediately following the overruling of each objection, the trial court gave the jurors a cautionary instruction that they were to consider the statements repeated by Lawlor only as something that Lawlor relied on in making his medical diagnosis, not for the truth of the matters contained in the statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">Eisenbach testified that she had considered future back surgery, but felt it would be too great a risk and might not alleviate all of her pain. Eisenbach further testified that she was concerned about her future health. She was concerned that she might need surgery, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>that she might need continual medical treatment, and that her low back problems might hinder future pregnancies. Defense counsel objected to each part of this testimony, and argued that the lay witness was testifying to medical opinions. The trial court overruled the objections and gave the jury a curative instruction explaining that they were to consider this testimony only to illustrate Eisenbach\u2019s present state of mind, not as expert medical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">\u201cOur standard of review regarding challenges to a trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings is that these rulings will be overturned on appeal only where there was an abuse of discretion and a showing by the defendant of substantial prejudice or injustice. ... In reviewing claims that the trial court abused its discretion, great weight is given to the trial court\u2019s decision and every reasonable presumption is given in favor of its correctness. . . . We will reverse the trial court\u2019s ruling only if it could not reasonably conclude as it did.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Annecharico </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>44 Conn. App. 271, 275, 688 A.2d 1341 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">The defendants\u2019 assert that the trial court improperly admitted Lawlor\u2019s testimony that he relied on Currim\u2019s report that Eisenbach had a herniated disk. \u201c[T]he ruling by the trial court in issue is consistent with the accepted principle that an expert\u2019s testimony may be based on reports of others if the reports are those customarily relied on by such an expert in formulating an opinion.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cosgrove, </em>181 Conn. 562, 584, 436 A.2d 33 (1980). We conclude, therefore, that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting Lawlor\u2019s testimony, especially when the evidentiary ruling was immediately followed by a clear and concise cautionary instruction to the juiy. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>44 Conn. App. 338, 349-50, 689 A.2d 517 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">We next conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that Eisenbach\u2019s statement about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>Nijensohn\u2019s surgical recommendation was offered solely to show its effect on Lawlor\u2019s subsequent diagnosis and treatment, and thus was not hearsay. \u201cIt is an elementary premise of evidentiary law that a statement made out-of-court that is offered to establish the truth of the facts contained in the statement is hearsay.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Annecharico </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>supra, 44 Conn. App. 275. However, \u201c[a] statement offered solely to show its effect upon the hearer is not hearsay.\u201d(Intemal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>212 Conn. 351, 356, 562 A.2d 1071 (1989). Moreover, any potential prejudice to the defendants resulting from the introduction of the testimony was completely dissipated by the trial court\u2019s prompt delivery of a curative instruction to the jury, which clearly explained that the jury was to consider the testimony only for its effect on Lawlor, not for its truth. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>supra, 44 Conn. App. 349-50; <em>State </em>v. <em>Lasky, </em>43 Conn. App. 619, 636, 685 A.2d 336 (1996), cert. denied, 239 Conn. 959, 688 A.2d 328 (1997). \u201cIn the absence of a clear indication to the contrary, [jurors] are presumed to follow the instructions that they are given.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Guess, </em>39 Conn. App. 224, 235, 665 A.2d 126, cert. denied, 235 Conn. 924, 666 A.2d 1187 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Finally, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it determined that Eisenbach\u2019s testimony regarding her fears of future surgery, continual treatment, and potential problems with future pregnancies was admissible nonhearsay offered to prove Eisenbach\u2019s state of mind, not a lay person\u2019s medical opinion. It is well established that \u201c[a]n out-of-court statement is not hearsay . . . if it is offered to illustrate circumstantially the declarant\u2019s then present state of mind, rather than to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d <em>Annecharico </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>supra, 44 Conn. App. 275. Moreover, the court\u2019s evidentiary ruling was immediately followed by a clear and concise cautionary instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>tion to the jury and jurors are presumed to follow the instructions that they are given. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>supra, 44 Conn. App. 349-50; <em>State </em>v. <em>Guess, </em>supra, 39 Conn. App. 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The defendants further claim that the trial court improperly permitted the untimely amendment of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint to include allegations of recklessness, driving while intoxicated, violation of the headlight statute, future surgery as to Eisenbach, and fear of future surgery as to McClure. The defendants argue that this untimely amendment prejudiced them because they had prepared their case in reliance on the original complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">\u201cThe grant or denial of a motion to amend the pleadings is a matter within the discretion of the trial court. ... In the interest of justice courts are liberal in permitting amendments; unless there is ... an abuse of discretion. . . . The trial court is in the best position to assess the burden which an amendment would impose on the opposing party in light of the facts of the particular case. The essential tests are whether the ruling of the court will work an injustice to either the plaintiff or the defendant and whether the granting of the motion will unduly delay a trial.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wassell </em>v. <em>Hamblin, </em>196 Conn. 463, 466-67, 493 A.2d 870 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">At trial, the plaintiffs offered evidence of Downey\u2019s intoxication, recklessness and operation of a motor vehicle without proper headlights. The plaintiffs also offered evidence as to Eisenbach\u2019s need for future surgery and McClure\u2019s fear of future surgery. The defendants did not object to the introduction of any of this evidence on the ground that the evidence was beyond the scope of the pleadings. Near the end of the trial, the plaintiffs moved to amend their complaint to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>form the pleadings to the proof. The trial court allowed the amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing these amendments. \u201cA party is permitted to amend the pleadings to conform with the proof offered.

Moreover, any claim of prejudice was mitigated by the defendants\u2019 failure to object to the evidence when it was introduced at trial.

Furthermore, at the time the trial court permitted the plaintiffs to amend their complaint, the defendants did not argue untimeliness, they did not request a continuance, nor did they make any claim of prejudice.

We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">It is well established that a trial court should instruct a jury on an issue \u201cfor which there is any foundation in the evidence, even if weak or incredible. ... In determining whether any such foundation exists, [w]e must consider the evidence presented at trial in the light most favorable to supporting the [trial court\u2019s jury instruction.]\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>40 Conn.

Ct. 257, 136 L. Ed. 2d 183 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Eisenbach testified that the defendant drove at a high rate of speed through a stop sign in a reckless manner. Both Eisenbach\u2019s mother, who arrived at the scene of the accident shortly after the collision, and McClure testified that Downey seemed to be intoxicated as they observed him at the scene of the accident. Downey testified that his headlights were not on at the time of the accident, while the plaintiffs testified, in accordance with the police accident report, that the accident occurred at dusk on a rainy evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Lawlor and Showah opined at trial that Eisenbach and McClure would most likely experience recurring muscle spasms, pain and disability for at least the next ten years. Lawlor and Showah testified that Eisenbach\u2019s and McClure\u2019s neck and back injuries would render them susceptible to future injuries and arthritis. Further, both Eisenbach and McClure testified as to their anxiety regarding their future physical health, including fears of arthritis and of low back injuries hindering pregnancy and childbirth.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">In its charge to the juiy, the court defined lost wages as \u201ctime away from one\u2019s work due to sickness or doctor or therapy appointments and the like that may cause one to lose some earnings . . . .\u201d Lawlor and Showah testified that both Eisenbach and McClure have permanent injuries from the accident that will most likely result in future pain, discomfort and disability, as well as require future treatment and therapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">\u201cWe do not evaluate the credibility of these witnesses, but instead examine whether there was <em>any </em>evidence to support [these instructions] .... We leave the function of gauging credibility and weighing evidence to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>the jury.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>supra, 40 Conn. App. 531. We conclude that there was sufficient evidence presented at trial to support the trial court\u2019s jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The defendants further claim that the trial court improperly denied their motion for remittitur when the verdict<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> was excessive as a matter of law. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">\u201cIn ruling on the motion for remittitur, the trial court was obliged to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff in determining whether the verdict returned was reasonably supported thereby. . . . The size of the verdict alone does not determine whether it is excessive. The only practical test to apply to this verdict is whether the award falls somewhere within the necessarily uncertain limits of just damages or whether the size of the verdict so shocks the sense of justice as to compel the conclusion that the jury was influenced by partiality, prejudice, mistake or corruption. . . . Every reasonable presumption in favor of the correctness of the court\u2019s refusal to set aside the verdict as excessive should be indulged and its ruling will not be disturbed unless there is a clear abuse of discretion. ...\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Goral </em>v. <em>Kenney, </em>26 Conn. App. 231, 240-41, 600 A.2d 1031 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">The jury could have reasonably found that Eisenbach suffered permanent injuries to her back and neck. At the time of trial, she had incurred $15,012.54 in medical expenses and a loss of earnings of $19,747.29. She had a life expectancy of 51.2 years, and could expect to incur future medical expenses of approximately $1500 a year and to sustain future pain and suffering. She has trouble sleeping and can no longer play volleyball or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>softball, vacuum, mop, clean, dance, jog or carry heavy bags.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Further, the jury could have reasonably found that McClure suffered permanent injuries to her back and neck. At the time of trial she had incurred medical expenses of approximately $9058.20 and lost earnings of about $173.60. She had a life expectancy of 49.3 years, and could expect to incur future medical expenses of approximately $1500 and to sustain much future pain and discomfort. She has difficulty carrying a purse or a briefcase. Traveling has become painful and difficult. She can no longer water ski, snow ski, roller skate, jog, bicycle, dance, ride horses, engage in aerobics or play racquetball.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Our review of the record convinces us that the amount of damages awarded by the jury falls within the necessarily uncertain limits of fair and just damages. While the award may have been generous, it does not shock the conscience. See <em>Goral </em>v. <em>Kenney, </em>supra, 26 Conn. App. 241. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for remittitur.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">Finally, the defendants claim that the trial court improperly awarded offer of judgment interest under General Statutes \u00a7 52-192a.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Specifically, the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>ants argue that the plaintiffs amended their complaint to include new allegations of recklessness, operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor and violation of the headlight statute, thereby altering \u201cthe conduct underlying the complaint\u201d and rendering the original offer of judgment moot. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">This issue is governed by <em>Blakeslee Arpaia Chapman, Inc. </em>v. <em>El Constructors, Inc., </em>239 Conn. 708, 749-51, 687 A.2d 506 (1997). In <em>Blakeslee, </em>after the offer of judgment was filed, the plaintiff amended its complaint to include a new allegation that altered the conduct underlying the complaint. In the original complaint, the plaintiff sought to recover ongoing costs under a subcontract for the rental of steel. The amended complaint alleged anew breach of the subcontract and thus sought to recover the steel\u2019s liquidation value. Our Supreme Court emphasized that the amendment was \u201cnot based on the method of compensation sought for the steel, but, rather, on the breach of the subcontract.\u201d Id., 751. In determining that the plaintiffs amendment seeking liquidation costs for the new breach of subcontract did not invalidate the offer of judgment, our Supreme Court explained that, \u201c[a]n offer of judgment is an offer to settle the entire case, including claims both known and unknown, and both certain and uncertain.\u201d (Internal quotations marks omitted.) Id., 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">On the basis of <em>Blakeslee, </em>we conclude that the trial court properly awarded offer of judgment interest under General Statutes \u00a7 52-192a, and the defendants\u2019 claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b195-5\"> As used in this opinion, the name Eisenbach applies only to the plaintiff Alicia Eisenbach. Earl Eisenbach, her father, was named as an additional plaintiff in the original complaint, claiming property damage to his vehicle and rental charges for the lease of a vehicle. By agreement of the parties, no separate verdict form was used for Earl Eisenbach. The jury was instructed, by agreement, that Earl Eisenbach made no claim for property damage but sought only to recover the cost of four days of car rental at an amount set forth in an exhibit and that any award to him should be included in the amount awarded to Alicia Eisenbach and not as a separate item or in a separate verdict. The third plaintiff is Jennifer McClure, who was a passenger in the vehicle operated by Alicia Eisenbach.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b196-8\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 14-96 (a), as amended by Public Acts 1987, No. 87-230, provides: \u201cEvery vehicle upon a highway within this state at any time from a half-hour after sunset to a half-hour before sunrise and at any other time when, due to insufficient light or unfavorable atmospheric conditions, including, but not limited to, periods of snow, rain or fog, persons and vehicles on the highway are not clearly discemable at a distance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>five hundred feet ahead shall display such lighted lamps and illuminating devices as may be required under the provisions of sections 14-96a to 14-96aa inclusive.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b197-8\"> The pertinent interrogatories and answers addressed to the Eisenbach case were: \u201c1.
