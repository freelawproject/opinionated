The petitioner appealed that conviction to this court. We affirmed the judgment of the trial court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Larkin, </em>38 Conn. App. 125, 659 A.2d 1211, cert. denied, 235 Conn. 903, 665 A.2d 904 (1995). The petitioner thereafter filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, which, after a hearing, was dismissed by the habeas court. The petitioner then filed a request for certification of appeal by this court, which was also denied. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-12\">On appeal, the petitioner claims that the habeas court abused its discretion in denying his petition for certification of appeal by improperly (1) denying his request to review the victim\u2019s medical and psychological records, (2) finding that <em>State </em>v. <em>Cassidy, </em>236 Conn. 112, 672 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>A.2d 899, cert. denied, 519 U.S. 910, 117 S. Ct. 273, 136 L. Ed. 2d 196 (1996), did not apply retroactively and (3) concluding that the petitioner had effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">\u201cFaced with a habeas court\u2019s denial of a petition for certification to appeal, a petitioner can obtain appellate review of the dismissal of his petition for habeas corpus only by satisfying the two-pronged test enunciated by our Supreme Court in <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>229 Conn. 178, 640 A.2d 601 (1994), and adopted in <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>230 Conn. 608, 612, 646 A.2d 126 (1994). First, he must demonstrate that the denial of his petition for certification constituted an abuse of discretion. Id. Second, if the petitioner can show an abuse of discretion, he must then prove that the decision of the habeas court should be reversed on its merits. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">\u201cTo prove an abuse of discretion, the petitioner must demonstrate that the [resolution of the underlying claim involves issues that] are debatable among jurists of reason; that a court <em>could </em>resolve the issues [in a different manner]; or that the questions are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further. . . .Id., 616, quoting <em>Lozada </em>v. <em>Deeds, </em>498 U.S. 430, 432, 111 S. Ct. 860, 112 L. Ed. 2d 956 (1991).\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Tatem </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>39 Conn. App. 813, 815-16, 667 A.2d 1295 (1995), cert. denied, 236 Conn. 904, 670 A.2d 1305 (1996). We now apply this standard of review to each of the petitioner\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">The petitioner first claims that the habeas court abused its discretion in refusing to review the victim\u2019s medical and psychological records and to allow him to amend his petition. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-10\">The following facts pertain to this issue. During the original trial, the court reviewed the victim\u2019s medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>and psychological records in camera. The court gave certain of these records to the defendant and sealed others for appellate review. Sometime prior to filing his petition for habeas corpus, the petitioner gained access to the sealed portion of the victim\u2019s records.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The records contained a statement that the victim had seen and conversed with her dead grandfather. During the course of the hearing, the petitioner discovered that the records containing the victim\u2019s statement were not disclosed to the defense at trial. He then sought to amend his petition to add the allegation that the trial court had failed to turn over this exculpatory information to him. The habeas court denied his request. The petitioner also sought to have the habeas court reexamine all of the victim\u2019s records to make an independent determination as to what information the trial court should have disclosed. The habeas court refused to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">The petitioner claims that, if the habeas court had reviewed the records, it could have determined whether either the trial court had improperly failed to disclose exculpatory information to the defense or the state had improperly failed to turn over the information to the trial court for its review. Moreover, he argues that, had these records been available to him at trial, he could have attacked the credibility of the victim and used it to impeach the state\u2019s expert witness who testified that the victim could distinguish reality from fantasy. The petitioner, therefore, maintains that the habeas court abused its discretion in not reviewing the records or allowing him to amend his petition to add this issue. The habeas court denied his requests because it found that the petitioner could have pursued the issue concerning access to the victim\u2019s records on appeal. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>conclude that the petitioner failed to establish that the habeas court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">\u201cThe appropriate standard for reviewability of a constitutional claim not raised before sentencing or on direct appeal is the <em>Wainwright</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u2018cause and prejudice\u2019 standard. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>227 Conn. 124, 133-34, 136, 629 A.2d 413 (1993); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>218 Conn. 403, 412-13, 589 A.2d 1214 (1991); <em>Bowers </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>[33 Conn. App. 449, 451, 636 A.2d 388, cert. denied, 228 Conn. 929, 640 A.2d 115 (1994)]. \u2018The petitioner must show good cause for his failure to preserve a claim at trial and actual prejudice resulting from the alleged constitutional violation.\u2019 <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>28 Conn. App. 64, 71, 609 A.2d 1052, cert. denied, 224 Conn. 924, 614 A.2d 820 (1992).\u201d <em>Baez </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>34 Conn. App. 236, 239-40, 641 A.2d 147, cert. denied, 231 Conn. 905, 648 A.2d 148 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">Here, the petitioner failed to offer any evidence explaining why he did not previously challenge the trial court\u2019s determination that certain records were not material to the impeachment of the victim by requesting the Appellate Court to review the sealed records. The petitioner also failed to demonstrate adequately that he was prejudiced by his lack of access to the records. The habeas court properly denied the petitioner\u2019s requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b841-9\">The petitioner next claims that the habeas court improperly determined that the holding in <em>State </em>v. <em>Cassidy, </em>supra, 236 Conn. 112, did not apply retroactively. We disagree with the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">The petitioner alleges that the state violated his constitutional right to due process by remarks made during its cross-examination of the petitioner and its closing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>argument. In Cassidy, the court held that the prosecutor\u2019s argument invited the jury to draw an inference adverse to the defendant solely because he asserted his constitutional right to be present at trial. The prosecutor had argued to the jury that the defendant, because he was present throughout the trial, was able to tailor his testimony to that of the state\u2019s witnesses. Id., 120. In this case, because the prosecutor cross-examined the petitioner regarding his presence in court and made similar comments in closing argument, the petitioner claimed in his habeas petition that he was entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">In reviewing this claim, the habeas court noted that direct review had been completed and that the petitioner was attempting collaterally to attack his conviction on the basis of the holding in <em>Cassidy. </em>Relying on <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>218 Conn. 791, 796, 591 A.2d 407 (1991), the habeas court held that the holding in <em>Cassidy </em>did not apply because new constitutional rules of criminal procedure cannot be announced or applied to cases that are on collateral review.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">The petitioner urges this court to apply the criteria set forth in <em>Stovall </em>v. <em>Deno, </em>388 U.S. 293, 297, 87 S. Ct. 1967, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1199 (1967), to determine the retroactivity of a rule.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We decline to do so and agree with the habeas court that the rule announced in <em>Cassidy </em>should not be applied retroactively <em>to </em>cases on collateral review.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">In <em>Teague </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 109 S. Ct. 1060, 103 L. Ed. 2d 334 (1989), the United States Supreme Court abandoned the criteria applied in <em>Stovall </em>for cases on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>collateral review. It held that, for such cases, new rules generally should not be applied retroactively. Id., 310; see also <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 218 Conn. 797, citing the holding of <em>Teague. </em>It also identified two exceptions to this general rule of nonretroactivity: (1) if the rule places certain kinds of primary, private individual conduct beyond the power of the criminal law-making authority to proscribe or (2) if the new rule requires the observance of those procedures that are implicit in the concept of ordered liberty. <em>Teague </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>supra, 307. In the present case, the petitioner has failed to demonstrate that the rule announced in <em>Cassidy </em>falls within one of these exceptions. The habeas court, therefore, properly declined to apply <em>Cassidy </em>retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">The petitioner next claims that the habeas court abused its discretion in concluding that the petitioner had effective assistance of counsel. Prior to trial, the trial court granted the petitioner\u2019s motion pro hac vice, allowing Attorney Frederick Busconi, a member of the Massachusetts bar, to represent him. In compliance with Practice Book \u00a7 24, Busconi was \u201csponsored\u201d by local counsel.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The petitioner argued at the habeas hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>ing that the local counsel\u2019s lack of experience and failure to participate in the proceedings contributed to depriving him of effective assistance of counsel. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">\u201cThe sixth amendment of the federal constitution requires that \u2018the accused shall enjoy the right ... to have the assistance of counsel for his [defense]\u2019 in all criminal prosecutions.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Barber, </em>173 Conn. 153, 155, 376 A.2d 1108 (1977). \u201cThe right to counsel means the right to the conscientious services of competent counsel.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">\u201cIn an appeal from the denial of a habeas writ, the burden imposed upon the petitioner is higher than that imposed on him in a direct appeal. In order to succeed in a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the petitioner must prove: (1) that his counsel\u2019s performance fell below the required standard of reasonable competence or competence displayed by lawyers with ordinary training and skill in the criminal law; and (2) that this lack of competence contributed so significantly to his conviction as to have deprived him of a fair trial. <em>Valeriano </em>v. <em>Bronson, </em>209 Conn. 75, 85-86, 546 A.2d 1380 (1988); see also <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984). A reviewing court can find against the petitioner on whichever ground is easier. <em>Valeriano </em>v. <em>Bronson, </em>supra [85-86]; <em>Nardini </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>207 Conn. 118, 124, 540 A.2d 69 (1988).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Magnotti </em>v. <em>Meachum, </em>22 Conn. App. 669, 674, 579 A.2d 553 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>The petitioner maintains that local counsel\u2019s lack of basic knowledge of Connecticut criminal law and Connecticut trial practice and her failure to participate in the defense of the client resulted in the denial of effective assistance of counsel. We are not persuaded that the rules of practice set forth such requirements for local counsel;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> however, the petitioner must also demonstrate that local counsel\u2019s alleged lack of competence deprived him of a fair trial. We conclude that the petitioner has failed to meet this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">The petitioner has not presented this court with any evidence that he was prejudiced by local counsel\u2019s alleged incompetence. Specifically, there is no support in the record that Busconi, the petitioner\u2019s chosen trial and appellate counsel, did not have adequate knowledge of Connecticut criminal law and, therefore, had to rely on local counsel. The habeas court found that Busconi\u2019s representation was more than adequate. In the absence of such evidence, we cannot conclude that local counsel\u2019s performance deprived the petitioner of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">We now turn to the gravamen of the petitioner\u2019s complaint that Busconi rendered ineffective assistance in the conduct of his representation, thereby depriving him of a fair trial. The facts in this case as recited in <em>State </em>v. <em>Larkin, </em>supra, 38 Conn. App. 127, are as follows. \u201cOn April 5,1991, the defendant, a twenty year old male, met the victim, a twelve year old girl, at a highway picnic area across the street from the victim\u2019s house. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>He gave the victim a beer and drove her to a wooded area where they engaged in sexual intercourse and other sexual acts. The victim told several people about her sexual encounter with the defendant, all of whom testified at trial. The victim\u2019s parents, upon learning about the incident from reading the victim\u2019s diary, reported the incident to the state police.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">\u201cIn reviewing the claim [of ineffective assistance of counsel], this court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance; that is, the defendant must overcome the presumption that, under these circumstances, the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy. <em>Levine </em>v. Manson, [195 Conn. 636, 640, 490 A.2d 82 (1985)]; see also <em>Chace </em>v. <em>Bronson, </em>19 Conn. App. 674, 678, 564 A.2d 303, cert. denied, 213 Conn. 801, 567 A.2d 832 (1989). In assessing the petitioner\u2019s claim, this court must make every effort to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel's challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time. <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra [466 U.S.] 689. <em>Levine </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra [640]; see also <em>Valeriano </em>v. <em>Bronson, </em>supra, [209 Conn.] 87.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Magnotti </em>v. <em>Meachum, </em>supra, 22 Conn. App. 674-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">In this case, the petitioner claimed at his habeas hearing that his trial attorney lacked knowledge of the rules of evidence. As an example, he cited the fact that Busconi did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s improperly commenting on the defense\u2019s failure to call the petitioner\u2019s brother and others as defense witnesses. The petitioner avers that if his attorney had been familiar with the rule in <em>Secondino </em>v. <em>New Haven Gas Co., </em>147 Conn. 672, 165 A.2d 598 (1960),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> those comments would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>been stricken from the record and a cautionary instruction would have been given. The habeas court noted that neither the petitioner nor Busconi testified at the habeas hearing and, as a result, the habeas court had no evidence before it that the attorney did not know the rule or that his failure to assert it was something other than trial strategy. We agree with the habeas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">The petitioner also argued that Busconi rendered inadequate representation in that he failed to take any action regarding the prosecutor\u2019s statements that the petitioner\u2019s presence in the courtroom during the trial allowed him to tailor his testimony, in violation of the holding in <em>State </em>v. <em>Cassidy, </em>supra, 236 Conn. 112. At the time of the petitioner\u2019s original trial, however, <em>Cassidy </em>had not been decided. His attorney, therefore, can hardly be held accountable for ignoring a ruling not yet made.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">The petitioner additionally claimed that his attorney made errors of omission and commission regarding other evidentiary matters. After a careful review of the record and transcripts, we agree with the habeas court that the performance of the petitioner\u2019s trial counsel did not fall below the standard of reasonable competence.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">The petitioner has failed to demonstrate that the habeas court abused its discretion in resolving the issues raised in his petition. We, therefore, conclude that the habeas court did not abuse its discretion in denying the petitioner\u2019s certification to appeal the dismissal of his petition for habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-10\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b840-7\"> It is not clear from the record how the petitioner gained access to the sealed psychiatric records for his habeas hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b841-11\"> <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 97 S.

The petitioner, however, misreads the requirement set forth in this case. The Wyoming Supreme Court ruled that local counsel should \u201cbe something more than a matter of form or protocol; it is not intended that he be only a figurehead.
