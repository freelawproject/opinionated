J.</author>\n<p id=\"A74\">This matter concerns two joint petitions for review of a tiial court closure order, one filed by the Hartford Courant and the Stamford Advocate and the other by LWWI Broadcasting, Inc., doing business as television station WTNH News Channel 8 (WTNH) and Rainbow Connecticut Holdings, Inc., doing business as News 12 Connecticut. The petitions were filed pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-164X<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Practice Book \u00a7 4166.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The closure order of the trial court,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> rendered on its own motion,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> stems from the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>amended motion to dismiss the pending charges against him of kidnapping in the first degree and sexual assault in the first degree. A previous trial involving the same charges ended in a mistrial. The closure concerns a newspaper article published after the mistrial was declared. After a hearing held in this court to review the closure order, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4166 (a), we vacate the order of the trial court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The defendant\u2019s amended motion to dismiss alleged that \u201ceither the state, law enforcement authorities or persons associated with the complainants leaked information to the media about new allegations against Mr. Kelly\u201d and that \u201cthe state, and/or its agents, including the complainant\u2019s attorney, have made prejudicial public statements which were disseminated in the local and national media,\u201d which actions frustrate the defendant\u2019s ability to obtain a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">The court, in barring the news media and the public from hearings regarding the information alleged by the defendant to have been supplied to the media, made certain findings.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>The issues to be decided in that portion of the hearing ordered closed concern the sources for information in a certain article by the Hartford Courant and whether there was any prosecutorial misconduct involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">A right of public access to pretrial criminal proceedings has been recognized by the United States Supreme Court and this court. See <em>Press-Enterprise </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>478 U.S. 1, 106 S. Ct. 2735, 92 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Franzese, </em>23 Conn. App. 433, 580 A.2d 538 (1990). The test set out in <em>Press-Enterprise </em>for ordering a court closure requires that the trial court (1) articulate specific findings after a hearing, (2) find that the closure is essential to preserve \u201chigher values,\u201d (3) narrowly tailor the order to serve the interest sought to be protected, (4) find a \u201csubstantial probability\u201d that the interest sought to be protected will be prejudiced by the open courtroom and that closure would prevent the prejudicial effect, (5) consider reasonable alternatives to closure and conclude that they would not adequately protect the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Press-Enterprise </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>supra, 13-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">At the hearing<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> concerning the trial court\u2019s sua sponte order of closure, the court considered the criteria estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>lished in <em>Press-Enterprise. </em>The court stated that the reason for the closure order was to preserve the defendant\u2019s interest in selecting, impaneling and being tried by a jury in Stamford that is as free from the influence of adverse publicity as possible. The court, however, did not explain how closing a portion of the hearing concerning the defendant\u2019s amended motion to dismiss would protect that \u201chigher value,\u201d the second prong of <em>Press-Enterprise. </em>The portion of the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss that the court ordered closed concerns the source for the Hartford Courant article. A determination of the source does not involve evidence concerning the truth or the contents of the allegations in the article regarding uncharged misconduct. The hearing would primarily concern whether there was prosecutorial misconduct involved in leaking information to the press and whether that involvement would warrant dismissal of the charges against the defendant. It is unclear how this portion of the hearing would be prejudicial to the defendant\u2019s interest in having an unbiased jury pool for his impending trial on the previous charges. The third prong of <em>Press-Enterprise </em>is met because only aportion of the hearing was ordered closed in order to conform to the court\u2019s view of the prejudice to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">The court found, as to the fourth prong of <em>Press-Enterprise, </em>that there is a substantial probability that the defendant\u2019s rights to a fair trial would be prejudiced and that closure would prevent the information contained in the newspaper article from being further disseminated to the current jury pool. The court, in discussing the fifth prong of <em>Press-Enterprise, </em>noted that it was not aware of any alternatives to closure that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>would accomplish this goal although it had considered alternatives. The court indicated that it had considered sequestration of the jury but had denied the request for sequestration, and there was no method for sequestering a jury pool during pretrial proceedings. The court indicated that extensive voir dire would be permitted, but that if the publicity had infected the jury pool, the court would reconsider the defendant\u2019s motion for a change of venue. The court concluded, however, that voir dire was not a satisfactoiy alternative to closure in light of the recent publicity. Admonition of the jury was also considered but the court indicated that such instructions would not be adequate to correct the current publicity problem. The court considered a \u201cgag order\u201d but held that such an order would substantially impact on first amendment rights and would not be appropriate. The court noted that voluntary restraint by the media was another option that it had considered. The court also considered a continuance but stated that it would not continue the case because the charges had been pending for some time.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Although the court considered the criteria of the <em>Press-Enterprise </em>case, most of its statements regarding the likelihood of prejudice to the defendant\u2019s right to an impartial jury and the possible alternatives to closure are conclusory. The federal constitution\u2019s first amendment right of public access to courts cannot be overcome by a conclusory assertion that publicity might deprive the defendant of a fair trial. See <em>Press-Enterprise </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>supra, 478 U.S. 13-14. Moreover, the portion of the hearing on the amended motion to dismiss to which the closure order applies, i.e., the source of the November 15,1996 Hartford Courant article and whether prosecutorial misconduct was involved, does not have a direct impact on the issue of whether the defendant can obtain a fair trial, with an impartial jury, on the pending charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>The necessity for closure, given the tenuous connection between what might be elicited at a hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss and the ability to obtain an impartial jury in Stamford, is especially questionable in light of the extensive prior publicity concerning the defendant and the charges against him, including the extensive publicity about the Hartford Courant article itself. The trial court summed up the prior dissemination of the Hartford Courant article by stating that the \u201ccat is out of the bag.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">Furthermore, questions of alleged prosecutorial misconduct, which impinge on the integrity of the judicial system, would also militate against closure because the public\u2019s confidence in the criminal justice system could be undermined by closure of the court to consider such issues. Closure of a courtroom should be sparingly granted because public hearings and public trials vindicate an important societal interest in the judicial system and openness of the courts enhances the basic fairness of that system, which is essential to public confidence in it. <em>Ostolaza </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>26 Conn.

The decision to vacate the order was announced by the appellate clerk on April 4, 1997. The petitioners were represented by counsel and participated in the hearing.
