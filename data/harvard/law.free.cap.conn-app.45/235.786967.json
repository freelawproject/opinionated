See <em>Borkowski </em>v. <em>Borkowski, </em>228 Conn. 729, 740, 638 A.2d 1060 (1994); <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>35 Conn. App. 246, 251, 644 A.2d 1317 (1994). Our examination of the record shows that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to modify the judgment. The parties agreed to be bound by the arbitrator\u2019s decision with respect to the division of their personal property. The plaintiffs dissatisfaction with that division does not warrant judicial intervention in light of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">The appeal with respect to the last issue is dismissed because the attorney is not a party to this action and, \u201cwhere a nonparty is aggrieved by a ruling made in the context of an ongoing action, that person\u2019s remedy is by writ of error rather than by appeal.\u201d <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>QVC Network, Inc., </em>43 Conn. App. 851, 854, 686 A.2d 997 (1996).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">The appeal from the imposition of a fine against the plaintiffs attorney is dismissed; in all other respects, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b264-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-272 provides that writs of error may be \u201cbrought to the Supreme Court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
