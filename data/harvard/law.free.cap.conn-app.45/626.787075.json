We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">The following facts are necessary for the resolution of this appeal. Ficara, a town of Manchester police officer, commenced this negligence action against William O\u2019Connor.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The town intervened as a plaintiff in the action to recover workers\u2019 compensation benefits paid to Ficara. On February 19, 1993, the trial court referred the case to an attorney trial referee to try the claims of the town against William O\u2019Connor.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This case was tried on February 19 and April 2,1993. Both parties filed posttrial briefs on April 16,1993. Subsequently, on April 11, 1994, the attorney referee issued his report, which was filed on April 26, 1994. In his report, the attorney referee found in favor of the town and recommended an award of $14,740.93.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">The defendant filed a motion to vacate the decision, dated April 29, 1994, on the ground that the attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>referee failed to file a report within the time provided for in Practice Book \u00a7 430A. On March 21, 1995, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to vacate. On January 29, 1996, the trial court rendered judgment. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">We first address the defendant\u2019s claim regarding the timeliness of the attorney referee\u2019s report because it is dispositive of this appeal. The defendant argues that the attorney referee\u2019s failure to file his report within the 120 day period provided for in Practice Book \u00a7 430A deprived the trial court of jurisdiction. The town contends that the defendant waived the 120 day limit by forwarding correspondence for consideration by the attorney referee, after the posttrial briefs were filed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">Practice Book \u00a7 430Aprovides in part that \u201c[a]n attorney trial referee to whom a case has been referred <em>shall </em>file a report with the clerk of the court . . . within one hundred and twenty days of the completion of the trial before such referee.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In denying the defendant\u2019s motion to vacate, the trial court found that, while there was no waiver provision in \u00a7 430A, waiver was appropriate in this case because it was the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>ant who forwarded the unsolicited material to the attorney referee and then moved to have the report vacated because it was unfavorable. The trial court concluded that the 120 day period commenced on March 3, 1994, the last date on which the defendant submitted material, and, thus, the attorney referee\u2019s report was timely filed on April 26, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">In <em>Gumpert </em>v. <em>Ore-Ida Foods, Inc., </em>39 Conn. App. 635, 641, 666 A.2d 437 (1995), we held that an attorney referee\u2019s failure to comply with the 120 day limit as set forth in Practice Book \u00a7 430A, coupled with the objection of the defendants, required a new trial. See also <em>Sanchez </em>v. <em>Prestia, </em>29 Conn. App. 157, 161-62, 612 A.2d 824, cert. denied, 224 Conn. 913, 617 A.2d 167 (1992). In <em>Gumpert </em>v. <em>Ore-Ida Foods, Inc., </em>supra, 637 n.3, we did not address the issue of whether the parties may waive or agree to extend the 120 day period under \u00a7 430A, but noted that \u201c[u]nlike General Statutes \u00a7 51-183b [which provides a waiver provision], Practice Book \u00a7 430A contains no explicit waiver provision . . . .\u201d The issue of whether the parties may waive the 120 day period is now squarely before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">\u201c \u2018The rules of statutory construction apply with equal force to Practice Book rules.\u2019 \u201d <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>37 Conn. App. 7, 11, 654 A.2d 798, cert. denied, 233 Conn. 905, 657 A.2d 645 (1995), quoting <em>Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Trantolo, </em>192 Conn. 15, 22, 470 A.2d 228 (1984). \u201cA cardinal rule of statutory construction is that where the words of a statute [or rule] are plain and unambiguous the intent of the [drafters] in enacting the statute [or rule] is to be derived from the words used. . . . Where the court is provided with a clearly written rule, it need look no further for interpretive guidance.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bristol </em>v. <em>Vogelsonger, </em>21 Conn. App. 600, 604, 575 A.2d 252 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>The plain language of \u00a7 430A is unambiguous. Clearly, it was the intent of the drafters not to provide a waiver provision for the parties to extend the time an attorney referee has to file a report. As a result, the parties cannot waive the 120 day period provided in \u00a7 430A. Moreover, while the legislature provided a waiver provision in General Statutes \u00a7 51-183b, the judges of the Superior Court, in promulgating the rules of practice for attorney referees, were certainly cognizant of \u00a7 51-183b, yet decided not to include a waiver provision in \u00a7 430A. See also Practice Book \u00a7 546G (providing no waiver provision for fact finders) and \u00a7 546Q (providing no waiver provision for arbitrators). Thus, we conclude that the trial court lacked the power to accept an attorney referee\u2019s report that did not comply with \u00a7 430A.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b655-8\"> The town of Manchester intervened as a plaintiff and filed an amended complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b655-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 38a-836 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b655-10\"> Subsequently, Kevin O\u2019Connor, William O\u2019Connor\u2019s son, was joined as a defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b655-11\"> The defendant\u2019s insurer, American Mutual Insurance Company, became insolvent in March, 1989. As a result, Ficara applied for and received uninsured motorist benefits from his insurance company, Nationwide Insurance. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>Ficara subsequently settled his claim with Nationwide Insurance and withdrew his claims against William O\u2019Connor and Kevin O\u2019Connor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b656-10\"> The town argues in its brief that this appeal should be dismissed on the ground that the defendant waived his right to appeal and, notwithstanding, this appeal is untimely. The town argues that the defendant waived his right to appeal by improperly filing an appeal from the attorney referee\u2019s report. This court dismissed that appeal due to the defendant\u2019s failure to file a brief. The town further argues that the trial court rendered judgment when it denied the defendant\u2019s motion to vacate on March 21, 1995, and, thus, this appeal is untimely. See Practice Book \u00a7 4009. On the basis of our review of the record, the trial court rendered judgment on January 29, 1996, and, subsequently, the defendant filed this timely appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b656-11\"> The defendant, on August 13, 1993, forwarded to the attorney referee a magistrate\u2019s recommendation in a District Court case, and on November 11, 1993, the defendant informed the attorney referee of an error in his August 13,1993 cover letter. Also, on March 3,1994, the defendant forwarded a federal District Court case to the attorney referee for his consideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
