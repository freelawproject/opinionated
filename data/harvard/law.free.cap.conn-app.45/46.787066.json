On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly concluded that the facts found did not constitute (1) an invasion of privacy and (2) a violation of the Connecti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>cut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">After trial before an attorney trial referee (attorney referee), the attorney referee submitted a twenty-six page report of her findings and recommendations. The trial court rendered judgment in accordance with the report, which found that the plaintiff prevailed on her claim that the defendants, Anton Filipovic and Rosanda Filipovic, had failed to return her security deposit (count one), awarding $1600 plus interest, and on her claim for emotional distress<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (count four), awarding damages in the amount of $1500. Further, the trial court rendered judgment for the defendants on all remaining counts<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the plaintiffs nine count amended complaint, and rendered judgment for the plaintiff on the defendants\u2019 counterclaim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">The attorney referee found the following relevant facts. The plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>the defendants for a one bedroom unit on the first floor of 297 Bruce Park Avenue, Greenwich, for $800 a month. The plaintiff entered into possession of the apartment in March, 1988. After numerous incidents between the plaintiff and the defendants over the next several months,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the relationship soured. The defendants demanded that the plaintiff vacate the premises no later than November 30, 1988. The plaintiff voluntarily vacated the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">The facts relevant to the claim of invasion of privacy concern notes referring to the plaintiffs psychiatric care. There was conflicting testimony as to how the defendants came into possession of the notes, but the attorney referee determined that the plaintiff failed to prove her claim that the defendants wrongfully entered her apartment and removed the notes. Nevertheless, the attorney referee found that, once the defendants came into possession of the notes, they read them and retained them despite the fact that it must have been clear that they contained information of a personal and private nature. The defendants showed the notes to their attorney. The defendants\u2019 attorney made known the basic contents of the notes to the plaintiffs attorney. The notes were then filed with the trial court in connection with discovery proceedings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The attorney referee found that the defendants\u2019 conduct in circulating the notes was wrongful and found them liable under the plaintiffs claim of emotional distress. The attorney referee then determined whether the act of publishing the notes constituted an invasion of privacy. She found that the defendants did not circulate or make the notes known to the general public. The attorney referee concluded that the defendants gave the notes to their attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>ney as part of discovery and that, therefore, no invasion of privacy occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">The facts relevant to the CUTPA claim concern the defendants\u2019 actions as the plaintiffs landlord. The plaintiff claims that the defendants failed to place her security deposit into an interest bearing account, that they turned off the electricity in the apartment and that the circulation of the notes constituted a violation of CUTPA.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The attorney referee determined that, while the defendants\u2019 conduct was \u201cinjudicious, ill-advised and tortious,\u201d it did not constitute a violation of CUTPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">As a prehminary matter, we must examine the procedures that govern matters heard by an attorney referee. See Practice Book \u00a7 428 et seq. An attorney referee \u201cis obliged to report to the court \u2018the facts found and the conclusions drawn therefrom,\u2019 but the report may be supplemented with a \u2018memorandum of decision including such matters as [the attorney referee] may deem helpful in the decision of the case . . . .\u2019 Practice Book \u00a7 434.\u201d <em>Seal Audio, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bozak, Inc., </em>199 Conn. 496, 503, 508 A.2d 415 (1986). The parties may seek additions or corrections in the facts contained in this report by filing a motion to correct with the attorney referee pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 438.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> After the attorney referee responds to any motions to correct, the parties may file with the trial court exceptions to findings of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>fact pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 439<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> or objections to factual conclusions or rulings pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7440.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Seal Audio, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bozak, Inc., </em>supra, 503, 518.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">In <em>Seal Audio, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bozak, Inc., </em>supra, 199 Conn. 518, the seminal case examining the procedures for matters heard by an attorney referee, our Supreme Court held that \u201c[w]ith respect to the various claims of error relating to the merits of the factual findings made by the attorney referee, as well as the judgment rendered by the trial court based thereon, the defendant is precluded from effective appellate review by its failure to file a motion to correct the report of the referee pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 438 or an objection to acceptance thereof pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 440.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>The court declined to review the factual findings because \u201c[a] litigant cannot wholly ignore established procedures for the protection of its rights . . . and hope to receive on appeal the same treatment accorded to those who follow the rules of practice.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Seal Audio, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bozak, Inc., </em>supra, 518.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Here, the plaintiff took no action pursuant to the postreport procedures pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 438,439 or 440.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The trial court accepted the findings of fact and factual conclusions and rendered judgment in accordance with the report of the attorney referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">The plaintiff claims that she is not contesting the findings of fact or factual conclusions of the attorney referee. She asserts, rather, that the trial court, by adopting the report of the attorney referee, improperly applied the law to the facts as found by the attorney referee. \u201cThe reviewing court is the effective arbiter of the law and the legal opinions of [an attorney referee], like those of the parties, though they may be helpful, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>carry no weight not justified by their soundness as viewed by the court that renders judgment.\u201d <em>Seal Audio, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bozak, Inc., </em>supra, 199 Conn. 510. While we do not condone the plaintiffs failure to raise such challenges to the attorney referee in a motion to correct, exceptions or objections to the trial court, we must evaluate the trial court\u2019s adoption of the attorney referee report as it applies the law to the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">The plaintiff claims that the defendants invaded her personal privacy by publishing the notes to their attorney and causing him to publish the notes to the court, and by summarizing the contents of the papers to her attorneys, thereby, damaging her relationship with them. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">Our Supreme Court has described the four types of invasion of privacy: \u201c(1) appropriation, for the defendant\u2019s benefit or advantage, of the plaintiffs name or likeness; (2) intrusion upon the plaintiffs physical solitude or seclusion; (3) publicity, of a highly objectionable kind, given to private information about the plaintiff even though it is true and no action would lie for defamation; and (4) publicity which places the plaintiff in a false light in the public eye.\u201d <em>Venturi </em>v. <em>Savitt, Inc., </em>191 Conn. 588, 591 n.l, 468 A.2d 933 (1983). \u201cSection 652D of the Restatement (Second) of Torts defines a tort action for the invasion of personal privacy as being triggered by public disclosure of any matter that \u2018(a) would be highly offensive to a reasonable person, and (b) is not of legitimate concern to the public.\u2019 \u201d <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>228 Conn. 158, 172, 635 A.2d 783 (1993). \u201cComment (c) of \u00a7 652D recognizes, however, that not all personal and private information is protected from public disclosure: \u2018The rule stated in [\u00a7 652D] gives protection only against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>unreasonable publicity, of a kind highly offensive to the ordinary reasonable [person].\u2019 \u201d Id., 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The attorney referee determined that, although the facts constituted an intentional infliction of emotional distress, they did not constitute an invasion of privacy. Whether filing the notes with the court is \u201chighly offensive\u201d is a factual determination. The attorney referee found that the defendants did not circulate or make the notes known to the general public. They gave them to their attorney who filed them with the court in connection with discovery. On the basis of her unchallenged factual findings, the attorney referee concluded that the defendants did not invade the plaintiffs privacy. The trial court accepted the attorney referee\u2019s conclusion. We do not find this determination to be an improper application of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">The plaintiff argues that the defendants unreasonably intruded on her solitude. Neither the attorney referee nor the trial court addressed that argument explicitly. In her report, the attorney referee did not address that theory of invasion of privacy. The attorney referee did not find that the defendants physically intruded on the plaintiffs space or even improperly investigated the plaintiffs private matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">The plaintiffs failure to comply with the rules of practice governing procedures by which a party may challenge the findings of fact and factual conclusions of the attorney referee proves fatal to this claim. Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 438 and 439 specifically provide a procedure by which a party can challenge the omission of facts in an attorney referee\u2019s report. Because the plaintiff did not raise an alternative theory for finding an invasion of privacy in a postreport motion, we are unable to review this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">The plaintiff claims that the facts found constitute a violation of CUTPA. She contends that the defendants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>conduct violated CUTPA because it was unfair and caused her substantial injury. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">Connecticut applies the so-called cigarette rule, which sets out the standard for a CUTPA violation: \u201c(1) [wjhether the practice, without necessarily having been previously considered unlawful, offends public policy as it has been established by statutes, the common law, or otherwise\u2014whether, in other words, it is within at least the penumbra of some common law, statutory, or other established concept of unfairness; (2) whether it is immoral, unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous; (3) whether it causes substantial injury to consumers [or competitors or other businessmen].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Williams Ford, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hartford Courant Co., </em>232 Conn. 559, 591-92, 657 A.2d 212 (1995). \u201c \u2018All three criteria do not need to be satisfied to support a finding of unfairness. A practice may be unfair because of the degree to which it meets one of the criteria or because to a lesser extent it meets all three.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cheshire Mortgage Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Montes, </em>223 Conn. 80, 106, 612 A.2d 1130 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The attorney referee found that, while the defendants failed to place the plaintiffs security deposit in an interest bearing account, they have acknowledged that they owe her interest on the deposit. The attorney referee determined that this conduct arose out of the defendants\u2019 ignorance of their obligations. The attorney referee further determined that, although the defendants were not justified in turning off the electricity, the situation was quickly remedied. In addition, the attorney referee awarded the plaintiff damages for emotional distress because the defendants submitted the notes to their attorney, who filed the notes with the trial court in connection with discovery. Nevertheless, the attorney referee did not find the defendants\u2019 behavior to rise to the level of a CUTPA violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">\u201cWhether a practice is unfair and thus violates CUTPA is an issue of fact.\u201d <em>DeMotses </em>v. <em>Leonard </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number><em>Schwartz Nissan, Inc., </em>22 Conn. App. 464, 466, 578 A.2d 144 (1990). Although the attorney referee found that the defendants were liable for failure to return the deposit plus interest and for emotional distress caused by the circulation of the notes, it did not find in favor of the plaintiff on any of her other claims. The attorney referee implicitly concluded, on the basis of her unchallenged factual findings, that the defendants\u2019 conduct did not rise to the level of \u201cunscrupulous, oppressive, immoral or causing substantial injury\u201d and, therefore, did not constitute a violation of CIJTPA. The trial court accepted the attorney referee\u2019s conclusion. We do not find this determination to be improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b76-8\"> The plaintiff alleges a claim of invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of emotional distress in count four. The attorney referee awarded damages for emotional distress, but did not award compensatory or punitive damages for the claim of invasion of privacy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b76-9\"> The plaintiff alleged (1) unauthorized entry in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 47a-16 (d) and damages in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 47a-18a (count two), (2) theft under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-564 and 53a-119 for items allegedly taken during the unauthorized entry and treble damages under \u00a7 52-564 (count three), (3) peaceable entry and detainer under General Statutes \u00a7 47a-43 (a) (3) and writ of restitution under General Statutes \u00a7 47a-45 (count five), (4) deliberate utility shutoff in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 47a-13 and damages and attorney\u2019s fees under the statute (count six), (5) refusal to allow the plaintiff to use the laundry facilities in contravention of an alleged oral agreement in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 47a-9 and retaliatory eviction in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 47a-20 (count seven), (6) retroactive rent abatement for failing to install smoke detectors in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 29-292 (a) (1), 47a-7 (a) (1) and 47a-4a (count eight), and (7) violation of CUTPA, General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq. (count nine).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b76-10\"> The defendants claimed that the plaintiff damaged the apartment by causing smoke damage to the walls and ceilings and by burning and staining the carpeting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b77-7\"> These incidents will be discussed where relevant to the claims on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b77-8\"> The contents of the notes were the subject of many of the interrogatories filed by the defendants and the notes themselves were attached as exhibits to the defendants\u2019 request to admit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b78-9\"> The plaintiffs other claims of improper conduct on the part of the defendants are not included in review of this CUTPA claim because the attorney referee found in favor of the defendants on the remaining claims and the plaintiff does not challenge these findings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b78-13\"> Practice Book \u00a7 438 provides in relevant part: \u201cIf either party desires to have the report or the finding corrected by striking out any of the facts found, or by adding further facts, or by stating the claims of the parties made before the committee, or by setting forth rulings upon evidence or other rulings of the committee, he shall within two weeks after the filing of the report or finding file with the court a motion to correct setting forth the changes and additions desired by him. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b79-7\"> Practice Book \u00a7 439 provides in relevant part: \u201cIf a committee fails to correct a report or finding in compliance with a motion to correct, the moving party may, within ten days after the decision on the motion to correct, file exceptions seeking corrections by the court in the report or finding. The court will not consider an exception unless its subject matter has been submitted to the committee in a motion to correct, provided that this requirement shall not apply to exceptions taken to corrections in the report or finding made after it was filed; nor will the court correct a finding of fact unless a material fact has been found without evidence or the committee has failed to find an admitted or undisputed fact, or has found a fact in such doubtful language that its real meaning does not appear. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b79-8\"> Practice Book \u00a7 440provides in relevant part: \u201cA party may file objections to the acceptance of a report on the ground that conclusions of facts stated in it were not properly reached on the basis of the subordinate facts found, or that the committee erred in rulings on evidence or other rulings or that there are other reasons why the report should not be accepted. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b79-9\"> Our Supreme Court in <em>Seal Audio, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bozak, Inc., </em>supra, 199 Conn. 518, refers to <em>exceptions </em>pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 440 instead of <em>objections. </em>It appears the defendant in <em>Seal Audio, Inc., </em>failed to file a motion to correct pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 438, exceptions pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 439 or objections pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 440.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">Recently, the court stated that \u201c[i]n the absence of a motion to correct the report or an objection to its acceptance because the facts had been improperly found, we examine these facts solely to determine whether the referee\u2019s findings were <em>clearly erroneous.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Jacobs </em>v. <em>Healey Ford-Subaru, Inc., </em>231 Conn. 707, 727-28, 652 A.2d 446 (1995).

W. Moller &amp; W. Horton, supra, \u00a7 440, authors\u2019 comments. They presumably base that suggestion on the argument that the failure to file a motion to correct should create an even more ratified standard of review than the customary standard used in reviewing factual findings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b80-9\"> It appears that if the appellant had complied with the rules of practice, traditional appellate review would apply.
