We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. In late fall, 1994, the fifteen year old victim resided with her foster mother, Publia Gonzalez, and two other foster children in a two-story condominium in Hartford. The defendant, who was Gonzalez\u2019 boyfriend at the time, would sometimes come to the condominium. In September or October of 1994, when the victim was in the kitchen of the condominium, the defendant intentionally and inappropriately touched her buttocks. After the defendant touched her, the victim turned around to ask the defendant what he was doing, and he told her to be quiet.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">On a subsequent occasion, the defendant came to the condominium in an intoxicated state. He proceeded to rub his penis through his pants, while occasionally looking at the victim. This lasted for approximately twenty minutes. Gonzalez\u2019 niece, Glenda Robles, was present on that occasion. When Robles indicated that she had to leave, the victim indicated that she was afraid, and Robles took the victim home with her.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">A few weeks later, the victim was upstairs reading in her bedroom. The defendant came into the room, knelt down on his knees, pulled the victim\u2019s pants down,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and tried to put his penis into her vagina. The defendant\u2019s erect penis was exposed. The victim tried to keep her knees closed while that was occurring. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>Although the victim could feel the defendant\u2019s penis touch her, the defendant was unable to penetrate her. During that incident, the victim, who was scared and crying, yelled at the defendant to get off of her. The defendant told the victim to \u201cshut up\u201d and that if she told anyone what had happened, she would not be believed. He stated, \u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re going to waste your time,\u201d and then left the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">In early November, 1994, the victim was sitting on the floor in the living room of the condominium watching television when the defendant sat down on the couch behind her. The defendant grabbed the victim\u2019s right hand and pulled it behind her to where he was sitting. The victim then felt the defendant\u2019s penis in her hand. The defendant made the victim move her hand up and down as she held his penis, and the defendant briefly touched the victim\u2019s breasts over her clothing. The defendant then pulled the victim\u2019s hair, causing her pain. The victim did not struggle to get away from the defendant because she was afraid that if she did the defendant would pull her hair harder. The defendant told the victim, \u201cIf you tell anyone, nobody is going to believe you.\u201d He also told the victim, \u201cIf you tell anyone, you\u2019re going to see what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d Following that incident, the victim ran away from her foster mother\u2019s home because she was afraid of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">The defendant first argues that the trial court improperly prohibited him from arguing, during closing argument, that the victim\u2019s testimony on the issue of penetration was materially inconsistent with a prior statement made by the victim. The defendant further argues that by so ruling, the trial court infringed on his federal and state constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-9\">Some additional facts are necessary to resolve this issue. On direct examination, the victim testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>the defendant did not penetrate her during the attempted sexual assault in her bedroom. On cross-examination, defense counsel questioned the victim about what she had told various workers from the department of children and families (DCF) about that incident. Specifically, in response to a question by defense counsel, the victim responded that she did not recall having told any of the people from DCF that the defendant had been successful in having sex with her. On redirect examination, the victim again stated that she did not recall ever telling anyone that the defendant had penetrated her. Finally, on recross-examination, the victim stated that she never told anyone that the defendant had penetrated her.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">The state also presented the testimony of Donna Davies, a DCF investigator who interviewed the victim on December 12, 1994. On direct examination, Davies testified that during that interview, she questioned the victim about the incident with the defendant in the victim\u2019s bedroom. With regard to that incident, Davies testified that \u201c[the victim] did not specifically state that she was penetrated.\u201d Davies reiterated that when questioned on cross-examination.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Finally, Davies again indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>cated on re-direct examination that the victim never explicitly or specifically mentioned that the defendant had penetrated her vagina. Davies stated, however, that she did not ask the victim those types of questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">After the state rested, the defense presented the testimony of Kim Clarke, a social work supervisor for DCF. Clarke, along with social worker Leroy Muldrow, interviewed the victim after the victim reported to Muldrow that she had been sexually abused in her foster home. With regard to the incident in the victim\u2019s bedroom, Clarke testified that her conclusion after interviewing the victim was that the defendant had penetrated the victim.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On cross-examination, however, Clarke admitted that her notes of the interview with the victim were of her interpretation of what the victim had said, and that the victim never said that the defendant had penetrated her.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>Following a charging conference, the trial court, on the record, indicated that it would allow the defendant to argue during closing argument a number of \u201calleged inconsistencies\u201d between the victim\u2019s trial testimony and statements that she made to others. The trial court, however, disallowed defense counsel from arguing that the victim\u2019s statements were inconsistent with regard to whether the defendant had penetrated her during the incident in the victim\u2019s bedroom. In so ruling, the court first reviewed the testimony of Clarke, and noted that her testimony was of <em>her </em>interpretation of the victim\u2019s statements. The court stated that \u201c [interpretations by a listener do not constitute the declaration of an inconsistency.\u201d The court further stated that evidence of any inconsistency was lacking and that to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>allow the defendant to argue such an inconsistency would be to ask the jury to speculate.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">The defendant argues that the trial court impermissibly invaded the province of the jury when it concluded that the victim had not told Clarke that the defendant had penetrated her. The state counters by claiming that the defendant failed to demonstrate that the victim\u2019s trial testimony and the prior statement to Clarke were substantially and materially inconsistent. The state further argues that because the defendant failed to demonstrate that the victim\u2019s statements were inconsistent on the issue of penetration, the court exercised proper discretion in prohibiting closing argument on this issue. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">We first consider whether the trial court correctly concluded that victim\u2019s trial testimony was not substantially and materially inconsistent with the prior statement that she made to Clarke. We begin by noting that \u201c[w]hile it is clearly proper to attack a witness\u2019 credibil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>ity by evidence of his materially inconsistent statements . . . this can only be done if the court is satisfied that the prior statements are in fact inconsistent. ... In determining whether an inconsistency actually exists, the testimony of the witness as a whole, or the whole impression or effect of what has been said, must be examined.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>220 Conn. 385, 395, 599 A.2d 1053 (1991). Moreover, \u201c[s]ince the purpose of such evidence is to induce the tribunal to discard the one statement because the witness has also made another statement which cannot at the same time be true . . . the inconsistency must be substantial and relate to a material matter.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>214 Conn. 752, 763-64, 574 A.2d 182 (1990). \u201c[Statements from which a possible inference of inconsistency may be drawn are insufficient for the purpose of impeachment.\u201d Id., 764.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">We agree with the conclusion of the trial court that the victim\u2019s prior statement to Clarke was not substantially and materially inconsistent with the victim\u2019s testimony at trial. In both the statement to Clarke and her testimony at trial, the victim described how the defendant \u201cattempted\u201d to have sexual intercourse with her. The victim testified at trial that she never told anyone that the defendant had penetrated her and Clarke testified that the victim never used the word \u201cpenetration.\u201d Although Clarke interpreted the victim\u2019s statement to mean that the defendant had penetrated the victim, the trial court correctly noted that Clarke\u2019s interpretation does not constitute a substantial or material inconsistent statement of the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">Having concluded that the victim\u2019s trial testimony was not substantially and materially inconsistent with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>the prior statement given to Clarke, we next consider whether the trial court, in not allowing the defendant to argue such an inconsistency to the jury during closing argument, impermissibly invaded the province of the jury-</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">We begin by noting that \u201c[c]ounsel may comment upon facts properly in evidence and upon <em>reasonable </em>inferences to be drawn from them. . . . Counsel may not, however, comment on or suggest an inference from facts not in evidence. . . . Even if the trial court admits incompetent evidence, it may be relied on in argument, and alone or in part may support a verdict or finding.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Arline, </em>223 Conn. 52, 58-59, 612 A.2d 755 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">\u201cIn general, the scope of final argument lies within the sound discretion of the court . . . subject to appropriate constitutional limitations. ... It is within the discretion of the trial court to limit the scope of final argument to prevent comment on facts that are not properly in evidence, <em>to prevent the jury from considering matters in the realm of speculation </em>and to prevent the jury from being influenced by improper matter that might prejudice its deliberations.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 59-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">In the present case, after the trial court concluded that the victim\u2019s trial testimony was not inconsistent with the prior statement that she made to Clarke, it properly exercised its discretion in prohibiting closing argument on this issue. If the trial court had allowed the jury to consider such an inconsistency, the jury then would have been allowed to consider matters within the realm of speculation. The trial court therefore properly prevented defense counsel from arguing this matter to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">The defendant next argues that the trial court improperly refused to admit testimony by the victim\u2019s foster mother, Gonzalez, concerning events leading up to a confrontation between the victim and Gonzalez on the day the victim ran away. The defendant argues that this ruling by the trial court infringed on his federal and state constitutional rights to confront witnesses and to present a defense. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">The following additional facts are necessary to resolve this issue. On cross-examination, the victim admitted that she spoke to her social worker, Muldrow, the same day that she ran away from the foster home, and that she did not tell Muldrow about the alleged incidents with the defendant. The victim testified that she told Muldrow and Clarke about the incidents after she ran away, and that she remembered telling them that she was afraid to tell anyone about the incidents before that time. The victim also testified that she told Muldrow and Clarke that she was afraid to tell Gonzalez about the incidents because Gonzalez would not believe her. The victim admitted that Gonzalez had previously caught her in lies regarding the victim\u2019s attendance at school.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>After the state rested, the defendant made an offer of proof regarding the testimony of Gonzalez. Specifically, the defendant sought to have Gonzalez testify that (1) the victim was suspended from school, (2) Gonzalez subsequently learned of the suspension, (3) Gonzalez confronted the victim and contacted Muldrow, (4) the victim spoke with Muldrow, and (5) later that same day the victim ran away from the foster home. According to the defendant, the proscribed testimony would have provided the jury with a fuller picture of the events precipitating the victim\u2019s running away, and would have presented the jury with an alternative reason for the victim to have run away. According to the defendant, this testimony also would have gone to the victim\u2019s possible motive or interest in making accusations about Gonzalez\u2019 boyfriend. The trial court refused to allow this testimony, stating that the questions about the victim\u2019s suspension from school were \u201ccollateral, irrelevant, and ... an effort to discredit the character of the . . . victim in front of the juiy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">We begin by noting that although the defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s ruling denied him his constitutional rights to confront witnesses and to present a defense, the trial court\u2019s ruling was evidentiary in nature. \u201cEvery evidentiary ruling which denies a defendant a line of inquiry to which he thinks he is entitled is not constitutional error. In this instance, the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>ant has put a constitutional tag on a nonconstitutional claim.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Moales, </em>41 Conn. App. 817, 824, 678 A.2d 500, cert. denied, 239 Conn. 817, 682 A.2d 1011 (1996). \u201cThe trial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility of evidence. . . . The determination of the relevancy and remoteness of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial court. . . . This court will not disturb the trial court\u2019s ruling on evidence unless a clear abuse of discretion is shown.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>202 Conn. 463, 482, 522 A.2d 249 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">On the basis of the record before us, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it refused to allow this testimony of Gonzalez. The defendant argues that although the trial court allowed him to elicit from the victim that she lied to Gonzalez about being suspended, the court denied him the opportunity to attempt to prove the more significant facts that the confrontation about the suspension culminated in Gonzalez\u2019 calling DCF and the victim\u2019s running away that day. We agree with the state, however, that the court precluded the defendant from presenting evidence regarding only the specifics of the lie. Gonzalez did in fact testify that the victim left the house on the same day that Gonzalez discussed the school suspension with the victim. We also agree that the facts underlying the victim\u2019s lie to Gonzalez were collateral to the issue of whether the defendant was guilty of the crimes charged, and were prejudicial to the credibility of the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b785-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-49 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of attempt to commit a crime if, acting with the kind of mental state required for commission of the crime, he . . .

The court charged that the evidence was being admitted to show the defendant\u2019s general intent, any motive the defendant may have had and whether the defendant\u2019s conduct evinced a pattern of criminal activity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b786-10\"> The victim testified that the defendant was unable to pull her pants all the way down because she was struggling, but he did get them down \u201cfar enough to expose [her] private areas.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b788-7\"> The transcript reveals the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-8\">\u201cQ.

But, she somewhat recalled again, not with a great deal of certainty, that [the victim] may have said \u201cput into.\u2019 Now, the next question that the court raises, but these questions were not asked as a follow-up by either side: Put into what? The sexual assault statute defines sexual intercourse as penetration into the vaginal, to the vagina, into the genital area, and also into the anal opening or the genital opening, I\u2019m sorry. So that there are three vaults by which penetration may occur which constitutes sexual intercourse. We have none of that here.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">\u201cThe court concludes that in this instance, Kim Clarke made an inaccurate and incorrect leap of faith. In addition, the victim testified that she is still a virgin. She found no blood on the bed after the alleged incident. The victim herself testified that there was no penetration. The court concludes that the evidence of any inconsistency is lacking. And to argue inconsistency would be to ask the jury to speculate, at best. The evidence further indicates that the clearest statement that Kim Clarke made on cross-examination was, and I quote \u2018I thought\u2019\u2014she\u2019s not even certain\u2014T thought she said put into.\u2019 Again, the court raises the question: Put into what?
