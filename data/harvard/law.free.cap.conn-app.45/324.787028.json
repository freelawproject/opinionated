Since that date, he has been receiving temporary total disability benefits pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-307. The fund accepted liability for the defendant\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation benefits on May 8, 1992, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-349 and has paid benefits since that date. On or about May 25, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>1995, the fund filed two forms pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-296<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> giving notice that it intended to discontinue or reduce the defendant\u2019s benefits. The basis for this filing was that he (1) was no longer totally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>disabled and (2) had violated the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 31-290c<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by perpetrating a fraud on the fund in receiving such benefits. The defendant contested the fund\u2019s position, and the issue of whether to discontinue or reduce his benefits is the subject matter of a pending formal hearing on the workers\u2019 compensation claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>The fund has instituted a civil action against the defendant for money damages based on a violation of \u00a7 31-290c. In addition to criminal sanctions, that statute provides in part: \u201cSuch person shall also be liable for treble damages in a civil proceeding under section 52-564. \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">In connection with this civil action, the plaintiff applied for a prejudgment remedy under General Statutes \u00a7 52-278c.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant filed a motion to dismiss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>the fund\u2019s application for a prejudgment remedy on the ground that the Superior Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, claiming that \u201cjurisdiction belongs in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission pursuant to Chapter 568 of the Connecticut General Statutes,\u201d the act, and not in the Superior Court. The trial court denied the motion to dismiss and granted the fund a prejudgment remedy in the amount of $80,000. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">There are two issues in this appeal. The first is raised by the fund, which maintains that this court does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>have subject matter jurisdiction because the appeal was not timely filed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The second issue, which is raised by the defendant, is whether the Superior Court improperly ordered the prejudgment remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">We first take up the issue of subject matter jurisdiction of this court. \u201cLack of subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time. <em>Baldwin Piano &amp; Organ Co. </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>186 Conn. 295, 297, 441 A.2d 183 (1982).\u201d <em>Park City Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>14 Conn. App. 413, 417, 542 A.2d 326 (1988), aff'd, 210 Conn. 697, 556 A.2d 602 (1989); <em>Romanowski </em>v. <em>Foley, </em>10 Conn. App. 80, 83, 521 A.2d 601, cert. denied, 204 Conn. 802, 525 A.2d 1352 (1987). \u201cWhenever the absence of jurisdiction is brought to the notice of the court or tribunal, cognizance of it must be taken and the matter passed upon before it can move one further step in the cause; as any movement is necessarily the exercise of jurisdiction.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Rozbicki, </em>211 Conn. 232, 245, 558 A.2d 986 (1989), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Malkowski, </em>189 Conn. 101, 104, 454 A.2d 275 (1983); see <em>Kohn Display &amp; Woodworking Co. </em>v. <em>Paragon Paint &amp; Varnish Corp., </em>166 Conn. 446, 448-49, 352 A.2d 301 (1974); <em>Carten v. Carten, </em>153 Conn. 603, 610, 219 A.2d 711 (1966). The fund claims that this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction because the appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">The order granting the fund a prejudgment remedy in the amount of $80,000 on real property of the defendant was issued pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-278\u00cd. That statute provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) An order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>. . . granting ... a prejudgment remedy following a hearing under section 52-278d . . . shall be deemed a final judgment for purposes of appeal, (b) No such appeal shall be taken except within seven days of the rendering of the order from which the appeal is to be taken.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The basic facts in the record relevant to the timeliness issue are as follows. The order for the prejudgment remedy from which the defendant appeals was signed and dated by the trial judge on February 28,1996. Notice of that action was mailed by the clerk to counsel on Friday, March 8, 1996,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the ninth day after February 28, 1996.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendant filed the appeal on Monday, March 11, 1996, the twelfth day after February 28, 1996. On the record before us, we cannot discern whether the passage of nine days between the signing of the order by the trial judge and the mailing of notice to counsel by the clerk came about because the trial judge did not expeditiously give her order to the clerk or because the clerk did not expeditiously mail notice of that order to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">The fund argues that the judgment was rendered on February 28,1995, when the trial judge signed the order, that the appeal was taken on March 11,1996, and, therefore, the appeal is untimely under \u00a7 <em>52-2781 </em>and must be dismissed. Accordingly, it claims that there is no subject matter jurisdiction because \u00a7 52-572/ris jurisdictional. See, e.g., <em>Ambroise </em>v. <em>William Raveis Real Estate, Inc., </em>226 Conn. 757, 762, 628 A.2d 1303 (1993). In arguing that the appeal is untimely, the fund claims that the language of \u00a7 <em>52-2781 </em>(b) providing that \u201c[n]o such appeal shall be taken except within seven days of the rendering of the order from which the appeal is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>be taken,\u201d mandates that the seven day appeal period is to be reckoned from February 28, 1996. The case law, it maintains, is dispositive. It relies on <em>Ambroise </em>v. <em>William Raveis Real Estate, Inc., </em>supra, 762, <em>HUD/Barbour-Waverly </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>235 Conn. 650, 668 A.2d 1309 (1995), and <em>Srager </em>v. <em>Koenig, </em>36 Conn. App. 469, 651 A.2d 752 (1994), claiming at oral argument that these cases indicate that the appeal period begins on the date the trial judge signed the order. It would appear that the fund claims that General Statutes \u00a7 51-53<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> does not apply to \u00a7 52-278/ because the latter statute provides its own appeal period rather than relying on the more general provision for appeal in \u00a7 51-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">The defendant, on the other hand, claims that <em>Ambroise, HUD/Barbour-Waverly </em>and <em>Srager, </em>the same cases relied on by the fund, support his claim that the order was \u201crendered\u201d under \u00a7 52-278/, not when the trial judge signed it, but, rather, when notice of that order was issued by the court clerk. He claims that the record demonstrates that such notice was issued on March 8, 1995, and that his appeal, filed on March 11, 1995, was, therefore, timely as filed within the seven day appeal period. We agree with the defendant that the order was \u201crendered\u201d under \u00a7 52-278/ on March 8, 1995, the date the court clerk mailed notice to counsel, and that the appeal was, therefore, timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">We begin our analysis by examining <em>Ambroise, </em>in which the dispositive issue was whether an appeal from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>the denial of a prejudgment remedy could be taken after the expiration of the seven day period specified by \u00a7 52-278/. <em>Ambroise </em>v. <em>William Raveis Real Estate, Inc., </em>supra, 226 Conn. 757-58. In that case, no reference was made at all to when the trial court\u2019s order was made or even mailed. Informatively, however, the Supreme Court said: \u201cThe procedural facts of the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal are undisputed. The parties received notice of the trial court\u2019s decision on January 26,1993. The plaintiffs filed their appeal on February 16,1993.\u201d Id., 759-60. A fair reading of the procedural history of <em>Ambroise </em>strongly suggests that the Supreme Court calculated the appeal period from the date that counsel <em>received </em>notice of the trial court\u2019s decision. It further said that \u201c[b]ecause the jurisdiction of this court is defined by statute . . . non-compliance with \u00a7 <em>52-2781 </em>raises a challenge to [our Supreme Court\u2019s] subject matter jurisdiction\u201d; id.; and it dismissed the appeal as untimely. <em>Ambroise </em>does not support the fund\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\"><em>HUD/Barbour-Waverly, </em>also does not avail the fund. The issue in that case was whether, in an appeal from a judgment of possession in a summary process eviction proceeding, the failure of the defendant to comply with the five day time limit to appeal as specified by General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 47a-35<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> deprived this court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>subject matter jurisdiction. After a trial, the trial court rendered a judgment of possession in favor of the plaintiff on August 5, 1993. There is no reference in the court\u2019s opinion in that case to whether the judgment was rendered in open court in the presence of counsel or whether notice was issued by the clerk to counsel on the same day the trial judge signed the order. Within the five day appeal period, the defendant filed a motion<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> in the trial court for an extension of time to file an appeal pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4040. That motion was granted on August 16, 1993. Later, on August 30, 1993, nineteen days after the expiration of the appeal period set forth in \u00a7 47a-35, the defendant appealed to this court, which dismissed the defendant\u2019s appeal. The Supreme Court affirmed our dismissal. In doing so, that court, referring to <em>Ambroise, </em>held that the legislature intended that the five day appeal period prescribed by \u00a7 47a-35 implicated subject matter jurisdiction, and that failure to comply with that time requirement deprived this court of jurisdiction to hear and decide the defendant\u2019s appeal. <em>HUD/Barbour-Waverly, </em>unlike the case now before us, was not a case in which the appeal period had purportedly already run when notice of the decision was received by the party seeking to appeal. <em>HUD/Barbour-Waverly </em>does not avail the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">An examination of <em>Srager </em>v. <em>Koenig, </em>supra, 36 Conn. App. 469, persuades us that that decision also does not support the fund\u2019s claim of untimeliness. <em>Srager </em>was an action instituted to recover damages for breach of contract for the sale of certain real property and other relief. The plaintiffs in <em>Srager </em>had recorded a notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>lis pendens on September 16,1993. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-325a (c), the defendant moved for a discharge of the notice of lis pendens for lack of probable cause. Significantly, in reciting the procedural history, the court in <em>Srager </em>stated: \u201cThe trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion and notice of the court\u2019s order was issued to the parties on September 14,1994. The plaintiff appealed from the order on September 27, 1994.\u201d Id., 470. On appeal to this court, the defendant sought dismissal of the appeal claiming lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the appeal was filed after the expiration of the seven day appeal period set out in \u00a7 52-325c (b). That section provides in relevant part: \u201cNo appeal shall be taken from such order except within seven days thereof. . . .\u201d Relying on <em>Ambroise, </em>this court said: \u201cOur review of General Statutes \u00a7 52-325c, informed by the <em>Ambroise </em>analysis, leads us to conclude that the failure to appeal within the specified time period deprives this court of subject matter jurisdiction. The language of \u00a7 52-325c (b) is clear and is virtually the same as the language of \u00a7 52-278\u00cd (b), which the Supreme Court held to impose such a jurisdictional requirement.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Id., 471. After opining that the legislative purpose was advanced by the seven day appeal period, this court concluded by saying: \u201cIn this case, the plaintiffs appealed from the discharge of the notice of lis pendens thirteen days after the notice of that order was issued. The court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this untimely appeal.\u201d Id., 473. In <em>Srager, </em>this court considered that the date on which notice of the court\u2019s order was <em>issued </em>was the date to be used in calculating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>the start of the seven day appeal period. <em>Srager </em>does not support the fund\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Were we to accept the fund\u2019s interpretation of the seven day appeal period in \u00a7 52-278?, the right of appeal in that section would be meaningless in this case. Accepting its interpretation would have draconian effect. For example, were a judge to sign and date a \u201cdecision\u201d and hold onto it until the seven day appeal period ran, there could be no appeal from that \u201cdecision.\u201d The legislative intent certainly could not have been to provide that the appeal period would have to begin to run before there was a final judgment from which to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Contrary to the fund\u2019s position, we have determined that our case law actually supports the defendant\u2019s position as to when the appeal period of \u00a7 52-278? begins to run. \u201cOur law is clear on this issue. A judgment does not exist as a legal entity until pronounced, expressed, or made known, in some appropriate way. <em>Goldreyer </em>v. <em>Cronan, </em>76 Conn. 113, 117, 55 A. 594 [1903]. ... A judgment is in fact <em>rendered </em>in a cause tried to the court when the trial judge officially announces his decision orally in open court, or, out of court, signifies orally or in a writing filed with the clerk in his official capacity the decision pronounced by him. <em>Hubbard </em>v. <em>Planning Commission, </em>151 Conn. 269, 272, 196 A.2d 760 [1963]; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>New Haven Taxicab Co., </em>93 Conn. 251, 258, 105 A. 706 [1919];<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Hull </em>v. <em>Thoms, </em>82 Conn. 386, 391, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>73 A. 793 [1909]; <em>Bulkeley\u2019s Appeal, </em>76 Conn. 454, 457, 57 A. 112 [1904].\u201d <em>Bogaert </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>162 Conn. 532, 535, 294 A.2d 573 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The decision in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>New Haven Taxicab Co., </em>supra, 93 Conn. 258, is significant in resolving the timeliness issue in this case by reference to its definition of \u201crendering a decision.\u201d In <em>Brown, </em>there was no indication in the record as to the date on which the judge\u2019s decision was given to the clerk. In that case our Supreme Court said, \u201cThe date placed by the judge upon a paper is by no means determinative of the date when the paper is handed to the clerk, or when, if at all, the ruling contained is announced in open court. In practice such ruling is not ordinarily announced in any other way than by delivery of the writing to the clerk. When so delivered to the clerk or announced in court the judgment is rendered. . . . This pronouncement of the court it is incumbent upon the clerk to forthwith enter. . . . Where there is no other evidence of the date when judgment is rendered than the action of the clerk in notifying counsel, as in this case, it will be presumed that the clerk acted promptly and the date of the notification will be taken to be the date when the judge informed the clerk of his decision.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">Moreover, only last year this court said, \u201c \u2018A judgment is in fact rendered in a cause tried to the court when the trial judge officially announces his decision orally in open court, or, out of court, signifies orally or in a writing filed with the clerk in his official capacity the decision pronounced by him. . . . The judgment of a court is not rendered when the judge arrives at his decision in the privacy of his chambers, nor is the date placed on a paper by the judge determinative of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>date when the paper is handed to the clerk. <em>Bogaert </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>[supra, 162 Conn. 535-36]; <em>Hubbard </em>v. <em>Planning Commission, </em>[supra, 151 Conn. 272]; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>New Haven Taxicab Co., </em>[supra, 93 Conn. 258].\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Zoning Commission </em>v. <em>Fairfield Resources Management, Inc., </em>41 Conn. App. 89, 102, 674 A.2d 1335 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">We conclude that there was no judgment from which an appeal could be taken in this case until the court\u2019s decision granting the prejudgment remedy was delivered to the clerk, which in <em>this </em>case we presume was the same date on which the clerk mailed notice to counsel. The appeal period in this case could not have begun to run until March 8, 1996. The appeal by the defendant to this court was timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">The defendant makes several arguments in support of his claim that the trial court improperly failed to dismiss the fund\u2019s application for a prejudgment remedy. He argues that the failure to dismiss was improper because the fund, in seeking a prejudgment remedy, was asking the Superior Court to adjudicate whether he was entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits pursuant to \u00a7 31-307 (a), a determination that he says the legislature has entrusted solely to the workers\u2019 compensation commission. While not contesting that \u00a7 31-290c provides the right to a civil action when an individual fraudulently receives temporary total benefits, he claims that the issue for this court to decide is whether the Superior Court is empowered to determine whether he was entitled to such benefits pursuant to \u00a7 31-307 (a) in order to adjudicate fully the fund\u2019s action pursuant to \u00a7 31-290c. Contending that the fund\u2019s action is premature, the defendant argues that the fund asks the Superior Court to \u201cmodify\u201d and \u201cinterpret\u201d his award to such benefits, to \u201cdiscontinue and/or reduce\u201d them and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>order him to \u201creimburse\u201d the fund for moneys allegedly illegally received, which actions, he claims, would be clearly contrary to such cases as <em>Czeplicki </em>v. <em>Fafnir Bearing Co., </em>137 Conn. 454, 78 A.2d 339 (1951), and <em>Hyatt </em>v. <em>Milford, </em>26 Conn. App. 194, 600 A.2d 5 (1991), appeal dismissed, 224 Conn. 441, 619 A.2d 450 (1995). While we agree that under a scenario such as that in <em>Czeplicki, </em>the commissioner has authority to act as fact finder, the facts to be found in a \u201ccivil proceeding\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 31-290c are not within the statutory authority of the commissioner. The defendant further argues that <em>Hyatt </em>applies \u201cperfectly to this cause\u201d where it states: \u201cThe doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies is designed to prevent piecemeal appeals of a litigant\u2019s claim before an administrative agency.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hyatt </em>v. <em>Milford, </em>supra, 200. Therefore, he claims that the Superior Court, having no jurisdiction at this point, cannot and should not act until the workers\u2019 compensation commission has made its determination, thereby respecting \u201cthe delicate balance between administrative agencies and the courts.\u201d In advancing this position, the defendant maintains that a favorable decision by the commissioner, i.e., that he was entitled to temporary total benefits under \u00a7 31-307a during the period the fund alleges fraudulent receipt of such benefits by him would bar the fund from proceeding with its civil action pursuant to \u00a7 31-290c. This is so, he says, because \u201cthe Superior Court could not find that the defendant committed fraud against the fund if the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner finds that he was entitled to benefits during the contested period.\u201d While agreeing with the trial court that the circumstances do not constitute concurrent jurisdiction, he says that \u201cmerely because jurisdiction to determine . . . treble damages lies with the Superior Court, it does not follow that the Superior Court has jurisdiction to determine [his] right to tempo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>rary total benefits pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-307 (a), which it must first do before it can reach the issue of . . . treble damages.\u201d To permit the Superior Court to make such a finding would, he claims, constitute \u201can impermissible judicial usurpation of the administrative function.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">The fund, on the other hand, claims that it may, under proper statutory construction and available remedies, pursue this civil action independent of any proceedings before the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner. In doing so, it argues that the plain language of \u00a7 31-290c enables it to proceed in the Superior Court for money damages and that the prosecution of this civil action does not violate the exclusive remedy doctrine. It maintains also that the substantive and procedural rights of the parties pursuant to \u00a7 31-290c can be protected only in the Superior Court. In that context, it points out that under \u00a7 31-290c it is necessary for the court, in making an independent determination of the facts in such an action, to do so in the context of the burden of proof required, i.e., that of clear and convincing proof of the actions required to assess treble damages pursuant to \u00a7 52-564. <em>Schaffer </em>v. <em>Lindy, </em>8 Conn. App. 96, 105, 511 A.2d 1022 (1986). The exclusive jurisdiction of this civil proceeding is in the Superior Court and is not subject to the administrative doctrine of the exhaustion of remedies. If it were subject to that doctrine, the fund argues, it could well be precluded from proceeding in the Superior Court, if met by an assertion of the defense of the statute of limitations. We agree with the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">\u201cIn construing any statute, we seek to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>220 Conn. 749, 755, 601 A.2d 1005 (1992). . . . <em>Vaillancourt </em>v. <em>New Britain Machine/Litton, </em>224 Conn. 382, 390, 618 A.2d 1340 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>(1993). It is an axiom of statutory construction that legislative intent is to be determined by an analysis of the language actually used in the legislation. <em>Caltabiano </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>211 Conn. 662, 666, 560 A.2d 975 (1989). . . . [W]hen the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, we need look no further than the words themselves because we assume that the language expresses the legislature\u2019s intent. <em>American Universal Ins.

It claims money damages and treble damages pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-564 and 31-290c. It is appropriate to note that it is agreed, and the trial court so found, that we are not presented with the matter of concurrent jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">In that regard, we are aware that \u201ccourts and administrative agencies often have concurrent jurisdiction, the common law doctrine of primary jurisdiction is designed to guide a court in determining whether and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>when it should refrain or postpone the exercise of its own jurisdiction so that an agency may first answer some questions presented. 4 Davis, Administrative Law (1983) \u00a7 22:1, p. 81.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cianci </em>v. <em>Connecticut Council, AFSCME, </em>8 Conn. App. 197, 201 n.3, 512 A.2d 232 (1986). In speaking of concurrent jurisdiction, \u201c[t]ypically, the creation of [an administrative] agency means the addition to the legal system of a new lawmaking and law applying authority, with no explicit subtraction from the previously-existing power of courts. 4 Davis, [supra] \u00a7 22:1, p. 81. In such cases, the doctrine of primary jurisdiction dictates that the dispute be directed to the board so as to take advantage of the board\u2019s specialized skills and procedures; <em>Sharkey </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>196 Conn. 253, 255-56, 492 A.2d 171 (1985); 4 Davis, supra, 81-82 . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Because the defendant has cast his initial issue in terms of primary jurisdiction, claiming that the Superior Court must stay its hand until the commissioner decides the matter presently before him, we must consider the authority of the workers\u2019 compensation commission as compared with that of the Superior Court in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">\u201cJurisdiction involves the power in a court to hear and determine the cause of action presented to it and its source is the constitutional and statutory provisions by which it is created.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Andrew Ansaldi Co. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>207 Conn. 67, 73, 540 A.2d 59 (1988) <em>(Shea, J., </em>concurring), quoting <em>Connecticut State Employees Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Connecticut Personnel Policy Board, </em>165 Conn. 448, 456, 334 A.2d 909 (1973). \u201cArticle fifth, \u00a7 1 of the Connecticut constitution proclaims that [t]he powers and jurisdiction of the courts shall be defined by law, and General Statutes \u00a7 51-164s provides that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>[t]he superior court shall be the sole court of original jurisdiction for all causes of action, except such actions over which the courts of probate have original jurisdiction, as provided by statute.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Carey, </em>222 Conn. 299, 305, 610 A.2d 1147 (1992), on appeal after remand, 228 Conn. 487, 636 A.2d 840 (1994). There are courts that have only limited jurisdiction. For example, in Connecticut, \u201c[o]ur courts of probate have a limited jurisdiction and can exercise only such powers as are conferred on them by statute. . . . They have jurisdiction only when the facts exist on which the legislature has conditioned the exercise of their power. ...\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Heiser v.

Administrative agencies are tribunals of limited jurisdiction and their jurisdiction is dependent entirely upon the validity of the statutes vesting them with power and they cannot confer jurisdiction upon themselves. . . .We have recognized that [i]t is clear that an administrative body must act strictly within its statutory authority, within constitutional limitations and in a lawful manner. . . .

The defendant is incorrect when he argues that the Superior Court cannot proceed with its \u00a7 31-290c action until the present matter before the commissioner has been fully resolved because that court seeks to adjudicate an issue entrusted solely to the commissioner. He is also incorrect in claiming that that court seeks not only to \u201cmodify\u201d and \u201cinterpret\u201d his award, but to \u201cdiscontinue or reduce\u201d it, as well as to have him \u201creimburse\u201d the fund for moneys he allegedly illegally received. All these alleged actions by the Superior Court, he argues, are in derogation of the commissioner\u2019s authority under the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">We recognize that the modification of an award is a function of the commissioner, as is the determination of an awar d in the first instance. The commissioner\u2019s authority under \u00a7 31-315 or \u00a7 31-296, however, is totally different from the new statutorily created cause of action and remedy in the Superior Court created by \u00a7 31-290c. \u201cThe purpose of the workmen\u2019s compensation law has always been to provide compensation for an injury arising out of and in the course of the employment regardless of fault .... The underlying objective is to provide for the workman and those dependent on him.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cappellino </em>v. <em>Cheshire, </em>226 Conn. 569, 575, 628 A.2d 595 (1993), quoting <em>Klapproth </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>156 Conn. 276, 279, 240 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>A.2d 886 (1968); <em>Perille </em>v. <em>Raybestos-Manhattan-Europe, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 529, 541, 494 A.2d 555 (1985). Section 31-290c is the legislative response to those who have abused or may be abusing the humanitarian purpose of the act by taking advantage of it by fraudulent means. It has ordained accomplishment of this purpose by spelling out the elements of this cause of action and by imposing liability in treble damages in a \u201ccivil proceeding\u201d under \u00a7 52-564. This \u201ccivil proceeding\u201d does not come within the authority of the commissioner. The \u201ccivil proceeding\u201d referred to in \u00a7 31-290c is a court proceeding.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">\u201cIt is clear that an award of treble damages is an extraordinary statutory remedy. See <em>Alaimo </em>v. <em>Royer, </em>188 Conn. 36, 43, 448 A.2d 207 (1982); <em>DeMilo </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>189 Conn. 671, 676, 458 A.2d 362 (1983).\u201d <em>Schaffer </em>v. <em>Lindy, </em>supra, 8 Conn. App. 104. \u201cBefore treble damages can be imposed, however, the proof must demonstrate a violation of the specific statute authorizing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>the extraordinary damages.\u201d <em>A-G Foods, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pepperidge Farm, Inc., </em>216 Conn. 200, 213, 579 A.2d 69 (1990). When treble damages are sought pursuant to \u00a7 52-564, as here, this court has decided that \u201cclear and convincing proof of the actions alleged is required in order to assess treble damages pursuant to \u00a7 52-564.\u201d <em>Schaffer </em>v. <em>Lindy, </em>supra, 105.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In addition, it is required that in actions seeking to recover double or treble damages under statutes \u201cthat the claim for relief shall be specifically based upon the statutory remedy.\u201d <em>Tillinghast </em>v. <em>Leppert, </em>93 Conn. 247, 250, 105 A. 615 (1919); <em>Dunbar </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>87 Conn. 253, 257, 87 A. 787 (1913). That was done in this case; there is no relief sought that the commissioner is authorized to order. Finally, the fund\u2019s complaint is clearly based on the statutory cause of action authorizing such extraordinary damages, and not for any other alleged cause of action. <em>DeMilo </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>supra, 676.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The \u00a7 31-290c action instituted by the fund in this case is a statutory cause of action properly brought in the Superior Court. The fund\u2019s claim in its complaint in this case is one at law, it is based on a tort theory and seeks damages. The liability under it is to be determined in a \u201ccivil proceeding.\u201d The theory of liability, the extraordinary relief and the forum of a \u201ccivil pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>ceeding\u201d and accompanying burden of proof all contribute to demonstrate that it is not within the scope of the commissioner\u2019s authority. It is wholly independent of and outside the statutory authority of the commissioner. The relief it makes available to a successful plaintiff is strictly tailored to the extraordinary remedy it provides. The legislature, from what we have said, intended that the \u201ccivil proceeding\u201d together with the relief it allows upon the appropriate proof be solely within the jurisdiction of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">As pointed out, the trial court determined that this is not a case of concurrent jurisdiction and the defendant agrees. \u201cConcurrent jurisdiction\u201d has been said to mean \u201cthe jurisdiction of several different tribunals, each authorized to deal with the same subject-matter at the choice of the suitor. Authority shared by two or more legislative, judicial, or administrative officers or bodies to deal with the same subject matter.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990); see 20 Am Jur. 2d, Courts \u00a7 91. We are not presented with a situation of concurrent jurisdiction here.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">We turn then to the doctrine of primary jurisdiction. It has been said that that doctrine \u201capplies where a claim is <em>originally cognizable </em>in the courts, and comes into play whenever enforcement of the claim requires the resolution of issues which, under a regulatory scheme, have been placed within the special competence of an administrative body; in such a case the judicial process is suspended pending referral of such issues to the administrative body for its views.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Western Pacific R. Co., </em>352 U.S. 59, 63-64, 77 S. Ct. 161, 1 L. Ed. 2d 126 (1956), citing <em>General American Tank Car Corp. </em>v. <em>El Dorado Terminal Co., </em>308 U.S. 422, 433, 60 S. Ct. 325, 84 L. Ed. 361 (1940). \u201cThe doctrine of primary jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>tion is invoked only to determine who will initially decide an issue; 3 Davis, Administrative Law Treatise \u00a7 19.01; it cannot operate to divest a court of its ultimate jurisdiction.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Golembeske </em>v. <em>White, </em>168 Conn. 278, 281, 362 A.2d 1354 (1975). The doctrine of primary jurisdiction is used to fix forum priority when the courts and an administrative agency <em>have concurrent jurisdiction </em>over an issue. <em>Far Eastern Conference </em>v. <em>United States, </em>342 U.S. 570, 574-75, 72 S. Ct. 492, 96 L. Ed. 576 (1952); <em>Mrs. W. </em>v. <em>Tirozzi, </em>832 F.2d 748, 759 (2d Cir. 1987). Stated another way, \u201c[t]he threshold issue in determining whether [the] doctrine [of primary jurisdiction] applies is whether both the court and an agency have jurisdiction over the same issue.\u201d <em>Golden Hill Paugussett Tribe of Indians </em>v. <em>Weicker, </em>39 F.3d 51, 59 (2d Cir. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">\u201cAgency and court jurisdiction to resolve disputes and issues frequently overlap, leading to potential conflicts in resolving issues or disputes. Primary jurisdiction is a doctrine used by courts to allocate initial decisionmaking responsibility between agencies and courts where such overlaps and potential for conflicts exist.\u201d 2 K. Davis &amp; R. Pierce, Administrative Law Treatise (3d Ed. 1994) \u00a7 14.1, p. 271. Under this view, \u201c[c]ourt jurisdiction is not thereby ousted, but only postponed.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Philadelphia National Bank, </em>374 U.S. 321, 353, 83 S. Ct. 1715, 10 L. Ed. 2d 915 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The doctrine of primary jurisdiction is distinguishable \u201cfrom the concept of exclusive agency jurisdiction, which refers to matters which an agency alone has the power to adjudicate and of which the court has no jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Mazzola </em>v. <em>Southern New England Telephone Co., </em>169 Conn. 344, 349, 363 A.2d 170 (1975). Primary jurisdiction does not apply in this case because, as we have demonstrated, the passage of \u00a7 31-290c was not intended to, and does not, authorize the commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>sioner to determine the issue of liability in the \u201ccivil proceeding\u201d under that statute or to award relief by way of treble damages. The jurisdiction under \u00a7 31-290c resides <em>solely </em>with the Superior Court. \u201c[A] court may not refer a controversy within its jurisdiction to an agency under [the primary jurisdiction] doctrine where the agency itself lacks jurisdiction; the court\u2019s jurisdiction in such cases is exclusive. <em>Collens </em>v. <em>New Canaan Water Co., </em>155 Conn. 477, 480-81, 234 A.2d 825 [1967]; 73 C.J.S., Public Administrative Bodies and Procedure, \u00a7 40.\u201d Id., 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Davis has said that \u201c[p]rimary jurisdiction is conceptually analogous to exhaustion of administrative remedies. . . . Both are prudential doctrines created by the courts to allocate between courts and agencies the initial responsibility for resolving issues and disputes in a manner that recognizes the differing responsibilities and comparative advantages of agencies and courts.\u201d 2 K. Davis &amp; R. Pierce, supra, \u00a7 14.1, pp. 271-72. This court has said that \u201c[i]t is a well settled principle of administrative law that if an adequate adxuinistrative remedy exists, it must be exhausted before the Superior Court will obtain jurisdiction to act in the matter. . . . <em>Connecticut Life &amp; Health Ins.

The Superior Court has sole jurisdiction of this action and is not required, as the defendant claims, to stay its hand. \u201cGenerally, a court with jurisdiction over a case has not only the right, but also the duty, to exercise that jurisdiction, and to render a decision in a case before it.\u201d 20 Am.

Lupachino sustained an injury to his lower back arising out of and in the course of his employment, giving rise to a workers\u2019 compensation claim being made and accepted under Chapter 568 of the Connecticut General Statutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-17\">\u201c2.) As a result of the injury the defendant received disability benefits from his employer or its insurer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-18\">\u201c3.) In that the defendant had a physical impairment of the lower back which preexisted the injury of October 10, 1988, the employer/insurer gave notice of its intention to transfer administration and liability of the claim to the plaintiff, Second Injury Fund of the State of Connecticut (sometimes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>hereinafter referred to as the State of Connecticut) pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 31-349.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-7\">\u201c4.) Based upon all of the facts and circumstances, the Plaintiff agreed to accept transfer of the claim pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 31-349 as of May 8,1992 and has from that date continued to pay workers\u2019 compensation benefits to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-8\">\u201c5.) Among the benefits paid by the plaintiff and accepted by the defendant are payments for temporary total incapacity pursuant to Conn. Gen. Statutes \u00a7 31-307.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-9\">\u201c6.) During periods comprising June and July of 1994, December of 1994, January of 1995 and at other diverse times since May 8, 1992, the defendant has had a work capacity and has performed services, including but not limited to physical labor for and on behalf of third parties, while continuing to receive temporary total incapacity payments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-10\">\u201c7.) To induce the plaintiff to continue to make periodic temporary total incapacity payments the defendant represented to the plaintiff that he continued to lack a work capacity and/or failed to disclose that he was performing services including physical labor, for others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-11\">\u201c8.) The defendant knew or should have known that the representations were false and/or that his nondisclosure of material facts would deceive the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-12\">\u201c9.) In reliance upon said representations and/or nondisclosure of material facts the plaintiff continued to pay said benefits, and is damaged thereby.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-13\">\u201c10.)
