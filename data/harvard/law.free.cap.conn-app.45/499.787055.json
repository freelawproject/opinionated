The commissioner ruled that the notice, sent to the \u201cDepartment of Motor Vehicles\u201d rather than to the \u201cState of Connecticut, Department of Motor Vehicles\u201d was insufficiently addressed to impose an obligation on the defendant to file a notice contesting liability within the twenty day period. The commissioner, therefore, denied the plaintiffs motion to preclude the defendant from contesting liability and, thereafter, dismissed the claim. The compensation review board (review board) affirmed the commissioner\u2019s decision denying the motion to preclude,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">The plaintiff asserts that the notice of injury was sufficiently addressed so that his employer, the state of Connecticut, had an opportunity to make a timely investigation of the claim. Therefore, the commissioner improperly denied the motion to preclude. The defendant asserts that the plaintiffs contention is contrary to the applicable precedent of the review board and is supported only by nonbinding dicta from a Supreme Court case. As alternative grounds for affirmance,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the defendant contends that the motion to preclude was properly denied because (1) the claim here is not bona fide, (2) the alleged date or dates of injury were too vague and ambiguous to allow the timely investigation contemplated by the twenty day rule of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 31-297 (b), and (3) the plaintiff did not provide evidence that established the sufficiency of his notice. We reverse the decision of the review board because we conclude that the notice of claim was sufficient to trigger the twenty day period.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">The following facts are relevant to our resolution of this appeal. On July 19,1989, the plaintiff was employed by the state of Connecticut, department of motor vehicles (defendant). On July 26, 1989, the plaintiff mailed a notice of claim to the defendant. The notice was addressed to the \u201cDepartment of Motor Vehicles\u201d at 60 State Street in Wethersfield. It stated that the plaintiff \u201cwhile in the employ of Department of Motor Vehicles at Norwich, CT, on the 19th day of July, 1989, or sometime prior thereto, sustained injuries arising out of and in the course of his . . . employment as follows . . . Repetitive Trauma/Repetitive Act and/or Trauma to Back, and Repetitive Trauma/Repetitive Act and/or Trauma to Left Knee.\u201d The defendant received the notice of claim on July 28, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">On September 1,1989, thirty-five days after it received the notice of claim, the defendant sent a notice contesting liability to the plaintiff and to the workers\u2019 compensation district office. On September 26, 1990, the plaintiff filed a motion to preclude the defendant from contesting the compensability of his alleged injury because the defendant failed to comply with the twenty day time limit set forth in \u00a7 31-297 (b). The workers\u2019 compensation commissioner denied his motion on September 13, 1991, because the notice failed to identify the defendant as \u201cState of Connecticut, Department of Motor Vehicles.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The purpose of the preclusion statute is to \u201censure (1) that employers would bear\u2019 the burden of investigating a claim promptly and (2) that employees would be timely apprised of the specific reasons for the denial of their claim. These effects would, in turn, diminish delays in the proceedings, discourage arbitrary refusal of bona fide claims and narrow the legal issues which were to be contested.\u201d <em>Menzies </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>165 Conn. 338, 343, 334 A.2d 452 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Before an employer\u2019s obligation to respond is triggered, a plaintiff must first file a notice of claim. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 31-294. Until our Supreme Court decided <em>Pereira </em>v. <em>State, </em>228 Conn. 535, 637 A.2d 392 (1995), the review board, in judging the sufficiency of a notice of claim, consistently adhered to a rule of strict compliance<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> with \u00a7 31-294. See, e.g., <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Central Paving Co., </em>5 Conn. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rev. Op. 92 (1988). In <em>Pereira, </em>however, our Supreme Court addressed, in dicta, the issue of what constitutes a sufficient notice of claim \u201cto clarify a misconception on behalf of the review [board] regarding the standard by which the sufficiency of a notice of claim to trigger an employer\u2019s obligation to respond under \u00a7 31-297 (b) should be judged. The rule of strict compliance adopted by the review [board] is not supported by either the plain language or the legislative history of \u00a7 31-297 (b). To the contrary, \u00a7 31-297 (b) is remedial legislation that should be liberally construed to accomplish its humanitarian purpose. . . . [I]t was enacted to require a prompt and thorough investigation of the employee\u2019s claim so as to yield a specific disclaimer of liability and to avoid unnecessary delay in the adjudication of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>workers\u2019 claims. As a result, <em>if the notice of claim is sufficient to allow the employer to make a timely investigation of the claim, it triggers the employer\u2019s obligation to file a disclaimer.\u201d </em>(Citation omitted; emphasis added.) <em>Pereira </em>v. State, supra, 542-43 n.8.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">After the <em>Pereira </em>decision, the review board retreated from its rule of strict compliance and adopted this relaxed standard. See <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Dow Corning STI, Inc., </em>13 Conn. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rev. Op. 109, 111 (1995). Although the relevant language in <em>Pereira </em>is dicta, we are disinclined to resolve the same issue on virtually identical facts contrary to such clear and persuasive guidance from our Supreme Court. We fail to discern how the addition of the words \u201cState of Connecticut\u201d would have added to the effectiveness of the notice here. The defendant\u2019s notice contesting liability states that it <em>knew </em>of the injury on July 19, 1989, and it is undisputed that the department of motor vehicles received the plaintiffs notice on July 28, 1989. Indeed, in the notice contesting liability the defendant lists the name of the employer as \u201cMotor Vehicles,\u201d an even more cryptic description than the plaintiffs. The address of the employer is listed on the disclaimer as 60 State Street, the exact address that the plaintiff used.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Any lack of opportunity to investigate the claim apparently resulted from internal misdirection of the notice. Contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertion, we do not read General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 31-294<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>requiring a plaintiff to send notice to a legal agent for service or to some other person who \u201ccould reasonably be expected to handle this sort of notice.\u201d Because the notice went to the same place to which it would have gone if \u201cState of Connecticut\u201d had been added to the address, the defendant had an opportunity to make a timely investigation of the claim. The notice contesting liability came too late and the defendant should have been precluded from contesting the compensability of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">The defendant asserts as alternative grounds for affirmance that, even if we adopt the <em>Pereira </em>standard, the notice of claim was insufficient because (1) it failed to state a precise date on which the alleged injuries occurred, (2) the claim is not bona fide and (3) the plaintiff did not prove that his notice satisfied the <em>Pereira </em>standard. We find no merit in these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">In his notice, the plaintiff alleged that he suffered a repetitive injury and trauma to his knee<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and back on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>or before July 19, 1989. The defendant was thus on notice that on or before that date the plaintiff sustained one or both types of injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">The notice of claim was sufficient to allow the defendant to investigate the claim of repetitive injury in a timely manner. A repetitive trauma, by definition, necessarily occurs over a period of time. See <em>Quinn </em>v. <em>Knapp, </em>12 Conn. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rev. Op. 334 (1994). The review board has consistently held that where a notice of claim alleges a repetitive trauma, the lack of a precise date of injury is not fatal to a notice of claim. See id., 336.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">The notice was also sufficient to enable the defendant to investigate the plaintiffs allegation that he incurred a traumatic injury on or before July 19, 1989. Unlike those cases in which a plaintiff alleges an inaccurate date of accidental injury; see, e.g., <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Bonhotel, </em>13 Conn. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rev. Op. 234 (1995); <em>Pickard </em>v. <em>Manchester Gardens Condominium Assn., Inc., </em>10 Conn. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rev. Op. 216 (1992); in this case, the defendant does not claim that the date in the notice is inaccurate.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Rather, it asserts that the notice of claim was insufficient because it was \u201cimpossible ... to focus its investigation on any particular time.\u201d We are unpersuaded by the defendant\u2019s assertion. If the results of the defendant\u2019s investigation did not reveal an accidental injury on the precise date given in the notice, or in the several days prior thereto, the defendant reasonably could have disclaimed liability for the traumatic injury.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">We conclude that the date in the notice of claim was sufficient to enable the defendant to make a timely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>investigation in order to determine whether to contest liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">The defendant next asserts that the denial of the plaintiffs motion to preclude was proper because he is not a bona fide plaintiff. The merits of his case have been adjudicated and his case was dismissed. As such, the defendant asserts, \u201che should not be entitled to utilize the preclusion statute to validate his meritless claim.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">The defendant cites no cases, and our research reveals none, where a subsequent finding on the merits was used to justify a denial of a motion to preclude. In making the determination of whether a motion to preclude should have been granted, we inquire into the sufficiency of the employee\u2019s notice of claim and the timeliness and sufficiency of the employer\u2019s notice contesting liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">The defendant imports a mistaken notion into the language of <em>Menzies </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>supra, 165 Conn. 343, in which our Supreme Court explained that one of the purposes of \u00a7 31-297 (b) was to \u201cdiscourage arbitrary refusal of bona fide claims . . . .\u201d The requirement in the statute that a contesting employer state \u201cthe specific grounds on which the right to compensation is contested\u201d serves that purpose. General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 31-297 (b). The statute in no way authorizes a retrospective review of the merits of the claim in order to address the question of preclusion. If we were to adopt the defendant\u2019s contention, the twenty day rale of \u00a7 31-297 (b) would be meaningless. A notice contesting liability would not be precluded, even if late, because the defendant would have a chance to contest the claim. If the defendant were to prevail, the claim, in hindsight, would not be considered bona fide. If the plaintiff were to prevail, the defendant would have had the opportu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>nity fully to contest the claim, in contravention of the clear intent of the preclusion statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Finally, the defendant asserts that the plaintiff failed to provide sufficient evidence to support his claim that his notice of claim satisfied the <em>Pereira </em>standard. This claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">The determination of whether the notice of claim in this case \u201cis sufficient to allow the employer to make a timely investigation of the claim\u201d is a question of law, not of fact. <em>Pereira </em>v. State, supra, 228 Conn. 542-43 n.8. In making this determination, we look within the four comers of the notice of claim. The plaintiff was not required to offer any evidence in support of his assertion that the notice of claim was sufficient to trigger his employer\u2019s obligation to respond pursuant to \u00a7 31-297 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">The decision of the review board is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to sustain the plaintiffs appeal and to remand the matter to the commissioner with direction to grant the plaintiffs motion to preclude.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b528-13\"> At the time of the defendant\u2019s injury, General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 31-297 (b) provided in relevant part: \u201cWhenever liability to pay compensation is contested by the employer, he shall file with the compensation commissioner, on or before the twentieth day after he has received a written notice of claim, a notice in accord with a form prescribed by the commissioners stating that the right to compensation is contested, the name of the claimant, the name of the employer, the date of the alleged injury . . . and the specific grounds on which the right to compensation is contested, and a copy thereof shall be sent to the employee. <em>If the employer or his legal representative fails to file the notice contesting liability within the time prescribed herein, the employer shall be conclusively presumed to have accepted the compensability of such alleged injury or death and shall have no right thereafter to </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number><em>contest the employee\u2019s right to receive compensation on any grounds </em>. . . (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b529-6\"> After a hearing on the merits, the trial commissioner dismissed the claim after concluding that the plaintiff had failed to establish his alleged injuries with sufficient, credible evidence. On appeal, the plaintiff does not challenge the dismissal of his claim; rather, he challenges only the denial of his motion to preclude.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b529-7\"> Although the defendant did not file a preliminary statement of issues stating these claims as alternative grounds of affirmance; see Practice Book \u00a7 4013; we may still consider them as such. The plaintiff had the opportunity to address these claims in a reply brief, but chose not to do so. See <em>In re </em>Jennifer, 29 Conn. App. 689, 692, 617 A.2d 921 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b530-8\"> The plaintiff appealed that denial to the review board. After the review board affirmed the commissioner's decision, the plaintiff appealed to this court. On May 11, 1993, this court dismissed the plaintiffs appeal for lack of a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">After this court\u2019s dismissal, the merits of the plaintiffs claim was heard by the workers\u2019 compensation commission. The commission dismissed his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>claim. The plaintiff appealed that decision to the review board, which affirmed the dismissal. This appeal followed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b531-10\"> The first time the review board addressed the plaintiffs preclusion claim, it applied this rule of strict compliance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b532-8\"> In <em>Pereira, </em>our Supreme Court indicated that where a plaintiff addressed a notice of claim to \u201cDept, of Children &amp; Youth Services,\u201d instead of using its proper name, \u201cState of Connecticut, Department of Children and Youth Services,\u201d the notice was sufficient to trigger the employer\u2019s obligation to respond pursuant to \u00a7 31-297 (b). Similarly, in this case, the plaintiffs failure to address the notice to \u201cState of Connecticut, Department of Motor Vehicles\u201d in no way hindered the defendant\u2019s ability to investigate the claim or caused it prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b532-9\"> At the time of the plaintiffs injury, General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 31-294 provided in relevant part: \u201cAny employee who has sustained an ipjury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>in the course of his employment shall forthwith notify his employer, or some person representing his employer, of such injury; and, on his failure to give such notice, the commissioner may reduce the award of compensation proportionately to any prejudice which he finds the employer has sustained by reason of such failure ....
