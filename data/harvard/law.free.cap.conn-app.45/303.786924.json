On December 22,1994, the defendant, a protective service trainee at the department of mental health and addiction services of the state of Connecticut, while operating his vehicle on Route 85 in Waterford, observed an automobile occupied by the victims, make an illegal left turn, which forced the defendant to bring his vehicle to a sudden stop. No collision occurred. The defendant then chased the victims onto 1-95 and attempted to stop them by signaling to them to pull over, pointing and blowing his hom. When the victims refused to stop, the defendant leaned toward the passenger window of his vehicle and displayed a black badge case bearing the insignia \u201cConnecticut State Police.\u201d The defendant opened the badge case and displayed a badge. The victims stopped their automobile, and the defendant pulled his private vehicle in front of the victims\u2019 automobile and approached the passenger side. The defendant again opened the badge case and displayed a silver badge. He said, \u201cConnecticut state police. Do you realize that you made an illegal left-hand turn?\u201d He also asked to see a license, registration and insurance card. The defendant is not a member of the Connecticut state police, nor did he have the power of arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">The defendant has not properly preserved this claim for appellate review. He neither filed a request to charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>nor took an exception to the trial court\u2019s charge as given. Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 852, 4061.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant does not seek review under <em>Golding</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>or under the plain error doctrine. He concedes that this issue is not a constitutional claim and does not deal with insufficiency of the evidence. He also admits that the trial court\u2019s instructions on the elements of the crime charged were sufficient under the law. We, therefore, conclude that the defendant\u2019s claim is not reviewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b332-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-130 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of criminal impersonation when he . . .
