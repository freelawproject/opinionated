We agree with the defendant\u2019s claim regarding the necessity for instructions on the lesser included offenses. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment on the assault charge and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">The jury could have reasonably found the following facts. The victim, Michael Juarbe, and the defendant\u2019s wife, Carmen Rodriguez, had a five year relationship that ended in January, 1991. The defendant\u2019s wife had one daughter from this relationship with the victim. The victim had visitation rights with this daughter. In the summer of 1991, the defendant married Rodriguez. The defendant and the victim had several confrontations leading up to April, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">On April 7, 1992, the defendant drove to the victim\u2019s New Haven apartment at approximately 10 p.m. Upon arriving at the victim\u2019s apartment, the defendant rang the doorbell located at the back door of the victim\u2019s premises. When the victim looked out his window, the defendant yelled to him to come out of the house to talk. The victim dressed and went to the front lawn of the apartment where he found the defendant standing on the sidewalk. The victim noticed that the defendant\u2019s car was parked in front of the premises and two men were sitting inside the vehicle. The victim and the defendant began to argue about the victim\u2019s visitation rights with his daughter and about telephone calls that were made by the victim to the defendant\u2019s home. The defendant eventually sat in the front passenger seat of his car. From that location, the defendant pulled a loaded revolver from under the car\u2019s seat and fired approximately five shots at the victim from a distance of six to nine feet. The victim was struck by four of the bullets and sustained serious injuries. After shooting the victim, the defendant and his two companions drove away in the defendant\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly refused to instruct the jury on the lesser included offenses of assault in the second degree, assault in the second degree with a firearm and assault in the third degree. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">\u201cA defendant is entitled to an instruction on a lesser offense if, and only if, the following conditions are met: (1) an appropriate instruction is requested by either the state or the defendant; (2) it is not possible to commit the greater offense, in the manner described in the information or bill of particulars, without having first committed the lesser; (3) there is some evidence, introduced by either the state or the defendant, or by a combination of their proofs, which justifies conviction of the lesser offense; and (4) the proof on the element or elements which differentiate the lesser offense from the offense charged is sufficiently in dispute to permit the jury consistently to find the defendant innocent of the greater offense but guilty of the lesser.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>179 Conn. 576, 588, 427 A.2d 414 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">\u201cIn considering whether the defendant has satisfied the requirements set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>supra, [179 Conn. 588], we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant\u2019s request for a charge on the lesser included offense. . . . [T]he jury\u2019s role as fact-finder is so central to our jurisprudence that, in close cases, the trial court should generally opt in favor of giving an instruction on a lesser included offense, if it is requested. . . . Otherwise the defendant would lose the right to have the jury pass upon every factual issue fairly presented by the evidence.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ray, </em>228 Conn. 147, 154, 635 A.2d 777 (1993). \u201cIf we cannot exclude, as a matter of law, the possibility that the defendant is guilty only of the lesser offense, we must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>conclude that the <em>trial </em>court\u2019s failure to give the requested instruction is improper. Id., 155; <em>State </em>v. <em>Falby, </em>187 Conn. 6, 30, 444 A.2d 213 (1982).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Huckabee, </em>41 Conn. App. 565, 568, 677 A.2d 452, cert. denied, 239 Conn. 903, 682 A.2d 1009 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The defendant claims that, under <em>Whistnant, </em>he was entitled to a lesser included offense charge with respect to five of the lesser degrees of assault. The state concedes that the first prong of <em>Whistnant </em>is met.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The state argues, however, that the third and fourth prongs of <em>Whistnant </em>are not satisfied by the facts of this case. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">The second prong of <em>Whistnant </em>requires that \u201cit [cannot be] possible to commit the greater offense, in the manner described in the information or bill of particulars, without having first committed the lesser . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>supra, 179 Conn. 588. In the present case, the defendant was charged in an information that \u201cwith the intent to cause serious physical injury to another person, he caused such injury to such person by means of a deadly weapon.\u201d At trial, the defendant requested a charge on the following lesser included offenses: assault in the second degree in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (2) or (3),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> assault in the second degree with a firearm in violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-60a,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and assault in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61 (a) (3).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">The elements of the lesser included offenses on which instructions had been requested were included in the elements of the greater offense charged. The requisite mental states of the requested lesser offenses are subsumed in the mens rea that was stated in the information charging the defendant. The intent to cause \u201cphysical injury,\u201d as required by \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (2), is clearly included in intent to cause \u201cserious physical injury,\u201d as set forth in the information. The remaining requested lesser offenses all require either a \u201creckless or negligent\u201d mental state. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>180 Conn. 382, 407, 429 A.2d 919 (1980), our Supreme Court held \u201can offense that would be a lesser included offense but for its requirement of a less culpable state of mind than that required for the greater, will be deemed a lesser included offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">The injury required by the requested lesser offenses is also subsumed under the \u201cserious physical injury\u201d that is described in the defendant\u2019s information. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (3) and (4).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In addition, the defendant\u2019s information states that the serious physical injury was caused by a dangerous weapon, which by statute includes a firearm. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-3 (6)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and 53a-3 (19).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Therefore, the requested lesser offense of assault in the second degree with a firearm, pursuant to \u00a7 53a-60a, would be included in the elements of the greater offense that was charged.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">In sum, all of the lesser offenses on which instructions were sought met the second prong of <em>Whistnant. </em>Furthermore, there is support in Connecticut law for the determination that several of the requested offenses can be lesser included offenses of assault in the first degree. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Huckabee, </em>supra, 41 Conn. App. 572 (holding that trial court erroneously failed to instruct jury on lesser included offenses of assault in first degree, which included assault in second degree pursuant to \u00a7 53a-60 [a] and assault in third degree pursuant to \u00a7 53a-61 [a]); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bunker, </em>27 Conn. App. 322, 329, 606 A.2d 30 (1992) (trial court correctly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>instructed jury on lesser included offenses of assault in first degree, which included assault in second degree, pursuant to \u00a7 53a-60 [a] and assault in third degree pursuant to \u00a7 53a-61 [a]).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">The third prong of <em>Whistnant </em>is satisfied when \u201cthere is some evidence, introduced by either the state or the defendant, or by a combination of their proofs, that justifies conviction of the lesser offense . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>supra, 179 Conn. 588. In the present case, there was ample evidence adduced at trial justifying the conviction of the defendant of the lesser offenses. There clearly was evidence that the victim sustained serious physical injuries, and these injuries were caused with a deadly weapon, specifically a firearm. Therefore, there was sufficient evidence, concerning the victim\u2019s injury and the weapon used by the defendant, to justify a conviction as to those elements of the lesser requested offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">The main differentiating element between first degree assault and the lesser offenses is the mental state that is required for the commission of the crime. Intent is \u201coften the most significant and, at the same time, the most elusive element of the crime charged.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>supra, 180 Conn. 404. At trial, the defendant testified that he fired the gun at the ground between his car and the victim to scare him away, believing that the victim was holding a gun. The defendant also testified that he fired the gun out of the car window while seated, and did not look where he fired. The location of the victim\u2019s wounds also support the defendant\u2019s contention that he fired downward to scare the victim. The victim testified that he was struck in the chest by a bullet as he lay on the ground, and his other wounds were in his leg and abdomen. In addition, there was testimony from police officers that they found bullets in the street that had been flattened as if they had been shot downward at the pavement. The sum of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>testimony supports the defendant\u2019s contention that he had fired the shots toward the ground to scare the victim, thereby providing some evidence of a potentially less culpable mental state, including either recklessness or negligence. Therefore, we conclude that the third prong of <em>Whistnant </em>is met.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">The fourth prong of <em>Whistnant </em>requires that \u201cproof on the element or elements which differentiate the lesser offense from the offense charged is sufficiently in dispute to permit the jury consistently to find the defendant innocent of the greater offense but guilty of the lesser.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>supra, 179 Conn. 588. \u201cThis could occur either through the right of cross-examination, the major function of which is to put certain matters in dispute, or through evidence presented as part of the defendant\u2019s case.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Fernandez, </em>5 Conn. App. 40, 47-48, 496 A.2d 533 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">The key differentiating element in the present case is the defendant\u2019s mental state. The state conceded this point in its closing argument, stating that \u201cthe other main issue, as far as the state is concerned is, what was [the defendant\u2019s] intent that night? Was he intending to kill [the victim]? Was he intending to cause him serious physical injury?\u201d Furthermore, the defendant specifically disputed the mental state of which he was accused when he testified that he did not intend to kill or to injure the victim seriously, but was acting in self-defense. We conclude, therefore, that the differentiating element between the greater and lesser offenses was sufficiently in dispute to meet the fourth prong of <em>Whistnant.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">\u201cOn appeal, an appellate court must reverse a trial court\u2019s failure to give the requested instruction if \u2018we cannot as a matter of law exclude [the] possibility\u2019 that the defendant is guilty only of the lesser offense. <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>v. <em>Falby, </em>[supra, 187 Conn. 30].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ray, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 155. Having found that the defendant met all four prongs of <em>Whistnant, </em>we reverse the ruling of the trial court and remand this case for a new trial. While this issue is dispositive, we will nevertheless review the defendant\u2019s remaining claims so that we may presently address any issues that the defendant may raise in a future appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is that the trial court improperly refused to instruct the jury concerning a theory of imperfect self-defense. At trial, the defendant requested that the trial court give an instruction concerning imperfect self-defense with respect to assault in the first degree. The defendant contends that there was conflicting evidence on the issue of whether the victim possessed a gun and was accompanied by another. Therefore, the defendant argues that first degree assault could be reduced to assault in the second degree or assault in the second degree with a firearm, if the jury found that the defendant mistakenly believed that he was acting in self-defense, so that the shooting was a result of recklessness. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">The defense of imperfect self-defense is not recognized in Connecticut.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Maryland and California, however, have extensively used this doctrine. The California Supreme Court recently held: \u201cUnder the doctrine of imperfect self-defense, when the trier of fact finds that a defendant killed another person because the defendant actually, but unreasonably, believed he was in imminent danger of death or great bodily injury, the defendant is deemed to have acted without malice and thus can be convicted of no crime greater than voluntary man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>slaughter.\u201d <em>In re Christian S., </em>7 Cal. 4th 768, 771, 872 P.2d 574, 30 Cal. Rptr. 2d 33 (1994). In Maryland, the Court of Appeals explained that the doctrine of imperfect self-defense, like that of hot-blooded response to adequate provocation, does not serve to exonerate a defendant \u201c \u2018but mitigates murder to voluntary manslaughter.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Faulkner, </em>301 Md. 482, 486, 483 A.2d 759 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">While these jurisdictions do recognize the doctrine of imperfect self-defense, their definition of the offense of murder is different from that of Connecticut. California Penal Code \u00a7 187 (a) (Deering 1985) provides: \u201cMurder is the unlawful killing of a human being, or a fetus, <em>with </em>malice aforethought.\u201d (Emphasis added.) By contrast, California Penal Code \u00a7 192 (Deering 1985) provides: \u201cManslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human being <em>without </em>malice. ...\u201d (Emphasis added.) \u201cThe vice is the element of malice; in its absence the level of guilt must decline. The doctrine of imperfect self-defense and diminished capacity arose from this principle.\u201d <em>In re Christian S., </em>supra, 7 Cal. 4th 773.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">In Maryland, the Court of Appeals stated: \u201c \u2018[Imperfect self-defense] operates to negate malice, an element the State must prove to establish murder. As a result, the successful invocation of this doctrine does not completely exonerate the defendant, but mitigates murder to voluntary manslaughter.\u2019 \u201d <em>Richmond v. State, </em>330 Md. 223, 227, 623 A.2d 630 (1993). \u201cIn the context of murder cases, this Court has said that malice means the presence of the required malevolent state of mind coupled with the absence of legally adequate justification, excuse, or circumstances of mitigation. <em>Ross v. State, </em>308 Md. 337, 340 n.1, 519 A.2d 735 (1987).\u201d <em>Richmond v. State, </em>supra, 231.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a et seq., however, our applicable murder statute requires the act of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>causing death coupled with an \u201cintent to cause the death of another person.\u201d Therefore, the Connecticut murder statute, which requires intent and an act, is somewhat different from the malice type of murder statutes, thereby making the doctrine of imperfect self-defense somewhat inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">It should also be noted that in these jurisdictions the doctrine of an imperfect self-defense applies only to murder and its \u201cshadow\u201d offenses, which may include attempted murder. See W. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law (2d Ed. 1986) \u00a7 7.11, p. 272. Yet, in Maryland it is uncertain how far this doctrine can be stretched from the offense of murder. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Faulkner, </em>supra, 301 Md. 504, the Maryland Appellate Court stated: \u201cLogically, because the statutory offense [assault with intent to murder] is defined in terms of murder, all the defenses available in a murder prosecution are applicable in an assault with intent to murder prosecution.\u201d While the <em>Faulkner </em>decision held that the mitigation defense of imperfect self-defense applies to the statutory crime of assault with intent to murder, that same court later held that this was a \u201cgenerous expansion of the law of self-defense . . . .\u201d <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>State, </em>328 Md. 95, 106 n.3, 613 A.2d 379 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">The majority view is that imperfect self-defense applies to murder and homicide charges. We hold that it does not apply to assault charges, and that the instructions on the lesser included offenses achieve the same result for the defendant.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">The defendant\u2019s third claim is that the trial court improperly precluded the defendant from offering four of the victim\u2019s previous criminal convictions to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>his violent character, as it pertained to the defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense. At trial, the defendant made an offer of proof outside the presence of the jury in which he attempted to introduce evidence that the victim had been previously convicted of five misdemeanor offenses.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The trial court only admitted the victim\u2019s March, 1991 conviction for assaulting the defendant. The trial court, however, excluded the victim\u2019s four other misdemeanor convictions, ruling they were too dissimilar in nature to the aggression alleged in the present case. We agree with the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">\u201c \u2018The trial court\u2019s ruling on evidentiary matters will be overturned only upon a showing of a clear abuse of discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>236 Conn. 514, 549, 673 A.2d 1117 (1996). \u201c \u2018The trial court also has broad discretion in balancing the probative value of proffered evidence against its prejudicial effect. That discretion is subject to reversal only where an abuse of discretion is manifest or where an injustice appears to have been done.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Weber, </em>31 Conn. App. 58, 65, 623 A.2d 506, cert. denied, 226 Conn. 908, 625 A.2d 1379 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">The defendant relies on <em>State </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>176 Conn. 107, 405 A.2d 622 (1978), for the proposition that because the convictions involve crimes of violence they are therefore relevant on the issue of initial aggression in relation to his claim of self-defense. While <em>Miranda </em>may stand for the general rule that evidence of a victim\u2019s prior convictions for violent crimes may be introduced as proof on the issue of initial aggression; id., 114; the defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Miranda </em>is misplaced. In <em>Miranda, </em>our Supreme Court warned that a defendant is not \u201cauthorized to introduce any and all convictions of crimes involving violence, no matter how petty, how <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>remote in time, or how dissimilar in their nature to the facts of the alleged aggression. In each case the probative value of the evidence of certain convictions rests in the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d Id., 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Given the dissimilar nature of the victim\u2019s four excluded convictions from the facts of the alleged aggression in this case, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">The defendant\u2019s fourth claim is that the trial court improperly failed to give a curative instruction directed toward the allegedly improper comments made by the state\u2019s attorney. The defendant claims that the prosecutor, during his closing argument, improperly characterized portions of the defendant\u2019s testimony as \u201cludicrous\u201d and \u201cunbelievable.\u201d The defendant also objected to the prosecutor\u2019s arguing to the jury that they should ignore evidence of the victim\u2019s past disputes with the defendant. The defendant contends that the comments made by the state and the lack of a curative instruction by the trial court amounted to a violation of the defendant\u2019s right to due process. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">\u201cIn determining whether a prosecutor\u2019s conduct was so egregious as to deny a defendant a fair trial, we note that some leeway must be afforded to the advocates in offering arguments to the jury in final argument. [I]n addressing the jury, [cjounsel must be allowed a generous latitude in argument, as the limits of legitimate argument and fair comment cannot be determined precisely by rule and line, and something must be allowed for the zeal of counsel in the heat of argument. . . . [W]e must review the comments complained of in the context of the entire trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Villanueva, </em>44 Conn. App. 457, 461-62, 689 A.2d 1141 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">\u201cIn determining whether prosecutorial misconduct was so serious as to amount to a denial of due process, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>this court, in conformity with courts in other jurisdictions, has focused on several factors. Among them are the extent to which the misconduct was invited by defense conduct or argument . . . the severity of the misconduct . . . the frequency of the misconduct . . . the centrality of the misconduct to the critical issues in the case . . . the strength of the curative measures adopted . . . and the strength of the state\u2019s case.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Williams, 204 Conn. 523, 540, 529 A.2d 653 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">After reviewing the record as a whole, we conclude that the conduct of the state\u2019s attorney was not so egregious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">The judgment is reversed only as to the conviction of assault in the first degree and the case is remanded for a new trial on that charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b621-4\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of assault in the first degree when: (1) With intent to cause serious physical injury to another person, he causes such injury to such person or to a third person by means of a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b621-5\"><em> </em>General Statutes \u00a7 29-35 provides in relevant part: \u201cCarrying of pistol or revolver without permit prohibited.

The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to the carrying of any pistol or revolver by any sheriff, parole officer or peace officer of this state, or sheriff, parole officer or peace officer of any other state while engaged in the pursuit of his official duties, or federal marshal or federal law enforcement agent, or to any member of the armed forces of the United States, as defined by section 27-103, or of this state, as defined by section 27-2, when on duty or going to or from duty, or to any member of any military organization when on parade or when going to or from any place of assembly, or to the transportation of pistols or revolvers as merchandise, or to any person carrying any pistol or revolver while contained in the package in which it was originally wrapped at the time of sale and while carrying the same from the place of sale to the purchaser\u2019s residence or place of business, or to any person removing his household goods or effects from one place to another, or to any person while carrying any such pistol or revolver from his place of residence or business to a place or person where or by whom such pistol or revolver is to be repaired or while returning to his place of residence or business after the same has been repaired, or to any person carrying a pistol or revolver in or through the state for the purpose of taking part in competitions or attending any meeting or exhibition of an organized collectors\u2019 group if such person is a bona fide resident of the United St ates having a permit or license to cany any firearm issued by the authority of any other state or subdivision of the United States, or to any person carrying a pistol or revolver to and from a testing range at the request of the issuing authority, or to any person carrying an antique pistol or revolver, as defined in section 29-33. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b624-8\"> The state concedes that the defendant satisfies the second prong of <em>Whistnant </em>with respect to all of the requested lesser offenses except assault in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (2). We, however, will analyze the second prong of <em>Whistnant </em>as it pertains to all five requested lesser offenses because we feel the analysis will be more effective if done as a whole.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b624-9\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 53a-60 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of assault in the second degree when: (1) With intent to cause serious physical injury to another person, he causes such injury to such person or to a third person; or (2) with intent to cause physical iqjury to another person, he causes such injury to such person or to a third person by means of a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument; or (3) he recklessly causes serious physical injury to another person by means of a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b625-8\"> Section 53a-60a requires either an intentional or reckless mental state, thereby constituting two lesser offenses for the purposes of this type of analysis.

The state\u2019s argument must fail, however, because this statute was amended in 1994 by Public Acts 1994, No. 94-2, \u00a7 5, to exclude injuries from the discharge of a firearm. When the shooting took place in 1992, General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (2) did not exclude the use of a firearm.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b629-9\"> There are, however, several states that do recognize this doctrine, including: Maryland, California, New Jersey, Idaho, Illinois, New Mexico, and North Carolina.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b631-10\"> We do not determine whether it is appropriate to apply the doctrine of imperfect self-defense to other offenses in our penal statutes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b632-8\"> The defendant unsuccessfully attempted to introduce evidence of four prior misdemeanor convictions of the victim.
