We affirm the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. While the defendant was incarcerated, he wrote letters to the Superior Court judge who had sentenced him. In his brief, the defendant concedes that \u201cit is fair to characterize [those letters] as vile and derogatory, threatening harm to the judge and his family, with antiSemitic and Nazi overtones.\u201d The trial court properly cautioned the jury that evidence ofthe defendant\u2019s prior convictions was not introduced to show a propensity to commit crimes, but only to establish an element of the crime of harassment in the first degree.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>The defendant had previously been convicted of murder, a class A felony, and two counts of attempted murder, class B felonies, and sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not less than twenty-five years to life.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defense counsel attempted to prevent the jury from learning that his client was serving a sentence for murder and attempted murder by seeking bifurcation to prevent the state from establishing the defendant\u2019s prior convictions until the other elements of the crime of harassment were proven. The defendant asserted in the motion that the jury would be unduly prejudiced against him if evidence of the convictions was introduced before the jury first determined whether the defendant was guilty of harassment. The defendant emphasized that the striking similarity between the words \u201ckill\u201d and \u201cphysically injure\u201d in \u00a7 53a-182b and the offenses of murder and assault in the first degree was particularly prejudicial. The trial court denied the motion to bifurcate, and the defendant argues that the denial deprived him of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Our Supreme Court and this court have both discussed the problem inherent in a prosecution for a crime that makes proof of a prior conviction an element of the crime being prosecuted. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>234 Conn. 324, 662 A.2d 1199 (1995); <em>State </em>v. <em>Joyce, 45 </em>Conn. App. 390, 696 A.2d 993 (1997); <em>State </em>v. <em>Banta, </em>15 Conn. App. 161, 554 A.2d 1226, cert. denied, 209 Conn. 815, 550 A.2d 1086 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">The state introduced evidence that the defendant was serving twenty-five years to life for felony convictions. The state did not, however, introduce evidence of the specific nature of the felony convictions. The previous sentencing judge testified only in terms of sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>the defendant for a class A and two class B felonies. The words \u201cmurder\u201d and \u201cattempted murder\u201d were never used by any state\u2019s witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">While testifying on his own behalf at trial, and when no question was pending, the defendant volunteered that he was convicted of murder and rebuked the state\u2019s attorney for not bringing that fact to the jury\u2019s attention.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Even if we assume, arguendo, that the trial court\u2019s ruling on the bifurcation motion was improper, the defendant\u2019s voluntary announcement of his murder conviction rendered any error harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">It is fundamental that it is not reversible error where evidence that comes into a case through an erroneous ruling is later introduced through another source. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Pannone, </em>9 Conn. App. 111, 120, 516 A.2d 1359 (1986), cert. denied, 202 Conn. 804, 519 A.2d 1208 (1987) , the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s request that the correction officers accompanying him in the courtroom wear plain clothes to prevent the jury from learning that he was incarcerated. In <em>Pannone, </em>the defendant argued that the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion deprived him of a fair trial because the jury would infer from the uniformed guards that the defendant was presently incarcerated. In <em>Pannone, </em>\u201cthe defendant himself took the stand and admitted that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>had been convicted during the year before the trial of a crime carrying a penalty of more than one year of imprisonment. This admission had the effect of nullifying any prejudicial influence the court\u2019s action might have engendered. . . . Thus, even if we found error in the corut\u2019s refusal of the defendant\u2019s request, the error would be rendered harmless by his admission at trial that he had been convicted of a crime requiring imprisonment.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\"><em>Instate </em>v. <em>Yates, </em>174 Conn. 16, 19, 381 A.2d 536 (1977), the trial corut required defense witnesses to testify while dressed in prison attire.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant objected on the grounds that the witnesses\u2019 credibility would be diminished in front of the jury. The trial court agreed that \u201c[i]n the minds of the jurors the credibility of such witnesses can be affected in the same manner as the presumption of innocence can be diminished by the defendant\u2019s appearance in prison garb.\u201d Id. The Supreme Court held, however, that \u201cwhatever prejudice may have been caused by the witnesses\u2019 attire was nullified by the fact that the witnesses themselves testified to their prior felony convictions .... The error viewed in the context of that testimony, therefore, cannot be said to be prejudicial or to have deprived the defendant of a fair trial.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">Here, the defendant\u2019s admission that he was presently incarcerated for murder had the effect of nullifying any prejudicial influence that the court\u2019s denial of the motion to bifurcate might have engendered. Accordingly, it would be a futile exercise for this court to perform an analysis of the defendant\u2019s claim that the denial of his motion to bifurcate was improper. We, therefore, decline to review it.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b437-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-182b (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of harassment in the first degree when, with the intent to harass, annoy, alarm or terrorize another person, he threatens to kill or physically injure that person or any other person, and communicates such threat by telephone, or by telegraph, mail computer network, as defined in section 53a-250, or any other form of written communication, in a manner likely to cause annoyance or alarm <em>and has been convicted of </em>. . . <em>a class A felony [or] a class B felony . . . </em>.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b437-11\"> The trial court instructed the jury as follows: \u201c[T]he state has offered evidence that the defendant, Mr. Banks here, has previously been convicted of crimes. As a general rule, evidence of other crimes is not admissible to prove a defendant, guilty of the crimes with which he is now charged. If you find that the defendant has previously been convicted of crimes you must not, consider that as evidence of bad character or a tendency to commit criminal acts. Evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior conviction has been offered only for the puipose of establishing an element of the crimes with which he is presently charged, for the purpose of identification of the defendant with the crimes presently charged and for the purpose of showing a motive on the part, of the defendant to commit the crimes presently charged. If you find from the evidence that the defendant has previously been convicted of crimes, I emphasize that you may consider such evidence of convictions only lor those specific purposes that I just mentioned and not as evidence of bad character or propensity to commit criminal conduct.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b438-8\"> The defendant concedes that the class B felony was attempted murder despite indication in part of the record that the convictions may have been for assault in the first degree. Because both crimes are class B felonies, the difference is of no significance in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b439-10\"> \u201c[State\u2019s Attorney]: And presumably you thought that it would upset him because if the letters didn\u2019t upset him he wouldn\u2019t do anything about them, isn\u2019t that right?</p>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">\u201c[The Defendant,]: Yeah, because judges are hot shit. You\u2019re not supposed to threaten them.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-12\">\u201c[State\u2019s Attorney]: And now\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b439-13\">\u201c[The Defendant]: <em>And the twenty-five to life is murder, by the way, how come you don\u2019t come into that?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-14\">\u201c[State\u2019s Attorney]: The twenty-five to life is for murder?</p>\n<p id=\"b439-15\">\u201c [The Defendant]: You keep on saying that twenty-five to life and <em>I thought that the jury has to hear tha,t it is for murder.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-16\">\u201c[State\u2019s Attorney]: Well, now that you have told them they know.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-17\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Yeah.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b440-11\"> This was prior to the adoption of Practice Book \u00a7 967 which prohibits requiring witnesses to appear in court in distinctive prison clothing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
