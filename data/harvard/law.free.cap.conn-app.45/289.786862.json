The victim, a twenty year old man with pervasive developmental disorder, took guitar lessons from the defendant. In November, 1991, during a guitar lesson, the defendant threatened the victim with a kitchen knife and forced him to perform fellatio on the defendant. The defendant and the victim maintained a sexual relationship for the next year. In November, 1992, the victim told his mother about his sexual relationship with the defendant, explaining that it began with the November, 1991 knife incident. The victim\u2019s mother became angry, ended the guitar lessons and contacted the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The defendant was charged with three counts of sexual assault. In June, 1994, the defendant was tried before a jury. He was convicted of one count of sexual assault in the first degree and was acquitted of one count of sexual assault in the second degree and one count of sexual assault in the fourth degree. On September 30, 1994, the defendant was sentenced to serve a term of ten years, suspended after five years, with five years probation. This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly admitted evidence of his <em>post-Miranda </em>silence and allowed it to be used against him, in violation of <em>Doyle </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>v. <em>Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 96 S. Ct. 2240, 49 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1976). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Certain additional facts are necessary to an understanding of our resolution of this claim. On January 13, 1993, at the Westport police station, Detectives Anthony Giunta and Bruce Peterson interviewed the defendant. First, the detectives read the defendant a standard advisement of rights form. The defendant initialed each right, acknowledging that he had been advised of and fully understood each right. Two of the enumerated rights were the right to remain silent and the right to refuse to answer questions or to stop answering questions at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">Next, the detectives asked the defendant general background questions about where he lived and worked. Then, the detectives told the defendant about the victim\u2019s complaint and his accusations against the defendant. The defendant \u201cwrenched\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> his face, dropped his face into his hands and said that he did not want to talk about it, that he did not think it would be in his best interest to talk about the accusations. The defendant became silent. Soon thereafter, the detectives asked the defendant to leave. In response to a motion to suppress, the trial court held an extensive pretrial hearing and found that the defendant was not in custody while being questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">At trial, Giunta testified no less than eight different times as to the defendant\u2019s request not to talk about the accusations, and his subsequent silence. At one point, Giunta testified that, upon hearing the victim\u2019s knife allegation, the defendant said he did not want to talk about it, wrenched his face and brought his hands up to his face. The state\u2019s attorney asked, \u201cWhat did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>you observe that to be?\u201d Giunta responded, \u201cI took that as a form of guilt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Later, Giunta again testified that, upon hearing the accusations against him, the defendant wrenched his face, dropped his face into his hands, stated that he did not want to talk about the accusations and became silent. The state\u2019s attorney then asked Giunta twice, \u201cHe didn\u2019t come out and say that\u2019s not true?\u201d Giunta replied that the defendant never denied the accusations, and, when pressed, the defendant stated that it would not be in his best interest to discuss the accusations.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> During closing argument, the state\u2019s attorney again equated the defendant\u2019s post <em>-Miranda </em>silence with guilt and consciousness of guilt.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">\u201cIn <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, 426 U.S. 619, the United States Supreme Court held that \u2018evidence of a defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>ant\u2019s . . . <em>post-Miranda </em>silence is constitutionally impermissible under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ricketts, </em>37 Conn. App. 749, 758-59, 659 A.2d 188, cert. denied, 234 Conn. 913, 660 A.2d 355, cert. denied, 516 U.S. 977, 116 S. Ct. 481, 133 L. Ed. 2d 409 (1995). \u201cThe court based its holding on two considerations: First, it noted that silence in the wake of <em>Miranda </em>warnings is \u2018insolubly ambiguous\u2019 and consequently of little probative value. Second and more important, it observed that \u2018while it is true that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings contain no express assurance that silence will carry no penalty, such assurance is implicit to any person who receives the warnings. In such circumstances, it would be fundamentally unfair and a deprivation of due process to allow the arrested person\u2019s silence to be used to impeach an explanation subsequently offered at trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Plourde, </em>208 Conn. 455, 465-66, 545 A.2d 1071, cert. denied, 488 U.S. 1034, 109 S. Ct. 847, 102 L. Ed. 2d 979 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">\u201cWith respect to <em>post-Miranda </em>warnings silence . . . silence does not mean only muteness; it includes the statement of a desire to remain silent, as well as of a desire to remain silent until an attorney has been consulted.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Daugaard, </em>231 Conn. 195, 219-20, 647 A.2d 342 (1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1099, 115 S. Ct. 770, 130 L. Ed. 2d 666 (1995). \u201cSuch evidence [of the defendant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>silence] may not be used to . . . imply guilt or to indicate a consciousness of guilt . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ricketts, </em>supra, 37 Conn. App. 759-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">\u201cThe unfairness of using a defendant\u2019s silence following <em>Miranda </em>warnings is not mitigated by the absence of custody. <em>Miranda </em>warnings inform a person of his right to remain silent and assure him, at least implicitly, that his silence will not be used against him. . . . <em>Doyle </em>bars the use against a criminal defendant of silence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>maintained after receipt of governmental assurances. . . . Custody is therefore not a prerequisite to a <em>Doyle </em>violation.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Plourde, </em>supra, 208 Conn. 467.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Here, the defendant was clearly given his <em>Miranda </em>rights. The state argues, however, that the defendant\u2019s speaking with the police casually after he was read his <em>Miranda </em>rights, but before the police informed him of the complaint against him, constituted a waiver of his right to remain silent, or an example of impermissible \u201cselective silence.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">\u201cWhile a defendant may invoke his right to remain silent at any time, even after he initially waived his right to remain silent, it does not necessarily follow that he may remain selectively silent. . . . [T]here must be some indication that the defendant has invoked the right to remain silent.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State v. Taft, </em>25 Conn. App. 149, 152-53, 593 A.2d 973, cert. denied, 220 Conn. 918, 597 A.2d 343 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">Here, the defendant spoke casually with the detectives after he was read his <em>Miranda </em>rights. As soon as he was informed of the complaints made against him, however, the defendant clearly invoked his right to remain silent and refused to speak to the detectives about the alleged crimes. Thus, we conclude that the defendant neither waived his right to remain silent, nor was selectively silent. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>201 Conn. 174, 185-86, 513 A.2d 1183 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Talton, </em>197 Conn. 280, 295, 497 A.2d 35 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Taft, </em>supra, 25 Conn. App. 152-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">We conclude, therefore, that the detective\u2019s testimony at trial, in conjunction with the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s closing argument, improperly used evidence of the defendant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>silence to imply the defendant\u2019s guilt and consciousness of guilt, and thus were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>\u201c \u2018fundamentally unfair and a deprivation of due process ....\u201d\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Plourde, </em>supra, 208 Conn. 468, quoting <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, 426 U.S. 618.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Having concluded that the trial court\u2019s admission of evidence of the defendant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>silence was improper, we next consider whether it was harmful. \u201cWhen an error is of constitutional dimension, the state has the burden of proving it harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Plourde, </em>supra, 208 Conn. 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">\u201cThe cases wherein the error has been found to be prejudicial disclose repetitive references to the defendant\u2019s silence, reemphasis of the fact on closing argument, and extensive, strongly-worded argument suggesting a connection between the defendant\u2019s silence and his guilt.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Daugaard, </em>supra, 231 Conn. 213. Here, evidence of the defendant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>silence was brought up repeatedly during the examination of Giunta and was then referred to during closing argument. The defendant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>silence was consistently equated with his guilt. Moreover, as the defendant did not testify at trial, there was a \u201creasonable possibility\u201d that the repeated use of evidence of the defendant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>silence as affirmative proof of his guilt and consciousness of guilt contributed to his conviction. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Plourde, </em>supra, 208 Conn. 469. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court\u2019s improper admission of the evidence of the defendant\u2019s post-<em>Miranda </em>silence was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and thus a new trial is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b318-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of sexual assault in the first degree when such person (1) compels another person to engage in sexual intercourse by the use of force against such other person or a third person, or by the threat of use of force against such other person or against a third person which reasonably causes such person to fear physical iiyury to such person or a third person . . . . \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b318-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-71 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of sexual assault in the second degree when such person engages in sexual intercourse with another person and ...
