The case was submitted ' to the Superior Court upon an agreed statement of facts, in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-9\">The attachment in the present action was made by trustee process on December 3, 187 9. At the time of the service of the writ upon the trustee, the city of Springfield, there was in its hands the sum of $91.67, due the principal defendant. On May 8,1880, the defendant gave a bond, with sureties, to dissolve the attachment, but the names of the sureties were not mentioned in the body of the bond. The condition of the bond was that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>the defendant should pay the amount recovered \u201c within thirty days after the final judgment, or after any special judgment therein entered in accordance with\u201d the St. of 1875, <em>c. </em>68, \u00a7 1.

Section one of the statute provides that, when any defendant who has dissolved an attachment is declared a bankrupt, the court may enter a special judgment, to enable the plaintiff to proceed against the sureties upon the bond given to dissolve the attachment. This defendant has not been declared a bankrupt. The statute refers to the bankrupt law of the United States, which was in force when the statute was enacted, and not to the state insolvent law, which became operative upon the repeal of the bankrupt law, after the enactment of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">The St. of 1880, <em>c. </em>246, \u00a7 8, amends the first section of the statute of 1875 by inserting the words \u201cor against whose estate a warrant in insolvency has already been or afterwards is issued.\u201d But this statute took effect after the bond was given, and cannot change its condition, which is to pay \u201c after any special judgment entered in accordance with\u201d the St. of 1875, <em>c. </em>68, \u00a7 1. <em>Order affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
