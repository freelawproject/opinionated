Sts. <em>e. </em>83, \u00a7 18. Trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Rockwell, </em>J., who reported the case for the determination of this court, in substance as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-10\">The plaintiff put in evidence the following license, dated October 19, 1874: \u201c The selectmen of the town of Swanzey have licensed, and do hereby.license, James R. Mitchell, of said Swanzey, to plant, grow and dig oysters in and upon the following described flats and channel situated in Coles River in said Swanzey for the term of twenty years, provided that said license shall not infringe or impair the private rights of any person, or materially obstruct the navigation of said Coles River, and is not located where there is a natural oyster-bed : Beginning at the southwest corner of Edmund Arnold\u2019s land on the west shore, and running south and southwesterly by the shore and channel of said Coles River on what is known <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>as the Parker Weaver farm about six rods, to what is called Stony Point.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-4\">The plaintiff also introduced evidence tending to show the taking of oysters in considerable quantities from what he claimed to be the tract intended to be described in the license, and the value of the same; he also testified that he staked out and showed to the defendant the flats which he claimed to be covered by his license. It appeared, on cross-examination of one of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, that Edmund Arnold\u2019s farm, referred to in the license, was on the east side of Coles River.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-5\">The defendant requested the judge to rule that the license was not sufficient on its face, as matter of law, for the plaintiff to maintain this action. The judge so ruled, and directed a verdict for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-6\">If the ruling was wrong, a new trial was to be granted; otherwise, the verdict to stand.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b318-7\"><em>H.

But this cannot appear by the mere reading of a paper which professes to define the tract by metes and bounds. It may be that, when all the facts appear, it will be obvious that the lines given describe no enclosure. The court cannot see where the southwest corner of Edmund Arnold\u2019s land is; nor can it see either the channel or the Parker Weaver farn\u00ed; nor whether the channel and the Parker Weaver farm are so situated in relation to each other that the language of the description must necessarily import two lines or one; nor whether Stony Point is of itself such a monument and extending such a length as, taken in connection with the other lines and monuments named, does define such a tract of land as may properly be granted by license to an individual, on which to plant oysters. From the reading of the license, it cannot be said that it does describe such a tract of land, nor can it be said that it does not. The case must therefore be sent for trial to a jury; and the evidence will then be such that perhaps the court can say that a tract is described by the evidence, or may say <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>that such tract is not described; or it may be a question of fact for the jury to decide, under proper instructions from the court, whether such a tract be or be not described.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">\n<em>New trial ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
