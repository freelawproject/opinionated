The plaintiff was the owner of two thirty-second parts and the defendant Brightman was the owner of thirteen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>sixty-fourth parts. The other,defendant, Clay, was not an owner. Clay was defaulted, and Brightman alone defended the action, and contended that, upon the foregoing facts, the plaintiff could not recover in this action in his own name.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-4\">The judge found for the plaintiff in the sum of $2250.51.

The agreement, having been made by all the owners jointly with one of their own number, cannot be enforced at law. <em>Eastman </em>v.
