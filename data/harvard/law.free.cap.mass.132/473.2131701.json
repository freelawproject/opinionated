His real estate consisted of an interest as tenant in common of an equity of redemption in a parcel of land. <em>Held, </em>on a petition by the executor for the instruction of the court as to the construction of the will, that the testator intended to give only one thousand dollars for the direct benefit of his son, and his wife took absolutely the rest of the personal estate; and that, under the petition, the court could not decide as to the real estate.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-8\">Petition to the Probate Court, by the executrix of the will of Lewis H.

B. Chase.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-4\">The petition alleged that the petitioner was the widow of the testator, and the respondent was his only child and heir at law; that the estate of the testator consisted of his interest in the firm of Chase and Company of Boston, being personal estate and amounting to $10,000, household furniture of the value of $800, and his interest as tenant in common of an equity of redemption in a parcel of land in Iowa, believed to be of no value over and above the mortgage; and that doubts had arisen as to the leggl effect of the second clause of the will; and prayed for the instruction of the court as to the construction of said clause and the disposition of the property named therein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-5\">The Probate Court determined that, under said clause, the petitioner took \u201c a fee in all the real estate and an absolute interest in the personal estate of said deceased remaining in her hands after the payment of the legacy mentioned in the first clause of said will, and after the payment of the debts of said deceased, funeral expenses and cost of administration.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-6\">The respondent appealed from this decree, assigning as reasons of appeal, that, by the true construction of said clause, the petitioner took \u201c only the use and income of said real and personal estate during her life, and that the remainder or reversion of both said real and personal estate is in this appellant upon the termination of said life estate.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-7\">Hearing before &lt;7.

There is no gift over. A partial intestacy is not favored. <em>Given </em>v. <em>Hilton, </em>95 U. S. 591. Pub. Sts. <em>c. </em>127, \u00a7 24.
