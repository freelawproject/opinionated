French, 4 East, 130. <em>Horneyer </em>v. <em>Lushington, </em>15 East, 46. <em>Graves </em>v. <em>Marine Ins. Co. </em>2 Caines, 339. <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Marine Ins. Co. </em>3 Johns. 307. <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Columbian Ins. Co. </em>11 Johns. 302. It has also been held that a policy on goods \u201c at and from Gottenburgh, .... beginning the adventure upon the said goods from the loading thereof on board,\u201d without specifying in terms that the loading is to be at Gottenburgh, is to receive the same construction, and will not attach upon goods loaded on board before the vessel arrived at Gottenburgh. <em>Spitta </em>v. <em>Woodman, 2 </em>Taunt. 416. <em>Langhorn </em>v. Hardy, 4 Taunt. 628. <em>Mellish </em>v. Allnutt, 2 M. &amp; S. 106. <em>Rickman </em>v. <em>Carstairs, </em>5 B. &amp; Ad. 651.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">On the other hand, it was held by Lord Ellenborough in <em>Gladstone </em>v. Clay, 1 M. &amp; S. 418, that a policy on goods \u201c at and from Pernambuco to Maranham, beginning the adventure upon the said goods from the loading thereof on board upon the said ship, wheresoever, &amp;c.,\u201d attached upon goods loaded on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>board before the vessel reached Pernambuco. And in this Commonwealth it has been settled that a policy on goods at and from \u00e1 certain port, without more, does not imply that the goods shall be loaded at that port. <em>Silloway </em>v. <em>Neptune Ins. Co. </em>12 Gray, 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">The plaintiff introduced evidence tending to show, as the bill of exceptions recites, that he \u201cnever saw or heard of the open policy of insurance; \u201d which, fairly understood, may be supposed to mean that he was not' aware of the particular provisions which it contained. There was no evidence tending to show that the parties came to any actual understanding or agreement together, as to where the cargo should be loaded, further than is to be inferred from the contents of the two papers themselves, which constituted the contract. It is not therefore to be assumed that it was any part of the oral agreement between the parties, that there should be a warranty that the potatoes should be loaded at Charlottetown or Georgetown. So far as the evidence goes, this assumption was negatived. For this reason, if it is essential to the construction relied on by the defendants that the blank should be filled by the insertion of the words \u201c Charlottetown or Georgetown,\u201d the defence must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">While it is true that even a court of law may at the trial correct a mistake in a written contract by supplying or changing words, yet this can only be done when the mistake is obvious, and the context furnishes with certainty the means of making the correction. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>23 L. J. (N. S.) Ch. 697. Numerous instances may be found where courts of law have exercised this power, but it has always been for the purpose of carrying out the plain intention of the parties. Thus promissory notes or bonds have been corrected, by supplying the word \u201c pounds,\u201d \u201c dollars,\u201d or \u201c hundred; \u201d and other similar changes have been made. <em>Coles </em>v. <em>Hulme, </em>8 B. &amp; C. 568. <em>Phipps </em>v. Tanner, 5 Car. &amp; P. 488. <em>Waugh </em>v. Bussell, 5 Taunt. 707. <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>Brotherson, </em>10 Wend. 93. <em>Sweetser </em>v. <em>French, </em>13 Met. 262, 265. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Tufts, </em>18 Pick. 455, 460. See also Leake Con. 225, 226, 327. In all such cases, the intention of the parties which is to be carried out must be their mutual intention. It is said that the strict rule of law is largely tempered by the doctrines and practice of the courts of equity. 2 Chit. Con. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>(11th. Am. ed.) 1028. Where a contract is contained in several papers, and one party is not even aware of the existence of the clause in which the omission occurs, and the other party is aware of the existence of the clause and of the unfilled blank therein, and leaves it in that condition apparently by design, it cannot fairly be considered that either party, it certainly cannot be considered that both parties, intended that the omitted words should be supplied before the execution of the contract, but through mistake neglected to have it done. On the evidence, there can be no pretence for saying that the plaintiff in this case had any actual intention that the words \u201c Charlottetown or Georgetown \u201d should be inserted in the clause in the open policy now under examination, or that he intended to warrant that the cargo should be loaded at either of those ports. Under such circumstances, neither a court of equity, upon a bill filed to reform the contract, nor a court of law with its more limited powers in this respect, would be justified in adding those words to the contract. An<em>drew </em>v. Spurr, 8 Allen, 412, 415, 416. <em>Sawyer </em>v. Hovey, 3 Allen, 331. 1 Story Eq. Jur. \u00a7\u00a7 155, 157.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">It remains to be considered whether the contract should receive the same construction in law, even without the filling of the blank, as if the words \u201c Charlottetown or Georgetown \u201d were supplied. It has been seen that certain policies providing that the adventure should begin \u201c from the loading of the goods on board the said vessel,\u201d without any words giving or calling for any further description of the place of loading, would be construed to mean from the loading at the port of departure, so that the legal signification would be the same as if those words were added. The court in one case said that they felt themselves obliged to give this construction ; obliged, that is, by the necessary meaning of the language used, and in the connection in which the words occurred. <em>Spitta </em>v. <em>Woodman, ubi supra. </em>In <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>French, </em>also, which did not turn upon the precise phraseology now under consideration, great stress was laid by Lord Ellenborough upon the fact that the words were incorporated with the body of the text of the printed words, and made to form therewith \u201c one entire and continued chain of words, and one unbroken sentence of intelligible expressions all applicable to the same subject matter.\u201d In the present case, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>form is quite peculiar. The risk primarily described in the open policy is, \u201c from Boston per railroad to Fall River, thence per Sound steamer to New York, and thence per Clyde\u2019s line to Wilmington.\u201d The goods to be insured are goods which are to be sent by a particular line. To this specially limited description is added a clause under which the present risk came, viz.: \u201c also to cover such other risks as may be approved by Higgins &amp; Cox, att\u2019ys, and indorsed hereon.\u201d Then follow the general printed provisions, which certainly must receive rather a violent construction to make them applicable to goods shipped at Boston by rail, to be transferred at Fall River to any steamer for New York, and then again transferred to any steamer of a certain line for Wilmington. In an open policy, designed to be used for covering a succession of risks of that description, partly by rail and partly by different and undesignated steamers, some of the risks beginning .at one place and some at another, it may well be taken for granted that the provision touching the beginning of the adventure would not be regarded as of great importance. It is not indeed apparent how the blank could well be filled in any particular case; or how, if once filled for one risk, the words could be changed by mere intendment for another risk. According to the view of the defendants, the clause must be a variable one, differing with each successive entry of a risk, and, by construction or intendment, the omission must be supplied by inserting whatever place may happen to be the port of departure for the voyage insured. But the policy also provides for insurance upon goods \u201c laden on board the good railroad; \u201d and it would be hardly profitable to express a conjecture as to what forms of risk would be covered by this policy on goods carried only'by rail from Boston to Fall River, or to develop the various inconsistencies which will be found to exist between the general printed form of the policy, designed to be applicable to a single marine risk, and the intentions of the different parties to the various risks which are to be engrafted upon it, by provisions specially applicable to each. It is obvious that in any such case, where a mere printed framework of a contract is used, and a clause is left with a blank unfilled, it may well be found that the significance of such clause is reduced to a minimum, and that its phraseology <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>must yield to a slight indication of a different intention, to be found in- the special provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">In the present case, the sentence of the clause relied on, being left incomplete, and calling for the addition of some further word or words, differs from that in <em>Spitta </em>v. <em>Woodman, </em>and other cases of that class. The collocation of the words is not such that, by reason of the sequence, the words relating to the beginning of the adventure must be held to explain and limit the words \u201c at and from,\u201d as in <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>French, </em>and other similar cases. Here, the general printed clause contains the words which the defendants would construe into a warranty, while the provisions specially adopted by the parties for this particular risk use the more general words \u201c at and from Charlottetown or Georgetown,\u201d which imply no warranty .that the vessel shall be loaded at either port. It would have been easy to include in the certificate issued to the plaintiff words which would specially refer to and adopt the general printed clause, and make it applicable to the risk to be insured, by providing that the clause should be read, in determining the rights of the plaintiff in case of loss, as if the blank were filled by the insertion of the words \u201c Charlottetown or Georgetown; \u201d but this was not done. If the defendants wished to avail themselves of so strict a provisio\u00f1, it is reasonable to require them to express their intention in plain terms. Inasmuch as the words which were used in the certificate have a recognized and settled legal construction, which is different from that which, according to the decisions above referred to, the printed words in the body of the contract would bear if the blank were filled by the insertion of the words \u201c Charlottetown or Georgetown,\u201d and inasmuch as the language of the certificate is not so arranged as to form a part of one continuous sentence in connection with the language of the body of the printed form, but is superadded by a separate paper, which embodies the terms of the contract which were specially in the minds of the parties, and which does not distinctly show that the words \u201c at and from Charlottetown or Georgetown \u201d were designed to be qualified by anything contained elsewhere, and inasmuch as the blank in the printed form was not filled, it is more just and reasonable to hold that the general provision, so far as it would bear a different meaning from the special provision, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>superseded by the latter, than it would be to hold the plaintiff bound by a warranty which was not brought to his attention. It is, to say the least, quite as consistent with the rules of law to fill the blank by inserting the word \u201c wheresoever,\u201d or to read the contract as if that word were inserted, as to insert words which would import a warranty of loading at a particular place. So far as can now be judged, if the attention of the parties had been called to the phraseology of the body of the policy, and the blank had been filled with reference to this risk, it might have been filled in this way; in which case <em>Gladstone </em>v. <em>Clay </em>would be an authority directly in point for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">If it could be shown that the plaintiff actually agreed that the blank should be filled by inserting the words \u201c Charlottetown or Georgetown,\u201d and that the omission was through a mutual mistake, the remedy of the defendants would be in another form, by a bill in equity to reform the contract, so as to make it express the real agreement of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The plaintiff has strongly urged that <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>French </em>and other like cases should be overruled, as sanctioning an unjust rule of law. It is not necessary to determine that here. There is no doubt, according to the decided cases, that the construction of words which of themselves would require the loading to be at the port of departure for the voyage insured, may be controlled by a special memorandum, or by circumstances showing that such construction was not intended in the particular case. <em>Bell </em>v. Hobson, 16 East, 240. <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Montefiore, </em>5 B. &amp; S. 408, 422; 33 L. J. (N. S.) Q. B. 256, 259, 260. <em>Nonnen </em>v. Reid, 16 East, 176. The view above taken is quite consistent with all the authorities, and renders it unnecessary to consider the other questions presented by the bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">\n<em>Bxceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">The case was argued in November 1880, by <em>L. S. Dabney </em>if- <em>H. L. </em>Harding, for the defendants; and by <em>C. T. Russell C. T. </em>Russell, Jr., for the plaintiff; and was reargued in March 1882, by the same counsel.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
