The word \u201cbenevolent\u201d as applied to objects or purposes may refer to those which are in their nature charitable, and may also have a broader meaning, and include objects and purposes not charitable in the legal sense of that word. Acts of kindness, friendship, forethought, or good will might properly be described as benevolent. It has therefore been held that gifts to trustees to be applied \u201c for benevolent purposes \u201d at their discretion, or \u201c to such benevolent purposes \u201d as they could agree upon, do not create a public charity. <em>Chamberlain </em>v. <em>Stearns, </em>111 Mass. 267. <em>James </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>3 Meriv. 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">In those cases, the word \u201c benevolent \u201d was the only word used in describing the purposes to which the gifts were to be devoted. But where it is used in connection with other words explanatory of its meaning, and indicating the intent of the donor to limit it to purposes strictly charitable, it has been held to be synonymous with, or equivalent to, \u201c charitable.\u201d Numerous instances of such use of the word in the statutes of this Commonwealth are referred to in <em>Saltonstall </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>11 Allen, 446, 468. And it was said by Mr. Justice Gray, in delivering the judgment in that case, \u201c Whatever may be the meaning, in the law of Massachusetts, of the word \u2018 benevolence \u2019 by itself, there can be no doubt that when used in connection with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>6 charity,\u2019 as in this will, it is synonymous with it.\u201d 11 Allen, 470. The language there was \u201cin aid of objects and purposes of benevolence or charity, public or private.\u201d So the words \u201cphilosophical or philanthropic purposes,\u201d taken in connection with other words which precede them, may be understood as referring to practical and useful sciences, and not to those which are merely abstract, speculative, and metaphysical. <em>Rotch </em>v. <em>Emerson, </em>105 Mass. 431.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">The meaning of the word \u201cbenevolent\u201d in the will now before us is modified and limited by other words in connection with which it is used; and it is plain that the testator used the word as synonymous with \u201c charitable,\u201d and intended to create a charity in its strict legal sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">The trustee under the residuary clause is, therefore, entitled to receive the fund. <em>Decree accordingly.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
