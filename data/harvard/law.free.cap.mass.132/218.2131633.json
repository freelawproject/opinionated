When the will was made, an action was pending in which the legatee sought to recover from the testator a sum less than one hundred <em>dollars; </em>and the bank named in the will, where the testator had a deposit of several hundred dollars, was summoned therein as trustee.

Before the death of the testatrix, \u201cneither party\u201d was entered in the action, and the trustee was discharged. The plaintiff contends that the word \u201cincluding\u201d means, in this connection, \u201cin addition to,\u201d and that the testatrix intended to give the plaintiff not only one hundred dollars, but in addition to that sum all the money she had in the bank; the words \u201c money trusteed at the Union Savings Bank\u201d being descriptive of, and intended to identify, the whole amount which she had then on deposit. But this is a forced construction, inconsistent with the meaning of the words used by the testatrix; and we can have no doubt, from the language of the bequest, taken in connection with the facts existing at the time the will was made, that she intended a gift to the plaintiff of one hundred dollars only, which sum was to include the amount for which the bank might be held liable as trustee; or,- in other words, that the one hundred dollars was to include the amount which the plaintiff claimed to be due from her. No question is made that the Union Institution for Savings is the bank described in the legacy as the Union Savings Bank.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b239-5\"><em>F.
