Trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Aldrich, </em>J., who allowed a bill of exceptions, in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-13\">Before the publication of the history, and in contemplation thereof, the plaintiffs employed one Ryanson as their agent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>obtain subscriptions for the work. -This agent of the plaintiffs called on the defendant and exhibited to him. an agreement and statement of the plaintiffs prefixed to it, and stating the objects of the work and what it would contain.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-4\">In addition to said general statement of what the contemplated history was to contain, the defendant, against the plaintiffs\u2019 objection, was allowed to introduce oral evidence, tending to prove that said agent, before the defendant signed said agreement and for the purpose of inducing him to sign the same, made the representations set forth in the defendant\u2019s answer; that those representations were false and known by the plaintiffs to be so; and that the defendant was induced thereby to subscribe for the book.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-5\">The plaintiffs requested the judge to rule \u201c that the words \u2018History of Essex County,\u2019 having a well-defined, precise and unambiguous meaning, parol evidence to show in what sense the . words were understood by the parties is not admissible.\u201d But the judge admitted the evidence objected to, for the purpose of showing what the plaintiffs\u2019 proposed History of Essex County, was to be.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-6\">The plaintiffs also requested the judge to rule as follows: \u201c 1. In order to relieve the defendant from the obligation of accepting and paying for the book on the ground of fraudulent statements made to him by the plaintiffs\u2019 agent, it must appear that the statements were not only false in fact, but were known by the agent to be false, and it was not enough that the agent had reasonable cause to believe that the statements made by him were untrue. 2. If the statements made by the plaintiffs\u2019 agent were false in fact, and were known by the plaintiffs to be false, yet, if the agent did not know them to be false, there is no ground to justify the defendant\u2019s refusal to accept the book, in the absence of authority to the agent from the plaintiffs to make such false statements.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-8\">The judge declined to rule as requested, but instructed the jury that the plaintiffs would be responsible only for the acts and representations of their agent made and performed within the scope of his agency, explaining in this connection, so far as was necessary for the purposes of this case, the law of principal and agent; and further instructed the jury, that if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>plaintiffs\u2019 agent, acting within the scope of his agency, and for the purpose of inducing thfe defendant to subscribe for the book, made, as true and as of his own knowledge, the representations set forth in the defendant\u2019s answer, and the defendant was thereby- induced to subscribe for and agree to take the book, and it should appear upon the evidence that the representations were false m fact, the defendant would be justified in refusing to accept and pay for the book, although it should also appear that the agent when making the representations did not know that they were false.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-4\">The jury returned a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiffs alleged exceptions to the admission of the evidence objected to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-5\">The case was argued at the bar in November 1880, and was afterwards submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b357-6\"><em>E.

Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AMN\">The evidence objected to was admitted to show false representations. We do not understand that it was admitted or used to affect the meaning of the contract, but to show by what representations, as to what their \u201c History of Essex County \u201d was to be, the defendant was induced to sign the contract. It was clearly admissible for this purpose, and we have no occasion to consider whether it would have been competent upon ' the question whether the book, conformed to the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">The jury must have found, under instructions not excepted to, that the defendant was induced to sign the contract by the false representations of the plaintiffs\u2019 agent, made while acting within the scope of his agency, and that those representations, while not known to the agent to be false, were made by him as true of his own knowledge. This was sufficient to establish the defence relied on.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">The further instructions asked were properly refused. It was not necessary that the agent should have known that the statements were false, if they were of matters of fact, and made as of positive knowledge. <em>Hazard </em>v. <em>Irwin, </em>18 Pick. 95, 104. <em>Milliken </em>v. <em>Thorndike, </em>103 Mass. 382. <em>Litchfield </em>v. <em>Hutchinson, </em>117 Mass. 195.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>If the agent, acting within the scope of his authority, represented that he knew facts to be true which were not true, but which he did not know to be false, it is immaterial whether or not the plaintiffs knew that he was to make the representations, or expressly authorized them. Such representations are fraudulent in the agent, and the principal is bound by them. Story on Agency, \u00a7\u00a7 134, 135, 452. <em>Locke </em>v.
