On 22 July 2003, the court held a hearing on the petition and found three grounds to terminate respondent's parental rights, and concluded that termination was in the best interest of the children. Respondent appeals. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Respondent is the father of C.M.M., born 21 June 1987, and L.R.W., born 1 June 1990. Respondent has been incarcerated since 1998, with an expected release date in 2015. He is not eligible for work release. DSS obtained custody of C.M.M. and L.R.W. on 16 July 2001, after their step-father sexually abused them. On 26 July 2001, DSS informed respondent that it had taken custody of his daughters. On 25 April 2003, the girls' mother relinquished her parental rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   During the time DSS had custody, respondent wrote the girls three letters and spoke to them once on the phone. Respondent presented no witnesses at the hearing. The court found that three grounds existed to support termination of respondent's parental rights: that he neglected his children, that he wilfully left his children in foster care for more than twelve months without showing to the satisfaction of the court reasonable progress in correcting the conditions that lead to removal, and that he failed to legitimate his children or provide substantial support or consistent care to them or their mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant argues that the court erred in finding each of the three grounds for terminating his parental rights. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The process for terminating parental rights is well-established:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Termination of parental rights is a two-step procedure. During the initial adjudication phase of the trial, the petitioner seeking termination must show by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence that grounds exist to terminate parental rights. A finding of any one of those grounds is sufficient to support termination of parental rights. If the petitioner succeeds in establishing the existence of any one of the statutory grounds listed in N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-1111, the trial court moves to the second, or dispositional, stage, where it determines whether it is in the best interests of the child to terminate the parental rights.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    In re Shepard,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8916071\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/162/215/#p221\">\n    162 N.C.

Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-1111(a)(2) by failing to apply the amended statute to this proceeding. The applicable statute reads, in pertinent part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The parent has willfully left the juvenile in foster care or placement outside the home for more than 12 months without showing to the satisfaction of the court that reasonable progress under the circumstances has been made in correcting those conditions which led to the removal of the juvenile. Provided, however, that no parental rights shall be terminated for the sole reason that the parents are unable to care for the juvenile on account of their poverty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-1111(a)(2) (2002). The statute was amended in 2001 for all petitions filed or pending as of 1 January 2002. The petition here was filed 13 November 2002. Prior to the amendment, the statute read, in pertinent part, \". . . without showing to the satisfaction of the court that reasonable progress under the circumstances has been made\n   <em>\n    within twelve months\n   </em>\n   in correcting those conditions which led to the removal of the juvenile.\" N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-1111(a)(2) (1999) (emphasis supplied). As respondent contends in his brief, this section no longer limits the period in which progress must be made. However, this error is harmless because the evidence before the court supported the conclusion that grounds exists under N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-1111(a)(2) to terminate respondent's parental rights.\n   <em>\n    In re Pope,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11432636\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/144/32/#p38\">\n    144 N.C.

Here, the court did articulate the proper standard of proof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The court found that respondent was incarcerated and had a release date of 2015, had sent the girls only three letters, and had made only one phone call to them during the two years they were in foster care. The court further found that respondent did not enter into a service agreement with DSS, and that his only plan for the children was for them to live with his mother, which plan DSS rejected because respondent's mother's home was not suitable. \"[A] respondent's incarceration, standing alone, neither precludes nor requires finding the respondent willfully left a child in foster care.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Harris,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8358086\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/87/179/#p184\">\n    87 N.C.

However, the court stated, in conclusions of law two, three and four, that each ground was \"[b]ased upon clear, cogent and convincing evidence.\" The record, including evidence from the testimony of DSS social worker Susan Perez, and the findings support the conclusion that grounds existed pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-1111 (a)(2) to terminate respondent's parental rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Because the trial court properly terminated respondent's parental rights under N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-1111(a)(2), we need not address his arguments that his parental rights were improperly terminated pursuant to \u00a7 7B-1111(a)(1) and \u00a7 7B-1111(a)(5).\n   <em>\n    In re Pope,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11432636\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/144/32/#p38\">\n    144 N.C.
