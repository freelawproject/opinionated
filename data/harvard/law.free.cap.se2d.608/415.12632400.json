A jury found defendant guilty of attempted rape of a child, three counts of first-degree sexual offense and two counts of indecent liberties with a child. The trial court sentenced defendant to two concurrent life sentences. Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant's counsel states that he \"is unable to identify an issue with sufficient merit to support a meaningful argument for relief on appeal\" and asks this Court to review the record for possible prejudicial error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Counsel has shown to the satisfaction of this Court that he has complied with the requirements of\n   <em>\n    Anders v. California,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182629\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/738/\">\n    386 U.S. 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182629\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/738/\">\n    18 L.Ed.2d 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    reh'g denied,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6194450,6194707\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/388/924/\">\n    388 U.S. 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20L.%20Ed.%202d%201377\">\n    18 L.Ed.2d 1377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1967), and\n   <em>\n    State v.

We conclude the appeal is wholly frivolous. In reaching this conclusion, we have conducted our own examination of the record for possible prejudicial error and have found none.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   We hold defendant had a fair trial, free from prejudicial error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   No error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Judges CALABRIA and LEVINSON concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Report per Rule 30(e).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
