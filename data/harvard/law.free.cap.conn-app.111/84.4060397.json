Feldman, </em>special deputy assistant state\u2019s attorney, with whom, on the brief, were <em>Jonathan C. Benedict, </em>state\u2019s attorney, and <em>Charles M. Stango, </em>assistant state\u2019s attorney, for the appellee (state).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b111-10\">\n<em>Opinion</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"b111-11\">HARPER, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AcP\">The defendant, Ryshon Wells, appeals from the judgment of conviction, rendered after a jury trial, of criminal possession of a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-217, carrying a pistol without a permit in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 29-35 and interfering with an officer in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-167a.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant claims that the court improperly failed, sua sponte, to declare a mistrial when (1) drugs that had not been introduced as evidence were found intermixed with properly introduced evidence in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>the jury room, (2) the jury heard testimony that the gun had been fired prior to his arrest and (3) the jury heard testimony that a gun recovered upon his arrest was stolen property. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On March 26, 2006, the Bridgeport police were notified that a shooting had occurred in Bridgeport. Upon commencing an investigation, the police identified the defendant as a suspect. Once the defendant was located, he was notified by the police to stop and put his hands up. The defendant instead reached into his waistband, removed a gun, dropped that gun onto the sidewalk and immediately fled the scene. Soon thereafter, the police apprehended the defendant and recovered the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">In a substitute information filed on September 25, 2006, the state charged the defendant with criminal possession of a firearm, carrying a pistol without a permit and interfering with an officer. At the defendant\u2019s criminal trial, Vincent LaRiccia, a Bridgeport police officer who was at the scene of the defendant\u2019s arrest, testified regarding the number of bullets found within the recovered gun. LaRiccia testified that the gun has \u201ca ten round capacity .... It would be a total of eleven\u201d bullets.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He testified that on the evening of the arrest, the recovered gun had \u201ceight [bullets] in the magazine and on\u00e9 in the chamber.\u201d The defendant did not object to this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">Later during the defendant\u2019s trial, John Tenn, a Bridgeport police officer who arrived at the scene after the defendant\u2019s arrest, testified that after the defendant had been taken into police custody, he ran the \u201cserial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>number\u201d on the gun and got \u201ca printout that . . . told [him] that the gun was stolen.\u201d The defendant objected to this testimony. After an off the record discussion with counsel, the court instructed the jury to \u201cstrike the testimony about the . . . gun being stolen .... You\u2019re not to consider that as evidence in this case whatsoever.\u201d The defendant did not object in any way to this instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">During its deliberation, the jury provided a note to the court that \u201cone of us has just discovered what appears to be [marijuana] in the glove in the evidence box. Does this cause a problem?\u201d The court then informed both parties that it would \u201cinstruct the jury\u2014 first I\u2019m going to have it taken out of the evidence area and tell them not to consider it; it\u2019s not evidence in the case. But I have to welcome comments . . . .\u201d The defendant stated that he \u201cwould agree\u201d to such an instruction. The court then specifically instructed the jury not to consider the marijuana, as \u201cit\u2019s not part of the information, you\u2019re not to speculate or try to guess why it\u2019s there. It\u2019s just not evidence in the case, and that\u2019s how I\u2019m going to instruct you on that.\u201d The court then solicited comments from counsel on the jury instruction as given, and the defendant proffered no objection. The jury later returned a guilty verdict on all charges. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">The defendant claims that the court denied him a fair trial and due process under the fifth, sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution because it failed to declare a mistrial, sua sponte. In support of this claim, he argues that several improprieties occurred at trial, the cumulative effect of which denied him his constitutional rights. We will address each aspect of the defendant\u2019s claim in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">Before we do so, we note the applicable standard of review. \u201cThe decision as to whether to grant a motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>for a mistrial, or to grant a mistrial on the court\u2019s own motion, is one that requires the trial court to exercise its judicial discretion. . . . [T]he law has invested [c]ourts of justice with the authority to discharge a jury from giving any verdict, whenever, in their opinion . . . there is a manifest necessity for the act, or the ends of public justice would otherwise be defeated. They are to exercise a sound discretion .... [A] mistrial should be granted only if something occurs in the course of the trial that makes it apparent to the court that a party cannot have a fair trial and the whole proceedings are vitiated.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Phidd, </em>42 Conn. App. 17, 38-39, 681 A.2d 310, cert. denied, 238 Conn. 907, 679 A.2d 2 (1996), cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1108, 117 S. Ct. 1115, 137 L. Ed. 2d 315 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">The defendant\u2019s primary claim is that the presence of marijuana in the jury room along with properly introduced evidence violated his constitutional right to a fair trial. The defendant acknowledges that this claim was not preserved at trial and requests that we review it pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), or, in the alternative, under the plain error doctrine. See Practice Book \u00a7 60-5. Because we conclude that the defendant waived this claim at trial, we do not review the claim under <em>Golding </em>or the plain error doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">\u201c[WJaiver is the intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>52 Conn. App. 802, 810, 729 A.2d 778 (1999). \u201c[A] valid waiver calls into question the existence of a constitutional violation depriving the defendant of a fair trial for the purpose of <em>Golding </em>review [and it] also thwarts plain error review of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>claim.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Corona, </em>69 Conn. App. 267, 274, 794 A.2d 565, cert. denied, 260 Conn. 935, 802 A.2d 88 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Our careful review of the record leads us to conclude that the defendant waived any claim that this occurrence deprived him of a fair trial when he expressly agreed with the court\u2019s proposed jury instruction and failed to proffer any type of objection after that instruction was given to the jury. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Respass, </em>256 Conn. 164, 192-93, 770 A.2d 471 (waiver occurred when court \u201cexplicitly gave both parties opportunities to conduct further inquiry, and both parties declined. . . . [I]f the defendant perceived the trial court\u2019s inquiry as inadequate, then he would have complained during the inquiry process instead of waiting until after the jury had reached a verdict.\u201d [Citation omitted.]), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 1002, 122 S. Ct. 478, 151 L. Ed. 2d 392 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">In terms of <em>Golding, </em>we note that although the defendant asserts that this claim deprived him of a fair trial, we cannot so conclude. One of the required conditions under <em>Golding </em>is that \u201c the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial .... The appellate tribunal is free . . . to respond to the defendant\u2019s claim by focusing on <em>whichever condition </em>is most relevant in the particular circumstances.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 240. As the reviewing court, \u201cwe will review [the claim] and arrive at a conclusion as to whether the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and whether it clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial.\u201d Id., 241. We conclude that because the defendant has waived the claim, there is no clear, existing constitutional violation, and, thus, the claim fails to satisfy the third prong of <em>Golding. </em>Additionally, on the basis of the defendant\u2019s waiver, we are not persuaded that plain error exists with regard to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">The defendant next claims that LaRiccia\u2019s testimony that the gun had been fired prior to the defendant\u2019s arrest violated his constitutional right to a fair hearing. The defendant concedes that this claim is unpreserved and seeks review under <em>Golding </em>and the plain error doctrine. We decline to review this claim under <em>Golding </em>and conclude that the defendant cannot succeed under the plain error doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">We begin by noting that although the defendant asserts that this claim is of constitutional magnitude, we cannot so conclude. One of the required conditions under <em>Golding </em>is that \u201cthe claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right .... The appell\u00e1te tribunal is free ... to respond to the defendant\u2019s claim by focusing on <em>whichever condition </em>is most relevant in the particular circumstances.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 239-40. The defendant bears \u201cthe responsibility of demonstrating that his claim is indeed a violation of a fundamental constitutional right.\u201d Id., 240. \u201cThe defendant can not raise a constitutional claim by attaching a constitutional label to a purely evidentiary claim or by asserting merely that a strained connection exists between the evidentiary claim and a fundamental constitutional right.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Stepney, </em>94 Conn. App. 72, 79, 891 A.2d 67, cert. denied, 278 Conn. 911, 899 A.2d 40 (2006). \u201cGenerally, the admissibility of evidence is a matter of state law and unless there is a resultant denial of fundamental fairness or the denial of a specific constitutional right, no constitutional issue is involved.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Vilalastra, </em>207 Conn. 35, 46, 540 A.2d 42 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">It is well settled that claims involving disputed testimonial statements are evidentiary in nature. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Hansen, </em>39 Conn. App. 384, 388-91, 666 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>421 (court declined to afford <em>Golding </em>or plain error review to testimony regarding defendant\u2019s past contacts with police), cert. denied, 235 Conn. 928, 667 A.2d 554 (1995). Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s argument fails under the second prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">The defendant also argues that plain error exists. A \u201cdefendant cannot prevail under [the plain error doctrine] . . . unless he demonstrates that the claimed error is both so clear and so harmful that a failure to reverse the judgment would result in manifest injustice.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>251 Conn. 285, 389, 743 A.2d 1 (1999), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 841, 121 S. Ct. 106, 148 L. Ed. 2d 64 (2000); see also Practice Book \u00a7 60-5. \u201c[Plain error] review is reserved for <em>truly extraordinary situations </em>where the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinckley, </em>198 Conn. 77, 87-88, 502 A.2d 388 (1985). \u201cA <em>plain error review </em>does not necessarily require the conclusion that a defendant will prevail in the claim that <em>plain error </em>exists.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hedman, </em>62 Conn. App. 403, 408, 772 A.2d 603 (2001), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 261 Conn. 390, 802 A.2d 842 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">The defendant has not demonstrated how the existence of an error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings. Here, we cannot conclude that the defendant\u2019s claim is of such compelling error or so truly extraordinary that reversal of the court\u2019s judgment is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">We next turn to the defendant\u2019s claim that Tenn\u2019s testimony that the recovered gun was stolen violated his constitutional right to a fair hearing. The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>requests that we review this claim pursuant to <em>Golding </em>or the plain error doctrine. The defendant cannot prevail under either doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">The defendant\u2019s claim is evidentiary in nature and not one of constitutional magnitude because he challenges the admissibility of testimonial evidence. As we concluded in part II, <em>Golding </em>review is inapplicable on this claim because a constitutional issue is not involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">With regard to the plain error doctrine, \u201c[it] may only be invoked in instances of forfeited-but-reversible error . . . and cannot be used for the purpose of revoking an otherwise valid waiver. This is so because if there has been a valid waiver, there is no error for us to correct. . . . The distinction between a forfeiture of a right (to which the Plain Error Rule may be applied) and a waiver of that right (to which the Plain Error Rule cannot be applied) is that [w]hereas forfeiture is the failure to make the timely assertion of a right, waiver is the intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Wilson, supra, 52 Conn. App. 809-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">Although the record reflects that the defendant did not intentionally waive this claim during trial, the claim fails under the plain error doctrine because he has not demonstrated the existence of a \u201ctruly extraordinary situation.\u201d The record clearly depicts Term\u2019s testimony that his research led him to conclude that the gun was stolen and also depicts the defendant\u2019s objection thereto. The court then instructed the jury to \u201cstrike the testimony about the . . . gun being stolen .... You\u2019re not to consider that as evidence in this case whatsoever.\u201d The defendant did not object or expressly agree to the instruction. Nonetheless, under plain error review, as we noted in part II, \u201creview is reserved for <em>truly extraordinary situations </em>where the existence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinckley, </em>supra, 198 Conn. 87-88. The defendant has not demonstrated how the existence of an error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings. We cannot conclude that the defendant\u2019s claim is of such compelling error or so truly extraordinary to reverse the court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">On the basis of the foregoing analysis, we conclude that, whether viewed individually or collectively, the occurrences claimed by the defendant did not deprive him of a fair trial or due process. Accordingly, we disagree with the defendant\u2019s claim that the court\u2019s failure to declare a mistrial, sua sponte, constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b111-12\"> The defendant was given a total effective sentence of ten years imprisonment, execution suspended after six years, and five years probation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b112-9\"> LaRiccia explained that a ten round capacity weapon holds ten bullets in the magazine, or clip, and one bullet in the chamber and, thus, holds a total of eleven bullets.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
