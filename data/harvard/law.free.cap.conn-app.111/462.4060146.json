We dismiss the appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>The plaintiff, Astoria Federal Mortgage Corporation, commenced a foreclosure action against the defendants in the summer of 2005 with respect to real property located in Bridgewater (property). On February 27, 2006, the court rendered judgment of foreclosure by sale, finding the value of the property to be $625,000. The defendants did not appeal from that judgment. The court thereafter set a sale date of December 2, 2006. Six successive, and successful, motions to open the judgment and to set a new sale date followed over the course of the next year.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On November 20, 2007, the defendants moved once again to open the judgment of foreclosure and to set aside the scheduled December 8, 2007 sale date. The court denied that motion on December 3, 2007, and the defendants appealed to this court on December 7, 2007. Their principal claim on appeal pertains to the alleged noncompliance with a standing order, in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 49-25,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> requiring a disinterested appraiser to submit to the court its appraisal of the foreclosed property at least seven days prior to the sale. See Standing Order JD-CV-79 (10).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">The plaintiff argues, and we agree, that the present appeal is not ripe for our adjudication and hence nonjusticiable. \u201cJusticiability involves the authority of the court to resolve actual controversies. . . . Because courts are established to resolve actual controversies, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>before a claimed controversy is entitled to a resolution on the merits it must be justiciable. Justiciability requires (1) that there be an actual controversy between or among the parties to the dispute ... (2) that the interests of the parties be adverse ... (3) that the matter in controversy be capable of being adjudicated by judicial power . . . and (4) that the determination of the controversy will result in practical relief to the complainant. ... As we have recognized, justiciability comprises several related doctrines, namely, standing, ripeness, mootness and the political question doctrine.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. Burton, 282 Conn. 1, 7, 917 A.2d 966 (2007). \u201cA case that is nonjusticiable must be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. . . . [B]ecause an issue regarding justiciability raises a question of law, our appellate review [of the question of ripeness] is plenary.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Chapman Lumber, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tager, </em>288 Conn. 69, 86, 952 A.2d 1 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">As our Supreme Court has explained, \u201cthe rationale behind the ripeness requirement is to prevent the courts, through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements . . . [and we therefore] must be satisfied that the case before [us] does not present a hypothetical injury or a claim contingent upon some event that has not and indeed may never transpire.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Office of the Governor </em>v. <em>Select Committee of Inquiry, </em>271 Conn. 540, 570, 858 A.2d 709 (2004). At present, no sale date has been set for the property subject to the court\u2019s judgment of foreclosure. As a result, the possible failure of the disinterested appraiser to submit to the court an appraisal of the property at least seven days prior to that sale remains hypothetical. To proceed to a consideration of the merits of the defendants\u2019 claim requires us to engage in speculation and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>conjecture, which \u201chave no place in appellate review.\u201d <em>Narumanchi </em>v. <em>DeStefano, </em>89 Conn. App. 807, 815, 875 A.2d 71 (2005). Because the defendants\u2019 claim is contingent on some event that has not and indeed may never transpire, it is not ripe for our adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">In addition, justiciability requires the determination of the controversy to result in practical relief to the complainant. See <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Burton, </em>supra, 282 Conn. 7. Irrespective of which party prevails in this appeal, the matter will return to the Superior Court, where a new sale date will be set. The defendants will find themselves in the same position whether this court rules in favor of the plaintiff, the defendants or dismisses the appeal altogether, and will be free to challenge the propriety of the independent appraiser\u2019s submission following the committee sale.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Jacqueline Properties, LLC </em>v. <em>Gartrell, </em>101 Conn. App. 6, 919 A.2d 1059, cert. denied, 283 Conn. 907, 927 A.2d 918 (2007). We thus perceive no practical relief that this court can grant to the defendants in this appeal. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b489-5\"> The court granted the defendants\u2019 November 21, 2006 motion to open the judgment on November 27, 2006. The court granted the defendants\u2019 January 19, 2007 motion to open the judgment on January 22, 2007. The court granted the defendants\u2019 April 9, 2007 motion to open the judgment on April 23, 2007. The court granted the defendants\u2019 July 18, 2007 motion to open the judgment on July 23, 2007. The court granted the defendants\u2019 August 24, 2007 motion to open the judgment on September 4, 2007.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b489-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 49-25 provides in relevant part: \u201cWhen the court in any such proceeding is of the opinion that a foreclosure by sale should be decreed, it shall . . . appoint one disinterested appraiser who shall, under oath, appraise the property to be sold and make return of the appraisal to the clerk of the court. ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b491-7\"> The defendants also claim that the present dispute falls within the purview of the capable of repetition, yet evading review exception to the mootness doctrine. See <em>Loisel </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>233 Conn. 370, 660 A.2d 323 (1995) (en banc). That claim fails in light of our recent review of an almost identical claim. In <em>Jacqueline Properties, LLC </em>v. <em>Gartrell, </em>101 Conn. App. 6, 919 A.2d 1059, cert. denied, 283 Conn. 907, 927 A.2d 918 (2007), the defendant property owner appealed to this court from the trial court\u2019s approval of the sale of foreclosed property, claiming that \u201cthe court improperly approved the foreclosure sales of the properties because it did not order and receive new appraisals pursuant to \u00a7 49-25 when ... it rendered judgments of foreclosure by sale.\u201d Id., 9. In reviewing that claim, we concluded that the trial court in that case \u201ccomplied with \u00a7 49-25 . . . .\u201d Id., 10. As such, the defendants\u2019 contention that their claim evades review fails.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
