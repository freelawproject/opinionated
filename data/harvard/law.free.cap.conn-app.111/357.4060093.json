The town filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">After examining the record on appeal and considering the briefs and arguments of the parties, we are persuaded that the judgment of the court should be affirmed. Because the court\u2019s memorandum of decision fully addresses the arguments raised in this appeal, we adopt the court\u2019s thorough and well reasoned decision as a statement of the facts and the applicable law on these issues. See <em>Motiva Enterprises, LLC v. Stratford, </em>50 Conn. Sup. 639, 961 A.2d 485 (2007). Further discussion by this court would serve no useful purpose. See, e.g., <em>White Sands Beach Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Bombaci, </em>287 Conn. 302, 950 <em>A.2d </em>489 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b383-14\"> The plaintiffs property consists of a gas and oil storage and distribution center on a total of 48.35 acres; 25.67 acres are located in Stratford, and the remaining land is located in Bridgeport. Only the portion of the land in Stratford is the subject of this dispute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b383-15\"> <em>The </em>town also claims that the trial court improperly \u201crelied upon speculation when determining the value of the subject property [and improperly] concluded that the Stratford portion could not be more valuable than the Bridgeport portion.\u201d The court\u2019s memorandum of decision shows only that the court noted that the Bridgeport property was not offered as a comparable sale, recounted the assessed value of the Bridgeport property and the improvements that it contained and stated that \u201c[t]here is nothing to indicate that the [Stratford portion] is more valuable than the Bridgeport portion of [the plaintiffs] facility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-16\">Even if we assume arguendo that the court relied on these findings, we cannot say that they are clearly erroneous. The court had uncontroverted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>evidence of the assessed value of the Bridgeport property and the improvements on both properties. The town has failed to show that \u201cthere is no evidence in the record to support\u201d the court\u2019s findings and failed to provide \u201cthe definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United Technologies Corp. </em>v. <em>East Windsor, </em>262 Conn. 11, 23, 807 A.2d 955 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b384-9\"> The plaintiff appealed to the board of assessment appeals from the valuation by the town assessors, but the board elected not to conduct a hearing. The plaintiff filed its application to appeal within two months of the board\u2019s action. See General Statutes \u00a7 12-117a.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b384-10\"> The plaintiff subsequently amended its application to appeal to include the tax assessments for 2005 and 2006. See General Statutes \u00a7 12-117a.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
