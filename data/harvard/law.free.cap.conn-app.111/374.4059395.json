We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. The defendant met O<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in 1996, and a romantic relationship ensued. In the fall of 1999,0 and her daughters, E, L, and J, moved into the defendant\u2019s condominium in Hartford. At that time, E was thirteen years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">Upon their moving into the condominium, the relationship between O\u2019s daughters and the defendant changed. The defendant became stricter with the girls, frequently punishing them for violating certain rules by having them kneel on the floor with their arms extended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>and palms up. The defendant at times placed books on their open palms, which he testified was a form of corporal punishment that he learned in Nicaragua.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Furthermore, after the girls moved into the defendant\u2019s condominium, the defendant began to touch E\u2019s intimate parts. At trial, E detailed several physical encounters with the defendant. For example, while lying on the defendant\u2019s bed watching television with him, E confided in the defendant that she was experiencing problems with her boyfriend. The defendant responded by digitally penetrating E\u2019s vagina, telling her that this was what her boyfriend was supposed to do. On another occasion, E was taking a shower when the defendant entered. Once in the shower with E, the defendant shaved her pubic hair. He then instructed E to go to his bedroom and lie down. The defendant then digitally penetrated E\u2019s vagina and fondled her breasts. E testified that the defendant touched her inappropriately on a regular basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">In November, 2002, the defendant ended his relationship with O. Sometime thereafter, E informed her older sister, J, that the defendant had sexually assaulted her. J shared this information with O, who contacted the police. The defendant subsequently was charged by information with twelve counts alleging sexual assault and risk of injury to a child.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Following a trial, the jury found the defendant guilty of one count of sexual assault in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1) and one count of risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21 (a) (2); it found him not guilty of the remaining counts. The court denied the defendant\u2019s subsequent motions for a judgment of acquittal and for a new trial, and rendered judgment in accordance with the verdict. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>It sentenced the defendant to a total effective term of fifteen years incarceration, execution suspended after eight years, with ten years of probation. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">The defendant claims that the court improperly admitted into evidence E\u2019s journal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That claim is governed by the abuse of discretion standard of review. \u201cUnless an evidentiary ruling involves a clear misconception of the law, the [t]rial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility ... of evidence. . . . The trial court\u2019s ruling on evidentiary matters will be overturned only upon a showing of a clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. . . . We will make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>286 Conn. 499, 532, 944 A.2d 947, cert. denied, 555 U.S. 916, 129 S. Ct. 271, 172 L. Ed. 2d 200 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">The following additional facts are relevant to the defendant\u2019s claim. On direct examination, E testified that the defendant began touching her intimate parts shortly after her family moved into his condominium, and she detailed several specific incidents. E also testified that she never told anyone about those incidents \u201cbecause [the defendant] had control of everything and if I would have told my mom, she would have kicked me out like she did to my sister because [the defendant] told her to. . . . My mom wouldn\u2019t believe me. She was in love with [the defendant].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">On cross-examination, the defendant sought to impeach E\u2019s testimony. Defense counsel confronted E with her February 5, 2004 written statement to the police, referring to inconsistencies in her testimony on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>direct examination. Defense counsel repeatedly questioned E as to her statement to the police that the defendant had engaged in anal intercourse with her \u201c[every day, two] or three times a day\u201d when she was thirteen years old and in the seventh grade. In response, E testified that \u201cyes, it would be two or three times a day.\u201d On redirect examination, E explained that her reference to \u201ctwo or three times a day\u201d pertained to sexual encounters generally. She stated that when she made that remark, she \u201cmeant everything. . . . When he used to finger me, when he used to touch me, when he used to take a shower with me. When you say \u2018every day,\u2019 it was because I lived in a hell.\u201d In addition, E acknowledged on cross-examination that she was unsure precisely when that assault began, stating, \u201cI don\u2019t know the year,\u201d and, \u201cI\u2019m not doing the math.\u201d E also conceded that she did not initially inform her mother or sisters of her sexual encounters with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">During cross-examination, defense counsel also asked E about discussions she had with counselors. Defense counsel then raised the subject of E\u2019s journals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-7\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: In front of [your counselors], did you ever say that you had journals or diaries of all the sexual abuse that [the defendant] had committed as the acts were taking place?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-8\">\u201c[The Witness]: I never said ... all my journals were about him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-9\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: No, I\u2019m not suggesting that all your journals were about him. But didn\u2019t you say that you wrote down everything he had done to you in the diary?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-10\">\u201c[The Witness]: I write everything that happens to me in my diary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>\u201c[Defense Counsel]: All right. And didn\u2019t you tell [your counselors] when you were interviewed, that you had these journals or diaries that talked about what [the defendant] had done to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-6\">\u201c[The Witness]: Yes, I had my journals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-7\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Right. And what you had said to them was that you were writing down in your diary as these things were happening, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-8\">\u201c[The Witness]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-9\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: All right. And you went to get your diaries today, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-10\">\u201c[The Witness]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-11\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: And nothing is in there; isn\u2019t that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-12\">\u201c[The Witness]: Cause those are not the only diaries I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-13\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Oh, okay. Where are the other diaries that talk about what [the defendant] did to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-14\">\u201c[The Witness]: I don\u2019t know because I moved out from my mom\u2019s house.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-15\">Later, on recross-examination, counsel for the defendant again asked: \u201c[T]he diaries where you claim you wrote about all the things that [the defendant] did to you while they were happening have . . . disappeared? . . . Where are they now?\u201d E admitted that she did not know the whereabouts of those journals.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-16\">On July 13, 2006, Detective Naomi Rivera Cagianello of the Hartford police department testified that she took statements from L, J and O on May 14, 2003, and from E on February 5, 2004. Following her testimony and outside of the courtroom, Cagianello asked the prosecutor why he had not inquired about \u201cthe journal entry.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>Cagianello indicated that \u201calthough not in the warrant, she had tagged as evidence a journal given to her by E at the time that E provided her written statement to her.\u201d It is undisputed that prior to that time, neither the state nor the defendant was aware of that journal\u2019s existence, as Cagianello had not mentioned it in her police report or trial testimony. In addition, counsel for the defendant informed the court that \u201cas to the chain of custody and how the events took place, we\u2019re obviously not claiming any bad faith . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">On July 17, 2006, the state sought to offer into evidence two portions of the recently discovered journal. After hearing from both parties on the matter, the court concluded that the journal entries were admissible on three grounds. It stated: \u201cThe portions that the state seeks to introduce will be admitted to corroborate E\u2019s testimony that the defendant had contact with her intimate parts as charged in counts five and six .... It is evidence that tends to show why E did not disclose the abuse at the time .... It is also a prior consistent statement to rebut a claim of recent fabrication, as the [defendant] in his impeachment of E sought to discredit her and [to imply] that she was testifying falsely. The statement is trustworthy, having been written contemporaneously with the events, [and] the witness is here and subject to cross-examination. The court finds that the probative value outweighs the prejudice to the defendant, and it will be admitted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">E subsequently was recalled to testify about the two journal entries and confirmed that the journal belonged to her and was written by her hand. The state then moved for the admission of the two journal entries, which the court granted after noting the defense counsel\u2019s objection. E then read into the record the first entry from her journal: \u201cI like my mom, but sometimes I think I like [the defendant], but I do not like when he be feeling on me; I just don\u2019t like when he do those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>things when I\u2019m going to sleep or going to see television.\u201d E testified that when she wrote, \u201cI do not like when he be feeling on me,\u201d she meant the defendant\u2019s touching of her vagina, breasts and buttocks. E next read into the record the second entry from her journal: \u201cMy mom thinks [the defendant] is a good man, but he is not. He is always feeling on me; he is always doing that to me. For me to go out with my friends when my mom say no, he says yes but only if he could feel on me, and that\u2019s the only way I could go out. But I do hurt when he be doing this.\u201d E testified that she had to allow the defendant to touch her intimately before he permitted her to go out with friends and that he had hurt her physically and mentally. She stated that \u201cI was scared, and it hurt because I gave him a trust and he broke that trust.\u201d Defense counsel thereafter did not cross-examine E.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the court abused its discretion in admitting into evidence the journal entries. We do not agree. The court properly admitted the journal entries as prior consistent statements offered to rebut a charge of recent fabrication.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">\u201cAn out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted is hearsay and is generally inadmissible unless an exception to the general rule applies. . . . Prior consistent statements of a witness are generally regarded as hearsay and are not admissible at trial, either for their truth or for the propose of rehabilitating a witness\u2019 damaged credibility. . . . This rule, however, is not absolute. The trial court, within its discretion, may admit a prior consistent statement if offered to rehabilitate a witness who has been impeached . . . by a claim of recent fabrication .... When a prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>consistent statement is admitted under [that exception], it is admitted to affect credibility only and not to establish the truth of the statement.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>243 Conn. 796, 803-804, 709 A.2d 522 (1998). One noted commentator explained the rationale for that exception: \u201cImpeachment on the ground of recent contrivance ... is more nearly connected with the case of impeachment by self-contradiction. The charge of recent contrivance is usually made, not so much by affirmative evidence, as by negative evidence that the witness did not speak of the matter before, at a time when it would have been natural to speak; his silence then is urged as inconsistent with his utterances now, i.e., as a self-contradiction .... The effect of the evidence of consistent statements is that the supposed fact of not speaking formerly, from which we are to infer a recent contrivance of the story, is disposed of by denying it to be a fact, inasmuch as the witness did speak and tell the same story . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) 4 J. Wigmore, Evidence (Chadboum Rev. 1972) \u00a7 1129, pp. 270-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Accordingly, \u00a7 6-11 (b) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence provides in relevant part that \u201c[i]f the credibility of a witness is impeached by ... (3) a suggestion of recent contrivance, evidence of a prior consistent statement made by the witness is admissible, in the discretion of the court, to rebut the impeachment.\u201d As our Supreme Court recently stated, \u201cthe determination of whether to allow the introduction of a prior consistent statement for rebuttal purposes is left to the sound discretion of the trial court. . . . [I]n stating that evidence of a witness\u2019 prior consistent statement is admissible in the discretion of the court, [\u00a7] 6-11 stresses the broad discretion afforded the trial judge in admitting this type of evidence.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Daley </em>v. <em>McClintock, </em>267 Conn. 399, 412, 838 A.2d 972 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>In the present case, the court acted well within its discretion in allowing the state to introduce the journal excerpts to rebut a suggestion that E recently contrived her testimony. During cross-examination, defense counsel repeatedly confronted E with her February 5, 2004 written statement to the police, in which she stated that \u201c[t]his happened [every day, two] or three times a day.\u201d After establishing that E had stated that she wrote in her journal everything that the defendant had done to her and that she did so \u201cas these things were happening,\u201d he inquired, \u201c[a]nd you went to get your diaries today, didn\u2019t you?\u201d When E answered affirmatively, defense counsel stated: \u201cAnd nothing is in there; isn\u2019t that right?\u201d In addition, the following colloquy occurred during defense counsel\u2019s recross-examination of E:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-6\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Now, I believe we went over this in [cross-examination], but you had indicated, when you were interviewed . . . that you had journals or diaries where you recorded what [the defendant] was doing to you at about the time that it happened, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-7\">\u201c[The Witness]: Yes, I had journals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-8\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: That\u2019s what you told them. But now you\u2019ve brought some journals to court here today, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-9\">\u201c[The Witness]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-10\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: An inspector from the prosecutor\u2019s office went to Manchester to get those diaries for you, right, this morning?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-11\">\u201c[The Witness]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-12\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: But the diaries where you claim you wrote about all the things that [the defendant] did to you while they were happening, those have miraculously disappeared?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>After the state objected to the term \u201cmiraculously\u201d and the court sustained the objection, defense counsel again asked E the location of the journal containing her accounts of the alleged assaults, to which E replied that she did not know.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>supra, 243 Conn. 796, the Supreme Court stated that \u201cit is irrelevant that the defendant did not expressly pursue a theory of recent fabrication. The only relevant inquiry is whether the jury reasonably may have been left with the impression that [the witness\u2019] testimony was a recent fabrication.\u201d Id., 804-805. The court reasoned that \u201c[i]t is not necessary that the impeachment be explicit, i.e., that an actual allegation of recent fabrication be made, but only that a jury be able to reasonably infer that such is occurring.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 805. It thus held that \u201c[w]hen atrial court reasonably can conclude that there was sufficient evidence to permit a jury to draw an inference of recent fabrication, it may admit a prior consistent statement for rehabilitative purposes.\u201d Id., 806.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">Such is the case here. In light of the foregoing colloquies between counsel for the defendant and E, the court reasonably could conclude, as it did, that defense counsel \u201cin his impeachment of E sought to discredit her and [implied] that she was testifying falsely.\u201d E\u2019s inability to produce or to refer to any statement in her journals concerning the alleged sexual assault, when considered in tandem with her earlier statement that she had written in her journal everything that the defendant had done to her as it was happening and her admission that she did not initially tell her mother or sisters about her sexual encounters with the defendant, could lead the jury to conclude that her testimony was recently fabricated. Moreover, the journal entries admitted into evidence contained statements consistent with E\u2019s trial testimony. Affording the court broad discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>and indulging every reasonable presumption in favor of the court\u2019s ruling as our standard of review requires, we cannot say that the court abused its discretion in admitting into evidence, as prior consistent statements, E\u2019s two journal entries.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">The defendant next contends that the court improperly instructed the jury on the statutory requirements of \u00a7 53-21.* 1*3**<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At trial, the defendant neither filed a request to charge nor objected to the jury instructions that ultimately were given by the court. Because he did not properly preserve that claim, he seeks review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We review the defendant\u2019s claim because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>record is adequate for review and the claim is of constitutional magnitude. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>70 Conn. App. 393, 398, 797 A.2d 1190, cert. denied, 261 Conn. 924, 806 A.2d 1063 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">In instructing the jury on \u00a7 53-21, the risk of injury to a child statute, the court stated in relevant part: \u201c[T]he state must show that the defendant\u2019s behavior was likely to impair the child\u2019s health or morals. \u2018Likely\u2019 means in all probability or possibly\u2014or possibility rather. Probability or possibility. Thus, the state must show that it was possible or probable that the sexual and indecent behavior of the defendant would injure or weaken E\u2019s health or morals. There is no requirement that the state prove actual harm to E\u2019s health or morals.\u201d The defendant argues, and the state agrees, that the term \u201clikely to impair\u201d does not mean possible, as the court instructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">Our analysis is governed by the decision of our Supreme Court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Romero, </em>269 Conn. 481, 849 A.2d 760 (2004). In <em>Romero, </em>the trial court provided a verbatim instruction to the jury on the \u201clikely to impair\u201d requirement of \u00a7 53-21 that was identical to that at issue in the present case. Id., 488. On appeal, the Supreme Court concluded that \u201cthe term \u2018likely,\u2019 as used in \u00a7 53-21 (a), cannot be understood fairly to encompass a meaning of either \u2018possible\u2019 or \u2018in all possibility\u2019 and, therefore, the trial court\u2019s instructions to the contrary were improper.\u201d Id., 491. The court then considered whether, under <em>Golding\u2019s </em>third prong, there existed \u201ca reasonable possibility that the jury was misled by these improprieties.\u201d Id., 492. The court analyzed the charge as a whole: \u201c[W]e note that the trial court provided the jury with a thorough explanation of the concept of reasonable doubt and the state\u2019s burden of proving each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>element of each charge beyond all reasonable doubt. We further note that the trial court\u2019s instructions reduced \u00a7 53-21 (2) to three elements, reiterating the state\u2019s burden as to each of the elements. In this regard, the trial court instructed that the state had to prove beyond reasonable doubt that: (1) [the victim] was under the age of sixteen at the time of the criminal acts; (2) the defendant had contact with [the victim\u2019s] intimate parts and, in connection with the second risk of injury count, that the defendant had subjected [the victim] to contact with the defendant\u2019s intimate parts; and (3) such contact with intimate parts took place in a sexual and indecent manner that was likely to impair [the victim\u2019s] health or morals.\u201d Id., 492-93. The court concluded that, viewing the charge as a whole, \u201cthere does not exist a reasonable possibility that the jury was misled by the trial court\u2019s instructions as to the meaning of the term \u2018likely\u2019 in \u00a7 53-21 (2).\u201d Id., 494. Guided by the <em>Romero </em>precedent, this court reached a similar result in <em>State </em>v. <em>Michael A., </em>99 Conn. App. 251, 267, 913 A.2d 1081 (2007), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Ritrovato, </em>85 Conn. App. 575, 606, 858 A.2d 296 (2004), rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, 280 Conn. 36, 905 A.2d 1079 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">The court\u2019s charge in the present case, viewed as a whole, mirrors that at issue in <em>Romero. </em>The court provided an extensive explanation of reasonable doubt and the state\u2019s burden to establish under that standard that (1) E \u201cwas under the age of sixteen at the time of the alleged incident,\u201d (2) that \u201cthe defendant had contact with the intimate parts of E,\u201d and (3) that \u201cthe contact with the intimate parts of E took place in a sexual and indecent manner, which was likely to impair the health or morals of a child, that is, E.\u201d The court further instructed the jury that said contact \u201cmust have taken place in a sexual and indecent manner as opposed to an innocent touching or an accidental, inadvertent or reflexive touching.\u201d In addition, the court later correctly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>defined \u201clikely,\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 53-21, stating that the term \u201cmeans in all probability or probably\u201d when instructing the jury on an additional risk of injury to a child count. Finally, as the state observes, because the jury found the defendant guilty of having sexual intercourse with someone younger than age sixteen, \u201cit is difficult to imagine a finding that this conduct could not be deemed likely\u2014in the context of probably\u2014to impair [the victim\u2019s] morals.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Romero, </em>supra, 269 Conn. 493. Accordingly, we conclude that, considering the instructional impropriety within the context of the entire charge, there is no reasonable possibility that the jury was misled.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b402-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-71 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of sexual assault in the second degree when such person engages in sexual intercourse with another person and: (1) Such other person is thirteen years of age or older but under sixteen years of age and the actor is more than two years older than such person . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">General Statutes \u00a7 53-21 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person who ... (2) has contact with the intimate parts, as defined in section 53a-65, of a child under the age of sixteen years or subjects a child under sixteen years of age to contact with the intimate parts of such person, in a sexual and indecent manner likely to impair the health or morals of such child . . . shall be guilty of ... a class B felony . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-11\">We note that the conduct that gave rise to the risk of injury charge allegedly occurred between March, 1999, and October, 2002. Although \u00a7 53-21 was amended during that time, there is ho dispute that the conduct in which the defendant allegedly engaged was prohibited under all of the revisions of the statute applicable during that time period. In the interest of simplicity, we refer to the current revision of \u00a7 53-21.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b402-12\"> In accordance with our policy of protecting the privacy interests of the victims of sexual abuse and the crime of risk of injury to a child, we decline to identify the victims or others through whom the victims\u2019 identities may be ascertained. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-86e.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b403-8\"> The amended information included four counts pertaining to the alleged sexual assault and risk of injury to L. Because the jury found the defendant not guilty of those charges, we do not detail them here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b404-10\"> The terms journal and diary are used interchangeably in both the parties\u2019 briefs and the record before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b408-9\"> Because we conclude that the court properly admitted the journal entries as prior consistent statements offered to rebut a charge of recent fabrication, we do not consider alternate grounds of admission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b412-8\"> The defendant also claims that the court improperly failed to provide a limiting instruction to the jury regarding the admission of E\u2019s journal entries. The defendant failed to preserve that claim at trial and now requests <em>Golding </em>review. See <em>State </em>v. Golding, 213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). This court has held that the failure of the trial court, sua sponte, to provide such a limiting instruction is not of constitutional dimension. We stated: \u201c[T]he failure of the trial court to give a limiting instruction concerning the use of evidence ... is not a matter of constitutional magnitude. . . . Absent a claim of constitutional magnitude, the defendant\u2019s unpreserved claim fails to satisfy the second prong of <em>Golding </em>and is, therefore, not reviewable.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Wild, </em>43 Conn. App. 458, 467, 684 A.2d 720, cert. denied, 239 Conn. 954, 688 A.2d 326 (1996); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Ramirez, </em>101 Conn. App. 283, 297, 921 A.2d 702 (well established in Connecticut that trial court generally not obligated, sua sponte, to give limiting instruction), cert. denied, 283 Conn. 909, 928 A.2d 539 (2007), cert. denied, 552 U.S. 1109, 128 S. Ct. 895, 169 L. Ed. 2d 747 (2008). The claim fails.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b412-9\"> Under <em>Golding, </em>\u201ca defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if <em>all </em>of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. In the absence of any one of these conditions, the defendant\u2019s claim will fail.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40. <em>Golding\u2019s </em>first two prongs relate to whether a defendant\u2019s claim is reviewable, and the last two relate to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>substance of the actual review. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jarrett, </em>82 Conn. App. 489, 492 n.1, 845 A,2d 476, cert. denied, 269 Conn. 911, 852 A.2d 741 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
