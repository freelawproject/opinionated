The defendant was sentenced to a total effective term of forty years imprisonment. On appeal, the defendant claims that his right to a fair trial was violated due to prosecutorial improprieties<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> occurring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>in rebuttal to his closing argument.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We hold that the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial was not violated. We accordingly affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On November 13, 2004, the defendant, accompanied by Renel Romias and Marvin Nowell, went to the home of Randy Johnson and his parents located at 261 Ely Avenue, Norwalk. Johnson and Darrel McFadden were at the Johnson home. The five men spoke in the hallway of the Johnson home where the defendant suggested that they rob a taxicab. The defendant stated that he had done it before and that it was easy. The individuals agreed on a plan in which Johnson would call a taxicab, and, when it arrived, they would threaten the driver with firearms. Johnson called the taxicab company and requested a pickup at 249 Ely Avenue. The five men walked to 249 Ely Avenue to wait for the taxicab. Romias was armed with a shotgun, and the defendant carried a Derringer handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">Ralph Moreau drove the taxicab that responded to the call. When Moreau arrived at 249 Ely Avenue, Romias opened the driver\u2019s side door and held a shotgun to Moreau\u2019s face. The defendant went to the passenger side door and pointed a handgun at Moreau\u2019s face. Romias and the defendant ordered Moreau out of the car. Moreau attempted to drive off, but the defendant shot him twice. The defendant and the other men then ran from the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>At approximately 4:15 a.m., the Norwalk police department received a report of a possible motor vehicle accident at 309 Ely Avenue. Officer John James Haggerty and Officer Anthony DePanfilis arrived to find Moreau\u2019s taxicab wedged in between two trees so that they could not open its doors. The taxicab\u2019s engine was still running. Moreau appeared to be gasping for air so the officers broke the window of the taxicab so they could get inside. Paramedics took over soon after the officers had broken the window, and they removed Moreau from the taxicab. At that time, the police investigated the scene as a motor vehicle accident. It was not until Moreau arrived at a hospital that medical staff discovered his gunshot wounds. Moreau subsequently succumbed to his injuries. The medical examiner determined that Moreau died from two gunshot wounds and classified his death as a homicide. The police recovered the two bullets and determined they were .22 caliber bullets. A Derringer handgun is capable of firing a .22 caliber bullet, but a shotgun is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">A few days later, the defendant visited the Johnson home and stated to Randy Johnson in the presence of McFadden and Syreeta Johnson, Randy Johnson\u2019s sister, that he did not mean to shoot the victim, did not want to go to jail, and planned to blame the murder on Romias and to flee to Florida. Detective Ben Trabka of the Shelton police department, the husband of Tracey Trabka, the defendant\u2019s former schoolteacher with whom the defendant continued to maintain a relationship, testified that the defendant left a message on his wife\u2019s voice mail, in which the defendant identified himself. Detective Trabka testified that the defendant stated in that message that \u201cwhen he went to Norwalk, everyone said he was going to fuck up, and that\u2019s exactly what he did; he went to Norwalk and fucked up. He was looking at a lot of years of jail. His aunt had hired him a lawyer, and it was about the cab shit. It was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>taxi murder. It was in South Norwalk in Roodner Court where he lives. He was looking at charges. He was looking at conspiracy, conspiracy robbeiy, conspiracy murder. It didn\u2019t look good. And he continued to say that all of his boys were locked up, and he was the last one out.\u201d The state also admitted into evidence a recording of that voice mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">At some point, the defendant went to Florida. The Norwalk police obtained an arrest warrant for the defendant, and he was arrested in Florida on December 16, 2004. After the defendant waived extradition, the Norwalk police department transported him back to Connecticut. A jury subsequently found the defendant guilty of felony murder, attempt to commit robbery in the first degree and conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">The defendant claims on appeal that eight statements made by the prosecutor during rebuttal in closing arguments to the jury were improper personal opinions and that four of the statements also referred to facts that were not in evidence. The defendant claims that these statements deprived him of his right to a fair trial under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">At the outset, we first note that the defendant failed to object or otherwise to preserve the claim of prosecutorial impropriety by way of objections or motions for a mistrial. Nonetheless, \u201ca defendant who fails to preserve claims of prosecutorial [impropriety] need not seek to prevail under the specific requirements of <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), and, similarly, it is unnecessary for a reviewing court to apply the four-pronged <em>Golding </em>test. . . . The reason for this is that the defendant in a claim of prosecutorial [impropriety] must establish that the prosecutorial [impropriety] was so serious as to amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>to a denial of due process .... In evaluating whether the [impropriety] rose to this level, we consider the factors enumerated by th[e] court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>204 Conn. 523, 540, 529 A.2d 653 (1987). . . . These factors include the extent to which the [impropriety] was invited by defense conduct or argument, the severity of the [impropriety], the frequency of the [impropriety], the centrality of the [impropriety] to the critical issues in the case, the strength of the curative measures adopted, and the strength of the state\u2019s case. . . . The consideration of the fairness of the entire trial through the <em>Williams </em>factors duplicates, and, thus makes superfluous, a separate application of the <em>Golding </em>test. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">\u201cThis does not mean, however, that the absence of an objection at trial does not play a significant role in the application of the <em>Williams </em>factors. To the contrary, the determination of whether a new trial or proceeding is warranted depends, in part, on whether defense counsel has made a timely objection to any [incident] of the prosecutor\u2019s improper [conduct]. When defense counsel does not object, request a curative instruction or move for a mistrial, he presumably does not view the alleged impropriety as prejudicial enough to seriously jeopardize the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. . . . [Thus], the fact that defense counsel did not object to one or more incidents of [impropriety] must be considered in determining whether and to what extent the [impropriety] contributed to depriving the defendant of a fair trial and whether, therefore, reversal is warranted. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">\u201c[I]n analyzing claims of prosecutorial [impropriety], we engage in a two step analytical process. The two steps are separate and distinct: (1) whether [impropriety] occurred in the first instance; and (2) whether that [impropriety] deprived a defendant of his due process right to a fair trial. Put differently, [impropriety] is [impropriety], regardless of its ultimate effect on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>fairness of the trial; whether that [impropriety] caused or contributed to a due process violation is a separate and distinct question .... As we have indicated, our determination of whether any improper conduct by the state\u2019s attorney violated the defendant\u2019s fair trial rights is predicated on the factors set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>213 Conn. 540, with due consideration of whether that [impropriety] was objected to at trial.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Warholic, </em>278 Conn. 354, 360-62, 897 A.2d 569 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">In determining whether an impropriety has occurred in closing arguments, \u201cthe reviewing court must give due deference to the fact that [cjounsel must be allowed a generous latitude in argument, as the limits of legitimate argument and fair comment cannot be determined precisely by rule and line, and something must be allowed for the zeal of counsel in the heat of argument. . . . Thus, as the state\u2019s advocate, a prosecutor may argue the state\u2019s case forcefully, [provided the argument is] fair and based upon the facts in evidence and the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom. . . . Moreover, [i]t does not follow . . . that every use of rhetorical language or device [by the prosecutor] is improper. . . . The occasional use of rhetorical devices is simply fair argument. . . . Nevertheless, the prosecutor has a heightened duty to avoid argument that strays from the evidence or diverts the jury\u2019s attention from the facts of the case. . . . This heightened duty derives from . . . the special role played by the state\u2019s attorney in a criminal trial. He is not only an officer of the court. . . but is also a high public officer, representing the people of the [s]tate, who seek impartial justice for the guilty as much as for the innocent. In discharging his most important duties, he deserves and receives in peculiar degree the support of the court and the respect of the citizens of the county. By reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>of his office, he usually exercises great influence upon jurors. His conduct and language in the trial of cases in which human life or liberty [is] at stake should be forceful, but fair, because he represents the public interest, which demands no victim and asks no conviction through the aid of passion, prejudice, or resentment.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Camacho, 282 Conn. 328, 367-68, 924 A.2d 99, cert. denied, 552 U.S. 956, 128 S. Ct. 388, 169 L. Ed. 2d 273 (2007). \u201cIf the accused be guilty, he should [nonetheless] be convicted only after a fair trial, conducted strictly according to the sound and well-established rules which the laws prescribe. While the privilege of counsel in addressing the jury should not be too closely narrowed or unduly hampered, it must never be used as a license to state, or to comment upon, or to suggest an inference from, facts not in evidence, or to present matters which the jury ha[s] no right to consider.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Skakel, </em>276 Conn. 633, 745-46 888 A.2d 985, cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1030, 127 S. Ct. 1030, 166 L. Ed. 2d 428 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">With these principles in mind, we turn to the defendant\u2019s specific allegations of prosecutorial impropriety, keeping in mind that the defendant did not object at trial to any of the statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">IMPROPER PERSONAL OPINIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b834-9\">The defendant claims that eight statements made by the prosecutor during rebuttal were improper because they expressed his personal opinion as to the credibility of witnesses and the defendant\u2019s guilt. The state conceded that one of these statements was improper, namely, that the only honor in the case lies with the jury \u201chaving the guts\u201d to find the defendant guilty.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>is not necessary, therefore, for us to determine the propriety of that statement. We examine the remaining seven remarks, however, and determine that none of them was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">The defendant contends that the prosecutor expressed an improper personal opinion when he described as \u201chonorable\u201d the officers who found Moreau shortly after he was shot.* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We disagree. A prosecutor may not vouch for the integrity of his witness. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>41 Conn. App. 180, 183, 674 A.2d 1372, cert. denied, 237 Conn. 925, 677 A.2d 950 (1996). The propriety of the prosecutor\u2019s statement must, however, be examined in the context in which it was made. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Fauci, </em>282 Conn. 23, 37-38, 917 A.2d 978 (2007). In the present case, defense counsel argued in closing argument that the defendant\u2019s fingerprints were not discovered on Moreau\u2019s taxicab. The prosecutor\u2019s statement at issue responded to defense counsel\u2019s argument by arguing that the police were more concerned with saving Moreau\u2019s life than with gathering evidence. Furthermore, the credibility of the police officers was never an issue at the trial. The prosecutor\u2019s statement drew directly upon the testimony of Officer Haggerty, who stated that the officers at the scene believed they had responded to a motor vehicle accident, not an assault. Viewed in this context, it is clear that the prosecutor used the term honorable to explain the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>officers\u2019 conduct, not to vouch for the officers\u2019 credibility. Accordingly, the prosecutor\u2019s statement was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">The defendant argues next that it was improper for the prosecutor to state that there was \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d of the defendant\u2019s guilt.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We disagree. A prosecutor is entitled to comment on the strength of the state\u2019s evidence. <em>State </em>v. Moody, 77 Conn. App. 197, 217, 822 A.2d 990, cert. denied, 264 Conn. 918, 827 A.2d 707, cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1058, 124 S. Ct. 831, 157 L. Ed. 2d 714 (2003). A prosecutor may not state an opinion that a defendant is guilty, but a prosecutor may argue that the evidence proves a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Id. Accordingly, we find that it was not improper for the prosecutor to comment on the evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">The defendant argues next that the prosecutor stated numerous improper opinions concerning the credibility of the state\u2019s witnesses. We disagree. The statements at issue can be summarized as follows: (1) McFadden and Randy Johnson were telling the truth, playing \u201cthen-last card\u201d and were \u201cnot smart enough to he\u201d;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (2) McFadden and Randy Johnson were telling the truth and hoping for the best because they \u201clack criminal cunning,\u201d are not smart enough to think of anything else and were mad at the defendant for killing Moreau and getting them in trouble;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (3) the cooperation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>agreements given to McFadden and Randy Johnson could not have motivated statements given to police on November 22, 2004, because the statements preceded the cooperation agreements;* ***<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (4) an 18th century English author, Samuel Johnson, once said that any fool can tell the truth and that it takes a clever man to lie;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and (5) Syreeta Johnson may love her brother, but her testimony was nonetheless the truth because she was trying to \u201cpull herself out of . . . poverty,\u201d and \u201cshe wouldn\u2019t get involved in here if she had to do a lot of lying.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">It is not improper for a prosecutor to ask the jury to draw inferences and to exercise common sense. <em>State </em>v. <em>Fauci, </em>supra, 282 Conn. 37. A prosecutor may urge the jury to find for stated reasons that a witness was truthful or untruthful. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>269 Conn. 563, 585, 849 A.2d 626 (2004). A prosecutor may also \u201cremark on the motives that a witness may have to he, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>or not to lie, as the case may be.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. When a case involves two competing stories, a prosecutor may reasonably suggest that one is lying. <em>State </em>v. <em>Fauci, </em>supra, 48. \u201cThe distinguishing characteristic of impropriety in this circumstance is whether the prosecutor asks the jury to believe the testimony of the state\u2019s witnesses because the state thinks it is true, on the one hand, or whether the prosecutor asks the jury to believe it because logic reasonably thus dictates.\u201d Id. Additionally, a prosecutor may properly comment in closing argument on the lack of intelligence of the state\u2019s witnesses where the defense has brought their credibility into issue. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Dillard, </em>66 Conn. App. 238, 250-51 n. 13-14, 784 A.2d 387, cert. denied, 258 Conn. 943, 786 A.2d 431 (2001).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">The prosecutor\u2019s statements at issue here were not improper. The prosecutor never used the word \u201cI\u201d or stated that he based his argument on his personal beliefs. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Moody, </em>supra, 77 Conn. App. 217 (\u201cusing the pronoun I in an argument increases the chances that appropriately structured arguments will deteriorate into expressions of personal opinion\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). The prosecutor was entitled to apply common sense to the facts in evidence and to highlight Randy Johnson\u2019s, McFadden\u2019s and Syreeta Johnson\u2019s motives to tell the truth. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Fauci, </em>supra, 282 Conn. 37; <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>supra, 269 Conn. 585. Similarly, the prosecutor was entitled to refer to the fact that the testimony of the state\u2019s witnesses was by and large consistent. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Fauci, </em>supra, 47. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>It was also not improper for the prosecutor to reference a literary quotation. \u201cThe occasional use of rhetorical devices is simply fair argument.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Santiago, 269 Conn. 726, 747, 850 A.2d 199 (2004). Last, the prosecutor\u2019s statements regarding McFadden\u2019s and Randy Johnson\u2019s intelligence are nearly identical to those we held proper in <em>State </em>v. <em>Dillard, </em>supra, 66 Conn. App. 250-51 n. 13-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">Accordingly, we find that except for the statement conceded by the state to have been improper, the statements made by the prosecutor during rebuttal were not improper personal opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">FACTS THAT WERE NOT IN EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">The defendant argues that the prosecutor made four comments during rebuttal that referred improperly to facts that were not in evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-10\">The defendant argues first that the prosecutor\u2019s statements referring to Randy Johnson and McFadden playing their last card<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and lacking criminal cunning<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> improperly referenced facts that were not in evidence. \u201cA prosecutor may invite the jury to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence; however, he or she may not invite sheer speculation unconnected to evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>supra, 269 Conn. 587. The prosecutor\u2019s statements did not suggest that the prosecutor had specific knowledge as to Randy Johnson\u2019s and McFadden\u2019s state of mind or intelligence. Rather, he asked the jury to draw inferences from the facts that were in evidence. The jury could have inferred from Randy Johnson\u2019s and McFadden\u2019s testimony that they thought the best way to help themselves was to testify truthfully. The jury could also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>have inferred from the same testimony that Randy Johnson and McFadden were not cunning criminals. \u201c[A] court should not lightly infer that a prosecutor intends an ambiguous remark to have its most damaging meaning.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Moody, supra, 77 Conn. App. 216. Accordingly, we find that these statements did not refer improperly to facts that were not in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">The defendant argues next that the prosecutor referred improperly to facts that were not in evidence when he stated that McFadden\u2019s and Randy Johnson\u2019s testimony was not conjured to obtain the cooperation agreement.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The state admitted into evidence separate statements made by Randy Johnson and McFadden on November 22, 2004. McFadden also testified that he did not receive a cooperation agreement until the summer of 2005, and Randy Johnson\u2019s cooperation agreement, which was admitted into evidence, was dated September 19, 2005. This evidence suggests that McFadden\u2019s and Randy Johnson\u2019s testimony was not influenced by their cooperation agreements because the testimony was substantially similar to their statements made long before either witness was offered a cooperation agreement. See Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 6-11 (b) (\u201c[i]f the credibility of a witness is impeached by ... a suggestion of bias . . . evidence of a prior consistent statement made by the witness is admissible\u201d). Accordingly, we find the prosecutor\u2019s statement did not refer improperly to facts that were not in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">The defendant argues last that the prosecutor referred improperly to facts that were not in evidence when he stated that Syreeta Johnson was trying to \u201cpull herself out of . . . poverty . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Again, the propriety of this statement must be examined in its context. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>See <em>State </em>v. <em>Fauci, </em>supra, 282 Conn. 45. The defendant asked the jury during closing argument to \u201cconsider very strongly . . . what would Ms. Johnson do to protect the little baby brother that she helped raise.\u201d The prosecutor argued in rebuttal that \u201cthe way [Syreeta Johnson is] going, she wouldn\u2019t get involved in here if she had to do a lot of lying.\u201d The prosecutor asked the jury to draw that inference from the facts that were in evidence that Syreeta Johnson lived in a three bedroom apartment with her mother, father, two brothers and her son, worked thirty-five to forty hours per week and simultaneously took five classes at a community college.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">Accordingly, we find that the prosecutor\u2019s statement did not refer improperly to facts that were not in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">DUE PROCESS ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">We now turn to the question of whether the single instance of impropriety<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> \u201cso infected the trial with unfairness as to make the conviction a denial of due process.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>supra, 269 Conn. 589. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 540, our Supreme Court held that prosecutorial impropriety due process analysis focuses on the following factors: (1) the extent to which the impropriety was invited by the defense; (2) the frequency of the impropriety; (3) the severity of the impropriety; (4) the centrality of the impropriety to the critical issues in the case; (5) the strength of the state\u2019s case; and (6) the strength of the curative measures adopted by the court. These factors are viewed in light of the entire trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>supra, 574.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">Whether the Impropriety was Invited</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">The state does not argue that the defendant invited the single instance of prosecutorial impropriety. Accordingly, we agree with the defendant that he did not invite the prosecutor to argue to the jury that the only honor in the case lies with the jury \u201chaving the guts\u201d to stand up and say that the defendant was guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">Frequency and Severity</p>\n<p id=\"b842-10\">One instance of impropriety over the course of an entire trial is not frequent. See <em>State </em>v. Stevenson, supra, 269 Conn. 593-94. The conduct was also not severe. \u201cWe first note that we consider it highly significant that defense counsel failed to object to any of the improper remarks, request curative instructions, or move for a mistrial. . . . Given the defendant\u2019s failure to object, only instances of grossly egregious [impropriety] will be severe enough to mandate reversal.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>266 Conn. 440, 479-80, 832 A.2d 626 (2003). In <em>Thompson, </em>our Supreme Court held that impropriety was not severe when a prosecutor stated without objection that the defendants had \u201creserved a place in hell for themselves.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 480. On the basis of this precedent, we do not find that the conceded impropriety, which referred to the juror\u2019s honor, was severe.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-11\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b842-12\">Centrality to the Critical Issues and Strength of the State\u2019s Case</p>\n<p id=\"b842-13\">The state\u2019s evidence does not need to be overwhelming to support a conclusion that prosecutorial impropriety did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial. See id., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>482. In the present case, the evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt was strong. The state presented two witnesses who testified that they saw the defendant shoot Moreau, Syreeta Williams testified that the defendant admitted to shooting Moreau and expressed remorse, the defendant\u2019s confession on his teacher\u2019s answering machine corroborated the witnesses\u2019 testimony and the defendant\u2019s flight to Florida showed consciousness of guilt. See id., 481-82 (state\u2019s case strong when testimony placed defendant at site of shooting with gun in hand, police identified gunshot residue on defendant\u2019s jacket and defendant\u2019s conduct after shooting showed consciousness of guilt); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Figueroa, </em>257 Conn. 192, 196, 777 A.2d 587 (2001) (flight, when unexplained, tends to prove consciousness of guilt).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\">We also find that the impropriety was not central to the critical issues of the case. \u201cA prosecutor . . . may not appeal to the emotions, passions and prejudices of the jurors ... or otherwise inject extraneous issues into the case . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 473. The prosecutor\u2019s statement that referred to the jury\u2019s honor was extraneous to the issues properly before the jury. We find, however, that the statement was not central to the critical issues of the case because it did not contain any improper evidence establishing the defendant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">Curative Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">Although the court gave no instructions intended specifically to cure the single instance of prosecutorial impropriety, we note that the defendant did not object or request a special instruction. By failing to bring it to the attention of the court, the defendant bears much of the responsibility for the fact that this claimed impropriety was uncured. <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>supra, 269 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>597. Failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s argument when it was made suggests that defense counsel did not believe that it was unfair in light of the record of the case at the time. Id. In addition, the court reminded the jury in its general instructions that \u201c[c]ertain things are not evidence, and you may not consider them in deciding what the facts are. These include arguments and statements by lawyers. . . . [T]he credibility and believability of the witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony are matters entirely within your hands.\u201d We conclude, therefore, that the court\u2019s general curative instructions, when viewed in light of the other <em>Williams </em>factors, were sufficient to cure any harm to the defendant caused by the prosecutor\u2019s one instance of impropriety. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>supra, 598.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b828-12\"> Although most of the Supreme Court cases that we cite in this opinion refer to impropriety as misconduct, we have taken the liberty to substitute the noun impropriety for misconduct when quoting these opinions. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Fauci, </em>282 Conn. 23, 26 n.2, 917 A.2d 978 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b829-8\"> The state first argues that \u201cthis court should decline review of the defendant\u2019s claim[s] because he has inadequately briefed [them] by failing to cite any legal authority or analyze any case law dealing with alleged prosecutorial impropriety.\u201d See <em>State </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>94 Conn. App. 582, 592-93, 893 A.2d 495, cert. denied, 280 Conn. 901, 907 A.2d 91 (2006). Although the defendant\u2019s brief is lacking analysis, he does cite to seminal cases, and the crimes of which he was convicted were serious. We accordingly review his claims of prosecutorial impropriety.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b834-10\"> The prosecutor argued: \u201cAnd if you are confronted with proof beyond a reasonable doubt\u2014which you have been confronted with in this case\u2014 no matter how hard it is Tor you to say that someone who was seventeen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>years old at the time of this event, no matter how hard it is for you to say he\u2019s guilty and guilty of murder, your honor lies--and maybe the only honor in this case lies with you having the guts, the principle to come in here and stand up and say guilty because that\u2019s what the facts require and that\u2019s what the law requires.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b835-10\"> The prosecutor argued: \u201cThe first thing [defense] counsel talked about was that there was a lack of prints in the case. Now, if you recall the way this event happened, the police showed up at the scene of what they thought was a motor vehicle accident Now these are honorable men, and they don\u2019t show up at a scene where somebody\u2019s been injured and immediately start thinking about preserving prints when they think they may be able to save the man\u2019s life.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b836-8\"> The prosecutor argued: \u201cThe fact that firearms were not recovered does not contradict the ample corroboration in this case and overwhelming evidence in this case of that man\u2019s guilt.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b836-9\"> The prosecutor argued: \u201c[CJommon sense says that [if] Darrel McFadden and Randy Johnson wanted to gang up somehow and start telling a lot of lies . . . [t]he first thing they would have done was put that shotgun in his hand. They did not do that because they were telling the truth when they were in the station and when they were on the stand. And they were telling the truth because that\u2019s their last card left to play. They\u2019re just not smart enough to lie their way out of this . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b836-10\"> The prosecutor argued: \u201cThey\u2019re laying out the truth hoping for the best because that\u2019s all they can do. They really don\u2019t have any other choice, and they\u2019re not smart enough to think of another one. They lack criminal cunning. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>They\u2019re credible. They\u2019re credible because they\u2019re just not cunning enough to be otherwise. . . . They want to come in here and tell the truth about [the defendant] because he got them in so much trouble because he killed Ralph Moreau.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b837-11\"> The prosecutor argued: \u201c[C]ounsel talked again about cooperation agreements. Like I said, the cooperation\u2014the statements simply gave at the station precede the cooperation agreement. They\u2019re not the motivation. There\u2019s no story being conjured. They\u2019re not the cause of some kind of conjuring of some complex elaborate lie that these two gentlemen [who] had testified would never have been able to testily their way through the case with that type of elaborate anything.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b837-12\"> The prosecutor argued: \u201c[T]here\u2019s a man named Samuel Johnson who\u2019s a famous author; and he said: any fool can tell the truth. It takes a clever man to tell a lie. And the fact of the matter is, is it\u2019s just not smart enough to have done anything else but reach for the truth.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b837-13\"> The prosecutor argued: \u201cNow, Syreeta Johnson, she may <em>love </em>her brother. I mean, there\u2019s no reason to think that she wouldn\u2019t. She\u2019s trying to pull herself out of the poverty that she was born into obviously. You just have to use your common sense. I mean, basically what she said got said, fits in with everything else, that anger, that how to feel. Why did you have to kill an innocent man when you didn\u2019t have to? . . . And you know that the way that she\u2019s going, she wouldn\u2019t get involved in here if she had to do a lot of lying.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b838-7\"> In <em>Dillard, </em>this court held it was not improper for the prosecutor to state in closing argument: \u201cThen we come to Lonnie Cross. Lonnie Cross is a piece of work, and you\u2019d probably cross the street if you saw him come the other way. . . . Let me tell you another thing about people who commit crimes. People who commit crimes by and large are not smart. Lonnie Cross is not smart. Demetrius White is not smart. Neither is Julio Burgos. None of them are.
