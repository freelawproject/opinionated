Peay, brings a writ of error challenging the decision of the defendant in error, the sentence review division of the Superior Court (panel), affirming his sentence. On appeal, the plaintiff in error claims that the panel abused its discretion and violated his constitutional rights in concluding that he had a long criminal record. We conclude that the plaintiff in error failed to brief his claims adequately and to provide this court with an adequate record for review and, accordingly, dismiss the writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-11\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant. On April 17,2003, the plaintiff in error was arrested after striking the victim with a crowbar. He was found guilty of two counts of burglary in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-101 (a) (1) and (2), assault in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (2), and interfering with an officer in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-167a (a). See <em>State </em>v. <em>Peay, </em>96 Conn. App. 421, 423, 900 A.2d 577, cert. denied, 280 Conn. 909, 908 A.2d 541 (2006). On March 8, 2004, the court, <em>Keller, J., </em>sentenced the plaintiff in error to twelve years incarceration with a five year mandatory minimum. On October 24, 2006, the panel, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number><em>Iannotti, Mia\u00f1o </em>and <em>Espinosa, Js., </em>affirmed the sentence. In its report, the panel stated that it had considered the plaintiff in error\u2019s \u201cpositive attributes,\u201d the severity of the injuries he inflicted on April 17, 2003, and the fact that his \u201crecord dates back to 1974\u201d and \u201cis replete with both felonies and misdemeanors.\u201d On July 11, 2007, the plaintiff in error filed a writ of error in our Supreme Court, which transferred it to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">On appeal, the plaintiff in error claims that the panel abused its discretion when it found that he had a lengthy criminal record and that it utilized an illegal application of the habitual offender statute. \u201c[T]he legislature passed the Sentence Review Act in 1957 ... to reduce the disparity in sentences meted out by different judges and, thereby, to quell prisoner discontent.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>James L. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>245 Conn. 132, 144, 712 A.2d 947 (1998). \u201cThe review division shall review the sentence imposed and determine whether [it] should be modified because it is inappropriate or disproportionate in the light of the nature of the offense, the character of the offender, the protection of the public interest, and the deterrent, rehabilitative, isolative, and denunciatory purposes for which the sentence was intended.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 43-28. The panel\u2019s actions are reviewed for an abuse of discretion. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>192 Conn. 471, 475-76, 479, 472 A.2d 1267 (1984). The plaintiff in error bears the burden of providing this court with an adequate record for review. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hannah, </em>104 Conn. App. 710, 714, 935 A.2d 645 (2007), cert. denied, 285 Conn. 916, 943 A.2d 475 (2008); see also Practice Book \u00a7 61-10. Additionally, \u201c[w]e are not required to review issues that have been improperly presented to this court through an inadequate brief. . . . Analysis, rather than mere abstract assertion, is required in order to avoid abandoning an issue by failing to brie f [it] properly. \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Blango, </em>103 Conn. App. 100, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>116 n.11, 927 A.2d 964, cert. denied, 284 Conn. 919, 933 A.2d 721 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">We conclude that we cannot determine, on the basis of the record before this court, whether the panel abused its discretion when it relied on the plaintiff in error\u2019s criminal record. We have not been presented with the presentence report, the transcript of the sentencing hearing from March 8, 2004, or any other information that the panel considered before it affirmed the plaintiff in error\u2019s sentence. We cannot further analyze this claim without an adequate record. We also conclude that we cannot analyze the plaintiff in error\u2019s claims that the panel illegally applied the \u201chabitual offender statute\u201d or designated him to be a \u201ccareer criminal\u201d because the plaintiff in error does not specify the statute that he is referring to or provide any meaningful legal analysis of either claim. \u201cAlthough we are solicitous of the fact that the [plaintiff in error] is a pro se litigant, the statutes and rules of practice cannot be ignored completely. . . . We are not required to review issues that have been improperly presented to this court through an inadequate brief.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cooke </em>v. <em>Cooke, </em>99 Conn. App. 347, 352-53, 913 A.2d 480 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">The writ of error is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
