Because we conclude that the United States Postal Service is not an employer within the ambit of the Connecticut Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (act), General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 et seq., we affirm the decision of the workers\u2019 compensation review board.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\">The relevant facts are not in dispute. On July 13,2004, the plaintiff, Lynn Lopa, sustained a compensable injury to her lower back arising out of her employment with the defendant Brinker International, Inc.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On the date of the injury, she worked for the defendant, Timothy\u2019s Tavern and the United States Postal Service. The trial commissioner (commissioner) concluded that the compensation rate should be calculated on the basis of the plaintiffs concurrent earnings with the defendant and Timothy\u2019s Tavern.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The commissioner rejected the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>plaintiffs assertion that the United States Postal Service wages should be included in her average weekly wage on the ground that the federal government is not an employer within the meaning of the act. The workers\u2019 compensation review board (board) affirmed the commissioner\u2019s decision and this appeal followed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">We begin with a brief overview of the purpose, relevant provisions and relevant jurisdictional confines of the act. \u201cThe purpose of the workmen\u2019s compensation statute is to compensate the worker for injuries arising out of and in the course of employment, without regard to fault, by imposing a form of strict liability on the employer. . . . The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act compromise [s] an employee\u2019s right to a common law tort action for work related injuries in return for relatively quick and certain compensation.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Panaro </em>v. <em>Electrolux Corp., </em>208 Conn. 589, 598-99, 545 A.2d 1086 (1988). Our Supreme Court has \u201cobserved that the workers\u2019 compensation commission, like any administrative body, must act strictly within its statutory authority .... It cannot modify, abridge, or otherwise change the statutory provisions under which it acquires authority unless the statutes expressly grant it that power. ... A commissioner may exercise jurisdiction to hear a claim only under the precise circumstances and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>the manner particularly prescribed by the enabling legislation. . . . [I]t is settled law that the commissioner\u2019s jurisdiction is confined by the [act] and limited by its provisions.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Discuillo </em>v. <em>Stone &amp; Webster, </em>242 Conn. 570, 576, 698 A.2d 873 (1997). \u201cThe parties cannot confer jurisdiction upon the commissioner by agreement, waiver or conduct.\u201d <em>Kinney </em>v. <em>State, </em>213 Conn. 54, 60, 566 A.2d 670 (1989). \u201cThe [act] is not triggered by a claimant until he brings himself within its statutory ambit.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 59. \u201cAlthough the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act should be broadly construed to accomplish its humanitarian purpose ... its remedial purpose cannot transcend its statutorily defined jurisdictional boundaries.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 58-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">The dispositive issue in the plaintiffs appeal is whether the United States Postal Service, which is \u201can independent establishment of the executive branch of the Government of the United States\u201d; 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 201; falls within the definition of \u201cemployer\u201d under the act. Whether the postal service may be an employer under the act presents a question of statutory interpretation over which our review is plenary. See <em>Rivers </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>288 Conn. 1, 10, 950 A.2d 1247 (2008). \u201cWhen construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. ... In seeking to determine that meaning [General Statutes] \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered. . . . When a statute is not plain and unambiguous, we also look for interpretive guidance to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter . . . .\u201d <em>Rivers </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>supra, 10-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">Section 31-275 (10) of the act defines \u201cemployer\u201d as \u201cany person, corporation, limited liability company, firm, partnership, voluntary association, joint stock association, the state and any public corporation within the state using the services of one or more employees for pay, or the legal representative of any such employer . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (10). Both parties agree, as does this court, that the only portion of the definition of \u201cemployer\u201d that the postal service might satisfy is \u201cpublic corporation within the state.\u201d Because the meaning of a \u201cpublic corporation within the state\u201d is not readily ascertainable from the language of the statute, we turn to other sources for explication.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">The definition of employer under \u00a7 31-275 (10) has remained essentially unchanged since the act\u2019s enactment in 1913.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> During the committee hearings on the bill that became chapter 138 of the 1913 Public Acts, professor Willard C. Fisher, an economist at Wesleyan University who had been engaged by the standing committees on judiciary and labor to assist in drafting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>act, remarked that \u201cthe law ought to be as wide as possible in its scope; there ought to be no employment left out that can practicably be included.\u201d Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 1, 1913 Sess., p. 197. Fisher stated further that \u201cthere is no good reason for excluding employment of public corporations; I mean truly public corporations, the state, the city and the like.\u201d Id., p. 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-4\">Black\u2019s Law Dictionary provides one definition of a \u201cpublic corporation\u201d as: \u201cA corporation that is created by the state as an agency in the administration of civil government. ... A government-owned corporation that engages in activities that benefit the general public . . . .\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7th Ed. 1999). These definitions are consistent with our case law. See <em>Norwich </em>v. <em>Housing Authority, </em>216 Conn. 112, 121, 579 A.2d 50 (1990); <em>Housing Authority </em>v. <em>Dorsey, </em>164 Conn. 247, 251, 320 A.2d 820 (housing authority is public corporation created by municipality to exercise certain delegated sovereign powers), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1043, 94 S. Ct. 548, 38 L. Ed. 2d 335 (1973); <em>Local 530, AFSCME, Council 15 </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>9 Conn. App. 260, 262, 518 A.2d 941 (1986) (water authority created as public corporation to provide and assure provision of adequate supply of pure water at reasonable cost).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Analogously, the United States Postal Service was created by the federal government for a public purpose. Therefore, it appears to meet a definition of a \u201cpublic corporation.\u201d And, if we attribute \u201cwithin the state\u201d with its ordinary meaning in regard to geography,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we could conclude, as a matter of pure linguistics, that the United States Postal Service fits into the definition of \u201cemployer\u201d under \u00a7 31-275 (10). Such an interpretation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>would be particularly desirable in this case, from the plaintiffs viewpoint, because if the plaintiff had been employed full-time by virtually any other entity, her wages from that employment would have been used to calculate her compensation under General Statutes \u00a7 31-310. If we could apply this interpretation only to this case and, thus, only to \u00a7 31-310, the second injury fund would be implicated, not the postal service or the federal government.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">We cannot, however, interpret the term \u201cemployer\u201d in a vacuum or as it relates solely to \u00a7 31-310, which is only one portion of the workers\u2019 compensation scheme. When interpreting the definition of \u201cemployer,\u201d we must be mindful that the definition set forth in \u00a7 31-275 (10) applies to the entire statutory scheme, and not merely to \u00a7 31-310. \u201cThe entire statutory scheme of the [act] is directed toward those who are in the employer-employee relationship as those terms are defined in the act and discussed in our cases. That relationship is threshold to the rights and benefits under the act . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Vanzant </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>219 Conn. 674, 678, 594 A.2d 967 (1991). Thus, in determining who falls within the ambit of \u201cemployer\u201d under \u00a7 31-275 (10), we must ensure that that definition may be applied consistently throughout the entire act because we cannot have different meanings of the word \u201cemployer\u201d for different parts of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">There are many provisions in the act that impose statutory requirements on employers.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because the postal service is part of the federal government, and because the federal government has not expressly consented to the jurisdiction of our act, we do not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>the authority to require the federal government to comply with our state statutes. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>445 U.S. 535, 538, 100 S. Ct. 1349, 63 L. Ed. 2d 607 (1980). Accordingly, because the term \u201cemployer\u201d could not include the federal government for purposes of those provisions of the act that require statutory compliance, neither can it be so for \u00a7 31-310. To hold otherwise would impermissibly posit two different meanings of \u201cemployer\u201d to be used throughout one uniform statutory scheme.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">In light of the foregoing, we conclude that the United States Postal Service is not an employer within the meaning of \u00a7 31-275 (10) and, accordingly, that the board properly affirmed the commissioner\u2019s determination that the plaintiffs postal wages should not be used in calculating her compensation benefits under \u00a731-310.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">The decision of the workers\u2019 compensation review board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b849-5\"> Liberty Mutual Group, Inc., and the second injury fund are also defendants in this action.

Where the injured employee has worked for more than one employer as of the date of the injury and the average weekly wage received from the employer in whose employ the employee was injured, as determined under the provisions of this section, are insufficient to obtain the maximum weekly compensation rate from the employer under section 31-309, prevailing as of the date of the injury, the injured employee\u2019s average weekly wages shall be calculated upon the basis of wages earned from all such employers in the period of concurrent employment not in excess of fifty-two weeks prior to the date of the injury, but the employer in whose employ the injury occurred shall be liable for all medical and hospital costs and a portion of the compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>rate equal to seventy-five per cent of the average weekly wage paid by the employer to the injured employee, after such earnings have been reduced by any deduction for federal or state taxes, or both, and for the federal Insurance Contribution Act made from such employee\u2019s total wages received from such employer during the period of calculation of such average weekly wage, but not less than an amount equal to the minimum compensation rate prevailing as of the date of the injury.
