On appeal, the petitioner claims that the court improperly concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>that he was not denied the effective assistance of trial counsel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the habeas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">The petitioner was convicted of assault in the first degree and violation of probation for stabbing Bobby Johnson during a dice game on July 17, 1999. Johnson claimed that the petitioner was the aggressor, and the petitioner claimed that he acted in self-defense. The petitioner was sentenced to twenty-four years in prison. His conviction was upheld by this court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Vasquez, </em>80 Conn. App. 907, 838 A.2d 259 (2003), cert. denied, 267 Conn. 917, 841 A.2d 1190 (2004). In his amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus, the petitioner alleged in relevant part that his trial counsel \u201cdid not present available information to impeach prosecution witnesses.\u201d At trial, the petitioner claimed that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to examine Johnson\u2019s treating physician, Joseph Dineen, with respect to Johnson\u2019s ability to recall facts following the stabbing. Dineen was called to testify at the habeas trial with respect to that issue.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Following the habeas trial, the court found that Johnson\u2019s most relevant testimony at the criminal trial concerned what had transpired during the dice game that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>led to the stabbing. In that regard, the court found specifically that Johnson\u2019s \u201ctestimony is clear. It is concise. It is internally consistent, and there is no indication of any amnesia . . . .\u201d Johnson\u2019s testimony of what happened following the stabbing, when he was in the hospital, however, was vague. Dineen testified at the habeas trial that Johnson could have suffered some sort of amnesia, but Dineen did not <em>testify </em>that amnesia was a certainty. According to Dineen, Johnson suffered some sort of temporary memory loss that improved after his discharge and that was a typical course of recovery. The court concluded that trial counsel\u2019s examination of Dineen arguably was deficient but that the petitioner failed to demonstrate that had trial counsel examined Dineen with regard to Johnson\u2019s alleged memory loss, the outcome of the criminal trial would have been different, because the answer to that question would amount to speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">\u201cWhether the representation a defendant received at trial was constitutionally inadequate is a mixed question of law and fact. ... As such, that question requires plenary review by [an appellate] court unfettered by the clearly erroneous standard.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>285 Conn. 556, 576, 941 A.2d 248 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">\u201cTo determine whether the petitioner has demonstrated that counsel\u2019s performance was ineffective, we apply the two part test established in <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984). Claims of ineffective assistance during a criminal proceeding must be supported by evidence establishing that (1) counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, <em>and </em>(2) counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced the defense because there was a reasonable probability that the outcome of the proceedings would have been different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>had it not been for the deficient performance. \u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Jarrett v. Commissioner of Correction, </em>108 Conn. App. 59, 70, 947 A.2d 395, cert. denied, 288 Conn. 910, 953 A.2d 653 (2008). \u201cA reasonable probability is one which is sufficient to undermine confidence in the result.\u201d <em>Ruffin v. Commissioner of Correction, </em>106 Conn. App. 396, 399, 943 A.2d 1105, cert. denied, 286 Conn. 922, 949 A.2d 481 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">On the basis of our review of the evidence presented at the habeas trial, particularly Dineen\u2019s testimony, we agree with the court that there is no reasonable probability that the outcome of the criminal trial would have been different had trial counsel examined Dineen with regard to Johnson\u2019s ability to remember the incident and his hospitalization. To conclude that the outcome would have been different would amount to speculation. The transcript reveals that at the habeas trial, the petitioner\u2019s counsel asked Dineen whether it was more likely than not that Johnson \u201cwould have suffered some memory issues or amnesia.\u201d Dineen responded: \u201cI believe that because of the low [blood] pressure when he first entered the emergency room [with a reading of] sixty, because of the head injury and because of the medication he received postoperatively, that it\u2019s more likely than not to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that [he was] amnesic for the events of the injury and his care.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The question posed to Dineen, however, was not limited to any specific period of time, particularly his opinion of Johnson\u2019s ability to remember the underlying incident at the time of the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial. Moreover, during the habeas trial, Dineen testified on cross-examination that Johnson\u2019s amnesia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>\u201ceventually improved after discharge.\u201d Of key importance is the habeas court\u2019s finding that Johnson\u2019s trial testimony about the dice game and stabbing was clear and concise. Johnson\u2019s vague testimony about his hospitalization was unrelated to the crimes with which the petitioner had been charged.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> For that reason, we conclude that the court properly denied the petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b310-7\"> In his statement of the issue in his appellate brief, the petitioner claims that trial counsel failed to impeach the victim, Bobby Johnson. That specific claim is not alleged in the amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus, and the court did not address it. This court does not address claims that were not raised at trial or decided by the habeas court. We therefore decline to review this claim. See <em>Moody </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>108 Conn. App. 96, 103, 946 A.2d 1268, cert. denied, 288 Conn. 906, 953 A.2d 649 (2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b310-8\"> According to Dineen, Johnson was driven by an unknown person to St. Mary\u2019s Hospital in Waterbury. As Johnson walked unattended into the emergency room, he fell and struck his head on the pavement. Johnson had low blood pressure, indicating a diminished flow of blood to his brain. Blood was flowing from Johnson\u2019s ears, indicating intracranial pressure caused by head trauma. Johnson\u2019s more severe injury, however, was a laceration to the right ventricle of his heart. According to Dineen, anterograde and retrograde amnesia could result from head trauma or trauma to other parts of the body that cause loss of blood and blood flow to the brain, and from anesthesia and pain relieving medication. Such memory loss is temporary, and postdischarge, a patient\u2019s memory would improve.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b312-6\"> The medical definition or meaning of amnesia, its implications and whether memory loss was permanent or transient were not entered into evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b313-10\"> During the criminal trial, the petitioner claimed that he had stabbed Johnson in self-defense. Johnson testified that the petitioner was the aggressor. The issue for the jury therefore was one of credibility. Appellate courts do not second-guess the trier of fact with respect to credibility. See <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>109 Conn. App. 758, 763, 953 A.2d 685 (2008). As the habeas court noted, Johnson\u2019s ability to recall his hospitalization was not at issue; the issue was how and why he was stabbed. Members of the jury are permitted to rely on their life experience; common sense is not left at the courthouse door. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>273 Conn. 330, 343, 869 A.2d 1224 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">Given Dineen\u2019s testimony as to the seriousness of Johnson\u2019s injuries, the medical treatment Johnson received and the pain relievers administered to him; see footnote 2; members of the jury may have understood full well why Johnson\u2019s testimony about his hospital treatment was vague. Moreover, with respect to credibility, there was evidence before the jury that the petitioner had numerous felony convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
