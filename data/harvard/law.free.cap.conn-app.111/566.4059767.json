J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJh\">In this case, we are called on to determine whether a rule of practice requiring a \u201creview of the finding of facts and hearing on any objections\u201d to a fact finder\u2019s report requires that the trial court listen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>to the arguments of counsel. We conclude that it does. Following the rule of construction that specific provisions prevail over more general provisions, we conclude that a hearing was required even where oral argument was not requested specifically by the objecting party.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">The defendant Michael B. Guarco<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeals from the judgment of the trial court in favor of the plaintiff, Dartmoor Condominium Association, Inc., rendered in accordance with the report of an attorney fact finder. The defendant claims that (1) the court improperly rendered judgment without holding a hearing on his objection to the fact finder\u2019s report, (2) the fact finder improperly relied on evidence not before it and (3) certain findings of the fact finder were clearly erroneous. We agree with the defendant\u2019s first claim and determine it to be dispositive of the matter.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We, therefore, reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">The facts and procedural history necessary to our resolution of this appeal are as follows. In 1998, the defendant and Theodor Perez acquired title to certain property on Mayfield Drive, a private drive in Enfield. The property was subject to the terms and conditions of a private road maintenance agreement. Under the agreement, the defendant and Perez were obligated to pay six eighths of the maintenance costs of Mayfield Drive and its related improvements to the plaintiff, which the agreement designated as the managing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">On April 19, 2005, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint against the defendant and Perez, alleging breach of the agreement. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant and Perez had failed to make payments required by the agreement since December, 2003. The matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>was referred to an attorney fact finder, who took evidence on February 13, April 30 and May 7, 2007. On May 23, 2007, the fact finder filed with the court his findings of fact in which he recommended judgment in favor of the plaintiff in the amount of $23,362.50 plus court costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 23-57, the defendant filed an objection to the findings of fact on June 6, 2007. The objection did not contain a request for oral argument. On June 13, 2007, Perez filed an objection joining in the defendant\u2019s objection. Thereafter, without holding a hearing on the objections, the court issued two notices. The first, filed June 21, 2007, stated: \u201cThe foregoing objection having been heard by this court, it is hereby ordered: overruled. Judgment may enter in the amount of $23,362.50 plus court costs.\u201d The second notice, filed June 27, 2007, stated: \u201cObjections to acceptance of findings of facts dated June 6, 2007, has the following order: overruled, judgment may enter in the amount of $23,362.50 plus court costs.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Resolution of the defendant\u2019s appeal requires interpretation of our rules of practice and, therefore, presents a question of law over which our review is plenary. <em>Zirinsky </em>v. <em>Zirinsky, </em>87 Conn. App. 257, 269, 865 A.2d 488, cert. denied, 273 Conn. 916, 871 A.2d 372 (2005). In interpreting our rules of practice, we are guided by the principles governing statutory interpretation. <em>Pitched. Hartford, </em>247 Conn. 422, 432, 722 A.2d 797 (1999) (\u201c[t]he rules of statutory construction apply with equal force to Practice Book rules\u201d). Our fundamental objective in interpreting a rule of practice is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the drafters. <em>Chase Manhattan Mortgage Corp. </em>v. <em>Burton, </em>81 Conn. App. 662, 667, 841 A.2d 248, cert. denied, 268 Conn. 919, 847 A.2d 313 (2004). \u201cIn other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. . . . In seeking to determine that meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cogan </em>v. <em>Chase Manhattan Auto Financial Corp., </em>276 Conn. 1, 7, 882 A.2d 597 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">The defendant argues that, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 23-58 (a), and this court\u2019s holding in <em>Banks Building Co., LLC </em>v. <em>Malanga Family Real Estate Holding, LLC, </em>92 Conn. App. 394, 885 A.2d 204 (2005), aff'd after remand, 102 Conn. App. 231, 926 A.2d 1 (2007), the court was required to hold a hearing on his objection to the fact finder\u2019s report. Practice Book \u00a7 23-58 (a) provides that <em>\u201c[after review of the finding of facts and hearing on any objections thereto, </em>the judicial authority may take the following action: (1) render judgment in accordance with the finding of facts; (2) reject the finding of facts and remand the case to the fact finder who originally heard the matter for a rehearing on all or part of the finding of facts; (3) reject the finding of facts and remand the matter to another fact finder for rehearing; (4) reject the finding of facts and revoke the reference; (5) remand the case to the fact finder who originally heard the matter for a finding on an issue raised in an objection which was not addressed in the original finding of facts; or (6) take any other action the judicial authority may deem appropriate.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">In <em>Banks Building Co., LLC </em>v. <em>Malanga Family Real Estate Holding, LLC, </em>supra, 92 Conn. App. 396, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>court rendered judgment in accordance with the attorney fact finder\u2019s report without holding a hearing, despite the defendant\u2019s having objected and having requested argument. In reversing the judgment, we held that \u201c[Practice Book \u00a7 23-58 (a)] gives the reviewing court a number of discretionary options for disposition of a referred matter following the filing of a fact finder\u2019s report, including the rendering of judgment in accordance with the finding of facts. Practice Book \u00a7 23-58 (a) (1). Nevertheless, the plain language of the rule indicates that if any objections to the report have been raised, the court, before deciding on one of the available courses of action, must take the mandatory prerequisite step of holding a hearing on the objections. Compare <em>Gordon Hoyt Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Statewide Ins. Corp., 7 </em>Conn. App. 115, 117, 507 A.2d 528 (1986) <em>(\u2018[absent such a timely objection, </em>the court is warranted in rendering judgment on the finding of facts\u2019 . . .). Because the court here declined to do so, its ultimate judgment was rendered improperly.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Banks Building Co., LLC </em>v. <em>Malanga Family Real Estate Holding, LLC, </em>supra, 398-99. In the present case, we agree with the defendant\u2019s claim that Practice Book \u00a7 23-58 and the holding of <em>Banks Building Co., LLC, </em>required the court to hold a hearing on his objection to the findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">The plaintiffs arguments in opposition may be summarized as follows. The plaintiff first maintains that although \u00a7 23-58 (a) requires the court to hear any objections prior to accepting the fact finder\u2019s report, there is no requirement that the court hear oral argument on the objections. Because the court\u2019s initial notice stated that the defendant\u2019s objection had \u201cbeen heard,\u201d the plaintiff contends that the court fulfilled the requirements of \u00a7 23-58 (a). The plaintiff further argues that <em>Banks Building Co., LLC, </em>is distinguishable from the present case because here, the defendant did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>request a hearing. Under Practice Book \u00a7 11-18 (a), oral argument is at the discretion of the court, except in matters where argument is a matter of right. Practice Book \u00a7 11-18 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cOral argument is at the discretion of the judicial authority except as to motions to dismiss, motions to strike, motions for summary judgment, motions for judgment of foreclosure, and motions for judgment on the report of an attorney trial referee and/or hearing on any objections thereto. For those motions, oral argument shall be a matter of right, provided: (1) the motion has been marked ready for adjudication in accordance with the procedure indicated in the notice that accompanies the short calendar on which the motion appears, and (2) the movant indicates at the bottom of the first page of the motion or on a reclaim slip that oral argument or testimony is desired . . . The plaintiff points out that a hearing on an objection to a fact finder\u2019s report is not listed in Practice Book \u00a7 11-18 (a) as a matter where oral argument is as of right. It further argues that, even if the defendant were entitled to argument, he failed to request it as required by \u00a7 11-18 (a) (2). We are not persuaded by these arguments, which we address in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">First, regardless of the language employed in the court\u2019s notice, the defendant\u2019s objection was not given a sufficient hearing for the purposes of Practice Book \u00a7 23-58 (a). In <em>Banks Building Co., LLC, </em>the court\u2019s memorandum of decision made it clear that the court had reviewed the defendant\u2019s objection prior to its ruling. <em>Banks Building Co., LLC </em>v. <em>Malanga Family Real Estate Holding, LLC, </em>supra, 92 Conn. App. 396-97. Despite this review, we held that the hearing requirement of \u00a7 23-58 (a) had not been satisfied. Id., 399. Under the plaintiffs reasoning here, the court in <em>Banks Building Co., LLC, </em>\u201cheard\u201d the defendant\u2019s objections. Although the present appeal does not require us to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>delineate exhaustively the contours of a \u201chearing\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 23-58 (a), it is clear that under <em>Banks Building Co., LLC, </em>in camera review of a party\u2019s objection is not sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">The plaintiffs second argument is essentially that, notwithstanding Practice Book \u00a7 23-58 (a), the factual scenario in this case is governed by Practice Book \u00a7 Ills. The rules of practice concerning attorney fact finding are contained in Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 23-52 through 23-59.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These sections, and \u00a7 23-58 in particular, make no reference to \u00a7 11-18 or its requirements with regard to oral argument in civil matters. \u201cIt is a well-settled principle of [statutory] construction that specific terms covering the given subject matter will prevail over general language of the same or another statute which might otherwise prove controlling.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>State Employees\u2019 Review Board, </em>239 Conn. 638, 653, 687 A.2d 134 (1997). In these circumstances, the specific terms of Practice Book \u00a7 23-58 (a), requiring the court to hold a \u201chearing on any objections\u201d to the findings of fact, prevail over the general language of \u00a7 11-18, which would otherwise control in this civil matter. Further, we find significant the fact that hearings on objections to <em>attorney fact finder </em>reports are not included in the enumerated motions and hearings of \u00a7 11-18 (a) where argument is a matter of right but must be claimed for oral argument. In contrast, the drafters of our rules included hearings on objections to the reports of <em>attorney trial referees </em>under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>\u00a7 11-18 (a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As drafted, \u00a7 23-58 is a stand-alone provision with no indication that it is to be read in conjunction with, nor subject to, the provisions of \u00a7 11-18 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">In <em>Banks Building Co., LLC, </em>we indirectly emphasized the specificity of \u00a7 23-58 in holding that the \u201cplain language of the rule indicates that if any objections to the report have been raised, the court, before deciding on one of the available courses of action, must take the mandatory prerequisite step of holding a hearing on the objections.\u201d <em>Banks Building Co., LLC, </em>v. <em>Malanga Family Real Estate Holding, LLC, </em>supra, 92 Conn. App. 398-99. The plain language of \u00a7 23-58 (a) does not contain a requirement that a party objecting to a fact finder\u2019s report make a request for a hearing. Although the defendant in <em>Banks Building Co., LLC, </em>had requested oral argument, this fact was not crucial to our holding. Similarly here, the fact that the defendant did not request a hearing on his objection should not have precluded him from such a hearing pursuant to \u00a7 23-58 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Under the plain language of Practice Book \u00a7 23-58 (a) and our holding in <em>Banks Building Co., LLC, </em>a trial court, upon receiving an objection to an attorney fact finder\u2019s report must hold a hearing prior to taking further action. Because the court did not hold such a hearing in the present case, its judgment overruling the defendant\u2019s objection and accepting the findings of fact was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a hearing on the defendant\u2019s objection, after which the court may take further action in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 23-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b594-8\"> Although Guarco and Theodor Perez were named as defendants, Perez did not appeal. We refer in this opinion to Guarco as the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b594-9\"> Having so determined, we do not reach the defendant\u2019s second and third claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b599-6\"> The provisions of \u00a7 23-58 stand alone in their requirement for a hearing on objections to a fact finder\u2019s report. Practice Book \u00a7 11-18 (a) lists five other categories of motions in which argument may be had as of right but does not mention objections under \u00a7 23-58. A party seeking to enforce such a \u00a7 11-18 right nonetheless must claim it for oral argument or the matter will be decided on the papers. Some modification of the existing rule of \u00a7 11-18 would be salutary because the existing scheme may not sufficiently alert the busy trial judge to \u00a7 23-58\u2019s stand-alone mandatory hearing requirement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b600-9\"> Our rules of practice treat trial court review of the reports of attorney trial referees differently from review of fact finder\u2019s reports.
