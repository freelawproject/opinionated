Ct. 1868, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889 (1968), a police officer has the authority, under the fourth amendment to the United States constitution, to stop the operator of a car if the officer has a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the operator has engaged in illegal conduct. In furtherance of this constitutional principle, our Supreme Court has held that a police officer has the right to conduct a <em>Terry </em>stop even if the reason for the stop is only that the officer observed an infraction under our traffic laws. <em>State </em>v. <em>Dukes, </em>209 Conn. 98, 122, 547 A.2d 10 (1988). In this case, the state sought to justify a <em>Terry </em>stop by alleging an automobile operator\u2019s violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-99f (c), which prohibits the attachment of objects to a car so as \u201cto interfere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>with the operator\u2019s unobstructed view of the highway or to distract the attention of the operator.\u201d The state appeals from the judgment of the trial court dismissing the charges against the defendant because, in the court\u2019s view, the state did not establish that he had violated the statute. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">On March 10, 2006, the state filed a three count information charging the defendant, Gregory Cyrus, with operating a motor vehicle in Danielson on that day while under the influence of intoxicating liquor in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a, operating a motor vehicle without carrying an operator\u2019s license in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-213 and operating a motor vehicle with an obstructed view in violation of \u00a7 14-99f (c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant pleaded not guilty and filed a motion to suppress evidence allegedly seized illegally by the police at the time of his arrest. After an evidentiary hearing, the court granted the defendant\u2019s suppression motion. In response to the state\u2019s motion for reconsideration, the court issued a supplemental finding in support of its ruling. The court then dismissed the charges against the defendant but granted the state\u2019s request for permission to appeal from the ruling on the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">\u201c[0]ur standard of review of a trial court\u2019s findings and conclusions in connection with a motion to suppress is well defined. A finding of fact will not be disturbed unless it is clearly erroneous in view of the evidence and pleadings in the whole record .... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>[When] the legal conclusions of the court axe challenged, [our review is plenary, and] we must determine whether they are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the court\u2019s [ruling] . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>281 Conn. 613, 654, 916 A.2d 17, cert. denied, 552 U.S. 868, 128 S. Ct. 164, 169 L. Ed. 2d 112 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">In this case, the state challenges both the court\u2019s findings of fact and its conclusions of law. As a matter of fact, the state claims that the court improperly found that the arresting officer stopped the defendant\u2019s car merely because the officer observed something hanging from the defendant\u2019s rearview mirror. As a matter of law, the state has maintained, at least in its principal brief, that the court improperly concluded that \u00a7 14-99f (c) requires the state to establish that such a hanging object in fact obstructed the operator\u2019s vision or distracted the operator\u2019s attention. We disagree with both claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">In its initial memorandum of decision, the court made the following findings of fact in support of its determination that Trooper David Mattioli of the state police did not have a reasonable and articulable basis for stopping the defendant for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. Although Mattioli heard two anonymous tips about a motor vehicle being operated erratically that identified the make of the car and its license plate number, Mattioli\u2019s own observation of a car with a license plate that fit this description did not disclose anything improper about its operation. The court found that this information was not sufficiently reliable to justify stopping the defendant\u2019s car. On appeal, the state does not contest the validity of this finding by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>In response to the state\u2019s motion to reconsider, the court addressed the state\u2019s alternate contention that Mattioli had a second justifiable basis for stopping the defendant\u2019s car because, noticing a chain or crucifix hanging from the car\u2019s rearview mirror, Mattioli properly determined that the defendant was violating \u00a7 14-99f (c). The court found credible Mattioli\u2019s testimony that he observed \u201ca chain hanging approximately eight to ten inches, hanging from the rearview mirror\u201d of the defendant\u2019s car. The court heard conflicting evidence, however, about whether Mattioli had stopped the defendant\u2019s car because he observed this object in motion. At the initial hearing, Mattioli testified that he stopped the car because he saw \u201ca chain or crucifix . . . hanging from the rearview mirror which moved back and forth . . . .\u201d At a subsequent hearing, however, in response to the prosecutor\u2019s question whether \u201csometimes in your judgment there are things hanging from rearview mirrors that do obstruct the view of the driver. Is that correct?\u201d Mattioli replied that \u201cif it is not a busy night and I\u2019m in a proactive mode, I try to stop as many cars as I can. If they have something hanging from the mirror, I will stop them, yes.\u201d Viewing Mattioli\u2019s testimony in its entirety, the court found that \u201cMattioli\u2019s stop of the defendant was not based on a violation of the statute but was based solely on the fact that there was something hanging from the defendant\u2019s mirror.\u201d Because, in the court\u2019s view, the statute required a showing that the object in question was in fact \u201cobstructing the view of the driver or distracting the driver,\u201d the court dismissed the charges against the defendant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">The state\u2019s appeal purports to challenge, as clearly erroneous, the court\u2019s factual finding that Mattioli\u2019s stop <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>of the defendant was based not on a violation of the statute, but on the simple fact that he observed something hanging from the defendant\u2019s mirror. The state accurately reproduces the testimony that it presented to the court, but advances no reasoned analysis to support its contention that the court improperly found more credible Mattioli\u2019s testimony about his routine practice than his testimony about what he observed when he stopped this defendant\u2019s car. Because this claim was inadequately briefed on appeal, we deem it abandoned. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>255 Conn. 268, 281 n.30, 764 A.2d 1251 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">To the extent that it is relevant, any possible ambiguity in the record cannot readily be resolved in the state\u2019s favor. We note that, at the suppression hearing, the state expressly asked the court to make a supplemental finding that Mattioli\u2019s testimony was credible insofar as he testified that, prior to the investigatory stop, he had observed a chain hanging from the rearview mirror of the defendant\u2019s vehicle, and the court so found. We further note, however, that the state did <em>not </em>ask for a supplemental finding, and the court made none, that Mattioli credibly testified that he had seen anything attached to the rearview mirror \u201cwhich moved back and forth\u201d in a distracting or obstructive manner. We cannot fill this gap in the record. Accordingly, we have no basis for faulting the court\u2019s factual finding that Mattioli stopped the defendant\u2019s car in accordance with his routine practice of stopping cars whenever he observed something attached to their rearview mirrors.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">The state\u2019s principal argument for reversal is that, as a matter of law, the trial court construed \u00a7 14-99f (c) too narrowly. Our standard of review for issues of statutory interpretation is well settled. \u201cIssues of statutory construction raise questions of law, over which we exercise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>plenary review. . . . The process of statutory interpretation involves the determination of the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of the case, including the question of whether the language does so apply. . . . When construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. ... In seeking to determine that meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Alvord Investment, LLC v. Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>282 Conn. 393, 401-402, 920 A.2d 1000 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">The state\u2019s argument on this issue is not advanced by its shifting view of the proper interpretation of \u00a7 14-99f (c). In its principal brief, the state took the position that the statute does not require any proof that the view of the operator <em>actually </em>be obstructed or that his attention <em>actually </em>be distracted. It relied on cases in other jurisdictions that have held that even relatively small objects hanging from a rearview mirror justify the minimal intrusion engendered by a motor vehicle stop. In its reply brief, however, the state concedes that our statute does not proscribe \u201call items hanging from a rearview mirror\u201d but instead requires a showing that the item or object be hung in such a manner as to \u201cinterfere\u201d with the unobstructed view of the highway or to <em>\u201cdistract </em>the operator.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Emphasis in original.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>In its reply brief, the state effectively agrees with the defendant that, on its face, \u00a7 14-99f (c) does not make the hanging of an object from a rearview mirror a per se infraction. Indeed, the defendant\u2019s construction of the statute is compelled by the principle that criminal statutes are not to be read more broadly than their language plainly requires and that ambiguities in criminal statutes ordinarily are to be resolved in favor of the defendant. <em>State </em>v. <em>Peeler, </em>271 Conn. 338, 434-35, 857 A.2d 808 (2004), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 845, 126 S. Ct. 94, 163 L. Ed. 2d 110 (2005).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">In light of the state\u2019s concession that \u00a7 14-99f (c) requires proof of interference with an operator\u2019s unobstructed view or the operator\u2019s distraction, the state is left with the difficult task of showing that the court improperly found that the state failed to meet its burden of proof. It urges this court to conclude that, even if Mattioli improperly stopped the defendant\u2019s car simply because he observed a chain or crucifix hanging from the defendant\u2019s rearview mirror, \u201c[i]f the facts are sufficient to lead an officer to reasonably believe there was a violation, that will suffice, even if the officer is not certain about exactly what it takes to constitute a violation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Accepting this argument would stand the state\u2019s burden of proof in a criminal case on its head. We read a trial court record to sustain the court\u2019s judgment, not to overturn it. <em>Matza </em>v. <em>Matza, </em>226 Conn. 166, 187, 627 A.2d 414 (1993). The state\u2019s argument assumes that which the state was required to prove, namely, that there was credible evidence that the chain or crucifix that Mattioli observed was in fact interfering with the defendant\u2019s vision or distracting his attention. In effect, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>this argument merely restates the state\u2019s disagreement with the court\u2019s contrary finding of fact. Again, we are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">As the trier of fact, the court had the authority to find, on the credible record before it, that the state did not establish that Mattioli stopped the defendant\u2019s car for any reason other than his mistaken, albeit good faith, belief that \u00a7 14-99f (c) makes it an infraction for a car to be driven with <em>any </em>object hanging from a rearview mirror. Although our legislature might have enacted such a statute, the state now concedes that it has not done so. On the record before us, therefore, the state has failed to establish that the trial court improperly dismissed the charges against the defendant. We leave for another day, on another record, the question of how much of a distraction or impairment of an operator\u2019s vision the state must establish to prove a violation of \u00a7 14-99f (c).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b510-8\"> Although the information referred to General Statutes \u00a7 14-99, the parties acknowledge that Trooper Mattioli stopped the defendant for violating General Statutes \u00a7 14-99f (c), which provides: \u201cNo article, device, sticker or ornament shall be attached or affixed to or hung on or in any motor vehicle in such a manner or location as to interfere with the operator\u2019s unobstructed view of the highway or to distract the attention of the operator.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b512-7\"> Although the court referred to \u00a714-99 in its supplemental finding, as did the state in its information, it is clear that the statute at issue in this case is \u00a714-99f (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b514-7\"> The state repeated its concession at oral argument in this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b515-8\"> For decisions in other states that similarly have declined to give an expansive construction to statutes prohibiting the placement on rearview mirrors of objects that obstruct an operator\u2019s vision, see <em>People </em>v. <em>White, 107 </em>Cal.
