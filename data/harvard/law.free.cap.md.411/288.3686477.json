FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">On 27 August 2007, a Wicomico County grand jury indicted Huntley on charges of child sexual abuse. The original indictment alleged that the offenses took place between 1 September 2005 and 30 September 2006, based on statements from the child victim. Huntley first appeared in the Circuit Court on 6 September 2007. Therefore, to comply with the require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>ments of \u00a7 6-103(a) and Rule 4-271(a)(1), Huntley\u2019s trial had to begin by 4 March 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">After several postponements of earlier trial dates, the Circuit Court finally set a trial date of 3 March 2008, the day before the expiration of the 180-day period. On that date, the State moved to amend the indictment to change the date of the offenses to the period of 1 April 2003 to 31 July 2005. The State claimed that it received within the prior week new information<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> from the victim\u2019s family that suggested the dates alleged in the original indictment were incorrect. Huntley objected to the amendment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court denied the State\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Rather than proceed to trial under the indictment containing the purported incorrect dates, the State dismissed the charges by entering a nol pros.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">On 24 March 2008, three weeks later (and twenty days after the expiration of the original 180-day period), the Wicomico County grand jury re-indicted Huntley on the same charges as the original indictment, but provided as the date of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>offenses the period from 1 April 2003 to 31 July 2005. In response, Huntley, pursuant to Rule 4-271, filed a motion to dismiss the second indictment. After a hearing on 17 June 2008, the motions judge granted Huntley\u2019s motion, finding that \u201cthe purposes of the State\u2019s nol pros in March of 2008 ... was to evade the effect of [the earlier judge\u2019s] ruling denying the motion to amend.\u201d The State appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. We issued a writ of certiorari, on our initiative, prior to the intermediate appellate court deciding the case. <em>State v. Huntley, </em>407 Md. 275, 964 A.2d 675 (2009).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Ordinarily, where criminal charges are nol prossed and identical charges are refiled, the 180-day time period for commencing trial, as mandated by \u00a7 6-103(a) and Rule 4-271(a)(1), begins to run anew after the refiling. <em>Curley v. State, </em>299 Md. 449, 458, 474 A.2d 502, 506 (1984); <em>Baker v. State, </em>130 Md.App. 281, 288, 745 A.2d 1142, 1146 (2000) (noting that the nol pros \u201cis a legitimate and accepted way of doing prosecutorial business\u201d). We stated that, where there is a nol pros and refiling of charges, \u201cthe only existing prosecution or case is that begun by the new charging document,\u201d and that it is this new prosecution for which trial must be timely commenced. <em>Curley, </em>299 Md. at 460, 474 A.2d at 507.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">In <em>Curley, </em>we identified two exceptions to this general rule. Where (1) the purpose of the State\u2019s nol pros, or (2) the necessary effect of its entry, is to circumvent the statute and rule governing time limits for trial, the 180-day period for trial begins with the triggering event under the initial prosecution, rather than beginning anew with the second prosecution.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 459, 474 A.2d at 507. If trial does not begin then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>within 180-days of the first appearance of the defendant or defense counsel in the initial prosecution, the subsequent indictment must be dismissed under <em>Hicks. See Hicks, </em>285 Md. at 318, 403 A.2d at 360. The remedy of dismissal is designed to implement the Legislature\u2019s policy behind the enactment of \u00a7 6-103(a), namely, to \u201cobtain prompt disposition of criminal charges.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 316, 403 A.2d at 359. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>Without the <em>Curley </em>exceptions and the <em>Hicks </em>dismissal remedy, the State could evade the 180-day period, whenever it desired a trial postponement beyond 180 days, by merely nol prossing the case and refiling the same charges, a tactic that would make the requirements of the statute and rule \u201cmeaningless.\u201d <em>Curley, </em>299 Md. at 461, 474 A.2d at 508.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">In <em>Curley, </em>however, we noted that these exceptions will not apply where the prosecution acts \u201cin good faith or so as to not \u2018evade\u2019 or \u2018circumvent\u2019 the requirements of the statute or rule setting a deadline for trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 459, 474 A.2d at 507. Additionally, we opined that \u00a7 6-103(a) and Rule 4-271(a)(1) \u201cwere not intended to be codifications of the constitutional speedy trial right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 460, 474 A.2d at 507-08. Rather, \u201ctheir chief purpose was to operate as a prophylactic measure \u2018to further society\u2019s interest in the prompt disposition of criminal trials by providing an impetus to remedy court congestion....\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 460, 474 A.2d at 508. This purpose \u201cis ordinarily not violated when a prior prosecution against the defendant has been nol prossed and thus is removed from the court\u2019s docket, and when the trial under the new prosecution is commenced within the time period prescribed by\u201d \u00a7 6-103(a) and Rule 4-271(a)(1). <em>Id. </em>at 460-61, 474 A.2d at 508.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">In the present case, the State contends that an analysis of its nol pros under the <em>Curley </em>exceptions framework, and thus, any potential <em>Hicks </em>dismissal sanction, is inappropriate. It maintains that, because the nol pros was designed to respond to the trial court\u2019s denial of its motion to amend the indictment, rather than to evade or circumvent the 180-day deadline, the <em>Curley </em>exceptions and <em>Hicks </em>are not in play here. Instead, the State argues, the general rule should apply and the 180-day period should run anew from the date of Appellee\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s appearance under the second indictment. We agree with the State and hold that, where the State nol prosses an indictment based on the denial of its motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>amend a flawed indictment, absent bad faith or evidence of the State\u2019s motive to delay trial, <em>Curley </em>and <em>Hicks </em>do not compel dismissal of the subsequent indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Appellee relies on a number of cases, beginning with <em>Curley, </em>to bolster his contention that the purpose and necessary effect of the State\u2019s nol pros in this case was to circumvent the 180-day requirement in \u00a7 6-103(a) and Rule 4-271(a)(1). Specifically, Huntley directs our attention to <em>Ross v. State, </em>117 Md.App. 357, 700 A.2d 282 (1997), <em>Alther v. State, </em>157 Md.App. 316, 850 A.2d 1211 (2004), and <em>State v. Price, </em>385 Md. 261, 868 A.2d 252 (2005). It is clear to us, however, that his reliance on these cases is misplaced. In each case tendered, the State\u2019s proven purpose in nol prossing the charges was to evade the trial court\u2019s or administrative judge\u2019s denial of the State\u2019s motion for a continuance or postponement, or to force rescheduling of a trial date for which it was not ready to proceed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It is distinctly those types of scenarios, where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>nol pros is used as a clear stand-in for a failed continuance request, that the prophylactic analysis of <em>Curley </em>and the sanction of <em>Hicks </em>were designed to address.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>case, however, does not fit within this category, and thus, we maintain that <em>Curley </em>and <em>Hicks </em>do not compel dismissal here.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">As noted earlier, \u00a7 6-103(a) and Rule 4-271(a)(1) are \u201cdesigned to obtain prompt disposition of criminal charges.\u201d <em>Hicks, </em>285 Md. at 316, 403 A.2d at 359. Where the State fails to try a defendant -within the 180-day limit, absent a finding of good cause by the trial or administrative judge, the <em>Hicks </em>sanction of dismissal is appropriate. <em>See Price, </em>385 Md. at 278, 868 A.2d at 262 (noting that \u201cthe mechanism of the Hicks Rule serves as a means of protecting society\u2019s interest in the efficient administration of justice\u201d and that the objective of the statute and rule is to \u201celiminate excessive scheduling delays and unjustifiable postponements\u201d). W(hen the State seeks to try a case beyond the 180-day deadline through the strategic use of a nol pros, its actions equally are subject to the analysis discussed in <em>Curley. See Curley, </em>299 Md. at 460, 474 A.2d at 508 (noting that the \u201cchief purpose\u201d of the statute and rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>\u201cwas to operate as a prophylactic measure \u2018to further society\u2019s interest in the prompt disposition of criminal trials by providing an impetus to remedy court congestion----\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Where the State instead is prepared to try the case on the trial date, pending approval of its motion to amend the flawed indictment, that motion is denied, and the State nol prosses the indictment in order to re-indict later on corrected charges, the significant concern of the statute, the rule, <em>Hicks, </em>and <em>Curley </em>regarding the \u201cprompt disposition of charges\u201d and the elimination of \u201cexcessive scheduling delays\u201d is absent. In such a situation, the State has no obvious or secret motive to delay prosecution of the defendant beyond 180 days and there is no ruling by the trial court regarding its calendar that the State may be said to be circumventing. <em>See Jules v. State, </em>171 Md.App. 458, 476, 910 A.2d 553, 563 (2006) (noting that the <em>Curley </em>analysis is inappropriate in a denial of a motion to amend case because there is no ruling by the trial court controlling the court\u2019s calendar which the State may seek to circumvent). In fact, the State presumably stands prepared to bring the defendant to trial on that day, so long as its motion to amend the indictment is granted. Where the amendment is denied, there is no trial to be postponed or continued, and the State\u2019s nol pros and re-indictment under corrected charges brings a new prosecution for which a new 180-day period begins.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">This type of situation differs significantly from those presented in the cases relied on by Appellee because, here, the State could not try Huntley on the charges as they were stated in the charging document due to the incorrect breadth of the dates. In the continuance cases pointed to by Huntley, the State essentially nol prossed in an effort to extend the time period it had in which to prosecute each defendant, often in order to gather additional evidence or complete laboratory testing, purposes for which the statute and the rule were designed to foreclose. In the instance of a denied motion to amend the indictment, at least where the original indictment is legitimately flawed due to reasons assumedly beyond the control of the State, the State has no choice but to nol pros the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>indictment and re-indict Huntley with a fresh set of charges. In such a case, the State cannot be seen as circumventing the trial court\u2019s scheduling power or extending the 180-day period in which to prosecute the defendant (the main concerns underlying the relevant portions of the <em>Hicks </em>and <em>Curley </em>decisions) because it is impossible, under the circumstances, for the State to prosecute the defendant under the unamended indictment. As such, the nol pros is not amenable to the <em>Curley </em>two-pronged exceptions analysis.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Here, it appears that the State may have been prepared to try the case on the 179th day of the 180-day period and, in fact, would have begun trial that day had its motion to amend the charging document been granted.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> There is no sugges<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>tion that the State utilized the nol pros with any motive in mind other than to correct the dates on the charging documents and bring Huntley to trial. The State was not refused a continuance, and it did not seek to evade any scheduling orders of the court due to missing evidence. Denying the State the right to try Appellee based solely on the trial court\u2019s determination that it would not allow amendment of the charging documents, particularly where the trial court appeared to understand that the State planned to nol pros and re-indict if its motion was denied, would punish unfairly the State in this case. Rather, because the concerns of the statute, the rule, <em>Hicks, </em>and <em>Curley </em>against trial delay and State manipulation of trial scheduling through the use of a nol pros are not implicated, the general rule would apply that, where a nol pros is entered and charges are refiled subsequently, the 180-day period for trial begins anew with the second indictment. We therefore hold that the <em>Hicks </em>sanction of dismissal, and the concurrent exceptions analysis of <em>Curley, </em>do not apply here where the State\u2019s nol pros is entered based on a denial of its motion to amend an indictment. As such, the motions judge erred, on the record before it, in granting Appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss the second indictment based on <em>Hicks, Curley, </em>\u00a7 6-103(a) and Rule 4\u2014271(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">There is no direct suggestion in this case of any misconduct or ulterior motive to delay behind the State\u2019s entry of the nol pros. <em>See Curley, </em>299 Md. at 459, 474 A.2d at 507 (noting that the purpose and necessary effect exceptions will not apply where \u201cthe prosecution [is] acting in \u2018good faith\u2019 or so as to not \u2018evade\u2019 or \u2018circumvent\u2019 the requirements of the statute or rule setting a deadline for trial\u201d). There is no evidence that the State intentionally sought a flawed indictment originally in the hopes of nol prossing it and, in that way, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>evading the 180-day requirement. Had there been evidence of such bad faith on the part of the State in its entry of a nol pros against Huntley, application of the <em>Curley </em>exceptions test to its actions and imposition of a <em>Hicks </em>dismissal may have been appropriate. Absent bad faith, however, the general rule applies and the State\u2019s entry of nol pros and subsequent re-indictment of the defendant on the same charges generally restarts the 180-day period.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The record does evince some disagreement as to whether the State should have discovered the incorrect breadth of the dates in the initial indictment before in fact it did, an issue that goes to the question of whether the State entered its nol pros here in good faith. At no point did the Circuit Court squarely confront this issue, and, as an appellate court, we may not engage in fact-finding on this point. Thus, we shall remand the case so that the Circuit Court may determine whether the State in fact exercised good faith when it entered the nol pros of the initial indictment. If it is so found, the reindictment should not be dismissed by reason of <em>Hicks, Curley, </em>or the pertinent rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">We hold that the <em>Curley </em>two-pronged exceptions test, and the concurrent <em>Hicks </em>sanction of dismissal, are inapplicable where the State\u2019s nol pros follows a denial of its motion to amend an indictment, at least where bad faith on the part of the State to delay is not shown. This Court designed the <em>Curley </em>exceptions in order to prevent the State from using its nol pros power to evade the 180-day deadline and delay trial of a defendant\u2019s case beyond 180 days. Where the State\u2019s nol pros instead is used to remedy a genuinely flawed indictment, the concerns of <em>Curley </em>are not present. The severe sanction of a <em>Hicks </em>dismissal is reserved for situations where the State seeks to circumvent the strictures of \u00a7 6-103(a) and Rule 4r-271(a)(1) and unjustifiably delay a defendant\u2019s trial beyond 180-days. This is not such a case on the record as it exists <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>presently.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT OF WICOMICO COUNTY VACATED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS TO BE PAID BY WICOMICO COUNTY.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">BELL, C.J., and GREENE, J., Dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b324-10\">.

The Dissenting Opinion chooses to analyze the State's nol pros of the initial indictment against Huntley under the two-pronged test announced in <em>Curley, </em>concluding that the purpose and necessary effect of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>the entry of nol pros was to circumvent the 180-day requirement prescribed by \u00a7 6-103(a) and Rule 4 \u2014 271(a)(1).

As we shall discuss <em>infra, </em>an analysis under the two-pronged <em>Curley </em>test is inappropriate where, as here, the State\u2019s nol pros is based on a denial of its motion to amend a flawed indictment, absent a showing of bad faith or intent to delay by the State. The Dissenting Opinion proceeds down the wrong analytical path.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Even assuming arguendo that the Dissenting Opinion's analytical path were a correct choice, its conclusion that the State\u2019s nol pros in this case had the necessary effect or purpose of circumventing \u00a7 6-103(a) and Rule 4-271(a)(l) is flawed fatally. Regarding the \"necessary effect\u201d prong of the <em>Curley </em>test, this Court has noted that a nol pros has the necessary effect of an attempt to circumvent the requirements of \u00a7 6-103(a) and Rule 4 \u2014 271(a)(l) only \"when the alternative to the nol pros would be a dismissal of the case for failure to commence trial within 180 days____Otherwise, under the teaching of the <em>Curley </em>case, it does not.\u201d <em>State v. Brown, </em>341 Md. 609, 618, 672 A.2d 602, 607 (1996). As the Dissenting Opinion admits, instead of nol prossing the indictment, the State had the option of bringing the matter to the attention of the administrative judge or his or her designee to seek an extension of the 180-day requirement. Where such alternatives to nol pros are available to the State, the entry of nol pros does not have the \"necessary effect\" of circumventing \u00a7 6-103(a) and Rule 4-271(a)(l). As to the \"purpose\u201d prong of <em>Curley, </em>the Court of Special Appeals has observed that the State must be circumventing a ruling by an administrative judge (or his or her designee) which exercises control over the court's calendar, thus implicating the requirement of good cause for an extension of the 180-day requirement. <em>Jules v. State, </em>171 Md.App. 458, 475-78, 910 A.2d 553, 563-64 (2006). In the instant case, the Circuit Court denied the State\u2019s motion to amend the flawed indictment. Although the Dissenting Opinion may be correct in its assertion that the State entered its nol pros in an attempt to circumvent the authority and decision of the Circuit Court, this record does not support that it sought to circumvent a ruling <em>exercising control over the court's calendar, </em>and, therefore, the \"purpose\u201d prong is not satisfied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b328-9\">.

This Court, and the Court of Special Appeals, have used the <em>Curley </em>test to decide a number of other cases dealing with attempted circumvention of the 180-day period by the State through the use of a nol pros. In <em>State v.

In <em>Glenn, </em>there was no denial of a motion to amend the indictment. Thus, the State made a unilateral, unforced decision that its indictment was flawed and that a nol pros was necessary and appropriate. Here, the trial court denied the State\u2019s motion to amend the dates in the indictment, leaving the State with an indictment containing allegations that it could not prove. Denial of the amendment created a situation essentially where trial could not proceed. Additionally, in <em>Glenn, </em>the flaw contained in the indictment resulted from culpable error on behalf of the State, namely, failure to include an essential element of the charge. Here, the flaw in the indictment, the incorrect dates, stemmed from the child victim\u2019s initial incorrect recollection of when the incidents happened. Upon being presented by the victim\u2019s parents with new information, the State immediately attempted to remedy the indictment, but its motion to amend was denied.

His initial appearance in the Circuit Court was on September 6, 2007. Accordingly, the 180-day time period imposed under \u00a7 6-103 of the Criminal Procedure Article and Md. Rule 4-271 would expire on March 4, 2008. On March 3, 2008, the trial date, the State moved to amend the indictment to change the date of the offenses from the period September 1, 2005, through September 30, 2006, to the period April 1, 2003, through July 31, 2005. Huntley\u2019s attorney objected to the proposed amendment on the grounds that his trial preparation was based upon the specific dates alleged in the indictment and that to allow the amendment under the circumstances would prejudice his defense of Huntley. The attorney asserted further that the motivation for the State\u2019s decision to amend the dates alleged in the charging document was due to the potential testimony from Huntley\u2019s witnesses. According to the attorney, \u201cthe State became aware that these [offenses] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>could not have occurred during the timeframe that they alleged.\u201d Thus, the attorney deduced that \u201cnow they have figured up another timeframe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">It was the State\u2019s position, at the motion hearing, that if the court denied the motion to amend the indictment, the State would not be prepared to proceed to trial on March 3, 2008, and would therefore nol pros the charges. In response, Judge Beckstead, the trial judge, pointed out that the proposed amendment would not necessarily change the character of the offenses alleged. In reliance upon Md. Rule 4-204, the trial judge stated that as a result of \u201ca motion of a party or on its own initiative the [cjourt may at any time before verdict permit a charging document to be amended.\u201d The judge further suggested that the exception to the general rule is that \u201cif the amendment changes the character of the offense charged, the consent of the parties is required.\u201d In addition, Judge Beckstead expressed concern that the timing of the State\u2019s request to amend the indictment would implicate the <em>Hicks </em>rule. Therefore, based upon her comments, Judge Beckstead apparently did not want to make a ruling that would unnecessarily cause the trial to be postponed. In the exercise of her discretion, Judge Beckstead denied the State\u2019s motion to amend the indictment. She explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-6\">This case was previously called earlier today, case 07-0833. The State had made a motion to amend the charging document, and the Court has heard from the State and defense as to the reasons for the amendment and as to the prejudice that would result. In exercising my discretion, I\u2019m going to deny the request for the amendment. It is, in essence, a completely redesigned charging document. He\u2019s been held on these charges as well as other charges. We\u2019re now at 180 days. I am going to go ahead and deny your request to amend the charging document.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">In response, the State informed the court that it would \u201cnol pros ... and ... re-indict Mr. Huntley.\u201d Subsequently, on March 24, 2008, Huntley was indicted again, on the same charges, but the date of the alleged offenses was changed to the period April 1, 2003, through July 31, 2005. Thereafter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Huntley moved to dismiss the new indictment pursuant to Rule 4-271.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">At the motion hearing on Huntley\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment, Judge Jackson granted Huntley\u2019s request. Huntley argued that the State was not prepared to go forward with trial on March 3, 2008, and the lack of adequate preparation was the State\u2019s reason for nol prossing the charges one day before <em>Hicks </em>expired. Thereafter, according to Huntley, approximately three weeks after entering the nol pros, the State re-indicted Huntley on the same charges, except that \u201cthe only difference [was] adding the dates of the offense that [the State] had sought in [its] motion to amend, which had been denied.\u201d Furthermore, according to Huntley, the State had ample time to investigate the case before filing the first indictment and ample time to investigate after filing the first indictment but before the March 3, 2008, trial date. Consequently, in Huntley\u2019s view, matters of timing as to filing the charging document and what allegations were contained in that document were all within the State\u2019s control.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Conversely, the State maintained that \u201c[i]n this case there was a defect in the charging document\u201d and that the State acted timely in addressing that defect. The prosecutor conceded that as early as January 2, 2008, the State knew from conversations with the victim that there was an issue as to the actual dates of the crime. In addition, the State informed the hearing judge that it knew from conversations with Huntley\u2019s defense counsel on February 14, 2008, \u201cthat there may be some issues with the dates [alleged in the indictment].\u201d According to the State, as a result of the defect \u201cthere was no crime that occurred [during the period September 1, 2005, through September 30, 2006]\u201d and the State acted promptly to remedy the defect by bringing the matter to the court\u2019s attention prior to trial. Because the State argued that the crimes actually occurred during the period April 1, 2003, through July 31, 2005, and the court failed to grant the State\u2019s motion to amend the indictment, the State maintains that it was compelled to nol pros the charges and file \u201can entirely different charging document.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>After considering the arguments of counsel and the essential facts, Judge Jackson ruled, in reliance upon our decisions in <em>Price </em>and <em>Curley, </em>that there was a violation of the <em>Hicks </em>rale and that the appropriate sanction was dismissal of the charges. Judge Jackson explained that the State attempted to amend the indictment after 179 days had elapsed from the filing of the indictment. That motion was denied. Thereafter, the State filed new charges \u201calleging the same sex offenses against the same victim during a different time period, April of '03 through July of '05. That indictment was filed on March 24, 2008. That is well beyond <em>[Hicks].\u201d </em>Judge Jackson concluded that the purpose of the \u201cState\u2019s nol pros in March of 2008 ... was to evade the effect of Judge Beckstead\u2019s ruling denying the motion to amend.\u201d In addition, Judge Jackson concluded that there was no defect in the charging document. He pointed out that \u201ca defect in a pleading or charging document means not to contain necessary language, statutory language to charge an offense.\u201d A defect in the charging document does not mean, as Judge Jackson explained, that the indictment contained the wrong or incorrect dates.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">In its brief, filed in this Court, the State acknowledges that the trial judge\u2019s ruling on the motion to amend was discretionary; <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> nonetheless, the State contends that \u201c[o]nce the amendment was denied, [it] had no choice but to enter a nolle prosequi.\u201d Instead of nol prossing the indictment, since <em>Hicks </em>was an obvious problem in the case, the State, however, had the option of bringing the matter to the attention of the administrative judge or his designee for purposes of a continu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>anee. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 4-271. Of course, that would have required the State to convince the administrative judge that there was good cause to do so. Because the State elected to enter a nol pros, the administrative judge was never afforded an opportunity to make a good cause determination on the issue of changing the trial date to accommodate the State. To say that the State had no other option than to nol pros the charges is to ignore the point in the proceedings when the State sought to amend the charging document. The State\u2019s position also overlooks an important policy consideration underlying the <em>Hicks </em>rule: the need to afford a reasonably prompt trial by eliminating excessive scheduling delays and unjustifiable postponements. Although the State had discretion to enter a nol pros at anytime prior to entry of the verdict, it did not have the discretion to circumvent the requirements of <em>Hicks.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">In <em>Curley, </em>299 Md. at 462, 474 A.2d at 508, we recognized, for the first time, an exception to the general rule that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Apa\">when a circuit court criminal case is nol prossed, and the [S]tate later has the same charges refiled, the 180-day period for trial prescribed by <em>[Hicks </em>] ordinarily begins to run with the arraignment or first appearance of defense counsel under the second prosecution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">We held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-7\">[ijf, however, it is shown that the nol pros had the purpose or the effect of circumventing the requirements of <em>[Hicks </em>], the 180-day period will commence to run with the arraignment or first appearance of counsel under the first prosecution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 462, 474 A.2d at 508.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">Curley\u2019s original trial date was continued at his attorney\u2019s request; however, a new trial date was never set. On the 180th day, the State entered a nol pros of all the charges. According to the State, certain evidence was inadmissible and the victim\u2019s family did not wish to go forward with the case. Nonetheless, approximately three months later the State filed another charging document, charging the defendant with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>same offenses. Defense counsel filed motions to dismiss, which were denied. Upon our review of the case and in our application of the exception to the facts, we pointed out that when the nol pros was entered on the final day for trial it was too late to comply with the <em>Hicks </em>rule. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-5\">At the time a trial date had not even been assigned. The case could not have been tried on March 23rd, as the defendant, his counsel, and witnesses were not present. There was no reason for them to have been present, as March 23rd was not the assigned trial date. As of the close of business on March 23rd, the case would have had to have been dismissed for violation of <em>[Hicks]. </em>In reality, the prosecution had already lost this case under <em>[Hicks] </em>when the nol pros was filed. Regardless of the prosecuting attorney\u2019s motives, the necessary effect of the nol pros was an attempt to evade the dismissal resulting from the failure to try the case within 180 days.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-6\"><em>Curley, </em>299 Md. at 462, 474 A.2d at 508-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">The appellee further points out in its brief, filed in this case, that we said, \u201c[i]n <em>Curley, </em>[that] the motives of the State in entering a nol pros for the charges was irrelevant[,]\u201d because the State had already lost its case when the nol pros was filed. In other words, because it was too late to comply with <em>Hicks, </em>\u201cthe necessary effect of the nol pros was an attempt to evade the dismissal resulting from the failure to try the case within 180 days.\u201d <em>Curley, </em>299 Md. at 462-63, 474 A.2d at 509.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">In <em>Ross, </em>the Court of Special Appeals concluded that the State\u2019s purpose in entering the nol pros was to circumvent the <em>Hicks </em>rule. On the trial date, the State requested a postponement because the drugs that were seized from the defendant had not yet been analyzed. The parties appeared before the administrative judge and the judge denied the State\u2019s request for a continuance. In denying the motion for a continuance, the administrative judge pointed out that the \u201cdocket is too crowded. [The case] cannot be put back in before Hicks runs, and I am not finding good cause[.]\u201d <em>Ross, </em>117 Md.App. at 361, 700 A.2d at 284. The State then entered a nol pros and filed a</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>new indictment approximately eight days later. The \u201ctrial on the second indictment began on April 25, 1996, ... outside the 180-day limit under the first indictment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 361, 700 A.2d at 284. Prior to trial, Ross moved to dismiss the charges against him on the ground that \u201cthe State had circumvented the 180-day time period by nol prossing the charges against him when its request for a continuance was denied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The trial judge denied the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">In reversing the denial of the motion to dismiss, the Court of Special Appeals explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5I\">a postponement was requested and denied and, as found by the administrative judge, the case could not be set in before the tolling of the 180-day limit. We again stress that in light of the administrative judge\u2019s supervision of the docket, we are unable to ignore his statement that the case could not be heard before expiration of the 180-day time period. In addition, immediately following the judge\u2019s ruling, the State entered a nol pros in the case. We can discern no clearer attempt to circumvent the time period dictated by <em>[Hicks </em>].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-6\"><em>Ross, </em>117 Md.App. at 370, 700 A.2d at 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">In the present case, the State\u2019s motives in entering the nol pros were twofold: (a) to evade the effects of Judge Beck-stead\u2019s ruling denying the motion to amend; and (b) to circumvent the requirements of <em>Hicks. </em>At the time of the hearing on the motion to amend, Judge Beckstead focused her attention on the reasons for the motion to amend and on the consequences of delaying the trial if the motion to amend were granted on the trial date. The trial judge posed the question to the State: \u201c[I]s there some reason for the delay and the request for the charging document to be corrected?\u201d The court further inquired whether \u201cthe State [has] given information to the defense so that it can prepare for today\u2019s amendment?\u201d In addition, the trial judge asked: \u201c[I]f your motion is denied, your intention would be?\u201d In ruling on the motion to amend, Judge Beckstead made clear that the requirements of <em>Hicks </em>were taken into consideration. She said, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>\u201c[w]e\u2019re now at 180 days[,]\u201d she would deny the request to amend the charging document.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Immediately after Judge Beekstead raised the 180-day requirement and denied the motion to amend, the State entered a nol pros. As the intermediate appellate court recognized in <em>Ross, </em>considering the timing of the State\u2019s entry of the nol pros, there can be no clearer attempt to circumvent the 180-day limit. In my view, it makes no sense to suggest that the State intended to evade only the effects of Judge Beckstead\u2019s order denying the motion to amend, but did not intend to evade the effects of <em>Hicks, </em>when the next day was the 180th day under the <em>Hicks </em>calculation. We must consider the court\u2019s rulings in the context in which they were rendered. Before entering the nol pros, the State made no effort to prevent a violation of <em>Hicks. </em>The State did not bring the matter of rescheduling to the attention of the administrative judge, assuming that judge would have continued the trial date under the circumstances. The State\u2019s only alternative to a nol pros was to try the case. Moreover, there was no practical way, given the late date, the day before the <em>Hicks </em>expiration, that the State could have refiled and tried the case the next day after entering the nol pros. Having determined so close to the expiration of <em>Hicks </em>that the offenses occurred between April 1, 2003, and July 31, 2005, instead of September 1, 2005, through September 30, 2006, as alleged, the State\u2019s entry of the nol pros was no more than a tactical maneuver taking into consideration the insufficiency of its evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">The appellee contends that \u201c[pjrior to seeking an indictment, the State had ample opportunity to investigate the case.\u201d The appellee further points out that \u201ceven after obtaining an indictment, the State had six months to continue its investigation of the case in preparation for trial.\u201d The appellee is correct. The State knew approximately two months before the March 3rd trial date that the evidence it had was in conflict with the allegations contained in the indictment. To say that it resolved the conflict in its evidence one week prior to trial and did not act to correct the indictment until the day of trial clearly does little to satisfy the State\u2019s obligation to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>prepare its cases and bring them to trial promptly within the requirements of <em>Hicks. </em>At the time that the State made its motion to amend the dates in the indictment, the trial judge inquired and obtained the positions of both the State and defense counsel as to their positions on a continuance. The State was agreeable to a continuance if the amendment was granted, but Huntley was not. He never consented to, or waived his right to, a trial under <em>Hicks. </em>Ultimately, the trial judge denied the State\u2019s request to amend the dates in the indictment and the judge indicated that the parties were at the 180-day deadline. Judge Beckstead\u2019s denial of the motion to amend was, in effect, a mandate that the trial proceed, as scheduled, with no alterations to the charging document.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Although <em>Price </em>involved the Circuit Court\u2019s denial of the State\u2019s motion to continue the trial date in order to obtain DNA results, it is analogous to the present case because the State\u2019s purpose in entering the nol pros, in <em>Price, </em>was to circumvent the requirements of <em>Hicks. </em>The difference between <em>Price </em>and the present case is that in the former case, the administrative judge had an opportunity to speak before the State entered the nol pros. Moreover, in <em>Price, </em>the State conceded that it entered the nol pros to avoid the consequences resulting from a dismissal of the case for not going forward or an acquittal for not producing evidence. The State\u2019s motives in entering the nol pros were also relevant to the <em>Hicks </em>analysis. Likewise, in the present case, the State\u2019s motives in entering the nol pros are illuminating. In the present case, the State contends, however, that it was necessary to nol pros the first indictment in order to cure a defect in the charging document.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">In the present case, however, a judicial determination was made that there was no defect in the indictment. Judge Jackson explained that the claim that the State alleged the wrong dates did not render the indictment defective. <em>See State v. Mulkey, </em>316 Md. 475, 482, 560 A.2d 24, 27 (1989) (explaining that \u201cthe exact date of the offense is not an essential element, and is not constitutionally required to be set forth\u201d). In addition, a judicial determination was made, as we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>explained previously, that the State had to proceed to trial on the indictment as written. To evade that ruling and its mandate that the State proceed to trial on the evidence that it had, the State entered a nol pros in an attempt to circumvent the authority and decision of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">This case is unlike <em>State v. Glenn, </em>299 Md. 464, 474 A.2d 509 (1984). In <em>Glenn, </em>prior to trial, the State determined that the charging documents were defective because they failed to allege that Glenn and his co-defendants knowingly distributed obscene materials, one of the elements of the offense for which they were charged. In <em>Glenn, </em>the record established \u201cthat the charges were nol prossed because of a legitimate belief that the charging documents were defective and ... the defendants\u2019 attorney would not agree to amendment of the charging documents.\u201d 299 Md. at 467, 474 A.2d at 511. The State nol prossed the charges on November 17,1981; the 180-day period would not have expired until January 13, 1982. <em>Id. </em>at 465-66, 474 A.2d at 510. On the same day, the State refiled charges to correct what was indeed a defect in the charging documents. The defense moved to dismiss on the basis of <em>Hicks. </em>That motion was granted and the Court of Special Appeals affirmed. <em>Id. </em>at 466, 474 A.2d at 511. We granted certiorari and, after our review, we held that the prosecuting attorney\u2019s purpose in nol prossing the charges against Glenn was <em>not </em>to evade the 180-day rule but, rather, resulted from the defendants\u2019 refusal to allow the State to amend the charging documents. <em>Id. </em>at 467, 474 A.2d at 511. Accordingly, we explained that unlike the situation in <em>Curley,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-6\">the assigned trial date and the date of the nol pros[ ] was only 123 days after the arraignment and first appearance of counsel. If the eases had not been nol prossed, trial could have proceeded on November 17th. If the cases had not been nol prossed, and if for some reason trial had not proceeded when the cases were called on November 17th, there remained fifty-seven days before the expiration of the 180-day deadline. In <em>Curley, </em>if the case had not been nol <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>prossed on the 180th day, it necessarily would have been dismissed for a violation of <em>[Hicks </em>].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 467, 474 A.2d at 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">The reason that <em>Glenn </em>is distinguishable from the present case is that, in <em>Glenn, </em>when the State elected to nol pros the charges there remained 57 days before the expiration of the 180-day period. Accordingly, the State did not violate the <em>Hicks </em>mandate by nol prossing the charges. <em>See, Id. </em>at 467, 474 A.2d at 511. Clearly, if the State had nol prossed the charges in <em>Glenn, </em>as in the present case, the day prior to the expiration of <em>Hicks, </em>both the rationale of <em>Curley </em>and <em>Hicks </em>would apply and the appropriate sanction for evading <em>Hicks </em>would be a dismissal of the case. <em>Glenn, </em>perhaps more than <em>Curley, </em>demonstrates that the majority\u2019s analysis is simply incorrect in its efforts to distinguish <em>Curley </em>and <em>Glenn </em>and then conclude that \u201cthe <em>Curley </em>exceptions analysis is inappropriate where a nol pros is entered based on a flawed charging document.\u201d <em>See State v. Huntley, </em>411 Md. 288, 300 n. 13, 983 A.2d 160,167 n. 13 (2009). Reading <em>Curley </em>and <em>Glenn </em>together, leads to the inescapable conclusion that the same analysis the Court applied in <em>Curley </em>was applied in <em>Glenn </em>and should be applied in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">In the instant case, Judge Beckstead acted within her discretion and denied the motion to amend the indictment. There is no contention that the trial judge abused her discretion in denying that motion. This is similar to the situation in <em>Alther, </em>157 Md.App. at 337, 850 A.2d at 1224, a case in which the State entered a nol pros, but not to cure a defect in the charging document; instead, it was entered to evade the court\u2019s order denying the consolidation of charges. The Court of Special Appeals held in <em>Alther </em>that the \u201cnecessary effect\u201d of entering the nol pros, \u201cfour days before the end of the 180 day period, was to circumvent the 180-day rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 338, 850 A.2d at 1224. The alternative to entering the nol pros in that case was a dismissal for failure to comply with <em>Hicks. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">Given the alternatives available to the State, in the present case, the nol pros was intended to or did circumvent the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>requirements of <em>Hicks. </em>If the State had been given that which it requested, there would have been no reason for it to nol pros the charges and refile the indictment. The majority opinion suggests that the trial judge\u2019s \u201c[djenial of the amendment created a situation essentially where the trial could not proceed.\u201d <em>See State v. Huntley, </em>411 Md. at 300 n. 13, 983 A.2d at 167 n. 13 (2009). Also, according to the majority, \u201cit would not have been an abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court were it to have granted Huntley a continuance.\u201d <em>See State v. Huntley, </em>411 Md. at 300-01 n. 14, 983 A.2d at 168 n. 14 (2009). The majority is incorrect on both points. First, the court\u2019s ruling on the motion to amend did not prevent the State from going forward with its case. For example, nothing prevented the State from requesting an amendment to the dates in the charging document, by interlineation, if necessary, once it presented its evidence at trial. Second, only the administrative judge or his designee may grant a continuance of the trial. The trial judge had no authority to continue the trial date, unless the trial judge was also the administrative judge or his designee for postponements. The record, in the present case, however, does not suggest that the trial judge was also the administrative judge or his designee for postponements. The trial date in this case was March 3, 2008. Therefore, only the administrative judge had authority to continue the trial to a date outside the requirements of <em>Hicks. </em>As we explained in <em>Curley, </em>if \u201cwhenever the [S]tate desired a trial postponement beyond 180 days, it could nol pros the case, refile the same charges, and thereby cause the time period to start running anew, the requirements of <em>[Hicks </em>] would largely be rendered meaningless.\u201d <em>Curley, </em>299 Md. at 461, 474 A.2d at 508.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">For example, if the State had been dissatisfied with a ruling of the trial court with regard to a motion to amend, made one or two months prior to the expiration of the <em>Hicks </em>date, there probably would have been adequate time to re-indict before the 179th day or even the 180th day and thereby try the case within <em>Hicks. </em>Here, the State did not take that precaution and entered a nolle prosequi on the 179th day. As the hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>court found and the State concedes, the State\u2019s purpose in entering a nolle prosequi was to circumvent Judge Beckstead\u2019s ruling denying the motion to amend. Thus, the entry of the nol pros was not a legitimate option for the State. Even assuming for the sake of argument that the State\u2019s purpose in entering the nol pros was not to circumvent the requirements of <em>Hicks, </em>it is quite obvious that by entering the nol pros on the last day prior to the expiration of <em>Hicks, </em>that the necessary effect of entering the nol pros, regardless of motive, circumvented <em>Hicks. </em>Therefore, I would affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court for Wicomico County.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Accordingly, for the reasons stated herein, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Chief Judge BELL joins in the views herein expressed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b337-10\">.
