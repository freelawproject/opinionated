Olujobi (Awojobi), the respondent. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>petition charged, consistent with the complaint of John Walker-Turner, Esquire, counsel for one of the parties to the sale of real property that the respondent conducted, that the respondent violated Rule 8. 1, Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 8.4, Misconduct,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct, as adopted by Md. Rule 16-812, Md. Rule 16-609, Prohibited Transactions,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and Maryland Annotated Code (1989, 2004 RepLVoL) \u00a7 10-806 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article, pursuant to which \u201c[a] lawyer may not use trust money for any purpose other than the purpose for which the trust money is entrusted to the lawyer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>We referred the case, pursuant to Md. Rule 16-752(a)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>, to the Honorable Thomas P. Smith, of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, for hearing pursuant to Md. Rule 16-757(c).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Following a hearing, at which the respondent neither appeared nor participated, the hearing court found facts, by the clear and convincing standard, Md. Rule 16-757(b),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as follows (record references and footnotes omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-4\">\u201c1. On November 17, 2005, the Circuit for Prince George\u2019s County appointed respondent, Adekunkle Olujobi, a.k.a. Adekunkle Awojobi, as trustee for the sale of 3519 Roundhill Lane, Forestville, Maryland____The property was owned by Cleo M. Johnson and Shawn T. Johnson, who were divorced by order of the court dated January 3, 2001____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\"><em>\u201c2. </em>On May 30, 2006, respondent conducted an auction sale at the Prince George\u2019s County courthouse. The high bidder was Legacy Funding, LLC, which purchased the property for $230,500....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>\u201c3. On June 14, 2006, respondent filed a report of sale----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-4\">\u201c4. On March 2, 2007, the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, entered a final order of ratification for the sale of the Johnsons\u2019 house____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-5\">\u201c5. On March 18, 2007, settlement on the property took place at respondent\u2019s law office at 6411 Ivy Lane----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-6\">\u201c6. The sale was audited on June 13, 2007 and the audit was ratified on June 26, 2007....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-7\">\u201c7. Respondent did not distribute the proceeds of the sale to either party and on July 2, 2007, Cleo Johnson and Shawn Johnson, through their respective counsel, filed a Joint Motion To Distribute Settlement Proceeds____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-8\">\u201c8. On August 10, 2007, the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County ordered respondent to distribute $41,077.40 to Cleo Johnson and $41,077.09 to Shawn T. Johnson in care of his attorney, John Walker-Turner, Esquire----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-9\">\u201c9. Respondent did not distribute the funds to Shawn T. Johnson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-10\">\u201c10. In November 2007, complainant sent an e-mail to respondent asking respondent to contact him immediately in order to arrange for the delivery of Mr. Johnson\u2019s check. Complainant stated that if he did not hear from respondent by close of business on November 15, 2007, he would file a complaint with the Attorney Grievance Commission----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-11\">\u201c11. On November 18, 2007, respondent sent complainant an e-mail asking for \u2018professional courtesy and indulgence until the end of the month\u2019 when he would be back in the United States to take care of the disbursement. He further stated that his office in the United States was \u2018practically shut down for a Dubai office\u2019____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-12\">\u201c12. Complainant replied that respondent had until close of business on November 20, 2007 to send a check to his office____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-13\">\u201c13. On the afternoon of November 20, 2007, respondent sent an e-mail to complainant saying that his failure to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>Mr. Johnson must have been an oversight and that it was impossible to get a check to him until he got back....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-4\">\u201c14. On November 21, 2007, complainant sent an e-mail to respondent asking for clarification about a payment of $ 1,700 respondent had made in disbursing the proceeds of the sale of the house____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-5\">\u201c15. On November 22, 2007, respondent replied that he had no control over the disbursement and that he had just followed the auditor\u2019s instructions. He further advised complainant that he would \u2018get your check before the close of work the following Monday i.e. December 3rd____\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-6\">\u201c16. On December 4, 2007, complainant e-mailed respondent that he had yet to receive the check and again advised respondent that he would inform petitioner the next day____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-7\">\u201c17. On December 4, 2007, respondent e-mailed complainant that he was sorry but that he was still out of town and would make arrangements to pay before he got back. He said that he had asked his attorney, Rand Gelber, Esquire, to get in touch with complainant....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-8\">\u201c18. Subsequently, complainant received a phone call from Mr. Gelber stating that respondent did not have the money and that he hoped to obtain the necessary funds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-9\">\u201c19. On December 17, 2007, complainant filed a complaint with petitioner and advised that respondent had failed to disburse funds due his client____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-10\">\u201c20. Bar Counsel\u2019s investigator attempted to locate respondent to interview him regarding the complaint and was unsuccessful____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-11\">\u201c21. As of January 31, 2009, respondent had not disbursed any funds to Shawn T. Johnson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-12\">\u201c22. There is no evidence of any remedial action taken by respondent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-13\">On these facts, the hearing judge concluded that the respondent violated each of the charged violations, except the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>Rule 8.1 violation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As to Rule 8.4 of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Md. Rule 16-609, and \u00a7 10-306 of the Bus. Occ. &amp; Prof. Article, the judge reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-4\">\u201cThe evidence shows that respondent received the proceeds from the sale of the Johnsons\u2019 house pursuant to the settlement on March 18, 2007. On August 10,2007, this court ordered that $41,077.40 be distributed to Cleo Johnson and the same amount be distributed to Shawn T. Johnson[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>]. While it appears from the evidence that respondent may have paid Ms. Johnson, he did not pay Mr. Johnson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-5\">\u201cThe e-mail correspondence between complainant and respondent shows that four months after the order, respondent acknowledged that he had not distributed the money to Mr. Johnson. As of the date of the trial, almost 18 months after the order to disburse, respondent had yet to distribute the funds. He admitted through Mr. Gelber that he no longer had the funds. Even without this last piece of evidence, it is inferable from respondent\u2019s failure to disburse to Mr. Johnson his share of the proceeds that respondent has used Mr. Johnson\u2019s money for his own purposes. <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Duvall, </em>384 Md. 234, 863 A.2d 291, 294 (2004) (court infers that respondent failed to hold trust money in trust from passage of time and from respondent\u2019s failure to account to the client for the funds). Therefore, petitioner contends that it is established by clear and convincing evidence that respondent has appropriated funds belonging to Mr. Johnson to his own use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-6\">\u201cThis act is a violation of Md. Bus. Occ. &amp; Prof.Code Ann., \u00a7 10-306, which prohibits attorneys from using \u2018trust mon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>ey\u2019, such as the funds from the sale of the house, for a purpose other than that for which the money was entrusted to the lawyer. Respondent\u2019s conduct also violates Rule 16-609, which prohibits attorneys from borrowing or otherwise misusing money which is required to be deposited in their trust account, as these funds should have been. <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Brown, </em>380 Md. 661, 846 A.2d 428, 432 (2004) (misappropriation of client funds violates Md. Bus. Occ. &amp; Prof.Code Ann., \u00a7 10-304 and Rule 16-609).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-4\">\u201cLastly, respondent\u2019s conduct violates Rules 8.4(b), (c) and (d). His actions constitute theft in violation [of] Md.Crim. Law Code Ann., \u00a7 7-104(a) (2002) because he has taken Mr. Johnson\u2019s money and used it for his own purposes. In committing theft, he has violated Rule 8.4(b), (c) and (d). <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Kapoor, </em>391 Md. 505, 894 A.2d 502, 515, 517 (2006) (stealing client funds violates Rules 8.4(b), (c), and (d)).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">The petitioner filed no exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s findings, either of fact or conclusions of law. The petitioner did file, however, its recommendation for sanction. Noting the hearing judge\u2019s findings and conclusion from those findings that the respondent committed theft of funds entrusted to him and, thereby violated Rule 8.4(b), (c) and (d), Md. Rule 16-609 and Md. Bus. Occ. &amp; Prof.Code Ann., \u00a7 10-306, the petitioner submits that the respondent should be disbarred.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">As indicated, the respondent did not participate in these proceedings and, so, has neither excepted to the findings or conclusions nor presented anything remedial or mitigating.</p>\n<p id=\"A1A\">Md. Rule 16-759, as relevant, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-7\">\u201c(b) Review by Court of Appeals. (1) Conclusions of law. The Court of Appeals shall review de novo the circuit court judge\u2019s conclusions of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-8\">\u201c(2) Findings of fact. (A) If no exceptions are filed. If no exceptions are filed, the Court may treat the findings of fact as established for the purpose of determining appropriate sanctions, if any.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Thus, since no exceptions have been filed challenging the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact, we accept them as established. Moreover, those facts support the conclusions of law drawn by the court. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Hall, </em>408 Md. 806, 322, 969 A.2d 953, 962 (2009); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Goff, </em>399 Md. 1, 28, 922 A.2d 554, 570 (2007). Accordingly, we proceed to the determination of the appropriate sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">We recently confirmed, see <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. West, </em>411 Md. 3, 27, 981 A.2d 621, 635, 2009 Md. Lexis 738, *43 (2009), that, notwithstanding the benign goal of attorney discipline, \u201cthe protection of the public, rather than the punishment of the erring attorney,\u201d citing <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Hall, </em>408 Md. 306, 335, 969 A.2d 953, 970 (2009), the default sanction for ethical violations involving intentional \u201cmisappropriation, or other intentional dishonest conduct, <em>see Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376, 418, 773 A.2d 463, 488 (2001),\u201d is disbarment. Only where compelling extenuating circumstances are shown to justify it, will a lesser sanction be imposed in such cases. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Nussbaum, </em>401 Md. 612, 644, 934 A.2d 1, 20 (2007), and cases cited therein. Here, as we have seen, no evidence of such circumstances was presented to the hearing judge and, not surprisingly, none was found. It follows that the petitioner\u2019s recommendation that the respondent be disbarred is justified and, therefore, we accept it.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALT. COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE 16-761, FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION AGAINST ADEKUNLE B.
