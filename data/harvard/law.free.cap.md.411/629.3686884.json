The State\u2019s evidence was sufficient to establish that he committed those offenses on March 28, 2005. Petitioner noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed the judgments in <em>Prioleau v. State, </em>179 Md.App. 19, 943 A.2d 696 (2008). Petitioner then requested that this Court issue a <em>writ of certiorari </em>to address the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-7\">Was the question \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Maurice?\u201d the functional equivalent of interrogation under all the circumstances of this case, where the question was posed by a police officer standing in the doorway of a stash house the suspect had been seen using, and was directed toward a handcuffed suspect who had just been arrested by another officer nearby and brought back to the stash house?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">That request was granted. 405 Md. 290, 950 A.2d 828 (2008). For the reasons that follow, we hold that the words at issue did not constitute the functional equivalent of custodial interrogation, and therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">Detective Timothy Stach was the only witness who testified at the suppression hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Court of Special Appeals provided the following summary of the Detective\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>On March 28, 2005, Baltimore City Police Detective Timothy Stach and his partner Officer Jenkins were conducting a covert surveillance of the 1600 block of Regester Street. Det. Stach testified that, at about 6:00 p.m., he observed an Acura automobile pull to the curb. An individual, whom the detective recognized as Maurice Prioleau, [Petitioner], got out of the Acima and jogged to 1614 Regester Street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-5\">Det. Stach watched as [Petitioner] took out a clear plastic bag and tossed it onto the front steps of the house at that address. Det. Stach was using 10 by 50 binoculars at the time and could see small vials inside the plastic bag. The detective opined at the hearing as an expert in the packaging, distribution, and identification of controlled dangerous substances that the bag contained cocaine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-6\">Det. Stach saw [Petitioner] walk around the corner at the end of the block. The detective then saw a man, later identified as Keith Evans, walk up to the house at 1614 Regester Street to retrieve the bag. Det. Stach watched Evans distribute the contents of the bag to several individuals who had followed him. Those individuals walked away after the transactions. Evans continued to pace Regester Street, distributing items from the bag to individuals who approached him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-7\">[Petitioner] appeared and walked with Evans south on Regester Street toward Federal Street. [Petitioner] turned onto Federal Street, while Evans continued to distribute the contents of the bag to additional individuals along Regester Street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-8\">Det. Stach recalled that, at about 4:20 p.m., [Petitioner] returned. He entered 1610 Regester Street, and, after one minute, emerged with another bag of suspected cocaine. [Petitioner] gave the bag to Evans, who resumed his routine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>of strolling back and forth on Regester Street, engaging in \u201chand-to-hand transactions\u201d with individuals who approached.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-5\">Det. Stach alerted Officer David Crites, who was at the police station, that he believed he was witnessing \u201cnarcotics activity,\u201d and [Petitioner] and Evans were \u201cworking in tandem.\u201d Officer Crites responded to the scene, driving a marked police vehicle. Officer Crites saw Evans walking northbound toward the house at 1608 Regester Street and handing off the bag to an unknown person at that address. Officer Crites arrested Evans.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-6\">Det. Stach and Officer Jenkins emerged from their undercover observation position and joined Officer Crites. Det. Stach instructed Officer Crites to \u201cgo get [Petitioner].\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-7\">Det. Stach then escorted Evans into the house at 1610 Regester Street. The detective testified that there were numerous torn clear plastic bags on the floor, indicating drug activity in the house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-8\">Meanwhile, Officer Crites located [Petitioner], arrested him, and placed him in the cruiser. Officer Crites then drove to the front of 1610 Regester Street and removed [Petitioner] from the vehicle. [Petitioner] was reluctant to move, so Officer Crites employed a \u201cwrist lock\u201d and walked [Petitioner] up to the entrance of the house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-9\">As Officer Crites appeared at the front door of 1610 Regester Street with [Petitioner], Det. Stach was standing there. He said to [Petitioner]: \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Maurice?\u201d [Petitioner] then said: \u201cI\u2019m not going in that house. I\u2019ve never been in that house.\u201d Det. Stach testified that his words to [Petitioner] were \u201cnot a question on anything that has to do with illegal activity.\u201d He stated, moreover, that [Petitioner] appeared very agitated and nervous when he \u201cblurted out\u201d those words. Det. Stach acknowledged that [Petitioner] was under arrest by the time he was brought to the house....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-10\">Inside 1610 Regester Street, the police recovered a handgun with live rounds in it and three plastic bags containing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>25 clear vials of cocaine, all of which had been stashed above the ceiling tiles. The police searched [Petitioner] incident to his arrest and recovered $210.00 [from Petitioner\u2019s person].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">179 Md.App. at 22-24, 943 A.2d at 698-99 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">The record shows that the following transpired during Detective Stach\u2019s direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-6\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY:] And when you observed [Petitioner] being brought up to the house, could you explain his demeanor and his tone when he was making the statements to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-7\">[DETECTIVE STACH:] Oh, he was very agitated, nervous and he, again, he blurted out, as I said, \u201cHi, Maurice,\u201d to him, \u201cI\u2019m not going in that house. I was never in that house.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">The following transpired during Detective Stach\u2019s cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-9\">[PETITIONER\u2019S COUNSEL:] And when [Petitioner] was brought back by Officer Grites, was he free to leave at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-10\">[DETECTIVE STACH:] No, he was under arrest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Au9\">[PETITIONER\u2019S COUNSEL:] He was under arrest at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-11\">[DETECTIVE STACH:] Yes, at my direction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AdEO\">[PETITIONER\u2019S COUNSEL:] And did you read [Petitioner] his <em>Miranda </em>rights at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Asa\">[DETECTIVE STACH:] No, I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-12\">[PETITIONER\u2019S COUNSEL:] And are you aware of whether Officer Crites did?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-13\">[DETECTIVE STACH:] No, I do not believe so. I don\u2019t know. [Petitioner] was never questioned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQh\">[PETITIONER\u2019S COUNSEL:] Well, you asked him what was up, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-14\">[DETECTIVE STACH:] That\u2019s not a question on anything that has to deal with illegal activity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>[PETITIONER\u2019S COUNSEL:] I\u2019m not asking you that[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-4\">[DETECTIVE STACH:] I did ask him what was up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-5\">[PETITIONER\u2019S COUNSEL:] And after [Petitioner] blurted out [that] he didn\u2019t want to go into the house, I assume that\u2019s when the arrest and control technique was used; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-6\">[DETECTIVE STACH:] He was escorted in. I asked [Officer Crites] to bring him in. We needed him in the house. I didn\u2019t want one officer outside, one officer inside and then me looking around the house with three suspects, three Defendants [in there with me].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-7\">[PETITIONER\u2019S COUNSEL:] Detective, I asked you[,] was that before or after he blurted it, the statement out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-8\">[DETECTIVE STACH:] He was put into the house after he blurted out the statement, he was brought into the house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-9\">[PETITIONER\u2019S COUNSEL:] And it\u2019s my understanding from your testimony that nobody asked [Petitioner] any questions except you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-10\">[DETECTIVE STACH:] I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Maurice?\u201d That\u2019s a question, yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-11\">[PETITIONER\u2019S COUNSEL:] And that\u2019s when he blurted the statement out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-12\">[DETECTIVE STACH:] That\u2019s when he stated, \u201cI\u2019m not going in that house. I haven\u2019t been in that house.\u201d Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-13\">[PETITIONER\u2019S COUNSEL:] And after that, were there any other questions that were asked of him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-14\">[DETECTIVE STACH:] Not by me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>The following transpired at the conclusion of Detective Stach\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-4\">[PETITIONER\u2019S COUNSEL:] Your Honor, I\u2019m just going to submit. Thank you very much.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-5\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-6\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY:] Your Honor, I just simply argue that the statement that was made wasn\u2019t really ... in response to an interrogation, therefore <em>Miranda </em>didn\u2019t really apply at that time. It was a statement that was blurted out and I don\u2019t think it should be suppressed. And as far as the money that was recovered off of [Petitioner], it was [a] search incident to arrest and there was probable cause based on the facts that Your Honor heard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-7\">THE COURT: Okay, based on the evidence before the Court, the Court is satisfied that there was compliance with the Constitution of Maryland. Also, the Court is further satisfied that the law of the State is that an interrogation is where the officer expressly ask[s] an individual a question or employ[s] any word or act that the officer should [have] know[n][was] reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response. The evidence before the Court establishes that the comments by Detective[ ] Stach amounted to merely an exchange of greetings [under] the case law [of] <em>[Rhode Island v.] Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 [(1980)], [and] ... <em>[State v.] Conover, </em>312 Md. 33 [537 A.2d 1167 (1988)]. Also, the law of the State is [that] volunteered] statements or blurts that are not the product of an interrogation, [do] not trigger <em>Miranda </em>warnings. The Motion to Suppress ... the statements [is] considered and denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">The State\u2019s case-in-chief included the testimony that Petitioner sought to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">The following standard of review is applicable to a case in which a petitioner argues that this Court should reverse the denial of a motion to suppress his or her inculpatory statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-5\">In reviewing a circuit court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion to suppress evidence, we ordinarily consider only the evidence contained in the record of the suppression hearing. <em>State v. Tolbert, </em>381 Md. 539, 548, 850 A.2d 1192, 1197 (2004); <em>State v. Rucker, </em>374 Md. 199, 207, 821 A.2d 439, 443-44 (2003); <em>White v. State, </em>374 Md. 232, 249, 821 A.2d 459, 469 (2003). The factual findings of the suppression court and its conclusions regarding the credibility of testimony are accepted unless clearly erroneous. <em>Tolbert, </em>381 Md. at 548, 850 A.2d at 1197. We review the evidence and the inferences that may be reasonably drawn in the light most favorable to the prevailing party. <em>Id.; Rucker, </em>374 Md. at 207, 821 A.2d at 444; <em>White, </em>374 Md. at 249, 821 A.2d at 469. We \u201cundertake our own independent constitutional appraisal of the record by reviewing the law and applying it to the facts of the present case.\u201d <em>Tolbert, </em>381 Md. at 548, 850 A.2d at 1197; <em>White, </em>374 Md. at 249, 821 A.2d at 469.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-6\"><em>Rush v. State, </em>403 Md. 68, 82-83, 939 A.2d 689, 697 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">In the case at bar, it is clear that (1) Petitioner was \u201cin custody\u201d when he made the inculpatory statement,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (2) none of the exceptions to the requirements of <em>Miranda v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number><em>Arizona </em>are applicable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Petitioner was therefore entitled to suppression of the statement at issue if that statement resulted from either <em>actual </em>interrogation or the <em>junctional equivalent </em>of interrogation. We hold, however, that Petitioner was subjected to neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">As to whether \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Maurice?\u201d constituted actual interrogation,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> it is very well settled that not every question constitutes \u201cinterrogation\u201d of a suspect who is in custody when the question is asked. As the Supreme Court of Indiana has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-5\">The term \u201cinterrogation\u201d has been defined as a process of questioning by law enforcement officials which lends itself to obtaining incriminating statements. <em>Escobedo v. Illinois, </em>(1964), 378 U.S. 478, 485, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 1762, 12 L.Ed.2d 977, 986. Not every statement uttered by a police officer which is punctuated with a question mark will necessarily constitute an interrogation.... Rather, it is necessary to view the statement in the context in which it was made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Am5\"><em>Johnson v. State, </em>269 Ind. 370, 380 N.E.2d 1236, 1240 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">While the <em>Miranda </em>warnings must precede questions directed to the issue of whether a suspect who is in custody has engaged in and/or has knowledge of criminal activity, a classic example of a question that does not constitute \u201cinterrogation contemplated by <em>Miranda </em>\u201d is a question that asks the defendant, \u201cDo you understand your <em>(Miranda) </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>rights?\u201d <em>Richardson v. State, </em>6 Md.App. 448, 452, 251 A.2d 924, 927 (1969), <em>cert. denied </em>255 Md. 743 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">In <em>Richardson, </em>an appellant who had been convicted of rape and related offenses argued that he was entitled to a new trial on the ground that the State\u2019s evidence included statements attributed to him while he was being asked questions to determine whether he understood his <em>Miranda </em>rights. After the appellant had been placed under arrest, he was advised of his rights by a detective who read from a <em>\u201cMiranda </em>card\u201d that was introduced into evidence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That card contained four questions to be asked of the defendant after he or she had received the advise required by <em>Miranda:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-6\">Do you understand your rights and what I have just explained to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-7\">Are you willing to make a statement without a lawyer present at this time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-8\">Do you understand and know what you are doing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-9\">Have any promises, threats or inducements been made to pressure or coerce you into making this statement?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 450 n. 1, 251 A.2d at 926 n. 1. The suppression hearing court accepted the following testimony of the arresting officer. After he had read to appellant the <em>Miranda </em>rights contained on the card, and while he was asking appellant the questions contained on the card, appellant stated, \u201cI did not rape that girl. She gave in to me voluntarily.\u201d While rejecting the appellant\u2019s contention that his statement should have been suppressed, the Court of Special Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-11\">In the case at bar, there can be no question that the appellant was in police custody at the time the statement was given; but it is equally clear that the statement was not the result of \u201cquestioning initiated by law enforcement officers [quoting <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 444, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 1612, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966)].\u201d ... It is apparent that the appellant simply interrupted the officer and \u201cblurt<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>ed out\u201d or \u201cvolunteered\u201d the statement. The officer had not asked him any questions concerning the crimes for which he was arrested; interrogation, in the sense contemplated by <em>Miranda, </em>had not begun.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 452, 251 A.2d at 926 -27.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Cases holding that not every question constitutes \u201cinterrogation\u201d include <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>189 F.3d 502 (7th Cir.1999), in which an appellant who had been convicted of possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute argued that he was entitled to a new trial on the ground that the government\u2019s evidence included his post-arrest statements made after he had been asked whether he \u201cwould like to assist in different avenues of investigation that [you] could help us on[?]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 506. On June 16, 1997, the appellant was arrested for driving without a valid license, crack cocaine was discovered in the trunk of the vehicle he had been driving, and a vial containing crack cocaine was found under the seat of the patrol car in which he had been placed before being transported to police headquarters. On June 17,1997, the appellant (1) was removed from his cell by a detective of the East St. Louis Police Department (the detective) and advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, (2) stated that he would not make a statement unless a lawyer was present, and (3) was returned to his cell. On June 18, 1997, upon learning that the appellant had been arrested, an agent of the Illinois State Police (the agent) requested that the detective bring the appellant to an interview room where the agent requested that the appellant assist the officers in their investigation of the appellant\u2019s supplier. The statements at issue were made as the appellant was being returned to his cell. The United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois ruled that the appellant was not entitled to suppression of those statements. While affirming that ruling, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit provided the following factual background:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-7\">During the interview, ... [the agent] explained to Jackson that he was not concerned with any of the details of Jackson\u2019s arrest of June 16, 1997. [The agent] also advised Jackson that ... he [(the agent)] had knowledge that [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>appellant] had sold crack cocaine on two separate occasions to an undercover officer. [The agent] also told [the appellant] that he was not interested in obtaining any statement from him and that he was a \u201clittle fish\u201d who could help the police catch his supplier.... [The appellant] stated that he would call [the agent] upon his release. [The agent\u2019s] conversation with [the appellant] lasted approximately twenty minutes____As [the detective] escorted [the appellant] back to his cell, [the appellant] mentioned to [the detective] that after speaking to [the agent] he realized \u201cthat he was in a lot of trouble. He stated that he wanted to clear up an earlier matter of the traffic stop in the park.\u201d ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-6\">During the ensuing conversation, [the appellant] volunteered information to [the detective] concerning the June 16 traffic stop, none of which related to [the agent\u2019s] narcotics distribution investigation. Jackson stated that the bag of crack found in the trunk of [the] car [he had been driving immediately prior to his arrest] was his and took responsibility for placing the cocaine vial beneath the seat of the squad car.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 505-06 (footnote omitted). After citing <em>Arizona v. Roberson, </em>486 U.S. 675, 678, 108 S.Ct. 2093, 2096, 100 L.Ed.2d 704 (1988), (in which the United States Supreme Court held that, even if a suspect invokes his or her right to counsel when interrogated with respect to a particular investigation, the investigating officers \u201care free to inform the suspect of the facts of the second investigation as long as such communication does not constitute interrogation\u201d), the <em>Jackson </em>Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-8\">When [the agent] explained to Jackson that ... he knew that [the appellant] had sold crack cocaine to the undercover office on two occasions in April, he was \u201cinforming the suspect of the facts of the second investigation,\u201d <em>Roberson, </em>486 U.S. at 687, 108 S.Ct. at 2101, and soliciting Jackson\u2019s assistance if he was willing to give it after he was released from jail. [The agent] also told [the appellant] that he had no interest in obtaining a statement from him. With respect to the constitutional claim that Jackson has raised concerning his interview with [the agent], in view of the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>that [the agent] did not ask any questions of Jackson concerning the traffic stop on June 16, 1997, and since [the agent] advised Jackson of the fact that the only reason he was speaking with him was to solicit his help in an ongoing drug investigation after he was freed from jail, [the agent\u2019s] meeting with Jackson should not be considered an interrogation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-5\">\u201cAn accused, ... having expressed his desire to deal with the police only through counsel, is not subject to further interrogation by the authorities until counsel has been made available to him, <em>unless the accused himself initiates further communication, exchanges, or conversations with the police.\u201d Edwards v. Arizona, </em>451 U.S. 477, 484-85, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 1885, 68 L.Ed.2d 378 (1981) (emphasis added). After speaking with [the agent] on June 18, 1997, and as [the detective] was returning [the appellant] to his cell, Jackson personally requested that he be allowed to speak with the police in order that he might \u201cclear up\u201d the traffic stop. Obviously, ... it was Jackson who \u201cinitiated further communication.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 511. (Emphasis in opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">The above cited cases are consistent with <em>Hughes v. State, </em>346 Md. 80, 695 A.2d 132 (1997), in which, while holding that the \u201croutine booking question\u201d exception (to the requirements of <em>Miranda v. </em>Arizona) does not encompass a question as to whether the arrestee is a \u201cnarcotics or drug user,\u201d this Court stated that \u201cthe critical inquiry is whether the police officer, based on the totality of the circumstances, knew or should have known that the question was reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 95-96, 695 A.2d at 139-40. For these reasons, we conclude that, even if \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Maurice?\u201d was a question rather than a greeting, this \u201cquestion\u201d did not constitute \u201cinterrogation\u201d contemplated by <em>Miranda.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">While concluding that the words spoken by Detective Stach were words of greeting rather than words of interrogation, the Court of Special Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>The motions court concluded that Det. Stach\u2019s words, under the circumstances, were merely a greeting. Upon our independent assessment of the record, we agree. The phrase \u201cwhat\u2019s up?\u201d is commonly used as a greeting, especially, as the State points out, among young people. At least one other jurisdiction has recognized that the phrase is generally understood as a greeting. <em>See Arnett v. State, </em>353 Ark. 165, 122 S.W.3d 484, 488 (Ark.2003) (stating that the phrase \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d constitutes a general term of salutation, and holding that the officer\u2019s use of the phrase, under the circumstances of that ease, was not interrogation or its functional equivalent); <em>United States v. Paredes, </em>388 F.Supp.2d, 1185, 1193-94 (D.Haw.2005) (holding statement admissible where there was no evidence that a simple \u201cOkay, what\u2019s up?\u201d by the police officer would elicit an incriminating response).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-5\">Det. Stach\u2019s testimony indicates that he did not intend the words he spoke to appellant to be anything other than a greeting. He testified that \u2018W hat\u2019s up, Maurice?\u201d was \u201cnot a question on anything that has to do with illegal activity.\u201d The court did not indicate that it disbelieved that testimony, and we accept it. That fact is significant because \u201cthe police surely cannot be held accountable for the unforeseeable results of their words or actions,\u201d and \u201cthe definition of interrogation can extend only to words or actions on the part of police officers that they <em>should have known </em>were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.\u201d <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 301-02, 100 S.Ct. 1682 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-6\">Given that the phrase \u201cwhat\u2019s up\u201d is generally understood to be a greeting, and that Det. Stach did not intend the phrase to relate to anything \u201cillegal,\u201d we conclude that the detective\u2019s utterance of the words \u201cwhat\u2019s up, Maurice\u201d was not the functional equivalent of interrogation, under the circumstances of this case. Consequently, appellant\u2019s statement that followed on the heels of Det. Stach\u2019s greeting was not the product of interrogation but rather was volunteered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>by appellant. It was a classic \u201cblurt,\u201d to which the protections of <em>Miranda </em>do not apply. <em>See Fenner [v. State </em>], 381 Md. [1,] at 10[, 846 A.2d 1020, 1025 (2004), (holding that the petitioner had not been subjected to custodial interrogation during a bail review hearing when the presiding judge asked him, \u201cIs there anything you would like to tell me about yourself?\u201d)]; <em>State v. Conover, </em>312 Md. [33,] at 45[, 537 A.2d 1167, 1172 (1988)]; <em>see also Conboy v. State, </em>155 Md.App. 353, 373, 843 A.2d 216[, 228] (2004) (holding that a police officer\u2019s comment, remarking that a key discovered in defendant\u2019s pocket fit the ignition of a car involved in an accident, \u201cwas merely an observation made without inviting a response;\u201d and, although the appellant \u201cnonetheless did respond,\u201d the response was not the product of interrogation and was properly admitted into evidence at trial).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">179 Md.App. at 28-30, 943 A.2d at 702-03 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">In <em>Arnett v. State, </em>353 Ark. 165, 122 S.W.3d 484 (2003), the Supreme Court of Arkansas affirmed a sexual child abuse conviction obtained in part on evidence that, while the arresting officer was placing handcuffs on the defendant, (1) the arresting officer asked, \u201cwhat\u2019s up?\u201d and (2) the defendant stated that he had sexually abused his daughter and that he needed help. While rejecting the contention that the defendant\u2019s response should have been suppressed, the <em>Arnett </em>Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-7\">We hold that [the officer\u2019s] general question in this case of \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d is a general term of salutation much like the officer\u2019s salutation in <em>Weber v. State, </em>326 Ark. 564, 933 S.W.2d 370 (1996), wherein we held that the trial court was correct in admitting a defendant\u2019s incriminating statement made in reply to the responding officer\u2019s salutation. It is not reasonable to view [the officer\u2019s] general \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d as designed to elicit an incriminating response.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 488. The Court of Special Appeals expressly agreed with that analysis.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> So do we. We therefore hold that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>Petitioner\u2019s statement did not result from actual or express custodial interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">As to the issue of whether Petitioner was entitled to suppression on the ground that his statement resulted from the functional equivalent of interrogation, it is well settled that the functional equivalent of interrogation can occur even if the defendant is not asked a single question. In <em>Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980), while holding that the incriminating statement made by a robbery suspect being transported to the police station was admissible even though the statement was made in response to a conversation between the officers who were transporting the suspect, the United States Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-6\">\u201c[T]he <em>Miranda </em>safeguards come into play whenever a person in custody is subjected to either express questioning or its functional equivalent. That is to say, the term \u2018interrogation\u2019 under <em>Miranda </em>refers not only to express questioning, but also to any words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect. The latter portion of this definition focuses primarily upon the perceptions of the suspect, rather than the intent of the police. This focus reflects the fact that the <em>Miranda </em>safeguards were designed to vest a suspect in custody with an added measure of protection against coercive police practices, without regard to objective proof of the underlying intent of the police. A practice that the police should know is reasonably likely to evoke an incriminating response from a suspect thus amounts to interrogation. But, since the police surely cannot be held accountable for the unforeseeable results of their words or actions, the definition of interrogation can extend only to words or actions on the part of the police officers that they <em>should have known </em>were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 300-302, 100 S.Ct. at 1689-90 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">In <em>Drury v. State, </em>368 Md. 331, 793 A.2d 567 (2002), while concluding that a petitioner had been subjected to the func<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>tional equivalent of custodial interrogation, even though he had not been asked a single question before he made an inculpatory statement, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-5\">It is a basic principle that a statement taken during custodial interrogation conducted before a defendant is informed of his or her <em>Miranda </em>rights may not be used by the State in its case in chief against the defendant. The test to be applied in determining whether the police officer\u2019s statements ... was tantamount to interrogation is whether the words and actions of the officer were reasonably likely to elicit incriminating responses from petitioner. <em>See Williams v. State, </em>342 Md. 724, 760, 679 A.2d 1106, 1124-25 (1996).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 335-36, 793 A.2d at 510. In <em>Drury, </em>a jury convicted the petitioner of second degree burglary and related offenses. The State\u2019s case included evidence that the petitioner made an inculpatory statement after he had been (1) \u201cpicked up for questioning,\u201d (2) placed in an interrogation room, (3) shown a tire iron recovered at the scene of the crime, (4) shown a trash bag containing magazines that had been stolen during the burglary, and (5) told that those items would be examined for fingerprints. Even though the petitioner had not been asked any questions before he made the inculpatory statement, because that statement was made before he was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, this Court held that the statement should have been suppressed on the ground that \u201cthe officer\u2019s conduct and words were the functional equivalent of interrogation within the meaning of <em>Innis,\u201d </em>explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-7\">It is undisputed that, although petitioner was in custody, he was not subjected to express interrogation. The officer did not ask petitioner questions, but rather made a statement to him and displayed the tire iron and magazines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-8\">Petitioner had been brought to the police station for the express purpose of questioning and, in fact, had been told so by Corporal Whaley. The police were not engaged in routine booking procedures; they were not required by any Maryland rule or procedure to read any document (other than the <em>Miranda </em>rights) to petitioner. Nonetheless, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>officer placed the tire iron and the trash bag containing the stolen magazines on the table before petitioner before advising him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. The officer told petitioner that he was going to send the evidence to be examined for fingerprints. Moreover, the officer testified that he \u201cwas presenting the evidence that was going to be used for questioning.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-5\">It appears to us that the only reasonable conclusion that can be drawn from the foregoing facts is that the officer should have known, in light of his having told petitioner that he was being brought in for questioning, that putting the evidence before petitioner and telling him that the items were going to be fingerprinted was reasonably likely to evoke an incriminating response from him. The only plausible explanation for the officer\u2019s conduct is that he expected to elicit a statement from petitioner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 337, 793 A.2d at 571.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">On the other hand, in <em>State v. Conover, </em>312 Md. 33, 537 A.2d 1167 (1988), this Court reversed a holding of the Court of Special Appeals \u201cthat delivery of the Statement of Charges and Application to the respondent after he had requested an attorney constituted a form of interrogation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 38, 537 A.2d at 1169. In that case, a jury convicted the respondent of murder and related offenses. The State\u2019s case included evidence that he made an inculpatory statement after he had been advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and invoked his right to counsel. The respondent was arrested on a warrant, transported to the Baltimore County Police Headquarters, and taken to the office of the captain of the homicide squad, where he was read his <em>Miranda </em>rights and invoked his right to an attorney. Although he was not asked any questions at that time, while the detectives were completing his \u201cprocessing,\u201d a detective (1) read the Statement of Charges to him, (2) handed him copies of that document as well as the Application for Statement of Charges, and (3) suggested that he \u201cread them, look at them, [and] if [he] had any questions[,] ask them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 37, 537 A.2d at 1169. The respondent then asked several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>hypothetical questions, and made the incriminating statement at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">While holding that the respondent\u2019s incriminating statement was admissible, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-6\">[WJe are persuaded, as was the trial judge, that the police did not \u201cinterrogate\u201d Respondent within the meaning of <em>Miranda. </em>They intended to question him, and took him to the captain\u2019s office for that purpose \u2014 an entirely proper procedure. However, when Respondent declined to waive his right to counsel, all questioning ceased. The officers were entitled to complete the processing of the arrestee, and were required to furnish him with a copy of the Charging Document....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-7\">We infer no sinister motive from the fact that police provided Respondent with a copy of the Application as well as a copy of the Statement of Charges----We do not consider it unusual for the detectives to have treated the Application for a Statement of Charges as a part of the \u201cpacket\u201d of charging documents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-10\">... The police acted reasonably and lawfully, and the Respondent was not subjected to compelling influences, psychological ploys, or direct questioning. His volunteered statement was properly admitted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 42-45, 587 A.2d at 1171-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-12\">In <em>Blake v. State, </em>381 Md. 218, 849 A.2d 410 (2004), this Court cited <em>Conover </em>for the proposition that \u201c[m]erely presenting an accused with a charging document, without more is not the functional equivalent of interrogation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 236, 847 A.2d at 420. In <em>Blake, </em>however, while holding that all statements made by the petitioner after he invoked his <em>Miranda </em>rights were inadmissible, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-13\">When the charging document was given to petitioner, containing a false statement of the law with respect to the penalty of death, it was accompanied by an officer\u2019s statement which served no legitimate purpose other than to encourage petitioner to speak.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>... We reject the State\u2019s characterization ... that the officer\u2019s statement [\u201cI bet you want to talk now, huh!\u201d] was merely a rhetorical question. The officer\u2019s statement to petitioner could only be interpreted as designed to induce petitioner to talk and it was improper.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 235-36, 849 A.2d at 420.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">In the case at bar, Petitioner presented no evidence in support of his argument that his inculpatory statement resulted from the functional equivalent of custodial interrogation. He was entitled to testify at the suppression hearing without running the risk that the State could use his testimony in its case-in-chief,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> because a defendant\u2019s suppression hearing testimony \u201cmay not thereafter be admitted against [the defendant] at trial on the issue of guilt unless [the defendant] makes no objection.\u201d <em>Simmons v. United States, </em>390 U.S. 377, 394, 88 S.Ct. 967, 976, 19 L.Ed.2d 1247 (1968). As was the situation in <em>Conover, </em>however, only one witness testified at the suppression hearing. Under these circumstances, the suppression hearing court was not required to speculate that, when Petitioner heard the words, \u201cWhat\u2019s up,\u201d he actually believed that he was being subjected to custodial interrogation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>Reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, it is clear that the suppression hearing court found that Detective Stach did not intend to ask Petitioner \u201ca question on anything that has to do with illegal activity.\u201d That factual finding was not clearly erroneous. The critical inquiry, therefore, is whether Detective Stach, based on the totality of the circumstances, knew or should have known that greeting Petitioner with the words, \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Maurice?,\u201d would be reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response. From our own independent constitutional appraisal of the record, we hold that it is not reasonable to expect that those words would be likely to elicit an incriminating response. We therefore agree with the suppression hearing court and the Court of Special Appeals that there is no merit in Petitioner\u2019s argument that he was subjected to the functional equivalent of interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED; PETITIONER TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b666-11\">.
