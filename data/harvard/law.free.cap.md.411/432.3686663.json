Bar Counsel charged Respondent with violating the following Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMRPC\u201d), Maryland Rules, and Maryland Statute: MRPC 1.15 (Safekeeping Property),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> MRPC 8.1 (Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> MRPC 8.4 (Miscon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>duct),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Maryland Rule 16-606 (Name and Designation of Account),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Maryland Rule 16-609 (Prohibited Transactions),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and Maryland Code (2006 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article (\u201cB.O.P.\u201d) (Misuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>of trust money).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">Pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-752(a),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we referred the Petition to the Honorable Susan Souder of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, to conduct an evidentiary hearing and make findings of fact and conclusions of law. Judge Souder held an evidentiary hearing on April 28, 2009, and on May 19, 2009, issued her findings of fact and recommended conclusions of law, pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-757(c).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Judge Souder found by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent had violated MRPC Rules 1.15(a), 8.1(b), 8.4(b), (c), and (d); Maryland Rules 16-606 and 16-609; and B.O.P. \u00a7 10-306.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Respondent was admitted as a member of the Bar of this Court on June 1, 1983. The conduct at issue in this Petition occurred incident to Respondent\u2019s representation of several clients in personal injury actions in connection with his practice of law as the Law Office of George S. Jarosinski and/or the Law Office of George S. Jarosinski, P.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Despite the grave allegations in the Petition, Respondent did not participate in the proceedings against him until he appeared before us at oral argument on October 5, 2009. Respondent\u2019s lack of participation and the corresponding default judgment against him was summarized in Judge Souder\u2019s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law:<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-4\">On October, 14, 2008, this matter was transmitted to this Court for Baltimore County to be heard and determined in accordance with Maryland Rule 16-757. An Affidavit of Service was filed which reflected that, on January 30, 2009, Respondent was personally served with the Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action, the summons of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County issued January 15, 2009 and the Order of the Court of Appeals dated October 14, 2008. At the same time, Respondent was also served with Petitioner\u2019s First Set of Interrogatories and a Request for Production of Documents. Respondent has not filed an Answer to the Petition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-5\">After the time for filing the Answer to the Petition passed, on or about March 5, 2009, Petitioner filed a Motion for Order of Default which was granted on March 6, 2009 and an Order of Default was issued. The Order set the date for the evidentiary hearing for April 28, 2009. On March 11, 2009, a copy of the Order of Default was sent to Respondent. Respondent did not respond to the Order of Default or appear at the hearing on April 28, 2009.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-6\">In accordance with Maryland Rule 2-323(e),[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>] the averments in the Petition are deemed admitted for purposes of the proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>In addition to the above, Judge Souder made the following findings of fact.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-4\">4. During the period May 22, 2007 through October 31, 2007, Respondent maintained two checking accounts at Provident Bank. Both accounts were intended by Respondent to be used as Attorney Trust Accounts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-5\">5. The checks and deposit tickets for these accounts did not include the designation: \u201cAttorney Trust,\u201d \u201cAttorney Escrow\u201d or \u201cClient Funds Account.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-6\">6. Respondent opened the first account, account number 7814, on or about May 22, 2007. Respondent was the sole authorized signer on the account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-7\">7. Respondent opened the second account, account number (ending with) 8012, on or about July 9, 2007. Account 8012 contained the phrase \u201cEscrow Account.\u201d Respondent was the sole authorized signer on this account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-8\">8. During times relevant to this matter, Respondent received funds intended to be held in trust by him on behalf of clients and/or third persons in connection with Respondent\u2019s law practice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-9\">9. These funds were deposited to one or the other of the trust accounts maintained by Respondent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-10\">10. On August 23,2007, check number 114 in the amount of $1,833.33 made payable to Respondent, cleared the trust account number 8012. The check had the following handwritten notation: \u201cTanya Hairston-Fee D/A 5-26-07.\u201d On September 19, 2007, a check from Nationwide Insurance payable to \u201cTanya Hairson and Jarosinski, George Her Attorney\u201d in the amount of $5,500 was deposited to the same trust account.[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>] The date of the check was Septem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>ber 5, 2007. The evidence established that Respondent disbursed funds representing his fee for the Tanya Hairson settlement 27 days prior to the deposit of the settlement funds and 13 days before the check was even written by the insurer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-4\">11. On August 23, 2007, check number 112 in the amount of $1,833.33 payable to Respondent cleared trust account number 8012. This check was dated August 22, 2007 and bears the notation \u201cFee Dana Ferguson.\u201d On October 1, 2007, a check from Nationwide Insurance in the amount of $5,500 made payable to \u201cDana D. Ferguson and Jarosinski, George Her Attorney\u201d was deposited to the same trust account. The date the check was issued/written was September 25, 2007. The evidence established that Respondent disbursed his fee for the Dana Ferguson representation 38 days before depositing the settlement funds and 33 days before the insurer issued the check.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-5\">12. The funds disbursed to Respondent on August 23, 2007 were in trust account 8012 as a result of prior deposits of trust funds for the following clients: W. McManus; K. Cornish; J. Chase; D. Neal; and L. Lewis. At a time that Respondent owed a trust obligation in excess of $8,000.00 for these clients, the balance in his attorney trust account was approximately $1,600.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-6\">13. On October 15, 2007, two checks payable to Respondent issued from trust account 8012. One of the checks was in the amount of $35.17 and had a notation of \u201cExpenses Tameka Smith 6-16-07.\u201d The check in the amount of $2,233.33 has a notation of \u201cTameka Smith 6-16-07.\u201d The settlement funds for Tameka Smith were not deposited until October 19, 2007, four days after the corresponding fees and costs were disbursed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-7\">14. Respondent repeated this conduct with regard to a client name[d] Katrina Jones-Coleman. On October 1, 2007, check number 174 in the amount of $13.00 was disbursed to Respondent from trust account number 8012. This check\u2019s notation indicated it was for \u201cExpenses Katrina Jones-Coleman 5-17-07.\u201d Check number 176 dated 9-15-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>07 in the amount of $1,650 was on account 8012 payable to Respondent [and] was posted on Oct. 15, 2007. The settlement funds for Katrina Jones-Coleman were not deposited to the account until October 19, 2007. Respondent received reimbursement for expenses 18 days and his fee 4 days before the settlement proceeds were deposited.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-4\">15. On or about June 18, 19, and 21, 2007, Petitioner received notices of overdrafts on Respondent\u2019s attorney trust account number 7814 at Provident Bank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-5\">16. On June 29, 2007, Respondent was sent a letter by Deputy Bar Counsel requesting a written explanation for the overdrafts and the production of financial records covering the period March through June 2007. The Respondent was asked to respond to this letter within ten (10) days. Respondent failed to respond to the letter of June 29, 2007 in a timely manner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-6\">17. On or about July 20, 2007, Petitioner received a notice of overdraft on Respondent\u2019s attorney trust account number 8012 at Provident Bank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-7\">18. On or about August 1, 2007, Assistant Bar Counsel sent Respondent a letter informing him that a case had been docketed against him and requesting that a written response and financial records be provided within fifteen (15) days. Respondent failed to respond in a timely manner to Assistant Bar Counsel\u2019s letter of August 1, 2007.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-8\">19. On or about August 22, 2007, a letter dated August 17, 2007, was received from Respondent. This letter was addressed to Deputy Bar Counsel and responded to the letter of June 29, 2007. In this letter, Respondent did not fully and accurately represent the transactions in the account in question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-9\">20. On or about August 23, 2007, the Attorney Grievance Commission received another overdraft notice in Respondent\u2019s attorney trust account number 7814 at Provident Bank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-10\">21. On or about September 12, 2007, Assistant Bar Counsel sent Respondent another letter requesting a writ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>ten response within fifteen (15) days. Respondent failed to respond to Assistant Bar Counsel\u2019s letter of September 12, 2007.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-4\">22. On or about September 20, 2007, the Attorney Grievance Commission received two overdraft notices for account 8012.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-5\">23. On or about October 8, 2007, Petitioner issued a subpoena to Provident Bank for the records for both trust accounts for the period May through October 2007.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-6\">24. On or about November 21, 2007, Commission Investigator, Marc Fiedler, began efforts to arrange an interview of the Respondent. Mr. Fiedler was not able to arrange for this interview until on or about December 27, 2007. On that date, Respondent and Mr. Fiedler met at Respondent\u2019s office. During the interview, Respondent failed to address all of Mr. Fiedler\u2019s questions. Respondent terminated the interview to seek advice of counsel. Thereafter, neither Respondent nor his attorney contacted Mr. Fiedler to reschedule the interview.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">From these facts, Judge Souder drew the following conclusions of law.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-8\">\n<em>Rule 1.15. Safekeeping Property.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-9\">Respondent violated Rule 1.15(a) when he failed to hold the funds entrusted to him by numerous clients in the attorney trust account until properly disbursed. On July 18, 2007, account number 8012 had a negative balance because Respondent did not deposit enough into the account to pay the charge for the purchase of checks for this account. The shortfall was corrected when Respondent deposited the settlement check for the clients named Mc-Manus and Cornish on August 7, 2007. Thus, the Mc-Manus/Cornish trust funds were invaded to cover the shortfall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>Rule 1.15(a) was also violated when Respondent paid himself fees and costs for settlements prior to the deposit of the funds for those settlements. By doing so, Respondent misappropriated funds being held for other clients as a result of earlier deposits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-4\">On August 24, 2007, Respondent\u2019s attorney trust account had a balance of $1,586.97. As of that date he should have been holding at least $8,365.04. This shortfall provides clear and convincing evidence that, Respondent misappropriated trust funds in violation of Rule 1.15(a). See, <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Glenn, </em>341 Md. 448, 460, 671 A.2d 463, 469 (1996) (The fact that the balance in the attorney trust account fell below the amount necessary to fulfill client obligations indicates a misappropriation or unauthorized use of trust funds.).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-5\"><em>Maryland Rule 16-609 </em>\u2014 Prohibited <em>Transactions.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\">As indicated above, Respondent used trust funds for unauthorized purposes when he used funds held in his trust account for other clients to pay himself fees and costs relating to settlements prior to the deposit of those settlement funds. The same conduct which violated Rule 1.15(a) provides clear and convincing evidence that Maryland Rule 16-609 was violated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">\n<em>Md.Code Ann. Business Occupations and Professions Art. \u00a7 10-306. Misuse of trust money.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-8\">Although not required for a violation of Rule 1.15 or Maryland Rule 16-609, in order to find that Respondent violated \u00a7 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article, the Court must find that the misappropriation or unauthorized use of the trust funds was knowing and/or intentional. See, e.g., <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Awuah, </em>346 Md. 420, 435, 697 A.2d 446, 454 (1997)(Members of the Bar are charged with knowledge of the ethical rules governing the operation of an attorney trust account.); <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Adams, </em>349 Md. 86, 97-98, 706 A.2d 1080, 1085 (1998)(In order to invoke disciplinary proceedings for a violation of this statute the violation must be willful.).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>Respondent knew that he was not using trust funds deposited for Tanya [Hairson] and Dana Ferguson when he made disbursements relating to those settlements on August 28, 2007, because he had neither received or deposited the settlement checks from the insurers as of that date. Respondent knew, therefore, that the only funds available to make the disbursements related to deposits made for other clients. There is clear and convincing evidence that Respondent knew he was using trust funds for unauthorized purposes. See, <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Zuckerman, </em>386 Md. 341, 372-73, 872 A.2d 693, 712 (2005) (An attorney violated \u00a7 10-306 when he disbursed funds to his clients from his trust account before their settlement checks had been deposited into the trust account, thereby providing funds belonging to one client to another.).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-4\">\n<em>Rule 8.1 Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-5\">Respondent violated Rule 8.1(b) when he failed to respond in a timely manner to Deputy Bar Counsel\u2019s letter of June 29, 2007. Although he was asked to respond within 10 days of his receipt of the letter, he did not request an extension and did not provide a response to this letter until August 17, 2007. By that time he had received the letter of August 1, 2007 to which he did not respond. Respondent also failed to respond to Assistant Bar Counsel\u2019s letter of September 12, 2007. See, <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Fezell, </em>361 Md. 234, 249-50, 760 A.2d 1108, 1116 (2000), <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Queen, </em>[407 Md. 556, 565, 967 A.2d 198, 203 (2009)] (Although a lawyer need not drop everything until he or she has completed a response, the lawyer who receives a request for information from Bar Counsel can comply with the requirements of Rule 8.1(b) by (1) acknowledging receipt of Bar Counsel\u2019s request, (2) explaining why he or she needs an extension of time to file a response, and (3) requesting that Bar Counsel consent to an extension for a reasonable period of time.).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\"><em>Maryland Rule 16-606 </em>\u2014 Name <em>and Desiynation of Account.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>There is clear and convincing evidence that the checks and deposit tickets for both of the attorney trust accounts maintained by Respondent from May through October 2007 did not bear one of the necessary designations: Attorney Trust Account; Attorney Escrow Account or Clients\u2019 Fund Account. The title on the checks for account number 7814 stated: \u201cLaw Office of George S. Jarosinski.\u201d The checks and deposit tickets for account number 8012 are titled: \u201cGeorge S. Jarosinski, P.A. Escrow Account.\u201d While the title for this account added the words \u201cEscrow Account,\u201d it did not indicate that this is an attorney escrow account or even that it was a law firm\u2019s escrow account. There is clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated Maryland Rule 16-606.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-4\">\n<em>Rule 8.4 Misconduct.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-5\">Respondent engaged in criminal acts that reflected adversely on his honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects when he knowingly used trust funds for unauthorized purposes. The willful use of trust funds for unauthorized purposes violates \u00a7 10-606(b) of the Business Occupations and Professions Article. This section provides that: A person who willfully violates any provision of Subtitle 3, [P]art I of this title, except for the requirement that a lawyer deposit trust moneys in an attorney trust account for a charitable purpose under \u00a7 10-303 of this title, is guilty of a misdemeanor and on conviction is subject to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or imprisonment not exceeding 5 years or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-6\">A criminal conviction is not required for a finding that Rule 8.4(b) was violated. The Court need only find that there is clear and convincing evidence of acts constituting a criminal offense. See, <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Garland, </em>345 Md. 383, 394-95, 692 A.2d 465, 471 (1997). The unauthorized use of trust funds adversely reflects on Respondent\u2019s honesty and trustworthiness to practice law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-7\">There is clear and convincing evidence that Respondent engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>misrepresentation, in violation of Rule 8.4(c), when he knowingly misappropriated client trust funds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-4\">An attorney engages in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice when he or she engages in conduct which is likely to seriously impair the public\u2019s perception of the legal profession. <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Clark, </em>363 Md. 169, 183, 767 A.2d 865, 873 (2001). Respondent engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice, in violation of Rule 8.4(d), when he misappropriated funds[.] See, e.g., <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Zuckerman, </em>386 Md. 341, 374-75, 872 A.2d 693, 713 (2005) (Misappropriation of client funds and misuse of an attorney trust account violates Rule 8.4(d)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Judge Souder found no facts in mitigation of the violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">\u201cThis Court has original and complete jurisdiction over attorney discipline proceedings[ ] in Maryland.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Moreover, this Court defers to the hearing judge\u2019s opportunity to assess the witnesses\u2019 credibility, and we will not interfere with the hearing judge\u2019s factual findings as long as they are founded on clear and convincing evidence.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

This standard of review applies even when the hearing judge has entered a default order and judgment. <em>Zdravkovich, </em>375 Md. at 126, 825 A.2d at 427.

Moreover, we accept the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law if they are supported by the factual findings. <em>Snyder, </em>406 Md. at 28, 956 A.2d at 151.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Judge Souder\u2019s conclusions of law are supported by the established facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">On July 18, 2007, Respondent\u2019s trust account ending in 8012 had a negative balance of $53.55 because Respondent had deposited insufficient funds to pay for the cost of the checks ordered for the account. That same day, Provident Bank issued an overdraft notice on the account. Therefore, Respondent was aware that any funds deposited in the account would be applied to the shortfall. Respondent, however, failed to deposit any funds into the account until August 7, 2007, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>he deposited two settlement checks, one designated as Mc-Manus client funds and another as Cornish client funds; the overdraft amount on account 8012 was then deducted from these funds. Respondent\u2019s use of client trust funds to cover the shortfall on the account was an unauthorized use of client funds. We therefore agree with Judge Souder that there is clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated MRPC 1.15(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">We also agree with Judge Souder that Respondent violated MRPC 1.15(a) when he disbursed funds to himself from account 8012 to pay fees and expenses for clients without first depositing the settlement funds from those clients. On August 22, 2007, Respondent drafted in his name three checks to pay client fees before depositing the corresponding settlement funds for those clients. First, Respondent drafted check number 112 in the amount of $1,833.33, designated as fees for client Ferguson, but did not deposit the client\u2019s settlement funds until October 1, 2007. Second, Respondent drafted check number 114 in the amount of $1,833.33, designated as fees for client Hairson, but did not deposit the client\u2019s settlement funds until September 19, 2007. Third, Respondent drafted check number 119 in the amount of $1,505.00, designated as fees for client McManus, but did not deposit sufficient settlement funds to cover the entire payment until August 29, 2007. Respondent deposited these checks on August 23, 2007, even though the requisite settlement funds had not yet been deposited and, therefore, applied funds from other clients to these payments.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Respondent repeated this conduct on September 15, 2007, when he drafted checks numbers 174 and 176, in the amounts of $13.00 and $1,650.00, respectively, to pay expenses and fees for client Jones-Coleman prior to depositing any settlement funds in that client\u2019s account. Moreover, on October 3, 2007, Respondent drafted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>checks numbers 199 and 200, in the amounts of $35.17 and $2,333.33, respectively, which he designated as expenses and fees for client Smith even though he had not yet deposited that client\u2019s settlement funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">These numerous instances in which Respondent withdrew client trust funds to pay other clients\u2019 fees, when he should have held those funds in trust, establish by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent also violated Maryland Rule 16-609; B.O.P. \u00a7 10-306; and MRPC 8.4(b), (c), and (d). Respondent violated Maryland Rule 16-609, which prohibits the use of client funds for \u201cany unauthorized purpose,\u201d because, as we have discussed, he impermissibly disbursed client trust funds to pay himself fees and costs related to settlements before deposit of those funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">These same misappropriations of client funds also violated B.O.P. \u00a7 10-306, which prohibits the willful misuse of trust money. \u201cWe have said that in order to invoke disciplinary proceedings for a violation of section 10-306, section \u201910-307 requires that the attorney\u2019s violation of [section] 10-306 must be <em>willful.\u2019 \u201d Adams, </em>349 Md. at 97-98, 706 A.2d at 1085 (internal citations omitted) (emphasis in original). In the context of attorney grievance matters, willfulness is defined as \u201cthe voluntary, intentional violation of a known legal duty not requiring a deceitful or fraudulent motive.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Nussbaum, </em>401 Md. 612, 636, 934 A.2d 1, 15 (2007) (internal quotations and citations omitted). A hearing judge need not have evidence of a deceitful or fraudulent motive to conclude that an attorney\u2019s conduct was willful. Yet, evidence of misappropriation alone, without more, is insufficient to prove willfulness if other evidence supports a finding that the misconduct was merely negligent. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. DiCicco, </em>369 Md. 662, 682-83, 802 A.2d 1014, 1025-26 (2002); <em>Glenn, </em>341 Md. at 482, 671 A.2d at 480 (citing <em>McBurney v. State, </em>280 Md. 21, 29 &amp; n. 6, 371 A.2d 129, 134 <em>&amp; </em>n. 6 (1977)). In other words, the facts in the record must support a finding, by clear and convincing evidence, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>general intent. <em>Glenn, </em>341 Md. at 482, 671 A.2d at 480 (citing <em>McBurney, </em>280 Md. at 29 &amp; n. 6, 371 A.2d at 134 &amp; n. 6).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Often, in cases involving the willful misappropriation of attorney trust funds, the records contain direct evidence of intentional and knowing misconduct. <em>See, e.g., Thomas, </em>409 Md. at 156-61, 973 A.2d at 206-08 (quoting attorney testimony acknowledging that he was aware that the client to whom he had attributed a disbursement of fees had never deposited any money in the trust account); <em>Nussbaum, </em>401 Md. at 639, 934 A.2d at 16 (\u201cRespondent wrote checks from his escrow account and deposited the funds into his operating account in order to cover personal expenses. When it came time for Respondent to disburse funds from the escrow account to proper payees, he would \u2018borrow\u2019 funds from other clients[.]\u201d); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Butler, </em>395 Md. 1, 12-13, 909 A.2d 226, 232-33 (2006) (\u201cRespondent used his Attorney Trust Account for personal and business matters, making payments to Pepeo, Verizon, Global pay Global STL, and American Express Collection.\u201d). An attorney\u2019s intent, however, may be inferred from circumstantial evidence. <em>See Thomas, </em>409 Md. at 159, 973 A.2d at 208 (sustaining hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that attorney\u2019s misappropriation was willful because he had withdrawn funds from clients who had contributed significantly less, or not at all, to the account); <em>Attorney Grievance Com\u2019n v. Zakroff, </em>387 Md. 603, 627, 645-46, 876 A.2d 664, 678-79, 690 (2005) (finding willful misappropriation on the grounds that the attorney\u2019s repeated conduct, methodology, and control over the account belied the attorney\u2019s claims of ignorance of account balances). Moreover, in making the determination that an attorney\u2019s misconduct was willful, the hearing judge may choose the evidence upon which to rely and, as long as the record supports the corresponding finding, we will not disturb the hearing judge\u2019s decision. <em>Thomas, </em>409 Md. at 156, 973 A.2d at 206 (\u201c[T]he factual determination of whether Respondent engaged in conduct involving, dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation was within the province of the hearing judge, to be decided after consideration of character testimony and other evidence[.]\u201d); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number><em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Powell, </em>328 Md. 276, 292, 614 A.2d 102, 110 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">We conclude that Judge Souder\u2019s determination that Respondent willfully misappropriated client trust funds is supported by clear and convincing evidence. The record shows that Respondent was the sole authorized signer on accounts 7814 and 8012. He, therefore, was solely responsible for all deposits and disbursements from the accounts and, as such, had notice of all account activity. Further, notwithstanding Bar Counsel\u2019s letters to Respondent notifying him of the July 20, 2007, and September 20, 2007, overdraft notices on account 8012, Respondent continued to disburse funds from that account to pay putative client fees before receiving the settlement funds for those clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Given Respondent\u2019s direct supervision of the accounts and account activities, we accept as reasonable Judge Souder\u2019s ultimate finding that Respondent was aware of the account balances each time his trust obligation exceeded the trust account balance and, therefore, willfully misappropriated client funds to cover those shortfalls. Likewise, Respondent\u2019s control of the trust accounts coupled with his repeated disbursement of fees from the account before receiving the corresponding settlement funds reasonably support Judge Souder\u2019s ultimate finding that Respondent knew he had not yet received the requisite settlement funds and, therefore, willfully misappropriated client funds. The willfulness of Respondent\u2019s conduct supports a violation of B.O.P. \u00a7 10-306.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Respondent\u2019s violation of B.O.P. \u00a7 10-306 supports a violation of MRPC 8.4(b), which proscribes as professional misconduct \u201ca criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer\u2019s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer[.]\u201d MRPC 8.4(b). Respondent\u2019s violation of B.O.P. \u00a7 10-603 constitutes a criminal act. <em>See </em>B.O.P. \u00a7 10-606(b).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> As Judge Souder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>noted, to conclude that an attorney has violated MRPC 8.4(b), the attorney need not have been convicted of a criminal act; the hearing judge need only find clear and convincing evidence that the attorney committed the underlying offense. <em>Garland, </em>345 Md. at 394-95, 692 A.2d at 471.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">For the same reasons that Respondent\u2019s willful misappropriation violated B.O.P. \u00a7 10-306 and MRPC 8.4(b), that conduct violated MRPC 8.4(c). Respondent intentionally misrepresented that he had earned the funds he disbursed to himself as fees from clients who had no trust funds in the account, and such conduct inherently involves misrepresentation and dishonesty. <em>See Thomas, </em>409 Md. at 163, 973 A.2d at 210 (concluding that an attorney\u2019s violation of B.O.P. \u00a7 10-306 gave rise to a violation of MRPC 8.4(c)). Moreover, Respondent\u2019s intentional misappropriation was conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice and, thus, a violation of MRPC 8.4(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Respondent violated Maryland Rule 16-606 by failing to maintain his trust accounts under one of the rule\u2019s requisite designations. The account titles, \u201cLaw Office of George S. Jarosinski\u201d and \u201cGeorge S. Jarosinski, P.A., Escrow Account\u201d are insufficient to provide notice, as required by Maryland Rule 16-606, that the accounts were attorney trust accounts maintained for the purpose of safekeeping client funds. Finally, Respondent\u2019s failure to respond timely to Bar Counsel\u2019s inquiries and to cooperate fully with Bar Counsel\u2019s investigation was a failure \u201cto respond to a lawful demand for information from [a] ... disciplinary authority\u201d and thereby violated MRPC 8.1(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">We are left only to determine the appropriate sanction for Respondent\u2019s misconduct. When sanctioning an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>attorney, we seek not to punish but to \u201cprotect the public and the public\u2019s confidence in the legal profession\u201d and to deter other attorneys from the same misconduct. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Kreamer, </em>404 Md. 282, 348, 946 A.2d 500, 539 (2008). Accordingly, \u201c[t]he severity of the sanction depends on several things, including \u2018the circumstances of each case, the intent [with] which the acts were committed, the gravity, nature and effects of the violations as well as any mitigating factors.\u2019 \u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Nichols, </em>405 Md. 207, 217, 950 A.2d 778, 785 (2008) (quoting <em>Ward, </em>394 Md. at 32-33, 904 A.2d at 496).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">Petitioner recommends disbarment as the appropriate sanction for Respondent\u2019s misconduct. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Paramount among Respondent\u2019s multiple violations are his violations of MRPC 8.4(b), 8.4(c), and B.O.P. \u00a7 10-306, by repeatedly and intentionally misappropriating client funds, and MRPC 8.1(b) by failing on at least three occasions to respond timely, if at all, to Bar Counsel\u2019s inquiries. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Brown, </em>380 Md. 661, 668-70, 846 A.2d 428, 432-33 (2004) (disbarring attorney who misappropriated one client\u2019s funds and who failed to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s letters). Respondent\u2019s intentional misappropriation is especially egregious because it \u201c\u2018is an act infected with deceit and dishonesty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Butler, </em>395 Md. at 15, 909 A.2d at 234 (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376, 406, 773 A.2d 463, 480 (2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">This Court has held consistently that \u201cacts of dishonesty, fraud, or misleading behavior frequently result in a sanction of disbarment.\u201d <em>Thomas, </em>409 Md. at 171, 973 A.2d at 216; <em>see also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Ward, </em>396 Md. 203, 218, 913 A.2d 41, 50 (2006) (\u201c[Disbarment ordinarily should be the sanction for intentional dishonest conduct.\u201d) (internal quotations and citations omitted). Professional misconduct of this nature warrants such an extreme sanction because, \u201c[u]nlike matters relating to competency, diligence and the like, intentional dishonest conduct is closely entwined with the most important matters of basic character to such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>degree as to make intentional dishonest conduct by a lawyer almost beyond excuse.\u201d <em>Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. at 418, 773 A.2d at 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">The intentional misappropriation of entrusted funds merits disbarment not only because it is inherently dishonest but also because, \u201ceven without actual loss, ... the failure to keep client funds separate subjects the funds to the claims of creditors of the lawyer.\u201d <em>Glenn, </em>341 Md. at 489, 671 A.2d at 483 (\u201cWe have consistently found misappropriation by an attorney of entrusted funds, be it intentional, knowing, or negligent, to be of great concern, representing serious professional misconduct.\u201d); <em>see also Thomas, </em>409 Md. at 174-75, 973 A.2d at 217-18 (holding that disbarment was the appropriate sanction for an attorney who withdrew trust funds for clients who had contributed substantially less, or not at all, to the account); <em>Brown, </em>380 Md. at 666-67, 669-70, 846 A.2d at 431, 433 (disbarring attorney who withdrew settlement funds for an unauthorized purpose, did not properly title trust account, and failed to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s letters).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Although we have noted that an attorney who has misappropriated funds may avoid disbarment under compelling extenuating circumstances justifying a lesser sanction, <em>Ward, </em>396 Md. at 218, 913 A.2d at 50, Respondent did not present any evidence before the hearing judge that a less severe sanction should be imposed. Furthermore, Respondent did not fully cooperate with Bar Counsel\u2019s investigation and did not participate or appear in the disciplinary proceedings prior to the hearing before this Court. We do not overlook the matters that Respondent proffered during that hearing. A respondent, however, must establish by a preponderance of the evidence any fact offered in his defense, and Respondent\u2019s verbal statements to this Court, without more, do not satisfy this burden. <em>See Brown, </em>380 Md. at 669, 846 A.2d at 433 (overruling respondent\u2019s exceptions, which consisted of a mere denial of the alleged misappropriation and failure to establish properly his attorney trust account).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>In light of Respondent\u2019s numerous instances of misappropriation and other professional misconduct, we conclude that the only appropriate sanction in this case is disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">IT IS SO ORDERED.
