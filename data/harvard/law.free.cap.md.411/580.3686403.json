Prior to her deployment Petitioner entrusted the full time care and physical custody of the parties\u2019 minor child[, a daughter], born April 11, 2006, to her parents residing in Chesapeake, Virginia.\u201d Petitioner argues that the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County did not have jurisdiction to enter an order granting her ex-husband, Respondent, \u201ctemporary residential custody\u201d of their child.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>Petitioner and Respondent were divorced by a JUDGMENT OF ABSOLUTE DIVORCE entered on September 13, 2007. In that judgment, the Circuit Court ordered that (1) Petitioner \u201cbe granted sole legal custody of the minor child ... so as to obtain a passport for the minor child and for unrestricted travel by the child,\u201d (2) Petitioner and Respondent \u201cshall have joint legal custody for major issues[,]\u201d (3) \u201cthe child shall continue to live primarily with [Petitioner] who will have residential custody and [Respondent] will have visitation[,]\u201d and (4) \u201cthe Court shall retain jurisdiction over the parties and their minor child with respect to the issues [of] custody, visitation and support[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">On May 19, 2008, the Circuit Court entered TEMPORARY ORDER IN RESPONSE TO EMERGENCY FILING that granted \u201ctemporary residential custody\u201d of the child to Respondent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the conclusion of a May 28, 2008 hearing during which both parties were represented by counsel,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Circuit Court (1) granted Petitioner\u2019s request to rescind the May 19, 2008 order, but (2) denied Petitioner\u2019s request that her parents, who live in Chesapeake, Virginia, be granted temporary custody of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Petitioner noted an appeal from the Circuit Court\u2019s refusal to order that the child be returned to the custody of Petitioner\u2019s parents. While affirming the judgment of the Circuit Court in an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-7\">We conclude that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in leaving [the child] in [Respondent\u2019s] care, pending further proceedings. The court did not, as [Peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>tioner] alleges, modify custody of [the child]. Rather, after vacating the temporary custody order, and in the absence of a motion to modify the divorce decree, the court merely declined to issue another emergency custody order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-4\">As the court noted, after it vacated the temporary custody order, the custody order in the 2007 divorce degree was the effective order. Under that decree, [Respondent], who the court noted had \u201cnever been adjudged unfit,\u201d had joint legal custody of [the child] and physical custody rights in the nature of visitation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-5\">Thus, in response to [Petitioner\u2019s] request \u201cto restore the status quo ante\u201d and return the child to the grandparents, the lower court properly pointed out that the status quo \u201cwas an order which said [Petitioner] has legal custody, but [Respondent] has visitation every other weekend,\u201d and \u201cthe grandparents [have] no legal standing in this case.\u201d Given that [Respondent] had joint legal custody of his daughter, as well as temporary custody in the form of visitation rights, it was proper for the trial court to decline to order that the child be returned to the third party grandparents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-6\"><em>Whittaker v. Dixon, </em>No. 832, September Term, 2008, slip opinion pp. 10-11, filed January 9, 2009. (Footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">I.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-8\">With thousands of troops on active duty in Iraq and Afghanistan, military custody issues arise frequently. In an all too common scenario, a servicemember who learns she will soon be deployed entrusts her child to the care of a grandparent or stepparent, rather than the child\u2019s other legal parent. While the servicemember is away on active duty, the other parent seeks custody of the child. If the custody arrangement is altered, the servicemember often faces a complicated legal battle to regain custody upon her return, in spite of her previous role as primary caregiver.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-9\">Though the servicemember can request a stay of the proceeding under the Servicemember Civil Relief Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>(SCRA), a lack of familiarity with the law often creates confusion among both the lawyers and judges involved, resulting in a denial or misapplication of the stay. Even if it is granted, a judge must balance the parents\u2019 rights with those of the child and may decide that the child\u2019s best interests trump the federal mandate and issue a new custody order in spite of the federal law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Lauren S. Douglass, Avoiding Conflict at Home When There is Conflict Abroad: Military Child Custody and Visitation, <em>Family Law Quarterly, </em>Volume 43, Number 2, Summer 2009, p. 349. (Footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">In the case at bar, the record shows that the Circuit Court asked Petitioner\u2019s counsel the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-7\">[Is it] your position that [the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, 50 App. U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 501 <em>et </em>seq.] provides that a service member in defiance of a custody order can place the children with third parties and utterly defeat the custodial claims of a second parent who has not been adjudged unfit for the duration of deployment to some assignment out of state or out of the country?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">Because there are many military installations in this State and in close proximity to this State, I am certain that other Circuit Courts will also be asking this question, and I am persuaded that this Court should endeavor to provide the answer. I therefore dissent from the decision to dismiss, as improvidently granted, the <em>writ of certiorari </em>that was previously issued in this case. Chief Judge Bell and Judge Adkins have authorized me to state that they also dissent from the decision to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">\u201cThe <em>parens patriae </em>jurisdiction of circuit courts in this State is well established.\u201d <em>Wentzel v. Montgomery Gen. Hosp., </em>293 Md. 685, 702, 447 A.2d 1244, 1253 (1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1147, 103 S.Ct. 790, 74 L.Ed.2d 995 (1983). I would hold that, pursuant to their inherent <em>parens patriae </em>authority, our Circuit Courts have jurisdiction to afford what<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>ever relief is necessary to protect the best interests of a child whose custodial parent has been deployed. I would therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, but order that the case be remanded to the Circuit Court for entry of an order that conforms to the requirements of \u00a7 9-108 of the Family Law Article.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">In <em>Lenser v. McGowan, </em>358 Ark. 423, 191 S.W.3d 506 (2004), while denying a petition for writ of prohibition filed by a servicemember who asserted that the Circuit Court of Pulaski <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>County was without jurisdiction to enter a temporary custody order transferring custody of his child (from the servicemember petitioner\u2019s mother to his ex-wife, the child\u2019s mother), the Supreme Court of Arkansas stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-4\">Various acts have been passed by Congress over the years to protect servicemembers who suffer adverse effects in defending or prosecuting cases. However, that relief afforded against adverse effects may not be used to gain an advantage, or in other words, may not be used as a sword. <em>See, e.g., Louis, J. [v. Superior Court, </em>103 Cal.App.4th 711, 127 Cal.Rptr.2d 26 (Cal.App.4th 2002) ], <em>supra. </em>The idea is to relieve servicemembers from disadvantages arising from military service, not to provide advantages by reason of military service. [The child\u2019s father] seeks an advantage over [the child\u2019s mother] in arguing that the circuit court and [the child\u2019s mother] are precluded from even raising the issue of temporary custody because [the child] happened to be with [the father\u2019s] mother when the stay was entered. Had [the child] perchance been with [the child\u2019s mother] when the stay was entered, it is doubtful [the child\u2019s father] would be arguing as he does presently. To accept [the] argument [of the child\u2019s father] would create an environment in which a servicemember could always gain custody by simply making sure the child is staying with the service-member when the stay is requested. That would provide servicemembers an advantage rather than protect against adverse affects. The circuit court stayed the domestic relations case until [the] return [of the child\u2019s father], but that does not put [the child] in suspended animation. His life goes on, and the circuit court properly entertained the issue of who should receive temporary custody. Even if the stay had been in place when the temporary custody was considered, it would not have prevented the circuit court from issuing the order. The circuit court has jurisdiction to consider matters such as support, custody, and other similar matters that arise during the course of the stay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 511. Because I agree with that analysis, I would affirm the holding of the Court of Special Appeals that \u201cit was proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>for the trial court to decline to order that the child be returned to the third party grandparents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">Judge Adkins has authorized me to state that she would also affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b615-12\">. According to Petitioner, the case at bar presents three questions;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-13\">(1) Whether the Courts below erred in upholding the Circuit Court judgment [that] was issued without a jurisdictional basis and in violation of Petitioner\u2019s rights pursuant to the federal Servicemember\u2019s Civil Relief Act (SCRA), 50 App. U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 501 <em>et seq. </em>(2003)[?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-14\">(2) Whether the Courts below erred in finding that the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in declining to take further action to protect Petitioner's rights in restoring the status quo ante and not returning the minor child to Petitioner?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-15\">(3) Whether the Courts below erred in finding that Petitioner was served with notice of collateral pleadings in the Circuit Court proceeding?</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b616-8\">.
