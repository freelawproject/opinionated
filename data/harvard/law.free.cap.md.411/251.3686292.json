Background</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Lochearn Nursing Home, LLC, d/b/a FutureCare-Lochearn, Inc. (hereinafter \u201cFutureCare\u201d), Respondent, sued Beulah Addison, Petitioner, a resident of the nursing home, for $71,928.90<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in delinquent \u201cnursing home care and service\u201d payments, in a breach of contract action brought in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. Ms. Addison defended against the breach of contract claim by filing an Answer, asserting both negative and affirmative defenses, as well as a seven-count <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>counterclaim,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> alleging that she was unable to pay because one of FutureCare\u2019s employees, a social worker, embroiled her in a real estate \u201cforeclosure rescue scam\u201d that deprived her of the equity in her former home, which not only prevented her from paying the bill, but also from successfully applying for medical assistance, and that FutureCare mismanaged the filing of her Medicaid application.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> FutureCare responded to Ms. Addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>son\u2019s Counterclaim by filing an Answer generally denying liability. FutureCare also filed a \u201cMotion to Compel Arbitration of Counterclaims, Motion to Stay, and Request for Attorney\u2019s Fees,\u201d asserting that the Resident and Facility Arbitration Agreement, signed by Ms. Addison upon her entry to the nursing home, required her to submit her counterclaims to arbitration. After a hearing, the judge denied FutureCare\u2019s arbitration motion, after which FutureCare requested that the order denying the motions be certified as a final judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>under Rule 2-602(b). The judge denied the motion to certify the order as final.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">FutureCare, nevertheless, appealed immediately to the Court of Special Appeals, challenging the denial of its motion to compel arbitration and for a stay. Ms. Addison responded by filing a \u201cMotion to Dismiss the Interlocutory Appeal\u201d in that court, arguing that there was no final judgment on all claims within the meaning of Rule 2-602 and that, therefore, the appeal was premature. The Chief Judge of the Court of Special Appeals denied the motion, stating that Section 12-303(3)(ix)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> permits an interlocutory appeal of an order \u201cgranting a petition to stay arbitration pursuant to \u00a7 3-208[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] of this article,\u201d and that, \u201c[tjhere is little difference between the denial of a motion to arbitrate and a CJ \u00a7 12 \u2014 303(3)(ix) order staying arbitration: both stop arbitration. <em>See Essex Corp. v. Susan Katharine Tate Burrowbridge, LLC, et. al, </em>[178 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>App. 17, 940 A.2d 199 (2008) ].\u201d In the order, the Chief Judge also left open the opportunity for FutureCare, \u201cto request in its brief that a Panel of [the intermediate appellate court] enter a final judgment pursuant to Maryland Rule 8-602(e)(1) on the circuit court\u2019s arbitration ruling, as happened in <em>Essex Corp., supra.\u201d </em>After oral argument,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> a panel of the Court of Special Appeals, in an unpublished opinion, acceded to Future-Care\u2019s request as to the circuit court order denying Future-Care\u2019s motion to compel arbitration and certified it as final.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The Court of Special Appeals reversed the circuit court judge\u2019s denial of FutureCare\u2019s Motion to Compel Arbitration, holding that ambiguity existed regarding whether the counterclaim fell within the arbitration clause and remanded the case with instructions for the circuit court to enter an order compelling arbitration and staying litigation. In so ordering, the intermediate appellate court, nevertheless, remained cognizant of the public policy dimension of an arbitration agreement involving a nursing home patient:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-6\">In concluding that the ambiguity of key terms of the agreement require us to defer their interpretation to an arbitrator, we are not unmindful of the fact that the use of arbitration provisions in nursing home contracts is a matter of public concern. In addition, two bills are moving through Congress to make unenforceable all pre-dispute, mandatory binding arbitration clauses in contracts between long-term care facilities and their residents. Nevertheless, the present state of Maryland law on arbitration leaves us no other course.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">(Internal citations omitted). Ms. Addison thereafter petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari, which we granted, 406 Md. 743, 962 A.2d 370 (2008), to address the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Did the Court of Special Appeals err in compelling arbitration of claims arising from a predatory real estate scam and sabotaged Medicaid application?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">After argument before us, we requested the parties to submit supplemental briefs and to argue an additional issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-6\">Assuming that the denial of the motion to compel arbitration and to stay the judicial proceedings in the present case is not appealable as a final judgment, does Section 12-303(3)(ix) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article permit an appeal as an appealable interlocutory order?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">We shall not address the merits of this controversy as raised by the original certiorari question, but will vacate the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and direct that Future-Care\u2019s appeal be dismissed, because the Court of Special Appeals could not certify the circuit court order as final, after the circuit court judge had refused to do so, and the denial of the motion to compel arbitration does not constitute an appeal-able interlocutory order or collateral order from which FutureCare could appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">A. Final Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">Generally, under Section 12-301,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> a party may appeal only from a final judgment entered in a civil or criminal case by a circuit court. A \u201cfinal judgment\u201d is \u201ca judgment, decree, sentence, order, determination, decision, or other action by a court ... from which an appeal ... may be taken.\u201d Section 12-101(f). We have often stated that our jurisdiction is defined by statute, and that appeals must be taken from final judgments, except under certain limited exceptions, as Judge Irma S. Raker, writing for this Court in <em>Gruber v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number><em>Gruber, </em>369 Md. 540, 546, 801 A.2d 1013, 1016 (2002), succinctly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-12\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Except as provided in \u00a7 12-302 of this subtitle, a party may appeal from a final judgment entered in a civil or criminal case by a circuit court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>This Court has often stated that, except as constitutionally authorized, appellate jurisdiction \u201cis determined entirely by statute, and that, therefore, a right of appeal must be legislatively granted.\u201d <em>Kant v. Montgomery County, </em>365 Md. 269, 273, 778 A.2d 384, 386 (2001). Where appellate jurisdiction is lacking, the appellate court will dismiss the appeal on its own motion. <em>Highfield Water Co. v. Washington County Sanitary Disk, </em>295 Md. 410, 414, 456 A.2d 371, 373 (1983).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-5\">It is well settled that with exceptions not relevant here, an appeal may be taken to the Court of Special Appeals under Maryland Code (1957, 1998 Repl.Vol., 2001 Supp.) \u00a7 12-301 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article only from a \u201cfinal judgment entered in a civil or criminal case by a circuit court.\u201d <em>See Taha v. Southern Mgmt. Co., </em>367 Md. 564, 790 A.2d 11 (2002); <em>O\u2019Brien v. O\u2019Brien, </em>367 Md. 547, 790 A.2d 1 (2002). Except for the limited category of exceptions codified in \u00a7 12-303 or under the collateral order doctrine, an appeal will not lie from an interlocutory order entered in a civil case. <em>Philip Morris, Inc. v. Angeletti, </em>358 Md. 689, 713, 752 A.2d 200, 213 (2000). We have often stated that the underlying policy of the final judgment rule is to avoid piecemeal appeals. <em>See Brewster v. Woodhaven Bldg. &amp; Dev., </em>360 Md. 602, 616, 759 A.2d 738, 745 (2000). Whether a matter is appealable is a jurisdictional matter and may be raised by an appellate court even if not noted by the parties. <em>See, e.g., In re Franklin P., </em>366 Md. 306, 326, 783 A.2d 673, 685 (2001).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-6\">A ruling of the circuit court, to constitute a final judgment, must, among other things, be an \u201cunqualified, final disposition of the matter in controversy.\u201d <em>Rohrbeck v. Rohrbeck, </em>318 Md. 28, 41, 566 A.2d 767, 773 (1989). An order merely assuming jurisdiction in a matter does not constitute such a decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>The certification as final of the denial of the motion to compel arbitration in the instant case, entered by a panel of the Court of Special Appeals under Rule 8-602(e),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> however, directly contravened the <em>denial </em>by the circuit court judge to certify the same order as final earlier in the litigation, and as such, must be vacated in light of our holdings in <em>Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp. v. Gress, </em>378 Md. 667, 838 A.2d 362 (2003), and <em>Silbersack v. ACandS, Inc., </em>402 Md. 673, 938 A.2d 855 (2008). <em>Gress </em>was a wrongful death action against asbestos and cigarette manufacturers, among others, in which it was alleged that the decedent\u2019s lung cancer was caused by a \u201csynergy\u201d or multiplied risk created by tobacco product-use and workplace exposure to asbestos. The tobacco defendants moved to dismiss or to sever the action from the asbestos claims, which the circuit court judge granted. The decedent\u2019s representatives requested that the judge certify the dismissal order as a final judgment, which the judge refused to do. The decedent\u2019s representatives, nevertheless, immediately appeal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>ed to the Court of Special Appeals, and the intermediate appellate court, based upon Rule 8-602(e)(1)(C), did what the circuit court judge had refused to do and entered a final judgment on the denial of the motion to dismiss, before reversing the judgment. <em>Gress v. ACandS, </em>150 Md.App. 369, 820 A.2d 616 (2003). We granted the tobacco defendants\u2019 petition for certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">In <em>Gress, </em>then, we faced the same issue that we must address in the present case \u2014 namely, \u201cwhether the Court of Special Appeals has the authority to enter final judgment pursuant to Maryland Rule 8-602(e)(1)(C) when the trial court, that could have entered final judgment pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-602(b), has expressly refused to do so....\u201d <em>Gress, </em>378 Md. at 675-76, 838 A.2d at 367. We held that the Court of Special Appeals lacked such authority, based upon our interpretation of Rule 8-602(e)(l)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">The basis for the <em>Gress </em>holding was in Rule 8-602(e), which only permits appellate certification as final when the judge overlooked the opportunity to certify, not when the judge acted and refused to certify. <em>Id. </em>at 677-78, 838 A.2d at 368. As we stated in <em>Gress:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-9\">We hold that where a trial court has been invited to direct entry of a final judgment in a case in which that trial court has discretion to do so and that trial court expressly declines to do so, and the merits of that ruling is not appealed, Rule 8-602(e)(l)(C) does not authorize an appellate court nevertheless to enter final judgment on its own initiative.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AhX\"><em>Id. </em>at 682, 838 A.2d at 371 (footnote omitted). In reaching this holding, we interpreted the use of the past tense in subsection (e)(1), regarding when a final judgment can be entered by an appellate court, as limiting appellate entry of a final judgment to those \u201csituation[s] in which the trial court has not entered final judgment and, indeed, in which the trial court has not considered the issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 677-78, 838 A.2d at 368. We explained that it would be inconsistent and illogical, moreover, to include subsection (e)(2), prescribing the procedure for remanding to the trial court, if an appellate court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>unilaterally could enter a final judgment after the trial judge had considered the issue under subsection (e)(1):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-5\">If still further confirmation is necessary, subsection (e)(2) supplies it. That subsection further addresses the situation in which the case is remanded for the trial court to determine whether to direct the entry of final judgment. It instructs that when \u201cthe lower court decides not to direct the entry of a final judgment pursuant to Rule 2-602(b), the lower court shall promptly notify the appellate court of its decision and the appellate court shall dismiss the appeal.\u201d If dismissal is required where the case has been remanded for a determination of whether a final judgment should be directed to be entered, it follows that the same requirement must apply when, as in this case, the trial court has been invited to consider the same issue after a premature appeal has been noted, and the trial court has not only considered the desirability of certification, but rejected it. A different construction renders the Rule internally inconsistent and, in truth, illogical.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 678, 838 A.2d at 368. We also reviewed the history of Rule 8-602(e), explaining that subsection (e) \u201cwas intended to deal with the vexing problem of premature appeals,\u201d and more specifically, was intended to permit the appellate court to enter final judgment when no determination was made by the circuit court, so that an appellate court could enter a final judgment and rule on the merits without first having to remand the case to circuit court with instructions to enter a final judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-7\">Section (e) deals with the Rule 2-602 problem. Essentially, it permits the appellate court, instead of simply dismissing the appeal as it does now, to return the case to the Circuit Court in compliance with Rule 2-602. If the Circuit Court makes the required determination, the appeal can proceed; otherwise it will be dismissed. The Rule also permits the appellate court to enter a final judgment on its own initiative and to proceed with the appeal without returning the case to the Circuit Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 679-80, 838 A.2d at 369-70 (footnote omitted), quoting Reporter\u2019s Note to Rule 8-602(e). As a result, we were clear in <em>Gress </em>that only when a trial judge had not acted to refuse certification would an appellate court be able to certify finality.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">We reinforced our holding in <em>Gress </em>recently in <em>Silbersack, </em>402 Md. 673, 938 A.2d 855, and answered the question of whether, even when the merits of a circuit court judge\u2019s refusal to certify is appealed, an appellate court can reverse and direct certification \u2014 a question that had been lurking since <em>Gress. Silbersack </em>presented a nearly identical factual situation as <em>Gress, </em>in which the spouse of a man who died of lung cancer attempted to join tobacco and asbestos defendants in the same suit. After the asbestos defendants had been removed from the case, either by bankruptcy stay or settlement, Silbersack moved to \u201creinstate\u201d the tobacco defendants, and the trial judge denied her motion, after which she asked the judge to certify his denial as a final judgment, which the judge also refused to do. Silbersack appealed from the order denying the motion to \u201creinstate,\u201d and we granted certiorari prior to any proceedings in the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Before this Court, Silbersack argued that we should remand the case to the circuit court and mandate that the judge enter a final judgment under Rules 2-601<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and 2-602(b),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> so that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>she could then appeal from the order. We refused to do so. In reaching our conclusion, we discussed \u201cbedrock\u201d principles of appellate jurisdiction and most notably, that ordinarily, appellate jurisdiction is dependent upon \u201cthe entry of a final judgment that disposes of all claims against all parties\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AiX\">To set the context, there is a long-standing bedrock rule of appellate jurisdiction, practice, and procedure that, unless otherwise provided by law, the right to seek appellate review in this Court or the Court of Special Appeals ordinarily must await the entry of a final judgment that disposes of all claims against all parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 678, 938 A.2d at 858 (citations omitted). We placed the general rule within the context of Rule 2-602, explaining that Rule 2-602(a) embodies the general rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">Rule 2-602(a), subject to an exception provided for in section (b) of that Rule, makes clear that an order or decision \u201cthat adjudicates fewer than all of the claims in an action ... or that adjudicates the rights and liabilities of fewer than all of the parties to the action: (1) is not a final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>judgment; (2) does not terminate the action as to any of the claims or any of the parties; and (3) is subject to revision at any time before the entry of a judgment that adjudicates all of the claims by and against all of the parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 678, 938 A.2d at 858. We noted the limited exception provided in Rule 2-602(b), which permits a trial judge to certify as a final judgment an order not qualifying as final under 2-602(a), if \u201cthere is no just reason for delay,\u201d but we explicitly recognized that this act is to be reserved only for the \u201cvery infrequent harsh case\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-6\">Rule 2-602(b) provides a limited exception. It allows the Circuit Court to order the entry of a judgment as to fewer than all of the claims or parties if the court expressly determines in a written order that \u201cthere is no just reason for delay.\u201d <em>For more than three decades, however, we have made clear that the discretion to enter judgment under Rule 2-602(b), or its predecessor Rule 605a, was to be reserved for the \u201cvery infrequent harsh case.\u201d Diener Enterprises v. Miller, </em>266 Md. 551, 556, 295 A.2d 470, 473 (1972). We pointed out in <em>Smith v. Lead, supra, </em>386 Md. 12, 25, 871 A.2d 545, 553 that the purpose of Rule 2-602(a) is to prevent piecemeal appeals \u201cwhich, beyond being inefficient and costly, can create significant delays, hardship, and procedural problems.\u201d <em>We noted, among other things, that piecemeal appeals may cause the appellate court to be faced with having the same issues presented multiple times and may burden the parties with having to assemble records, file briefs and record extracts, and prepare and appear for oral argument on multiple occasions. That is \u201cprecisely why,\u201d we said, \u201cRule 2-602(b) is reserved for the \u2018infrequent harsh case, \u2019 and why the trial judge, who normally has a much better grasp of the situation than an appellate court, is viewed, at least in the first instance, as the </em>\u2018dispatcher.\u2019 <em>\u201d Id. </em>at 26, 871 A.2d at 553.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 679, 938 A.2d at 858 (footnotes omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>After addressing the limits of the circuit court judge\u2019s ability to certify as final, we reaffirmed the <em>Gress </em>holding regarding the inability of an appellate court to enter a final judgment in direct contravention of the judge\u2019s ruling. We recognized that requiring the circuit court judge to enter a final judgment under Rule 2-602(b), after the trial judge had explicitly declined to do so, would have the same effect as our own certification of a final judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-5\">Our reasoning [in <em>Gress </em>] was clear and precise \u2014 that the appellate court\u2019s authority under Rule 8-602(e)(l)(C) to enter judgment on its own initiative may be exercised only when the circuit court has never exercised its own discretion in the matter and not when the trial court was asked to enter judgment under Rule 2-602(b) and expressly declined to do so:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-6\">We hold that where a trial court has been invited to direct entry of a final judgment in a case in which that trial court has discretion to do so and that trial court expressly declines to do so, and the merits of that ruling is not appealed, Rule 8-602(e)(l)(C) does not authorize an appellate court nevertheless to enter final judgment on its own initiative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 682, 838 A.2d at 371.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 681, 938 A.2d at 859. We emphasized various policy considerations that underpinned the notion that the trial judge is a \u201cdispatcher\u201d and the wide discretion accorded the judge to deny certification. <em>Id. </em>at 683-84, 938 A.2d at 861. We concluded that a request for mandamus review, itself separately granted,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> may be more appropriate than one for certification as final on an appellate level:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-9\"><em>[A]ny decision by the appellate court that the denial of a request to enter a Rule 2-602(b) judgment suffices under its </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number><em>criteria to constitute a final judgment will almost necessarily require a finding that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the request. </em>What would be presented, therefore, is the somewhat anomalous situation whereby the preliminary decision to review the ruling will amount to a determination that the ruling constituted an abuse of discretion. As a practical matter, the right to appeal translates into a right to win the appeal. If the Court is to travel that road, of effectively co-mingling the right to appeal with the merits of the appeal, it must be extremely cautious in doing so. <em>That kind of situation seems more appropriate to be presented in a petition for extraordinary relief through mandamus, which is also very rarely granted (see Forster v. Hargadon, </em>398 Md. 298, 920 A.2d 1049 (2007)), rather than an appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 685, 938 A.2d at 861-62 (emphasis added). In <em>Silbersack, </em>then, as well as <em>Gress, </em>we were clear that appellate authority to enter final judgment is limited to circumstances where the circuit court judge had overlooked certification, and even then, only in the \u201cvery infrequent harsh case[s].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 679, 681, 938 A.2d at 858-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Without distinguishing <em>Gress </em>or <em>Silbersack, </em>the Court of Special Appeals in the present case entered a final judgment under Rule 8-602(e)(1), relying on <em>Town of Chesapeake Beach v. Pessoa Construction Company, Inc., </em>330 Md. 744, 625 A.2d 1014 (1993). <em>Town of Chesapeake </em>involved a dispute between the Town of Chesapeake and a contractor, wherein the Town terminated the contract, and the contractor filed a demand for arbitration. The Town filed a petition to stay arbitration pursuant to Section 3-208, but the judge denied the petition and entered an order compelling arbitration. The Town immediately appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, which ultimately dismissed the appeal. We reversed and held that an order denying a petition to stay arbitration and thereby compelling arbitration was immediately appealable under both the final judgment rule and the collateral order doctrine, because the petition to stay arbitration involved a separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>demand and operated to put parties \u201cout of court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 750-54, 625 A.2d at 1017-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">In ruling that the order was appealable as a final judgment, we discussed <em>Horsey v.

FutureCare further argues that the legislative history of the Section confirms its interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Ms. Addison argues that an order denying a motion to compel arbitration is not an appealable interlocutory order because Section 12-303 explicitly identifies an order granting a petition to stay arbitration as an appealable interlocutory order, but excludes orders denying motions to compel arbitration. Ms. Addison explains that, \u201c[n]o ordinary or commonly understood meaning of \u2018petition to stay arbitration\u2019 includes a \u2018petition to stay <em>litigation </em>\u2019 or to <em>\u2018compel </em>arbitration.\u2019 \u201d (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Section 12-303(3) includes eleven specific interlocutory orders from which an appeal may be taken, none of which identifies a \u201cmotion to compel arbitration,\u201d while the grant of a stay of arbitration is explicitly identified in Section 12-303(3)(ix).

She urges that each State is free to choose its appellate procedures regarding arbitration, so long as those procedural rules do not undermine the objectives of arbitration, as we noted in <em>Wells v. Chevy Chase Bank, </em>363 Md. 232, 246, 768 A.2d 620, 627 (2001).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>The fact that the panel of the Court of Special Appeals opined that, \u201c[tjhere is little difference between the denial of a motion to arbitrate and a CJ \u00a7 12-303(3)(ix) order staying arbitration: both stop arbitration\u201d does not dispose of the matter, because the grant of a motion to stay arbitration and the denial of a motion to compel arbitration must be identical in order to support FutureCare\u2019s approach, which they are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The grant of a stay of arbitration can be analogized to an order granting an injunction, which is appealable under Section 12 \u2014 303(3) (i), because it defines the forum. A court\u2019s refusal to stay its own proceedings, intertwined with the denial of a motion to compel, on the other hand, is not equivalent to the denial of an injunction, because a forum is maintained. <em>See e.g., Highfield Water Co. v. Washington County Sanitary Dist., </em>295 Md. 410, 416, 456 A.2d 371, 374 (1983) (\u201c[A] trial court\u2019s refusal to stay its own proceedings until the conclusion of another court ease pending between the same parties ordinarily does not constitute the denial of an injunction.\u201d).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Rather, the denial of a motion to compel is often recognized as interlocutory and nonappealable, because it maintains the status quo and is reviewable at the conclusion of the case, after final judgment. <em>See, e.g., Sigma Reproductive Health Ctr. v. State, </em>297 Md. 660, 667, 467 A.2d 483, 486 (1983) (listing numerous interlocutory and nonappealable orders). <em>See also County Comm\u2019rs for St. Mary\u2019s County v. Lacer, </em>393 Md. 415, 428, 903 A.2d 378, 386 (2006) (\u201cThis Court has consistently held that discovery orders, being interlocu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>tory in nature, are not ordinarily appealable prior to a final judgment terminating the case in the trial court.\u201d) (internal quotations and citations omitted); <em>Brooks v.

The <em>denial </em>of a motion <em>to </em>compel arbitration pursuant to Section 3-207, however, keeps the parties in court, which may not preclude future arbitration. We note, in this regard, that the Legislature recognized the distinction by including the grant of a stay of arbitration in Section 12-303, but removing the denial of a motion to compel arbitration. The Revisor\u2019s Notes to Sections 3-207 and 3-208 explain that the changes pursuant to the recodification \u201cemphasize the difference between the court\u2019s order with respect to an arbitration agreement and a stay of arbitration,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he reorganization of provisions has been made to emphasize diversity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">C. Collateral Order Doctrine</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">The common law collateral order doctrine \u2014 a \u201cjudicially created fiction, under which certain interlocutory orders are considered to be final judgments, even though such orders clearly are <em>not </em>final judgments,\u201d <em>Dawkins v. Baltimore City Police Dept., </em>376 Md. 53, 64, 827 A.2d 115, 121 (2003) (emphasis in original) is also unavailing in this case. It is \u201ca very narrow exception to the general rule that appellate review ordinarily must await the entry of a final judgment disposing of all claims against all parties,\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 58, 827 A.2d at 118, quoting <em>Pittsburgh Corning v. James, </em>353 Md. 657, 660-661, 728 A.2d 210, 211-12 (1999), and generally permits an appeal from an order in a \u201csmall class\u201d of cases in which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>interlocutory order sought to be reviewed satisfies four requirements: (1) it must conclusively determine the disputed question; (2) it must resolve an important issue; (3) it must be completely separate from the merits of the action; and (4) it must be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment. <em>See Dawkins, </em>376 Md. at 58, 827 A.2d at 118; <em>Town of Chesapeake, </em>330 Md. at 755, 625 A.2d at 1020. Judge John C. Eldridge, in <em>Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission v. Bowen, </em>410 Md. 287, 296-97, 978 A.2d 678, 684 (2009), recently explained its extraordinary aspect:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-5\">Time after time, this Court\u2019s opinions have emphasized that the collateral order doctrine is extremely narrow and that it is applicable only under extraordinary circumstances. <em>See, e.g., Hudson v. Housing Authority, supra, </em>402 Md. at 25, 935 A.2d at 399 (The doctrine encompasses \u201ca \u2018narrow\u2019 class of interlocutory orders in \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 \u201d); <em>St. Joseph\u2019s v.

Nnoli, supra, </em>389 Md. at 329, 884 A.2d at 1223 (\u201cThe collateral order doctrine is a very narrow exception to the final judgment rule, and each of its four requirements is very strictly applied in Maryland. * * * [It is inapplicable if the] case does not present an extraordinary situation\u201d); <em>In re Foley, </em>373 Md. 627, 634, 820 A.2d 587, 591, <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 948, 124 S.Ct. 398, 157 L.Ed.2d 279 (2003)(\u201c[T]he doctrine may be entertained only in extraordinary circumstances\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">(Alterations in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">FutureCare, nevertheless, argues that the first three requirements of the collateral order doctrine are \u201csatisfied,\u201d in the present case, and then contends that if its interlocutory appeal is not allowed, its \u201ccontractual right to the informal, expeditious and inexpensive forum\u201d of arbitration would be \u201cirretrievably lost\u201d and unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment. Ms. Addison disputes the applicability vel non of the doctrine, but also hones in on the issue of whether the denial of the motion to compel arbitration would be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Assuming litigation proceeds on the underlying matters of this case and a final judgment is entered on behalf of Ms. Addison, FutureCare\u2019s assertion of error regarding the denial of the motion to compel would be reviewable on appeal. <em>See Bowen, </em>410 Md. at 297, 978 A.2d at 684-85 (stating that \u201cclaimed immunity from an adverse judgment would clearly be reviewable on appeal from a final judgment\u201d); <em>See also Bloch v.

FutureCare argues, however, that even success after an appeal from a final judgment would have subjected them to already unnecessary litigation with the added expense and inconvenience of a jury trial, in contravention of congressional intent, citing <em>Preston v. Ferrer, </em>552 U.S. 346, -, 128 S.Ct. 978, 986, 169 L.Ed.2d 917, 928 (2008) (arbitration after a trial \u201cwould likely be long delayed, in contravention of Congress\u2019 intent \u2018to move the parties to an arbitrable dispute out of court and into arbitration as quickly and easily as possible.\u2019 \u201d), quoting <em>Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr.

Keating, </em>465 U.S. 1, 104 S.Ct. 852, 79 L.Ed.2d 1 (1984). Ms. Addison argues, conversely, that FutureCare is claiming no more than an \u201cavoidance of trial\u201d theory rejected by this Court, and the appealability of the circuit court\u2019s order \u201cmust be determined by Maryland law, not federal law,\u201d and contends that <em>Wells, </em>363 Md. at 242, 768 A.2d at 625, in which we held that Maryland procedural law regarding appealability is not preempted by national policy supporting arbitration, supports its argument that we do not have to denigrate appellate procedure to facilitate arbitration. She propounds that arbitration agreements are on the \u201csame footing\u201d as other contracts, not on a <em>better </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>footing, asserting that our dicta in <em>Koons Ford of Baltimore, Inc. v. Lobach, </em>398 Md. 38, 50, 919 A.2d 722, 729 (2007) supports her argument. We agree with Ms. Addison that our procedural rules are not preempted by national policy favoring arbitration, as we have repeatedly stated. <em>Wells, </em>363 Md. at 242, 768 A.2d at 625.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">FutureCare, nevertheless, would have us find that this case falls \u201cin that small class which finally determine claims of right separable from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the action, too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated,\u201d <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 546, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 1225-26, 93 L.Ed. 1528, 1536 (1949), but FutureCare ignores one major distinguishable characteristic of this case: FutureCare, while arguing for arbitration of Ms. Addison\u2019s counterclaim, is the same party that chose the circuit court in which to litigate its initial claim against Ms. Addison. It seems somewhat disingenuous to argue that the denial of the motion to compel arbitration will somehow force protracted litigation and extra expense for FutureCare when it is seeking to bifurcate the current dispute into two forums, which would vastly increase time and expense for the system and the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Because the denial of a motion to compel arbitration could not be certified as a final judgment by the Court of Special Appeals after the circuit court judge denied the certification and cannot be considered as an appealable interlocutory or collateral order, we must vacate the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and remand with instructions to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS VACATED AND CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO DISMISS THE APPEAL.

FutureCare derived the $71,928.90 figure by multiplying the private-pay base rate of $171.00 per day times the number of days that Ms. Addison resided at the facility. Private-pay base rate is distinguished from the medical assistance rate. The latter, which is usually a lower rate, is generally paid to the nursing home directly by the State and Federal Government, using a pre-determined calculus: Maryland pays for nursing-care services under a \"case-mix\u201d system, meaning that \u201crather than paying all facilities one set rate, Medical Assistance calculates separate sets of rates for each facility.

Medical Assistance, or Medicaid, was described by Judge John C. Eldridge, writing for this Court in <em>Jackson v. Millstone, </em>369 Md. 575, 580-82, 801 A.2d 1034, 1036-38 (2002) (footnotes omitted) (alterations in original):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">Congress enacted the Medicaid Act in 1965 as Title XIX of the Social Security Act. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396 <em>et seq.; </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7 \u00a7 430-456. The Act was designed to enable states, as far as practicable, to furnish medical assistance to individuals whose income and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services. To that end, the Act established a medical assistance program, which is a jointly funded collaboration between the states and the federal government. It is a voluntary program, in which a state may elect, but is not compelled, to participate. When a state elects to participate in the medicaid program, it prepares and submits for approval by the federal Health Care Financing Administration, the federal agency that administers the Federal Medical Assistance Program, a state medicaid plan for the provision of medical assistance that complies with the federal Medicaid Act and with the regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 \u00a7 430-456. If the federal agency approves the state plan, then the state qualifies for federal funding, whereby the federal government will reimburse the state up to 50% of the cost of the medicaid program. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396b(a); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396d(b). The federal Office of Inspector General periodically audits state operations to determine whether the operations are '\u2018cost-efficient\u201d and whether \"[fjunds are being properly expended.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 430.33(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-8\">While the federal government establishes broad policy, secures state compliance with the statute, and dispenses federal funds to supplement state spending on medicaid, there exists some latitude for each state to determine which of its citizens qualify for this form of medical insurance and which services its program will provide. The state agency charged with dispensing the state medicaid program is responsible for interpreting, administering, and complying with federal medicaid statutes and regulations. Within broad federal rules, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>each state decides eligibility groups, types and range of services, payment levels for services, and administrative and operating procedures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-6\">Maryland has chosen to participate in the medicaid program. It does so through the Maryland Medical Assistance Program, operated by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1982, 2000 Repl.Vol., 2001 Supp.) \u00a7 15-103 of the Health General Article. The program\u2019s director, or a designee, is responsible for the approval or denial of applications for preauthorization for payment. Preauthorization, or approval from the Department, is required before one can receive medical assistance benefits. <em>See </em>COMAR 10.09.06.01B(30).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-7\">Although the federal Medicaid Act only mandates that states provide medical assistance for those classified as \"categorically needy,\" Maryland\u2019s state plan is designed to provide comprehensive health care services for \"categorically needy\u201d and \"medically needy\u201d persons. <em>See </em>\u00a7 \u00a7 15-201.1, 15-103 of the Health-General Article; COMAR 10.09.06.01B(21). <em>See also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(10)(A), (C) (listing those who qualify as \"categorically\u201d and \u201cmedically\u201d needy, respectively). Under the Maryland Medicaid Plan, \"categorically needy\" includes \"aged, blind, or disabled persons, or families and children, who are otherwise eligible for Medical Assistance and who meet the financial eligibility requirements for FIP, SSI, or Optional State Supplement.\u201d COMAR 10.09.24.02B(11). Essentially, \"categorically needy\u201d persons are those whose income levels are so low that they qualify to receive cash assistance from an approved state program, and they cannot afford to pay for basic needs or medical assistance. The \"medically needy,\u201d on the other hand, are \"persons who are otherwise eligible for Medical Assistance, who are not categorically needy, and whose income and resources are within the limits set under the [s]tate [p]lan.\u201d COMAR 10.09.24.02B(38). <em>See Jaffe v.
