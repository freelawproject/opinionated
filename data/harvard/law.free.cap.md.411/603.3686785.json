The case comes to us from the grant of summary judgment in favor of the HABC, the respondent, in a lead paint action brought by the petitioner, Devonte A. Brooks (\u201cBrooks\u201d). The HABC argued that, under Maryland\u2019s \u201cHousing Authorities\u201d law, Md.Code (1957, 2003 Repl.Vol.), Art. 44A,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as construed by <em>Jackson v. Housing Opportunities Comm\u2019n of Montgomery County, </em>289 Md. 118, 422 A.2d 376 (1980), it enjoys governmental immunity from suit because it exhausted the limits of its liability insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">The Circuit Court for Baltimore City agreed that, under <em>Jackson, </em>the HABC\u2019s governmental immunity was waived only up to the limits of its insurance coverage. The court concluded, moreover, that it was undisputed that the HABC had insurance coverage at the time the cause of action arose but, by the time Brooks filed suit, the coverage was exhausted. The court therefore ruled that the HABC was entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">Brooks noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed the judgment in an unreported opinion. For the reasons we shall explain, we reverse. We hold that Article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>44A, when read in its entirety, effects a complete waiver of governmental immunity from suit. By so holding we necessarily repudiate our language in <em>Jackson </em>stating the contrary. 289 Md. at 130, 422 A.2d at 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Brooks was born on November 4, 1993. Since then, he has lived with his mother in Baltimore City public housing, operated by the HABC. Brooks developed elevated blood lead levels, which he alleges resulted from his exposure to lead-based paint in the housing where he resided. Brooks, through his mother, Kimberly Wright, filed suit against the HABC on March 15, 2004. Brooks alleged negligence and violations of the Maryland Consumer Protection Act (\u201cCPA\u201d), Md.Code (1975, 2000 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 13-301-13-501 of the Commercial Law Article (\u201cCL\u201d), and sought damages resulting from his injuries.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">The HABC filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that its immunity from suit was waived only to the limits of its commercial insurance policy, which was exhausted by the time of Brooks\u2019s suit. The commercial insurance policy (hereafter the \u201cPolicy\u201d) to which the HABC referred was purchased by the HABC in 1993 from the Housing Authority Risk Retention Group (\u201cHARRG\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">The Policy was for three years, running from June 1, 1993 through June 1,1996. Subsection H of the Policy contained a \u201cLead Based Paint Liability\u201d rider, insuring the HABC liability coverage against \u201c \u2018bodily injury\u2019 arising from the ingestion of or exposure to lead-based paint\u201d occurring after June 1, 1988. The Policy had an annual coverage limit of $500,000 per occurrence and in the aggregate, on a \u201cclaims-made basis,\u201d and included a $25,000 per-claim deductible. The Policy was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>subject to reduction for payment of claims, judgments, settlements, legal defense, and related costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">The \u201cSpecial Conditions\u201d subsection of the lead-based paint liability rider provided that, if the lead-based paint coverage were cancelled, the HABC was entitled to obtain either a 3-month or a 15-month extension of coverage (commonly known as a \u201creporting tail\u201d). The 3-month reporting tail would ensue automatically upon the cancellation date, without an additional premium paid. The 15-month reporting tail was available upon written request within 30 days of cancellation and payment of an additional premium to be determined by HARRG. Under the terms of the rider, any lead-based paint claims arising during the period of the reporting tail would be covered under the terms and conditions of the last annual coverage period during which coverage was in place. The Policy also provided that, if during an annual coverage period and any reporting tail the HABC were to supply HARRG written notice that the HABC \u201c[became] aware of any circumstances which may subsequently give rise to a claim being made against [the HABC] ... for damages arising out of the ingestion of or exposure to lead-based paint,\u201d then a claim relating to those circumstances and later brought against the HABC would be considered to have been made during the coverage period when the written notice was received.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">On April 18, 1996, HARRG cancelled the lead-paint coverage rider in the Policy, effective immediately. After properly notifying HARRG of its intention to do so, the HABC purchased the 15-month reporting tail through July 18, 1997, and paid the additional premium of $74,880.27. The HABC thereby continued, through July 18, 1997, the $500,000 aggregate coverage limit provided during the 1995-96 annual coverage period.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Raymond A. L\u2019Altrelli is the Insurance/Risk Manager for the HABC. In May 1997, Mr. L\u2019Altrelli provided HARRG a list of names and other pertinent information concerning 73 children who had elevated blood lead levels (EBLs). Brooks, whose elevated blood lead level had been submitted to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>HABC by city health authorities in April 2006, was among the children listed in the HABC\u2019s submission to HARRG. The following month, the HABC sent a second list to HARRG. That list, too, contained Brooks\u2019s name. Mr. L\u2019Altrelli stated in the letter that accompanied the first list that the \u201creferenced EBL\u2019s are to be noted as <em>occurrences </em>only (since claims may never be filed).\u201d (Emphasis in original.) He added that the HABC understood that, by supplying HARRG with written notice, HARRG would \u201cafford coverage and defense under the current Policy provisions\u201d should claims subsequently be filed by any of the children on the list. The HABC did not purchase lead-based paint liability coverage beyond the date of expiration of the reporting tail, July 18, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">\n<em>The Lawsuit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">We have said that Brooks, through his mother, filed suit against the HABC in March 2004. The HABC timely answered and thereafter moved for summary judgment. The HABC argued that Brooks\u2019s claim was reported to HARRG under the 1995-96 Policy year, pursuant to the 15-month reporting tail, and, as of September 19, 2003, the $500,000.00 coverage for lead-based claims was exhausted. The HABC maintained that Article 44A waives its governmental immunity only up to the available limits of its insurance policy. The HABC relied on the holding of <em>Jackson, </em>which states that the \u201ccombination of\u2019 the relevant statutory provisions \u201ceffects, by necessary and compelling implication, a limited waiver of the defense of sovereign immunity to the extent of permitting recovery only out of any sum payable on behalf of the HOC (Housing Opportunities Commission) by its insurer under applicable liability coverage.\u201d 289 Md. at 130, 422 A.2d at 382. In support of summary judgment, the HABC submitted, <em>inter alia, </em>an affidavit by HARRG\u2019s Regional Claims Manager attesting that Brooks\u2019s potential claim was reported in the 1995-96 Policy year and, as of September 19, 2003, the $500,000 limit of coverage was exhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>Brooks opposed the summary judgment motion on the ground that the HABC was not entitled to invoke governmental immunity in this case. Brooks argued that the language in <em>Jackson </em>to the effect that the statute creates only a partial waiver of immunity is <em>dicta </em>because it was not necessary to the decision in that case. Brooks further argued that the court should treat the facts of his case more like the cases at issue in <em>Gibson v. Housing Auth. of Baltimore City, </em>142 Md.App. 121, 131, 788 A.2d 234, 240, <em>cert. denied, </em>369 Md. 182, 798 A.2d 554; <em>vacated sub nom Housing Auth. of Baltimore City v. Smalls, </em>369 Md. 224, 798 A.2d 579 (2002).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Gibson </em>presented the question whether the HABC could assert governmental immunity for lead-based paint claims that arose when the HABC was not covered by a liability insurance policy. The intermediate appellate court answered \u201cno\u201d to that question, analyzing the issue as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-5\">HABC argues that its failure to carry statutorily required liability insurance for \u201call risks and hazards\u201d will prevent the agency from being able to satisfy a judgment rendered in favor of the children and thus the HABC is immune from suit. If such a practice would be allowed, governmental agencies would be able to manufacture their own immunity simply by allowing their insurance to lapse. In instances where the legislature has mandated that the governmental agency carry insurance to allow for payment of successful suits brought against the agency, the autogenous of immuni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>ty would fly in the face [of] the legislative intent without submitting to it and create inequitable results. We will not allow such inequities to occur.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-4\">Therefore, in instances where the legislature has created a waiver from immunity for a governmental entity and required that insurance be obtained for liabilities resulting from its governmental conduct, that entity cannot fabricate its own immunity [] by failing to insure against those liabilities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-5\"><em>Gibson, </em>142 Md.App. at 131, 788 A.2d at 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Brooks argued, by extension of the logic underpinning <em>Gibson, </em>that the HABC attempted to manufacture its immunity by under-insuring itself and therefore was not entitled in his case to the defense of government immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">The Circuit Court interpreted <em>Jackson </em>and <em>Gibson </em>to hold that, \u201cif [the HABC] did not fail to insure, it is not required to take additional action to provide for payment of a claim.\u201d The court therefore saw the issue on summary judgment to be \u201cwhether there is any dispute of material fact about\u201d whether the HABC \u201cfailed to take appropriate measures to obtain insurance coverage given the facts reasonably available to it.\u201d The court reviewed the parties\u2019 exhibits offered in support of and in opposition to the motion, and concluded that \u201cthere is no basis for a dispute that [the] HABC failed to provide sufficient insurance, thereby forfeiting its immunity.\u201d Accordingly, the court granted summary judgment in favor of the HABC.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">Brooks appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. While the appeal was pending in that court, Brooks filed a petition for writ of certiorari. We denied the petition. <em>Brooks v. Housing Auth. of Baltimore City, </em>396 Md. 12, 912 A.2d 648 (2006). The appeal proceeded in the Court of Special Appeals, and in due course a divided panel of that court affirmed the judgment. <em>Brooks v. Housing Auth. of Baltimore City, </em>No. 06-1815, slip op. at 20 (Md.Ct.Spec.App. Dec. 18, 2006). The panel majority concluded, as had the Circuit Court, that the HABC\u2019s immunity from suit was waived only up to the limits of its insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>coverage, and such limits were exhausted by the time Brooks filed suit. <em>Id. </em>at 16. The panel majority further concluded that the record does not support \u201ca reasonable inference that the HABC knowingly was taking steps to under-insure itself in an effort to avoid liability for claims that might exceed Policy limits,\u201d as Brooks had argued. <em>Id. </em>There being no dispute of material fact on that issue, the panel majority held that the HABC was immunized from suit and, consequently, was entitled to summary judgment on Brooks\u2019s negligence claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 20. The panel also addressed Brooks\u2019s CPA claim and concluded that the claim was analogous to the common law torts of fraud or negligent misrepresentation, against which the HABC was entitled to assert governmental immunity. <em>Id. </em>at 26-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">We granted certiorari to answer six questions, only four of which Brooks has pursued in his brief.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> For purposes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>discussion, we condense those questions into a single, overarching question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-4\">Did the Circuit Court err in granting summary judgment in favor of the HABC on the ground that it was immune from the claims brought by Brooks because it was insured for the applicable period of time, notwithstanding that its coverage limits were exhausted?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">\u201cThe doctrine of sovereign immunity from suit, rooted in the ancient common law, is firmly embedded in the law of Maryland.\u201d <em>Katz v. Wash. Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n, </em>284 Md. 503, 507, 397 A.2d 1027, 1030 (1979). In Maryland, the doctrine applies to the State and its agencies. <em>Id. </em>The doctrine also applies to local governments and their agencies when tortious conduct arises out of governmental, rather than proprietary or corporate, functions. <em>Housing Auth. of Baltimore City v. Bennett, </em>359 Md. 356, 359, 754 A.2d 367, 368 (2000). Therefore, the doctrine is \u201cperhaps, more accurately characterized as \u2018governmental immunity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Austin v. City of Baltimore, </em>286 Md. 51, 53, 405 A.2d 255, 256 (1979); <em>accord Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Whalen, </em>395 Md. 154, 163, 909 A.2d 683, 688 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">The General Assembly has the authority to waive governmental immunity either directly or by necessary implication. <em>Katz, </em>284 Md. at 507-08, 397 A.2d at 1030. The test for ascertaining whether and to what extent governmental immunity is waived has two prongs: \u201c[A] legislative waiver of sovereign [or governmental] immunity is ineffective unless specific legislative authority to sue the agency has been given, and unless there are funds available for the satisfaction of the judgment, or power reposed in [an] agency for the raising of funds necessary to satisfy a recovery against it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 513, 397 A.2d at 1033. Stated another way, \u201c[a] waiver of sover<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>eign or governmental immunity from suit generally requires that two conditions be met. First, the Legislature must authorize suits for damages, and, second, there must be provision for the payment of judgments.\u201d <em>Kee v. State Highway Admin., </em>313 Md. 445, 455, 545 A.2d 1312, 1317 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">\n<em>The Pa,rties\u2019 Contentions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Whether the Circuit Court was correct in granting summary judgment in favor of the HABC turns on the question of whether that court correctly decided that the HABC was immune from Brooks\u2019s suit.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The parties, not surprisingly, are at odds on the answer to that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">Brooks leads with the contention that the Circuit Court erred in concluding that the General Assembly intended only a partial waiver of housing authorities\u2019 immunity from suit. He argues that Article 44A, viewed in its entirety, evidences a complete waiver of immunity from suits in tort, and the language of <em>Jackson </em>stating the contrary is <em>dicta </em>that is incorrect and should not be followed. Brooks further argues, in the alternative, that even if Article 44A effects only a partial waiver of immunity up to the limits of applicable insurance, as <em>Jackson </em>states, there is a dispute of material fact concerning whether the HABC, by under-insuring, \u201cmanufactured\u201d its immunity. Brooks argues that, assuming the HABC is engaged in a governmental function when maintaining and operating public housing, it failed in this instance to fulfill the statutory mandate to \u201cinsure or provide for insurance ... against any risks or hazards\u201d; consequently, the HABC is not immune from suit. Brooks adds as a final argument the threshold contention that the HABC is not immune from suit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>because, as a \u201clandlord\u201d operating a housing project that \u201conly benefits a specially qualified group of low income tenants, and does not benefit the welfare of the whole public, the HABC is engaging in a proprietary function, not a governmental function.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">The HABC counters that <em>Jackson </em>correctly holds that the General Assembly waived housing authorities\u2019 governmental immunity only up to the limits of liability insurance coverage. The HABC, acknowledging that it is a local government agency (not a state agency), argues that its functions are governmental and the immunity it thereby enjoys was waived only to the limits of its available insurance coverage. The HABC further argues that, because there is no dispute of material fact that the liability coverage it purchased was exhausted by the time Brooks filed suit, it is immune from suit. Consequently, in the view of the HABC, the court properly granted summary judgment in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">To determine which position is correct, we begin with an examination of \u00a7 1-301 of Article 44A, which is central to the disposition of this case. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-7\">An authority shall constitute a public body corporate and politic, exercising public and essential governmental functions, and having all the powers necessary or convenient to carry out and effectuate the purposes and provisions of this article, including the following powers in addition to others herein granted:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-8\">(1) <em>To sue and be sued, </em>to have a seal and to alter the same at pleasure, to have perpetual succession, to make and execute contracts and other instruments necessary or convenient to the exercise of the powers of the authority, and to make and from time to time amend and repeal bylaws, rules and regulations not inconsistent with this article, and to carry into effect the powers and purposes of the authority;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>(4) To make rent subsidy payments to or on behalf of persons of eligible income; to lease or rent any dwellings, houses, accommodations, lands, buildings, structures, or facilities embraced in any housing project and, subject to the limitations contained in this article, to establish and revise the rents or charges therefor; to own, hold, and improve real or personal property; to purchase, lease, obtain options upon, acquire by gift, grant, bequest, devise, or otherwise any real or personal property or interest therein; to sell, lease, exchange, transfer, assign, pledge, or dispose of any real or personal property or any interest therein; <em>to insure or provide for the insurance of any real or personal property or operations of the authority against any risks or hazards; to procure insurance or guarantees from the State or federal government of the payment of any debts or parts thereof (whether or not incurred by said authority) secured by mortgages on any property included in any of its housing projects;</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AfF\">(5) <em>To invest any funds held in reserves or sinking funds, or any funds not required for immediate disbursement, </em>in property or securities in which savings banks may <em>legally invest funds </em>subject to their control; to <em>purchase its bonds </em>at a price not more than the principal amount thereof and accrued interest, all bonds so purchased to be canceled;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-4\">(10) <em>To borrow money or accept grants or other financial assistance from the local, State, or federal government and accept grants from nongovernmental sources for or in aid of any housing project within its area of operation, </em>to take over or lease or manage any housing project or undertaking constructed, financed, or owned by the local, State, or federal government, and to these ends, to comply with such conditions and enter into such mortgages, trust indentures, leases, or agreements as may be necessary, convenient, or desirable. <em>It is the purpose and intent of this article to authorize every authority to do any and all things necessary or desirable to secure the financial aid or cooperation of the local, State, or federal </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number><em>government in the undertaking, construction, maintenance, or operation of any housing project by such authority; </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-4\">(11) To exercise all or any part or combination of powers herein granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Article 44A, \u00a7 1-301 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">We discussed the origins of this law in <em>Jackson. </em>We noted that the General Assembly enacted the law in anticipation of, and to take advantage of, the provisions of the United States Housing Act of 1937, ch. 896, 50 Stat. 888, now 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1401-1440 (1976). <em>Jackson, </em>289 Md. at 121, 422 A.2d at 377. The federal Act created a program designed \u201cfor slum clearance and provision for persons whose incomes are too low to enable them to live in other than insanitary or unsafe conditions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Matthaei v. Housing Auth. of Baltimore City, </em>177 Md. 506, 509, 9 A.2d 835, 836 (1939)). By Chapter 517 of the Acts of 1937, the General Assembly added Article 44A to the Code of Public Laws. The statute adhered closely to the terms of the federal law. <em>Matthaei, 177 </em>Md. at 509-10, 9 A.2d at 836. A housing authority was created in each city having a population of over 1,000 and in each county of the state. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1937), Art. 44A, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4, 22; <em>Jackson, </em>289 Md. at 121, 422 A.2d at 377. That law made each housing authority \u201ca public body corporate and politic,\u201d but it was necessary that each local authority declare its need for a housing authority. <em>Jackson, </em>289 Md. at 121, 422 A.2d at 377 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">The precise issue presented in <em>Jackson </em>was whether the Housing Opportunities Commission (\u201cHOC\u201d) could raise the defense of governmental immunity in a personal injury action brought against it for negligence in failing to maintain the safety of the premises of a housing project. The HOC filed a preliminary motion asserting government immunity, arguing in the alternative that it was operating \u201cas a state agency, or as a local agency exercising totally governmental functions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 120, 422 A.2d at 377. The plaintiffs, an injured child and his father, argued that the HOC maintained liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>insurance that constituted a recognized \u201cexception\u201d to the doctrine of governmental immunity. <em>Id. </em>The Circuit Court for Montgomery County granted the motion of the HOC, and the Court of Special Appeals affirmed. <em>Jackson v. Housing Opportunities Comm\u2019n of Montgomery County, 44 </em>Md.App. 304, 317, 408 A.2d 1337, 1344 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">We granted certiorari to answer \u201cthe sole question presented by the appellants[,]\u201d which was whether the General Assembly, by enacting Article 44A, had effected \u201ca waiver of sovereign immunity, either express or implied.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>289 Md. at 120, 422 A.2d at 377. To answer that question, we examined the statute, by reference to the two-pronged <em>Katz </em>test.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We concluded that the first prong of the <em>Katz </em>test\u2014 requiring specific legislative authority to sue the agency \u2014 was \u201cclearly satisfied in this case. A housing authority has power \u2018[t]o sue and be sued.\u2019 The power is unqualified.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 124, 422 A.2d at 379. To determine whether the second prong of the <em>Katz </em>test \u2014 requiring that \u201cfunds [be] available for the satisfaction of the judgment, or power reposed in the agency for the raising of funds necessary to satisfy a recovery against it\u201d \u2014 we looked to various provisions of Article 44A. We noted, in particular, that the statute \u201cboth authorizes and mandates the purchase of insurance\u201d to cover \u201cany real or personal property\u201d or \u201coperations of the authority\u201d \u201cagainst any risks or hazards.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>at 127, 422 A.2d at 380-81 (citing former Art. 44A, \u00a7 8(d)). We noted, too, that the provision of insurance relating to operations, former Art. 44A, \u00a7 9, also reflected that the General Assembly contemplated that liability insurance would be purchased. We said in that regard: \u201cThe term \u2018insurance\u2019 as used in [former] \u00a7 9 must bear the same meaning as its use in \u00a7 8(d) and include liability insurance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 128, 422 A.2d at 381. Moreover, we did not \u201cfind the absence of minimum policy limits in the Housing Authorities Law to be a bar to the waiver of immunity.\u201d <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>at 130, 422 A.2d at 382. We therefore declared our holding to be that \u201cthe combination of statutory provisions presented here effects, by necessary and compelling implication, a limited waiver of the defense of sovereign immunity to the extent of permitting recovery only out of any sum payable on behalf of the HOC by its insurer under applicable liability coverage.\u201d <em>Id.; see Bennett, </em>359 Md. at 361, 754 A.2d at 369 (expressing the <em>Jackson </em>holding as a declaration that \u201cArt. 44A both waived any governmental immunity which a housing authority might otherwise enjoy and capped its liability at the extent of its liability insurance\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">Brooks, recognizing that <em>Jackson </em>undermines his argument that the General Assembly effected a complete waiver of housing authorities\u2019 immunity from suit in tort, urges us to clarify that \u201cthe limited waiver of immunity\u201d language contained in the <em>Jackson </em>holding is <em>dicta, </em>because it is unnecessary to the resolution of the question presented in that case. We have said that, \u201c[w]hen a question of law is raised properly by the issues in a case and the Court supplies a deliberate expression of its opinion upon that question, such opinion is not to be regarded as <em>obiter dictum, </em>although the final judgment in the case may be rooted in another point also raised by the record.\u201d <em>Schmidt v. Prince George\u2019s Hosp., </em>366 Md. 535, 551, 784 A.2d 1112, 1121 (2001). Applying that standard in the recent case of <em>State v. Baby, </em>404 Md. 220, 246, 946 A.2d 463, 478 (2008), we identified as <em>obiter dictum </em>certain language in our prior case of <em>Battle v. State, </em>287 Md. 675, 414 A.2d 1266 (1980). We reasoned that the <em>Battle </em>language at issue was not made \u201con a point that was argued by counsel and deliberately addressed by this Court, but rather was a collateral statement. Most important is the fact that our decision in <em>Battle </em>was not dependent upon this statement; the holding would indeed be unaffected were that language to be removed.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Here, as in <em>Battle, </em>the language in <em>Jackson </em>that is presently at issue was not made on a point that either party argued; albeit, unlike in <em>Battle, </em>we deliberately addressed the matter. Most important, however, is that our decision in <em>Jackson </em>was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>not dependent upon our statement that the waiver of immunity is limited to the amount of insurance coverage. Moreover, the question for decision in <em>Jackson, </em>whether the statute effects any waiver of housing authority immunity, is unaffected by removal of our statement concerning the limits of the waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">Therefore, notwithstanding that our holding in <em>Jackson </em>includes language that Article 44A effects \u201ca limited waiver of the defense of sovereign immunity to the extent of permitting recovery only out of any sum payable on behalf of the HOC by its insurer under applicable liability coverage,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 130, 422 A.2d at 382, that language, not being necessary to the issue to be decided in <em>Jackson, </em>is <em>dictum. </em>Even were that language not <em>dictum, </em>we would overrule it for the reasons we next discuss.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">To decide whether the General Assembly\u2019s enactment of Article 44A effects a complete waiver of the HABC\u2019s governmental immunity in tort actions, as Brooks argues it does, we apply the well-recognized rules of statutory construction. Our primary goal is \u201c \u2018to discern the legislative purpose, the ends to be accomplished, or the evils to be remedied by a particular provision[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Anderson v. Council of Unit Owners of the Gables on Tuckerman Condo., </em>404 Md. 560, 571, 948 A.2d 11, 18 (2008) (quoting <em>Barbre v. Pope, </em>402 Md. 157, 172, 935 A.2d 699, 708 (2007)). We first look at the \u201cnormal, plain meaning of the language of the statute,\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>404 Md. at 571, 948 A.2d at 18, and we read it as a whole so that \u201c \u2018no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless or nugatory,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting <em>Barbre, </em>402 Md. at 172, 935 A.2d at 708). \u201cIf the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, we need not look beyond the statute\u2019s provisions and our analysis ends.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 572, 948 A.2d at 19. If the language can be subject to more than one interpretation, or if the terms are ambiguous when part of a larger statutory scheme, \u201cwe endeavor to resolve that ambiguity by looking to the statute\u2019s legislative history, case law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>statutory purpose, as well as the structure of the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The language should not be interpreted in isolation when the statute is part of a larger statutory scheme. <em>Id. </em>We analyze the statute as a whole considering the \u201c\u2018purpose, aim, or policy of the enacting body.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Serio v. Baltimore County, </em>884 Md. 373, 389, 863 A.2d 952, 961 (2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">Reading the relevant portions of Article 44A, we conclude that the General Assembly effected a complete waiver of the governmental immunity of housing authorities for a government function. The test for determining whether the legislature has waived a local government agency\u2019s governmental immunity (applicable only to government functions) has two conditions: \u201cFirst, the Legislature must authorize suits for damages, and second, there must be provision for the payment of judgments.\u201d <em>Kee, </em>313 Md. at 455, 545 A.2d at 1317 (summarizing the <em>Katz </em>test).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">We determined in <em>Jackson </em>that the statute readily satisfies the first condition because it authorizes housing authorities \u201cto sue and be sued.\u201d Article 44A, \u00a7 1-301(1); <em>Jackson, </em>289 Md. at 124, 422 A.2d at 379. We also determined in <em>Jackson </em>that Article 44A meets the condition established by the second prong of the <em>Katz </em>test because the General Assembly made provision in the statute for the payment of judgments. <em>Id. </em>at 129, 422 A.2d 376, 422 A.2d at 382. We depart, however, from our statement in <em>Jackson </em>that the waiver of immunity effected by the statute is limited by the extent of available commercial insurance coverage. Rather, an examination of the entirety of the housing authorities statute leads us to conclude that the statute effects a complete waiver of immunity, including when, as in the present case, there is no available commercial insurance coverage to satisfy the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Article 44A, \u00a7 1-301(4) authorizes housing authorities to \u201cinsure or provide for the insurance of any real or personal property or operations of the authority against any risks or hazards.\u201d Section 1-301(4) also authorizes housing authorities to \u201cprocure insurance or guarantees from the State or federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>government of the payment of any debts or parts thereof (whether or not incurred by said authority) secured by mortgages on any property included in any of its housing projects.\u201d Further, such insurance is, as we noted in <em>Jackson, </em>\u201cmandated\u201d by the language providing that the housing authority \u201cshall fix the rentals\u201d at amounts that would \u201cmeet the cost of, and to provide for, maintaining and operating the projects (including the cost of any insurance),\u201d which, as we noted in <em>Jackson, </em>includes liability insurance. <em>See </em>289 Md. at 127-28, 422 A.2d at 380-81 (citing former Art. 44A, \u00a7 9, recodified as Art. 44A, \u00a7 1-401).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Under \u00a7 1-301(5), moreover, housing authorities may \u201cinvest any funds held in reserves or sinking funds, or any funds not required for immediate disbursement.\u201d And, in setting rental rates, housing authorities \u201cshall fix the rents for dwellings in its housing projects ...\u201d at rates sufficient to \u201cmeet the cost of, and to provide for, maintaining and operating the housing projects (including the cost of any insurance) and the administrative expenses of the authority.\u201d Art. 44A, \u00a7 1-401(b)(1). Additionally, housing authorities may \u201cborrow money or accept grants or other financial assistance from the local, State, or federal government and accept grants from nongovernmental sources for or in aid of any housing project within its area of operation^]\u201d Art. 44A, \u00a7 1-301(10).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">The General Assembly also authorized housing authorities to \u201cdo any and all things necessary or desirable\u201d for the construction, maintenance, or operation of any housing project. Art. 44A, \u00a7 1-301(10). Finally, housing authorities have the power to issue bonds for any corporate purpose. Art. 44A, \u00a7 1-501.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">Plainly, by its enactment of Article 44A, the General Assembly expressly authorized housing authorities to satisfy judgments either by purchase of adequate insurance coverage or by self-insurance and to generate funds for that purpose through a variety of fund-raising means, without capping in any way the extent of the obligation. By application of the <em>Katz </em>test, the statute effects a complete waiver of immunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>from suit arising out of tortious conduct in the maintenance and operation of subsidized housing.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">Our conclusion is bolstered by the fact that, when the General Assembly wishes to limit the waiver of governmental immunity in a given situation, it knows precisely how to do so. For example, the General Assembly requires county boards of education to carry a minimum of $100,000 comprehensive liability insurance, through commercial policies or self-insurance, and provides that the county boards \u201cshall have the immunity from liability described under \u00a7 5-518 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.\u201d Md.Code (1978, 2008 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 4-105 of the Education Article. Section 5-518 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, in turn, states that \u201c[a] county board of education may not raise the defense of sovereign immunity to any claim of $100,00 or less[,]\u201d \u00a7 5-518(c), while entitling the county boards to \u201craise the defense of sovereign immunity to any amount claimed above the limit of its insurance policy or, if self-insured or a member of a pool described under \u00a7 4-105(c)(l)(ii) of the Education Article, above $100,000.\u201d Md.Code (1973, 2006 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 5-518(b) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJP\u201d). Similarly, the General Assembly has waived immunity for community college boards only up to insurance policy limits or $100,000 of self-insurance, and it permits the boards to \u201craise the defense of sovereign immunity to any amount of a claim in excess of the limit of an insurance policy or in excess of $100,000 in the case of self-insurance.\u201d CJP \u00a7 5-519. The General Assembly has done the same for the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission. <em>See </em>Md. Code (1957, 1997 Repl.Vol.), Article 28, \u00a7 2-111; CJP \u00a7 5-512 (requiring the Commission to have an \u201cadequate\u201d amount of insurance, and permitting the Commission to invoke the defense of government immunity for liabilities in excess of the insurance limits). Further, the General Assembly has provided that charitable organizations are not immune from tort liability, but the liability is limited to funds available under the organization\u2019s liability policy coverage. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1995, 2002 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 19-103 of the Insurance Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>In contrast to those statutes, the General Assembly did not expressly limit the waiver of immunity for housing authorities to either the limit of commercial insurance coverage or, in the case of self-insurance, a specific amount. We repeat, had the General Assembly wished to limit housing authorities\u2019 exposure to suits for damages, it knew how to make that limitation plain in the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">Other states having housing authorities statutes similar to Maryland\u2019s have construed their statutes as providing a complete waiver of governmental immunity. The Supreme Court of Delaware, for example, has held that one of its local housing authority\u2019s immunity is completely waived under the operative statute. <em>See Wilmington Housing Auth. v. Williamson, </em>228 A.2d 782, 788 (Del.1967) (superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in <em>Fiat Motors of N. Am. v. Wilmington, </em>498 A.2d 1062 (Del.1985)). Like Article 44A, \u00a7 1-301, the Delaware statute gives the housing authority the power to \u2018\u201csue and be sued\u2019\u201d and \u201c\u2018to insure or provide for the insurance of the property or operation of the authority against such risks as the authority may deem advisable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williamson, </em>228 A.2d at 787-788 (quoting 31 Del.C. \u00a7 4307(a)(3)). The Delaware Supreme Court interpreted these clauses as waiving immunity, stating: \u201cIf immunity to suit had been intended by the General Assembly, what purpose does the grant of authority to insure its operation serve?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Courts from other jurisdictions have likewise recognized that similarly worded statutes completely waive housing authorities\u2019 immunity. <em>See, e.g., Rosa v. V.I. Housing Auth., </em>43 V.I. 131, 135-36 (Terr.Ct.2008) (citing <em>Greaux v. Gov., </em>14 V.I. 160 (Terr.Ct.1977)) (discussing how the housing authority\u2019s sovereign immunity was originally waived, but a subsequent amendment to the statute specifically limited the housing authority\u2019s liability to $50,000, permitting the housing authority to claim immunity from judgments over that amount); <em>Evans v. Housing Auth. of the City of Raleigh, </em>359 N.C. 50, 602 S.E.2d 668, 672-73 (2004) (determining that the provisions of the housing authority\u2019s statute \u201cto sue or be sued\u201d and \u201cto insure or provide for the insurance of the property or opera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>tions of the authority against such risks as the authority may deem advisable\u201d waived immunity for the housing authority, but, pursuant to a separate statute, waiver of immunity was only to the extent of the amount of insurance purchased).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">For all of the reasons we have discussed, we hold that the General Assembly has waived completely the governmental immunity that Maryland\u2019s housing authorities would otherwise enjoy in tort actions arising out of the authorities\u2019 performance of government functions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As a consequence, under former Article 44A (and absent any other statutory cap), a housing authority sued for tortious conduct arising out of its maintenance or operation of subsidized housing is liable for any judgment against it. To the extent that <em>Jackson </em>declares a different rule, it is hereby disavowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Applying our holding to the present case, the HABC was not entitled to summary judgment on Brooks\u2019s negligence claim on the basis that it had exhausted its insurance coverage for the policy period during which that claim arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">It remains for us to address Brooks\u2019s argument that the HABC cannot assert governmental immunity for the CPA claim he raises in the complaint.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Brooks argues that the CPA is not a tort-based statute. The only argument the HABC has for claiming immunity from suit under the CPA is that Brooks\u2019s claim is based, essentially, on the same acts as would give rise to the common law torts of fraud and negligent misrepresentation; therefore, the HABC reasons, it is entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>to the same immunity it enjoys for suits brought under common law tort actions. The Court of Special Appeals agreed with the HABC and, believing that the HABC is immune from Brooks\u2019s common law tort claim, affirmed the Circuit Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the HABC on the CPA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">We recently held in <em>Green v. N.B.S., Inc., </em>409 Md. 528, 541, 976 A.2d 279, 286 (2009), that the statutory cap on noneconomic damages, CJP \u00a7 11-108, applies to a personal injury claim brought under the CPA. In so holding, we recognized that claims brought under the CPA can arise out of a common law tort. 409 Md. at 543, 976 A.2d at 287. We therefore reject Brooks\u2019s argument that his claim under the CPA is not tort-based.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Even though we reject Brooks\u2019s argument, we agree with him that he can sue the HABC on the grounds that it violated the CPA. The HABC presents no argument for immunity from suit under the CPA except that the HABC is immune to the same degree that it is immune from a common law tort claim. That argument fails in light of our holding that the HABC enjoys no such immunity from Brooks\u2019s common law claim. We therefore hold that the Circuit Court erred as a matter of law in granting the HABC summary judgment on the CPA claim.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AND REMAND THE CASE FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS IN THAT COURT.

By Chapter 63 of the Acts of 2006, Article 44A was re-codified as Maryland Code (2006), \u00a7\u00a7 12-101-12-175 of the Housing and Community Development Article.

We denied the petition insofar as it related to respondent Gibson, <em>Housing Auth. of Baltimore City v.
