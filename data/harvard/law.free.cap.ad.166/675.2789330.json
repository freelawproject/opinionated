Tinton Building Corporation, Appellant, <em>v. </em>James V. Ganly, as Clerk of Bronx County, Respondent.</parties>\n<court data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b751-5\">First Department,</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Ahb\">March 12, 1915.</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b751-6\">Judgment \u2014 transcript of judgment \u2014 Federal stamp tax.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b751-7\">The county clerk of Bronx county should not refuse to file a transcript of a judgment of the Municipal Court of the city of New York on the sole ground that the stamp required by section 5, Schedule A, of the Federal Revenue Act has not been affixed thereto. The transcript of such judgment does not come within the provisions of the act and the stamp is not required.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b751-8\">Appeal by the relator, Tinton Building Corporation, from an order of the Supreme Court, made at the Bronx Special Term and entered in the office of the clerk of the county of Bronx on the 13th day of January, 1915, denying its motion for a peremptory writ of mandamus.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b751-9\"><em>George D.

The transcript was correct in form and the respondent refused to receive or file the same solely on the ground that the ten cent-stamp required by section 5, Schedule A, of the United States Revenue Act of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>October 22, 1914 (38 U. S. Stat. at Large, 753, 761), in effect on and after December 1, 1914,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> had not been affixed thereto and canceled.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">We are of the opinion that the transcript of the judgment referred to does not come within the provisions of the act, and, therefore, a stamp tax is not required to be affixed thereto and canceled before the same can be filed in the county clerk\u2019s office. Such transcript is a necessary part of a court proceeding and its filing in the county clerk\u2019s office is a step to effectuate and enforce the judgment in the county of Bronx.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">The construction thus given to the statute is the one placed upon by it by the collector of the fourteenth district of New York (See N. Y. L. J., Feb. 6, 1915), also by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. (See circular, December 11, 1914, T. D. 2087; T. D. Dec. 17, 1914, vol. 27, No. 25, p. 21.) This, however, was not the position taken by the relator at the time the transcript was presented to the respondent. It then conceded, as it does in the brief presented on this appeal, that the transcript was a certificate within the meaning of the Federal act, but that act, in so far as it required a stamp to be affixed and canceled upon such certificate, was unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">Under such circumstances, while we think the order should be reversed and the motion granted, it should be without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">The order appealed from, therefore, is reversed and the motion granted, without costs to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">Present \u2014Ingraham, P. J., McLaughlin, Laughlin, Clarke and Scott, JJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">Order reversed and motion granted, without costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b752-10\">See 38 U. S.
