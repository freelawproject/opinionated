At the same time, the [petitioner] asked [Frank] Spetrino [an associate of his] if he would help him put the victim in a barrel. That evening, Byers drove the victim [Alex Palmieri], Spetrino and Tamara Thiel, the victim's girlfriend, to the [petitioner's] house. The [petitioner], the victim, Byers and Spetrino entered the [petitioner's] garage, while Thiel remained in the car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"In the garage, the [petitioner] and the victim argued about the [petitioner's] desire that the victim leave Connecticut and reside for a time in Italy, and the victim's refusal to do so. When the matter was not resolved to the [petitioner's] satisfaction, he handed Spetrino an aluminum baseball bat and told Spetrino not to let the victim leave the garage. Thereafter, as the group began to exit the garage, Spetrino struck the victim in the head with the bat. After Spetrino had hit the victim from one to three times, the [petitioner] said, 'Let's get him in the refrigerator.' Spetrino then began to drag the victim toward a refrigerator that was located inside the [petitioner]' s garage. As he was being dragged, the victim began to speak incoherently, and the [petitioner] said, 'Shut up Alex. You didn't go to Italy.' When the victim failed to quiet down, the [petitioner] struck him on the head with the bat numerous times. The additional blows made the victim bleed heavily and caused some of his brain tissue to protrude from his skull. The [petitioner], Byers and Spetrino then placed the victim into a large refrigerator, and the [petitioner] closed and padlocked the door. The men then loaded the refrigerator into the back of a rented van, and the [petitioner] and Spetrino drove the van to a parking area near the Pequonnock River, where the river empties into the\n   harbor in downtown Bridgeport. After making several holes in the refrigerator with an axe so that it would sink, the [petitioner] and Spetrino slid the refrigerator into the water and it floated away. Although a police dive team searched the harbor for the victim's body and the refrigerator for a period of five months, the divers could locate neither.

Those two actions eventually were consolidated under docket number CV-05-4000275 (CV-05). As discussed in the habeas court's memorandum of decision in the present case, the petitioner's habeas trial in the CV-05 action \"was first scheduled to begin in February 2010. At the request of the petitioner, trial was postponed to ... August, 2010. For unknown reasons, the trial was again rescheduled to ... October 4, 2011. The petitioner again requested a postponement and the case was reassigned a 'hard' and firm trial start date of October 23, 2012, [with] Judge Pavia presiding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"However, the day before trial was to begin, the petitioner executed a withdrawal of the habeas action on October 22, 2012. The petitioner signed the withdrawal form as [did] counsel. Despite the withdrawal filing, Judge Pavia required the petitioner and counsel to appear before her on October 23, 2012. Judge Pavia and [the] respondent's counsel both expressed their readiness to proceed with the habeas trial, but [the] petitioner's counsel reiterated the petitioner's desire to withdraw the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"Judge Pavia canvassed the petitioner on the record regarding his decision to withdraw the case and relinquish his opportunity to prove his allegations against previous habeas counsel. The judge recounted the lengthy procedural history and the fact that the trial had been postponed multiple times. Judge Pavia warned the petitioner that attempts to refile would be met with opposition by the respondent [Commissioner of Correction] and that such refiling might be dismissed summarily because of the withdrawal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"The judge ascertained that the petitioner's decision to terminate the litigation was made after consultation with counsel and without coercion of any sort and was a product of the petitioner's free will. The petitioner acknowledged the judge's admonitions but still wished to withdraw his case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Judge Pavia deemed the withdrawal to\n   be with prejudice,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   stating: \"For what it's worth, I am going to just put this on the record. I understand that there's an issue in terms of whether or not this is with prejudice or without prejudice. And while there may not be any case law that addresses the issue of prejudice in such a matter, I do want to place some things on the record for the next judge if in fact this issue ever is addressed again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"As indicated, we are here today for the first day of trial. This trial date was set many months ago. We were accommodating a request, a special request, which came in from Rockville to accommodate the [petitioner] because he had some serious health concerns and we wanted to be able to accommodate his needs so that\n   he was able to attend the trial in the best manner that he possibly could. And so this court agreed to take the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"The case is not necessarily a short habeas petition and did need at least a week to two weeks of trial time, as I was told from counsel. And on several occasions, we cleared our matters here in this court where we only have a single trial judge to be able to accommodate the petitioner's matter. In addition, we had addressed the idea of depositions taking place before the trial began, specifically the deposition of Attorney [Frank] Riccio, who is one of the main [witnesses with respect to the] claims of ineffectiveness in terms of the petitioner's habeas petition. That deposition was scheduled and rescheduled on several occasions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"I know that the state is-or the respondent is indicating that they're not going to ponder as to why the deposition did not go forward, but I think it's worth noting for the record that it was not the respondent who was not available. It was also not the deponent who was not available, but for one reason or another, the matter was called off. So it was not the respondent calling it off, it was not the deponent calling it off. And I think that matter will probably become more developed as time goes on.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \"This court has not only set aside the time in terms of trial, but the clerk gave up her time by way of setting afternoons, and even met with the attorneys and marked all the exhibits for this matter so that we'd be ready to go in an effective way today. The ... respondent is ready to begin, and has, according to ... much discussion in chambers, been actively pursuing their readiness for this trial for some time and are prepared to go forward today. The court is ready to go forward today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"I note the withdrawal of the action after a full canvass of the matter and the ramifications of that canvass. And to the extent that this matter can be deemed to be with prejudice, it would be this court's opinion that it should be.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On November 14, 2012, that is, less than one month after he withdrew the CV-05 action before Judge Pavia, the petitioner filed the present habeas action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In his fifth\n   amended petition dated March 26, 2015,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   the petitioner alleged in eighteen counts that his prior habeas attorneys in both the Noel and Palmieri cases rendered ineffective assistance of counsel. More specifically, the petitioner alleges, inter alia, that the petitioner's prior habeas counsel in the Noel case, Attorney Raymond Rigat, did not adequately challenge the effectiveness of the petitioner's appellate counsel, Attorney Timothy Pothin, and his trial counsel, Attorney Riccio; and that the petitioner's prior habeas counsel in the Palmieri case, Attorney Thomas Conroy, failed to adequately challenge the effectiveness of the petitioner's trial counsel in that case, Attorney Riccio. In his return,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   the\n   respondent pleaded the special defenses of procedural default, deliberate bypass, res judicata,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and laches.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The habeas court,\n   <em>\n    Sferrazza, J.\n   </em>\n   , was scheduled to begin trial on the petitioner's claims on May 4, 2015. That day, however, prior to hearing evidence, Attorney Fox stated that the parties were in agreement that \"it would be simpler for [the court] to ... decide whether [it] would want to rule on [the special defense] issues ... if [the respondent] prevails, the trial is not going forward, so it would make sense to deal with them now. \"Judge Sferrazza agreed, and the parties presented evidence, which included the testimony of the petitioner, on the limited issues posed by the respondent's special defenses. Later that day, Judge Sferrazza orally ruled that the petitioner's action was dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In his written memorandum of decision dated May 7, 2015, Judge Sferrazza made the following findings: \"[T]he petitioner testified that his decision to withdraw the case and his responses to Judge Pavia were clouded by the effects of illness and/or medication. The court finds this testimony unworthy of belief. He signed the withdrawal form on October\n   <em>\n    22\n   </em>\n   , 2012, after discussions with counsel. His replies to Judge Pavia the next day were cogent and belie his assertion of diminished comprehension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"His counsel, on October 23, 2012, revealed that the reason for the withdrawal was predicated on counsel's inability to arrange to depose Attorney Riccio, who was seriously ill around that date. Habeas counsel feared that Attorney Riccio might be unable to testify as to\n   his version of events at the habeas trial because of his deteriorating health. He died a few months later in 2013.\n   \"Habeas counsel's explanation for withdrawal on the eve of trial was due to a lack of confidence in proving the habeas on a habeas case if the trial proceeded. Attorney Wallace remarked, 'The fact that [Attorney Riccio] is our main witness, that that-without his testimony,\n   <em>\n    this trial would go nowhere\n   </em>\n   ' ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \"It must be noted that the petitioner chose to\n   <em>\n    terminate\n   </em>\n   the case rather than request additional time to secure whatever useful information Attorney Riccio might possess. Recall that Attorney Riccio had testified at the earlier habeas trials .... Presumably, he was available for discussion with new habeas counsel during the seven year period between January, 2005, when the previous habeas on a habeas case was filed, and October, 2012.... As mentioned above, the habeas trial was twice postponed at the petitioner's behest.\" (Citation omitted; emphasis in original.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Ultimately, Judge Sferrazza concluded that \"Judge Pavia's canvass made abundantly clear that [the petitioner's] decision to terminate his case was, indeed,\n   <em>\n    his\n   </em>\n   decision, made knowingly and without force or pressure. A petitioner ought not be permitted to withdraw a habeas case at the moment of trial simply based on fear of failure if the trial were to proceed, without incurring the consequence of finality.\" (Emphasis in original.) He then concluded that the deliberate bypass doctrine applied and dismissed the petition due to a lack of subject matter jurisdiction. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   We begin by setting forth the applicable standard of review. \"The conclusions reached by the trial court in its decision to dismiss [a] habeas petition are matters of law, subject to plenary review....

In the present case, however, the petitioner's waiver of his right to go forward with the habeas trial in the CV-05 case was made expressly and on the record before Judge Pavia, as opposed to in\n   <em>\n    Palumbo\n   </em>\n   , where the plaintiff's waiver of his right to a jury trial was done by operation of statute once he missed the deadline for claiming the action to a jury trial list. See General Statutes \u00a7 51-239b. As Judge Sferrazza highlighted in his memorandum of decision, the petitioner here \"participated personally in the decision to withdraw the previous habeas matter the day before trial was to begin. He signed the form on October 22, 2012, after consultation with his lawyer. Judge Pavia's canvass made abundantly clear that his decision to terminate his case was, indeed,\n   <em>\n    his\n   </em>\n   decision, made knowingly and without force or pressure.\" (Emphasis in original.) To the extent that the petitioner believed it was improper for Judge Pavia to canvass him and to enter the withdrawal with prejudice, he could have appealed her decision,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   rather than file a second, identical habeas petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Additionally, in relying on Judge Pavia's prior findings and the record in that proceeding,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Judge Sferrazza\n   found that \"[h]abeas counsel's explanation for withdrawal [of the CV-05 action] on the eve of trial was due to a lack of confidence in proving the habeas on a habeas case if the trial proceeded. Attorney Wallace remarked, 'The fact that [Attorney Riccio] is our main witness, that that-without his\n   testimony,\n   <em>\n    this trial would go nowhere\n   </em>\n   .' \" (Emphasis in original.) Judge Sferrazza also stated that Attorney Riccio presumably was \"available for discussion with new habeas counsel during the seven year period between January, 2005, when the [CV-05] habeas on a habeas case was filed, and October, 2012 [when the withdrawal of that action occurred],\" and that \"[a]ny lack of preparedness was attributable to the petitioner rather than the respondent or the court.\" Judge Sferrazza did not find that the petitioner's previous withdrawal was due to the petitioner's own health problems, and he found that the petitioner lacked credibility when he testified before the court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Ultimately, Judge Sferrazza considered the procedural posture of this case to implicate the doctrine of deliberate bypass,\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   noting that the petitioner chose to\n   terminate the CV-05 case rather than request additional time to secure whatever useful information Attorney Riccio could have provided as evidence. The argument could also be made that the court's disposition falls more neatly under other doctrines such as waiver or abuse of the writ.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Regardless of the label, the effect is the same. Judge Sferrazza's independent\n   determination that the petitioner's conduct in the previous CV-05 proceeding constituted a withdrawal with prejudice was legally correct, despite the fact that a hearing on the merits had not yet commenced, because the petitioner engaged in \"procedural chicanery\" by filing the present\n   petition in an attempt to undermine the order of the court in the CV-05 action. As previously discussed, we have considered such gamesmanship to be a limitation on the general rule that a party has a right to withdraw litigation unilaterally prior to a hearing on the merits.
