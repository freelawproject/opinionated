The respondent, the Commissioner of Correction, appeals from the judgment of the Appellate Court reversing the judgment of the habeas court, which dismissed the petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed\n   by the petitioner, Anthony A., for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Anthony A\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=159%20Conn.%20App.%20226\">\n    159 Conn.App. 226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 242,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20A.3d%20730\">\n    122 A.3d 730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). The respondent claims that, contrary to the conclusion of the Appellate Court, the habeas court properly dismissed the petition on the basis that the petitioner failed to allege a protected liberty interest. The petitioner responds that the allegations in the petition, which claim that he was incorrectly classified as a sex offender and that he suffered negative consequences as a result of that erroneous classification, sufficiently alleged a cognizable liberty interest to confer jurisdiction on the court. We agree with the petitioner and affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Because this appeal arises from the habeas court's ruling dismissing the petition\n   on the basis that the court lacked jurisdiction, we take the facts to be those alleged in the petition, including those facts necessarily implied from the allegations, construing them in favor of the petitioner for purposes of deciding whether the court had subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Dorry\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Garden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=313%20Conn.%20516\">\n    313 Conn. 516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 521,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=98%20A.3d%2055\">\n    98 A.3d 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). The allegations in the petition and attachments thereto establish that the petitioner is an inmate who was convicted after pleading guilty to unlawful restraint in the first degree, failure to appear and violation of probation. Initially, the victim, the petitioner's wife, also told the police that the petitioner had sexually assaulted her, but she subsequently recanted that statement, and the state entered a nolle prosequi as to the charge of sexual assault in a spousal relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Upon the petitioner's incarceration, he was classified pursuant to an administrative directive of the Department of Correction (department), which provides in relevant part: \"Each inmate under the custody of the Commissioner of Correction shall be classified to the most appropriate assignment for security and treatment needs to promote effective population management and preparation for release from confinement and supervision....\" Department of Correction, Administrative Directive 9.2 (1) (effective July 1, 2006) (Administrative Directive 9.2). An inmate's classification depends on his risks and needs scores, each of which is evaluated pursuant to specific factors. Administrative Directive 9.2 (8) (A) and (B).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Those scores and the resulting\n   classification determine the inmate's \"appropriate confinement location, treatment, programs and employment assignment whether in a facility or the community.\" Administrative Directive 9.2 (3) (A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The department classified the petitioner as a sex offender, despite the fact that he\n   had not been convicted of a sex offense and had no prior history as a sex offender.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a consequence of the erroneous classification, the petitioner was offered a choice. He could participate in \"sex treatment\" that was recommended by his offender accountability plan or risk forfeiture of supervised community release, parole and the opportunity to earn risk reduction earned credit (good time credits). He refused to participate in treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The petitioner subsequently filed this petition, claiming that he had been classified as a sex offender without being provided procedural due process. At the hearing on the petition, the court first heard argument as to whether it had jurisdiction. The petitioner argued that he had alleged sufficient facts to establish a cognizable liberty interest. Specifically, he argued that the classification had been predicated on erroneous facts, stigmatized him, and that he had been materially burdened by the classification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As to those material burdens, the petitioner alleged that he suffered several negative consequences as a result of the classification. He alleged a direct causal link between the classification and his increased security status. He alleged a contingent relationship between the classification, the recommended treatment plan and his eligibility for good time credits, parole and community\n   release. That is, he claimed that the department had notified him that if he did not participate in the recommended sex offender treatment, he risked forfeiting all three of those benefits. That claim finds support in the department's offender accountability plan that was attached to the petition and provides: \"Failure to comply with [the plan's] recommendations ...\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   negatively impact your earning of [good time credits] ... and/or chances of [department] supervised community release and/or parole.\" (Emphasis added.) Finally, although the petitioner did not allege in the petition that he actually suffered harassment as a result of the classification, he did claim in an inmate administrative remedy form that he had submitted to the department that the sex offender classification had the \"potential\" to prejudice prison staff and other inmates against him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The habeas court dismissed the petition, concluding that because the petitioner failed to allege any protected liberty interest, the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Upon the habeas court's grant of certification to appeal, the petitioner appealed from the judgment of dismissal to the Appellate Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Appellate Court first considered whether the petition had been rendered moot by the petitioner's release from prison prior to oral argument.\n   <em>\n    Anthony A.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=159%20Conn.%20App.%20226\">\n    159 Conn.App. at 232-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20A.3d%20730\">\n    122 A.3d 730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court observed that the petitioner had informed the court that, after his release, he had been arrested in connection with new charges and was being detained at New Haven Correctional Center. Id., at 232,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20A.3d%20730\">\n    122 A.3d 730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because of the petitioner's new arrest, the Appellate Court reasoned that there was \"a reasonable possibility that, should he return to prison, he\n   will again be classified as being in need of sex offender treatment because\n   the department assigned him a sex offender treatment need score with a recommended sex offender treatment referral during his previous incarceration.\" Id., at 234,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20A.3d%20730\">\n    122 A.3d 730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Id., at 238-40,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20A.3d%20730\">\n    122 A.3d 730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court concluded that the petitioner's allegation that the department had falsely labeled him a sex offender established stigma, and that the petitioner's allegation that he had been coerced to participate in sex offender treatment on the basis of that erroneous classification established the \"plus\" element of the test. Id., at 240-41,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20A.3d%20730\">\n    122 A.3d 730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Our first inquiry, therefore, is whether the petitioner has alleged a protected liberty interest. That question implicates the subject matter jurisdiction of the habeas court. See\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3950256\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/281/241/#p261\">\n    281 Conn. 241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 261-62,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=914%20A.2d%201034\">\n    914 A.2d 1034\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007) (holding that habeas court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because inmate did not have cognizable liberty interest in parole eligibility status).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The parties disagree as to the applicable test to determine whether the petitioner's allegations are sufficient to establish that the respondent's actions implicated a protected liberty interest. The respondent, relying on this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Wheway\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Warden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"542584\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/215/418/#p431\">\n    215 Conn. 418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 431,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=576%20A.2d%20494\">\n    576 A.2d 494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990), argues that because he enjoys full discretion in assigning classification and needs scores to inmates, such classifications cannot, as a matter of law, give rise to a protected liberty interest. The petitioner contends that because the classification stigmatized him and because he suffered negative consequences, he has satisfied his burden of establishing a protected liberty interest under the stigma plus test. We agree with the petitioner that the stigma plus test applies under the circumstances of the case, and we conclude that his allegations sufficiently allege a protected liberty interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Sandin\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Conner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1563880\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/472/#p477\">\n    515 U.S. 472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 477-84,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1563880\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/472/#p477\">\n    115 S.Ct. 2293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1563880\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/472/#p477\">\n    132 L.Ed.2d 418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995), the United States Supreme Court reviewed its earlier decisions that had\n   considered under what circumstances allegations by inmates were sufficient to establish that state action had implicated a protected liberty interest.

We agree with the lower federal courts, however, that an inmate raising a due process claim pursuant to the stigma plus test in\n   <em>\n    Vitek\n   </em>\n   also must allege the falsehood of the stigmatizing label or classification.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4219274\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/596/77/#p81\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Under the facts of the present case-where the petitioner has alleged that he was stigmatized when the respondent wrongfully classified him as a sex offender, and alleges as the \"plus\" that he suffered various negative consequences, including being compelled to participate in treatment or risk forfeiting good time credits and parole eligibility-the stigma plus test is the best fit. Our inquiry, therefore, focuses on whether the allegations of the petition demonstrate\n   that the classification\n   was wrongful and stigmatized the petitioner, and that the consequences suffered by the petitioner were \"qualitatively different\" from the punishments usually suffered by prisoners, so that they constituted a major change in the conditions of confinement amounting to a grievous loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The federal courts of appeals have arrived at the same conclusion, applying the stigma plus test to determine whether a prisoner who challenges his allegedly wrongful classification as a sex offender has established a protected liberty interest. We agree with the federal courts that the first part of the test-whether it is stigmatizing to be classified as a sex offender-may be dispatched with ease and relatively little analysis. That classification is uniquely stigmatizing. As the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit explained: \"We can hardly conceive of a state's action bearing more stigmatizing consequences than the labeling of a prison inmate as a sex offender.... One need only look to the increasingly popular Megan's Laws, whereby states require sex offenders to register with law enforcement officials who are then authorized to release information about the sex offender to the public, to comprehend the stigmatizing consequences of being labeled a sex offender.\" (Footnote omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Neal\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Shimoda\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11889252\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/131/818/#p829\">\n    131 F.3d 818\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 829 (9th Cir. 1997). As far as the petitioner's burden to demonstrate that the classification is wrongful, for purposes of jurisdiction, that requirement is satisfied by effective pleading and verified in a threshold inquiry-the petitioner simply must claim that the classification is false. At least one court has rejected a petitioner's claim on the basis that he failed to do so. See\n   <em>\n    Vega\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lantz\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4219274\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/596/77/#p81\">\n    596 F.3d at 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that petitioner failed to establish threshold requirement of alleging that classification as sex offender was false).

A recent decision of the United States Supreme Court highlights the difficulty of determining what constitutes a qualitative difference or major change in the conditions of confinement amounting to a grievous loss. One cannot do so without reference to what constitutes \"typical\" or \"ordinary\" conditions of confinement for a prisoner.

The court explained that \"the touch-stone of the inquiry into the existence of a protected, state-created liberty interest in avoiding restrictive conditions of confinement is not the language of regulations regarding those conditions but the nature of those conditions themselves\n   <em>\n    in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209063\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/209/#p223\">\n    Id., at 223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209063\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/209/#p223\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Courts have held to this rule notwithstanding the representations of prison officials that participation in sex offender treatment is voluntary. Rather than rely on such characterizations, courts consistently have looked to whether significant negative consequences flowed from failure to participate in a \"recommended\" treatment program. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Neal\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Shimoda\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11889252\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/131/818/#p829\">\n    131 F.3d at 822, 829\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting claim by prison officials that participation in treatment was merely recommendation and voluntary, where treatment was condition of parole eligibility). By contrast, courts have found no protected liberty interest where an inmate has been labeled a sex offender and provided with a recommendation for sex offender treatment, but has been unable to demonstrate\n   that he suffered any negative consequences for failure to participate in treatment. See\n   <em>\n    Toney\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Owens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4013101\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/779/330/#p340\">\n    779 F.3d 330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 340-41 (5th Cir. 2015).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Connecticut law is not to the contrary. Although this court has addressed inmates' claims that state action implicated a protected liberty interest, this appeal presents the first instance in which we are called upon to apply the stigma plus test in resolving that question. In fact, the two instances in which this court has considered the question of whether the actions of prison officials gave rise to a protected liberty interest, the court resolved the issue by relying on authority that predated and was disapproved by\n   <em>\n    Sandin\n   </em>\n   . Those cases, therefore, are not controlling. Specifically, in\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3950256\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/281/241/#p261\">\n    281 Conn. at 243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=914%20A.2d%201034\">\n    914 A.2d 1034\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , we rejected the petitioner's claim that he had been denied parole eligibility status on the basis of his improper classification as a violent offender, concluding that Connecticut's statutory scheme does not create a cognizable liberty interest in parole eligibility status. The court in\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   restricted its discussion, however, to state created rights decisions that the United States Supreme Court subsequently criticized in\n   <em>\n    Sandin\n   </em>\n   . Id., at 253-54,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=914%20A.2d%201034\">\n    914 A.2d 1034\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court in\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   did not discuss\n   <em>\n    Sandin\n   </em>\n   , and it does not appear that the petitioner claimed that he was stigmatized by the classification. Earlier, in\n   <em>\n    Wheway\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Warden\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"542584\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/215/418/#p431\">\n    215 Conn. at 423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=576%20A.2d%20494\">\n    576 A.2d 494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , this court addressed the question of whether an inmate's classification as a maximum security prisoner solely on the basis of a parole violation detainer implicated a protected liberty interest.\n   <em>\n    Wheway\n   </em>\n   was decided well before\n   <em>\n    Sandin\n   </em>\n   . In concluding that the prisoner had no protected liberty interest in his classification, the court in\n   <em>\n    Wheway\n   </em>\n   relied exclusively on the level of discretion enjoyed by prison officials in making the classification determination; id., at 431,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=576%20A.2d%20494\">\n    576 A.2d 494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; an approach that was subsequently criticized in\n   <em>\n    Sandin\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Sandin\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Conn\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    r\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1563880\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/472/#p477\">\n    515 U.S. at 479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1563880\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/472/#p477\">\n    115 S.Ct. 2293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   Turning to the petitioner's allegations, which we have noted must be accepted as true, we conclude that they are sufficient to allege a protected liberty interest, thus invoking the jurisdiction of the habeas court. The petitioner alleged that he was classified as a sex offender, and that he was required to participate in sex offender treatment, or risk forfeiting parole eligibility, community release, and good time credits. These allegations are precisely of the type that the majority of the courts of appeals have found to be sufficient to allege a protected liberty interest, such that a hearing now may proceed on the merits. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Coleman\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dretke\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9167312\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/395/216/\">\n    395 F.3d at 222-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The allegations are sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of the habeas court.\n   The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In this opinion the other justices concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    We granted the respondent's petition for certification to appeal, limited to the following question: \"Did the Appellate Court correctly reverse the trial court's judgment based on its determination that the trial court improperly held that it lacked jurisdiction over the petitioner's habeas petition challenging his prison classification of sexual treatment needs?\"\n    <em>\n     Anthony A.\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Commissioner of Correction\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=319%20Conn.%20934\">\n     319 Conn. 934\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=125%20A.3d%20208\">\n     125 A.3d 208\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2015).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    On appeal, the respondent now seeks to dispute the facts as alleged in the petition. For example, the respondent argues in his brief to this court that the petitioner was merely assigned a \" 'sexual needs treatment score,' \" which the respondent contends is not the equivalent of labeling the petitioner a sex offender. Even if we were not required on appeal to take the facts as alleged in the petition for purposes of determining whether the court had jurisdiction, the respondent waived this claim at the hearing on the petition. At that time, the respondent had the opportunity to contest the petitioner's allegation that he had been labeled a sex offender. The respondent failed to do so. Specifically, during the hearing, the court asked the respondent whether he had any objection to the court taking the facts from the allegations in the petition for the purpose of determining whether the petitioner had alleged a cognizable liberty interest, and the respondent answered: \"No objection, Your Honor.\" Later, the court stated: \"I'm prepared to rule on this matter and in my ruling I'm going to assume for purposes of this ruling that the factual allegations by [the petitioner] are correct, in that he has been classified as a sex offender when he was not really a sex offender.\" At that point, the respondent could have disputed the petitioner's allegation that the respondent had classified him as a sex offender, but he elected not to do so. Therefore, the respondent effectively has waived-at least for purposes of determining whether the court has jurisdiction-any disputes he may have as to the facts alleged in the petition.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    For the risk assessment, the following factors are considered: \"(1) [h]istory of escape; (2) [s]everity/violence of the current offense; (3) [h]istory of violence; (4) [l]ength of sentence; (5) [p]resence of pending charges, bond amount and/or detainers; (6) [d]iscipline history; and, (7) [s]ecurity [r]isk [g]roup membership.\" Administrative Directive 9.2 (8) (A).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    For the needs assessment, the following factors are considered: \"(1) [m]edical and health care; (2) [m]ental health care; (3) [e]ducation; (4) [v]ocational training and work skills; (5) [s]ubstance abuse treatment; (6) [s]ex offender treatment; and, (7) [c]ommunity resources.\" Administrative Directive 9.2 (8) (B).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    It appears that, on July 7, 2012, a hearing was held to determine the petitioner's classification.

That is, the record does not reveal whether the petitioner was convicted of the new charges, and, if so, whether he was sentenced to a term of incarceration and once again classified as a sex offender. It remains possible, however, that the respondent could, if the petitioner is again incarcerated, classify him as a sex offender because the previous classification establishes that he now has a prior history as an alleged sex offender.
