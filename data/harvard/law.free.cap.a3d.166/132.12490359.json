For the reasons that follow, we hold that the rule established by\n   <em>\n    Greco\n   </em>\n   applies regardless of whether the sentence was the product of a plea agreement or upon a conviction following trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    The crime, the plea agreement, and the sentencing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This case has its genesis in the 1997 armed robbery and murder of a District of Columbia policeman, Officer Oliver Smith, who was off duty at the time. The subsequent investigation quickly led the police to conclude that Respondent, Anthony Allen Crawley, and two co-actors, Antwaun Brown and Donovan Strickland, were involved in the commission of the crime. Crawley was charged with first degree felony murder and armed robbery. In exchange for his agreement to testify truthfully against Brown and Strickland, Crawley agreed to plead guilty to both charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The plea hearing was held in September 1997. At the outset of that hearing, counsel for Crawley made the following request:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"We are asking the Court to bind itself to an agreement reached between the State and the Defense that the sentence in this case would be life, which the Court would be required to impose, but that all but thirty-five years would be suspended on the felony murder charge.\" The plea agreement, which was read at the hearing, provided in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The State, the Court, and the Defendant agree that the Defendant shall be sentenced after the conclusion of the trials of codefendants Antwaun Brown and Donovan Strickland, to life suspend all but 35 years for the aforesaid felony murder charge. The underlying charge of robbery with a deadly weapon will merge, by operation of law, with the felony murder charge at sentencing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The plea agreement did not mention probation, and the court did not utter the term \"probation\" during the hearing, except in the course of a somewhat lengthy colloquy with Crawley concerning the impact that his guilty plea in the present case could have on his then-current status in the criminal justice system. Even then, the court's reference to probation was in asking Crawley whether he was \"on any kind of parole or probation at this point in time.\" Neither the State nor defense counsel referred to probation in connection with the sentence presented by the plea, and neither brought up the necessity to\n   have a period of probation attached to the suspended portion of the life sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At the conclusion of the hearing, the court declared its satisfaction that the plea was \"knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently made,\" and that defense counsel had discussed the plea in detail with Crawley and, with Crawley's consent, his family. The court then formally accepted the plea agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Sentencing took place a little more than a year later, on October 16, 1998. At the hearing, the court reiterated the agreement in imposing the sentence:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The sentence of this Court is, as to Count One, first degree felony murder, that you be sentenced to life in prison. Pursuant to the plea agreement, all but 35 years is suspended, and that sentence is to commence as of February 27th, 1997.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   As to Count Two, robbery with a deadly weapon, the sentence is that the Court rules that no sentence can be imposed because under felony murder robbery with a deadly weapon merges with Count Number One.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   No mention of probation was made by anyone at any time during the hearing. The commitment record indicates a sentence of \"life, all but 35 years suspended,\" with the box for the probation period left blank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In 2011, Crawley initiated the present challenge to the legality of his sentence. Before addressing that claim, we pause to review the then-evolving jurisprudential landscape in Maryland that bears directly on the claim he makes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Cathcart v.

Before us, Cathcart advanced an argument different from his argument in the Court of Special Appeals. We summarized the new argument this way:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Acknowledging that, in the absence of a period of probation attached to the suspended part of the sentence, there will be no occasion for the suspended part of the sentence ever to be executed and that, as a result, he will never have to serve more than ten years on that sentence, [Cathcart] complains that the effect of the sentence [for common law false imprisonment] as articulated [by the Court of Special Appeals to be ten years] and when considered together with the ten-year sentence for assault, is to preclude any parole consideration for the entire duration of the twenty years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Cathcart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3861378\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/397/320/#p327\">\n    397 Md. at 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3861378\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/397/320/#p327\">\n    916 A.2d 1008\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To that argument, we responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   We do not agree that the sentences imposed on Cathcart were in any way illegal. The sentence imposed on the assault conviction was well within the permissible statutory range, and, as we shall explain, the sentence imposed for\n   false imprisonment, despite its wording, was not a life sentence and has no attribute or collateral consequence of a life sentence. What the court has effectively done is to impose two ten-year sentences, one consecutive to the other, and there is nothing unlawful in its doing so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3861378\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/397/320/#p327\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3861378\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/397/320/#p327\">\n    at 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3861378\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/397/320/#p327\">\n    916 A.2d 1008\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Our conclusion was grounded in three sentencing principles:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \"[1] in the absence of statutory authority a court does not possess any power, after sentence has been pronounced, to suspend the execution of its judgment so as to relieve an accused, either in whole or in part, from suffering the sentence imposed\"[; 2] that, pursuant to Art.

Crawley argued that, under\n   <em>\n    Cathcart\n   </em>\n   , the omission of a period of probation rendered his sentence a fixed term-of-years sentence of 35 years.

A resentencing hearing was held on April 26, 2013. The circuit court explained that, although his \"personal druthers would be stick with the binding\n   plea agreement, [because] that's what the parties agreed to,\" he could not because the sentence was illegal.

The State maintains\n   that the circuit court, in resentencing Crawley pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-345(a), properly corrected Crawley's illegal sentence by adding the period of probation to effectuate the split sentence imposed at the original sentencing. Relying on the undisputed proposition that Crawley's original sentence was illegal pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Greco\n   </em>\n   , the State argues that, because the statutory minimum sentence for felony murder is life imprisonment, absent a provision for a period for probation, \"there would be no ability for the court ever to direct execution of the suspended part of the sentence.\" (Citation omitted). The State disagrees with Crawley's emphasis on the fact that his sentence was imposed as a result of a guilty plea. The State maintains that an illegal sentence remains illegal even if it was the product of a plea agreement. The State further argues that \"Crawley's negotiated arrangement for a split sentence of life imprisonment implicitly and necessarily contemplated a period of probation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Crawley argues, in response, that the test for determining the legality of a sentence imposed pursuant to a plea deal is based upon what a \"reasonable lay person would understand the agreement to be.\" He asserts that \"[i]t would be unreasonable to conclude ... that a lay person in [Crawley's] position would somehow know that his sentence included probation, especially in light of the fact that this Court has held that, in other circumstances, probation is not part of the sentence, if a sentencing court fails to mention 'probation.' \" (citing\n   <em>\n    Cathcart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3861378\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/397/320/#p327\">\n    397 Md. at 329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3861378\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/397/320/#p327\">\n    916 A.2d 1008\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

We do not have here an issue concerning an arguably ambiguous sentencing term of a plea agreement. What we have, instead, is a sentencing term of a plea agreement that, though agreed upon by the parties and imposed by the court, was unequivocally illegal.\n   <em>\n    Cuffley\n   </em>\n   and its progeny therefore have no application here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <em>\n    Our decision\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The principle that a substantively illegal sentence must be corrected applies regardless of whether the sentence has been negotiated and imposed as part of a binding plea agreement. Here, the negotiated split sentence to which Crawley agreed and the court imposed was the statutorily-mandated life imprisonment, with all but 35 years suspended. Because the suspended portion could not remain due to the lack of a probationary period, the sentence was converted by operation of law to an illegal term-of-years sentence, which could not stand. Crawley's sentence-unlawful as originally imposed-was properly remedied through the imposition of a period of probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <em>\n    Greco\n   </em>\n   instructs that a corrected sentence is \"limited by the maximum legal sentence that could have been imposed, with the illegality removed.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3710082\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/427/477/#p513\">\n    427 Md. at 513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3710082\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/427/477/#p513\">\n    48 A.3d 816\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The circuit court followed the dictates of\n   <em>\n    Greco\n   </em>\n   by vacating the original unlawful sentence, reimposing the mandatory life sentence with all but 35 years suspended, and adding a period of probation to the suspended portion of that sentence. In doing so, the circuit court effectively removed the illegality created by the absence of a period of probation attached to the suspended portion of the life sentence. There is no dispute that the four-year probation period satisfied constitutional standards and statutory limits.\n   <em>\n    Meyer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4366060\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/445/648/#p663\">\n    445 Md. at 670\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4366060\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/445/648/#p663\">\n    128 A.3d 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"When imposing probation conditions,\n   [a] judge is vested with very broad discretion ...
