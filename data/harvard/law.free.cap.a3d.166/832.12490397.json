We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The trial court set forth the following relevant facts and procedural history. \"[Robert] Walpuck, [doing business as the plaintiff], Stones Trail, LLC, entered into a contract to purchase the property on Ladder Hill Road in Weston ... (the property) on March 18, 1998. The property was composed of four smaller lots varying from one to two acres in size and one large lot (the Great Gate lot), with the total property aggregating about seventeen acres. The property was located in a two acre zone. Prior to closing the purchase, [the plaintiff] commissioned a title report, which was forwarded to the town. [The plaintiff] submitted three maps of the property to the town. Map # 3447 depicted the property as it had appeared since 1937, consisting of four small lots and one large lot. On September 18, 1998, Town Attorney Christopher Jarboe wrote to the code enforcement officer that the property depicted on map # 3447 was not a subdivision and should be stamped accordingly and filed on the land records. On the same day, the town engineer and [the] town code enforcement officer stamped and signed map # 3447 with a stamp reading as follows: 'The Town Engineer and Code Enforcement Office hereby attest to the fact that this plan is neither a subdivision nor a resubdivision as defined by the General Statutes of Connecticut and the Town of Weston and may be recorded without prior approval of the Weston Planning and Zoning Commission.' Approximately a week later, on September 24, 1998, map # 3448, which altered the property in that the Great Gate lot on map # 3447 was divided into two, yielding a total of six lots, was filed and stamped with the same language. Map # 3449 was also filed and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   stamped with the same language on September 24, 1998. Map # 3449 substantially altered the lots so that the four smaller lots each slightly exceeded two acres, giving the developer six potentially developable lots. Map # 3448 and map # 3449 were not stamped and filed on the Weston Land Records until roughly a week after the date of ... Jarboe's letter....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"Walpuck testified that he felt he did not need subdivision approval and that he could achieve his objective of six buildable lots by lot line adjustments. According to ... Walpuck, the procedure in Weston since 1991 was to place the aforementioned stamped language on a map when it was determined that no subdivision approval was needed. This procedure apparently was recommended by Town Counsel Harry Hefferan in 1991, who wrote, '[i]n the event a map is requested to be filed without subdivision or resubdivision action by\n   the Planning and Zoning Commission acting in its planning function, the same shall be presented by its proposed filer to the town engineer and to the code enforcement officer for their examination. If those officers determine that it is unnecessary to appear before the Planning and Zoning Commission because there is no subdivision or resubdivision as so defined, they shall so indicate on the face of the map and the town clerk may accept for filing such map.' ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"Walpuck testified that, in reliance on the review of the lots by town officials and the stamped notation on map # 3449, in October, 1998, the plaintiff completed the purchase of the property, having obtained a $1.1 million mortgage from Ridgefield Bank. The mortgage agreement included a provision allowing for the severance or release of individual lots upon payment of an allocated amount....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"Subsequently, on February 14, 2000, special counsel for the commission, Attorney Barry Hawkins, advised\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   the plaintiff's attorney by letter that he had 'determined that under applicable Connecticut law and the Weston Planning and Zoning Regulations and Subdivision By-Laws ... Walpuck must seek subdivision approval from the Weston Planning and Zoning Commission prior to dividing his properties situated at 10 Ladder Hill Road and 96 Georgetown Road in Weston ....' Hawkins explained that the plaintiff's 'extensive and aggressive lot line adjustments' appeared to be an attempt to 'circumvent compliance with [the town's] Subdivision By-Laws.' Hawkins also notified the plaintiff that he had advised the town's zoning enforcement and building officials not to issue zoning or building permits to the plaintiff, should it attempt to develop the lots. Hawkins advised the plaintiff that it should apply to the commission for subdivision approval, and that '[t]he Planning and Zoning Commission is willing to work with ... Walpuck to accomplish reasonably the safe and proper development of his properties in accordance with applicable subdivision statutes and regulations.'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"On March 22, 2000, Hawkins wrote to the town's tax assessor, advising that the lot line adjustments reflected on the recorded maps did not create additional building lots, and that, therefore, the plaintiff's property should be taxed as one parcel of land. In May, 2000, the tax assessor revised the tax assessment map so that the plaintiff's property was taxed as a single lot. This did not affect the existing lot lines, however.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"In 2002, [the plaintiff] was in default on its mortgage. The bank threatened foreclosure, and ... Walpuck sought permission to sell one of the reconfigured lots to generate cash to cure the default. However, the Ridgefield Bank refused to release any of the six lots from the plaintiff's mortgage because of, among other things, uncertainty about the legitimacy of the six lot configuration shown on map # 3449. Subsequently, the\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   bank commenced a mortgage foreclosure action against the plaintiff in February, 2002.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"Upon receiving Hawkins' letter, the plaintiff did not seek subdivision approval from the commission or appeal the position of the letter to the Zoning Board of Appeals. Instead, in 2004 and 2005, the plaintiff made requests to town attorneys Kenneth Bernhard and Patricia C. Sullivan to reconsider the town's position, based on the plaintiff's contention that the parcels did not constitute a subdivision under General Statutes \u00a7 8-18. The town attorneys rejected these requests and urged [the] plaintiff to apply for subdivision approval. Instead, [the] plaintiff commenced the present action in [November], 2005.... Walpuck testified that he did not apply for subdivision approval because it was a time-\n   consuming and expensive process, and because his lawyer told him that it might impair the collateral to his loan, or, 'since it could be viewed' as a possible admission that the lot line adjustments were invalid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"In April, 2006, subsequent to the commencement of this action, the plaintiff filed an informal, handwritten application with town Zoning Enforcement Officer Robert Turner for a certificate of zoning compliance for parcel D on map # 3449. Turner denied the application, noting that he lacked authority to grant a certificate of zoning compliance for anything other than the smaller, preexisting lot called the 'Honor Leeming Lot' on an older map of the property in its previous, nonconforming configuration. Turner further stated that the proposed lot line arrangements shown on map # 3449 'would have to be reviewed before permission can be given.' Turner continued, '[a]s has been explained to you on a number of prior occasions, the way to legitimately divide the property purported to be owned by [the plaintiff] adjacent to the Honor Leeming parcel, is by filing a subdivision application with the Planning and Zoning Commission.'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"The plaintiff appealed Turner's decision to the Zoning Board of Appeals, which upheld Turner's decision. The plaintiff then appealed to the Superior Court, which dismissed the action for lack of aggrievement because the plaintiff had lost the property to foreclosure in August, 2006. See\n   <em>\n    Stones Trail, LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Weston\n   </em>\n   , Superior Court, judicial district of Stamford-Norwalk, Docket No. CV-06-4010003-S,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%202168967\">\n    2008 WL 2168967\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (May 6, 2008) (\n   <em>\n    J. Downey, J.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"Walpuck also testified that the subsequent owner of the property in question successfully applied to the commission for subdivision approval. The subsequent owner received formal subdivision approval for four lots, which were larger than those proposed by ... Walpuck, and which allowed the construction of considerably larger houses.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The plaintiff commenced this action in November, 2005, by way of an eight count complaint. Of those eight counts, the following proceeded to trial: denial of equal protection of the law in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; denial of procedural due process in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; inverse condemnation or regulatory taking of land in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and inverse condemnation or regulatory taking of land in violation of the fifth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 11, of the state constitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff's three \u00a7 1983 claims were tried to the jury, and its federal and state constitutional claims were simultaneously tried to the court. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff on all three \u00a7 1983 counts and awarded damages to the plaintiff in the amount of $5,000,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Following trial, the court, sua sponte, raised the issue of whether the plaintiff's claims were ripe for adjudication, and thus whether it had jurisdiction over them. In\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   so doing, it explained: \"Over the course of nine and one-half years, this case has amassed an extensive procedural history. Of relevance to the present discussion are the defendant town's motions, on four separate occasions before trial, to dismiss the plaintiff's claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, arguing that [the] plaintiff had failed to apply to the commission for subdivision approval, that its claims were unripe for adjudication, and any appealed act of the town lacked finality. On each occasion, the [town's] motion was denied.

The court, however, in light of the facts developed at trial, and the Appellate Court and federal court decisions in\n   <em>\n    Lost Trail, LLC\n   </em>\n   , elected to raise and reconsider, sua sponte, the issue of the court's subject matter jurisdiction.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On June 9, 2015, the court issued a memorandum of decision, in which it set aside the jury's verdict and dismissed all of the plaintiff's claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the ground that its claims were not ripe because it had failed to obtain a final decision from the commission on its subdivision proposal. In its\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   decision, the court specifically discussed Connecticut's law requiring that a plaintiff must establish the finality of the determination made in his case before he is entitled to judicial review of his regulatory takings claim. The court then proceeded in its memorandum of decision to separately discuss the federal law requirement of ripeness, as set forth in\n   <em>\n    Williamson County Regional Planning Commission\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hamilton Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6197836\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/172/#p186\">\n    473 U.S. 172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 186,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6197836\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/172/#p186\">\n    105 S.Ct. 3108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6197836\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/172/#p186\">\n    87 L.Ed.2d 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1985), which\n   provides that a takings claim \"is not ripe until the government entity charged with implementing the regulations has reached a final decision regarding the application of the regulations to the property at issue.\" The court further noted in its discussion of the federal ripeness requirement that (1) a plaintiff is excused from obtaining a final decision if it would have been futile to pursue such a course, and (2) although the ripeness requirement discussed in\n   <em>\n    Williamson\n   </em>\n   was announced in a takings context, the requirement had been extended to equal protection and due process claims asserted in land use cases. Finally, the court discussed\n   <em>\n    Lost Trail, LLC\n   </em>\n   , and concluded that, \"[g]iven the substantial conformity of the facts between the present case and\n   <em>\n    Lost Trail, LLC\n   </em>\n   ... the legal outcome should conform as well.\" The court ultimately determined that, because the plaintiff had both \"failed to prove that a final decision was rendered by any administrative body charged with allegedly depriving [the] plaintiff of its rights,\" or \"that it would have been futile to pursue available administrative remedies,\" it was necessary to dismiss the plaintiff's claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Judgment entered in accordance with the trial court's June 9, 2015 memorandum of decision on that same date. On June 19, 2015, the plaintiff timely filed this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Subsequently, the town filed a motion for articulation, seeking clarification of the basis for the court's June\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   9, 2015 decision. Specifically, the town argued that clarification was necessary because, in the court's June 9, 2015 memorandum of decision, the court had made several references to the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine, which need not be satisfied before bringing a \u00a7 1983 claim, thereby creating an ambiguity as to whether the trial court had applied that doctrine.

Walpuck; the attempt to create additional buildable lots through the adjustment of lot lines; and the filing of maps showing the existing and proposed configuration in the summer of 1998. The Lost Trail maps received the same stamped language from town officials one month before the Stones Trail maps. The letter of February 14, 2000, from special counsel Hawkins, advising that an application to the commission for subdivision approval was required, referred to both the Lost Trail and Stones Trail properties in its 're' line, and the letter made no distinction between them.

Lost Trail asserts that in 2000 [by way of special counsel Hawkins' letter] the Town reversed this decision and now considers the four lots invalid because they lack subdivision approval from the Planning and Zoning Commission. Lost Trail argues that this reversal, coupled with specific instructions to various town officials not to issue permits until a proper subdivision application is processed, sufficiently meets the finality test in the first part of the\n   <em>\n    Williamson\n   </em>\n   decision and places this case squarely under the futility exception to the finality rule....\n   <em>\n    Lost Trail, LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Weston\n   </em>\n   , supra, 485 F.Supp.2d [at] 65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \"The court disagreed, holding that Lost Trail has failed to demonstrate that the Town has rendered a final decision as to how subdivision or zoning regulations will be applied to Lost Trail's property and whether the Town will prohibit all economically beneficial uses.

[ Id., at 65 ]. Nor does the Town's alleged prospective refusal to issue zoning or building permits until subdivision approval is obtained for the four lots demonstrate either a final decision or futility exempting Lost Trail from the final decision requirement.

Indeed, he recommended that Lost Trail apply for subdivision approval and stated that the commission was willing to work with Lost Trail to ensure the safe and proper development of the Georgetown Road property.

The trial court rejected the claim, explaining: \"The plaintiff's argument is unavailing for two reasons.... First, a vested property right is simply a term used to describe a constitutionally protectable property interest, which must be demonstrated in order to assert a takings claim. See\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Colchester\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10525373\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/863/205/#p212\">\n    863 F.2d 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 212 (2d Cir. 1988) (in the context of fourteenth amendment due process claim, employing the term vested property right interchangeably with property interest ... that was protectable under the fourteenth amendment ....).

Regardless of the merit to Lost\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Trail's legal argument, it has never been presented to the Planning and Zoning Commission for its formal consideration and thus Lost Trail has not obtained a final decision regarding the application of the zoning ordinance and subdivision regulations to its property ....\n   <em>\n    Lost Trail, LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Weston\n   </em>\n   , supra, 485 F.Supp.2d [at] 66 ].

Instead, it was conditional, with Turner refusing to issue the certificate before the plaintiff had presented its application to the commission and received subdivision approval. Turner merely referred the initial determination of the subdivision issue and the validity of the plaintiff's lots to the administrative body charged with deciding those issues. See General Statutes \u00a7 8-26 (a) (All plans for subdivisions and resubdivisions, including subdivisions and resubdivisions in existence but which were not submitted to the commission for required approval, whether or not shown on an existing map or plan or whether or not conveyances have been made of any of the property included in such subdivisions or resubdivisions, shall be submitted to the [planning and zoning] commission with an application in the form to be prescribed by it.

Indeed, none of the case law cited by the plaintiff in its brief to this court supports the plaintiff's claim. We thus agree with the trial court's thorough and well reasoned analysis of this claim. It would serve no useful purpose to discuss it further.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The plaintiff next claims that this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Lost Trail, LLC\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6767336\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/140/136/\">\n    140 Conn.App. at 136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=57%20A.3d%20905\">\n    57 A.3d 905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , was factually distinguishable from the present case, and thus that the trial court improperly relied upon it as binding precedent in this case.

The court explained, inter alia, the following\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   as it pertained to the plaintiff's futility argument: \"[W]ith regard to the plaintiff's futility argument, the Appellate Court held that Lost Trail cannot claim futility by setting up its own obstacles. Put simply, Lost Trail claims that it would have been futile to pursue step two of an administrative process, applying for zoning and building permits, because it refused to engage in step one, pursuing the opinion of the commission as to whether a subdivision had been created....\n   <em>\n    Lost Trail, LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Weston\n   </em>\n   , supra, 140 Conn.App. [at] 152 [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=57%20A.3d%20905\">\n    57 A.3d 905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ].

It is clear that the commission could have determined that Lost Trail had not created a subdivision-as it later did-or approved an application to subdivide its property, clearing the way for zoning and building permits to be issued. Thus, we reject Lost Trail's attempt to bootstrap its way to futility.... Id.\" (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) The court thus rejected the plaintiff's argument that it would have been futile to engage in the zoning process, noting that, as in\n   <em>\n    Lost Trail, LLC\n   </em>\n   , the commission granted a subdivision application relating to the property in question, in which a subsequent owner of the property was permitted to subdivide the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Here, not only did the commission not dig in its heels and refuse to grant any subdivision proposals submitted by the plaintiff, but the plaintiff was directed at every turn, by every town representative with whom it spoke about the matter, to seek approval from the commission. It never did so. The plaintiff's futility argument is further belied by Walpuck's testimony that he did not apply for subdivision approval because it was a time-consuming and expensive process and because his attorney told him that it might impair the collateral to his loan or it could be viewed as a possible admission\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   that the lot line adjustments were invalid. As aptly noted by the trial court, if the plaintiff had applied to the commission seventeen years ago, when Hawkins advised it of the invalidity of its attempt to obtain a reconfiguration of the lots on its property by filing a map showing the lot line adjustments, it might have obtained approval from the commission, and would have avoided wasting many years and significant amounts of state and municipal resources. If the commission had denied its application, it could\n   have established the jurisdictional basis for its judicial challenge that it now lacks.

In granting the town's motion for articulation, the trial court first stated its belief that the basis for its June 9, 2015 decision was clear. The court, nevertheless, issued a revised memorandum of decision to eliminate any references to the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine to avoid any ambiguity or confusion as to the basis of its decision. The plaintiff claims that in so doing, the court materially altered its decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   It is well established that \"[a]n articulation is appropriate where the trial court's decision contains some ambiguity or deficiency reasonably susceptible of clarification.... [P]roper utilization of the motion for\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   articulation serves to dispel any ... ambiguity by clarifying the factual and legal basis upon which the trial court rendered its decision, thereby sharpening the issues on appeal.... In the absence of an articulation, we are unable to determine the basis for the court's decision, and we therefore decline to review this claim.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Priest\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Edmonds\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4305102\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/295/132/#p140\">\n    295 Conn. 132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 140,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=989%20A.2d%20588\">\n    989 A.2d 588\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   At the outset of the trial court's June 9, 2015 memorandum of decision, the court specifically stated that, because the plaintiff had \"failed to prove that a final decision was rendered by any administrative body charged with allegedly depriving [the] plaintiff of its rights,\" or \"that it would have been futile to pursue available administrative remedies,\" the plaintiff's claims were not ripe for adjudication, and thus the court lacked jurisdiction over them. A review of the trial court's June 9, 2015 memorandum of decision in its entirety reveals that the court's decision focused on (1) the requirement of finality for the plaintiff's state takings claim, (2) the requirement of ripeness (and the futility exception thereto) with respect to the plaintiff's federal claims and (3) the fact that the present case was similar to\n   <em>\n    Lost Trail, LLC\n   </em>\n   , which was essentially decided by this court and the federal courts on grounds of finality and ripeness. Although the court's June 9, 2015 memorandum of decision at times mentioned the exhaustion of administrative remedies, it did so only in passing without any discussion of that doctrine or how it would apply to the present case. Thus, a fair reading of the court's June 9, 2015 memorandum of decision does not indicate that the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine formed the basis for the trial court's decision in this case. Including no reference to that doctrine in the court's October 19, 2015 memorandum of decision thus served only to dispel any confusion concerning the basis of the court's original\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   decision, which is an appropriate use of the articulation process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    As a claim against a subdivision of the state, this claim was treated as a claim under the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution. Even so, we will refer to it, as did the parties and the trial court, as a claim under the fifth amendment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    Prior to trial, the plaintiff's claim for violation of substantive due process was stricken as legally insufficient. The plaintiff's additional claims, one for a declaratory judgment and another asserting municipal estoppel, were dismissed prior to trial. Those rulings have not been challenged on appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    Because we reject all of the plaintiff's claims on appeal, we need not address the town's proposed alternative ground to affirm, which is that the plaintiff failed to seek any variances.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    See footnote 1 of this opinion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    The plaintiff also claims that \"[t]he regulatory takings claim based on the Connecticut constitution was incorrectly dismissed for lack of finality, and the state constitution does not apply to the equal protection and procedural due process claims.\" In support of this claim, the plaintiff claims to be challenging a ruling that the trial court purportedly made regarding its \"regulatory takings claim under the Connecticut constitution\" in response to the fifth motion to dismiss, which was filed by the town after the jury returned its verdict. Because the court dismissed the plaintiff's regulatory takings claim \"for lack of finality\" upon its sua sponte raising of the issue of subject matter jurisdiction, the plaintiff's claim in this regard is unfounded.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
