On appeal, the defendant claims that (1) the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction, (2) the trial court erred in refusing to set aside the guilty verdict as being against the weight of the evidence, (3) the court erred in instructing the jury on the elements of tampering with a witness, (4) the court erred in denying the defendant's request for a witness to testify, in a proffer, outside the presence of the jury, and (5) the court erred in granting the state's motion to quash the defendant's subpoena requesting information and materials related to the witness protection program. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This appeal comes before this court following extensive litigation involving the murder of Eugenio Vega, the owner of La Casa Green, a retail store on Grand Avenue in New Haven, in the early morning hours of July 4, 1993. An understanding of the facts and procedural history involving the prior litigation, as the jury reasonably could have found, is necessary in order to understand fully the issues presented in the defendant's appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On the morning of Vega's murder, Pamela Youmans went to La Casa Green to make a purchase. Vega was alive when Youmans left the store. After Youmans left but while she was still in the vicinity of La Casa Green, she tossed a coin over her shoulder and a woman with a limp picked it up.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   That same morning, Mary Boyd\n   walked by La Casa Green and observed two black males inside the store. One of the males was taller than the other. Later that morning, when Boyd went into the store to make a purchase, Vega was not there and did not respond when Boyd called him, so Boyd called 911. Boyd then took some quarters, cigarettes and food\n   stamps and left before the police arrived because she knew that there was an outstanding warrant for her arrest. When the police responded to the call, they discovered Vega, who had been shot and was deceased, with his hands tied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The New Haven Police Department questioned Doreen Stiles in the course of the investigation into Vega's murder. Stiles provided two written statements to the New Haven Police Department. In her first statement, dated July 29, 1993, Stiles described how she was in the vicinity of Vega's store on the morning of the murder when she saw a black male enter the store. Because the man frightened her, Stiles hid next door between the store and an alleyway, where she heard arguing from inside and someone asking Vega for money and to open the safe. She then heard a gunshot and saw two black males leave the store.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In her statement of July 29, 1993, Stiles identified George M. Gould as one of the individuals coming out of the store on the date of the murder. On August 2, 1993, Stiles gave a second written statement in which she identified Ronald Taylor as the other individual involved in the incident. At a probable cause hearing on October 14, 1993, Stiles testified consistently with her July 29, 1993 statement to the police. She also testified that she saw Boyd in the vicinity of the store on the morning of the murder. At the criminal trial of Gould and Taylor in January, 1995, Stiles, who testified that she had a disability in\n   her leg, identified Taylor and Gould as being present at Vega's store on the morning of his murder.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following a jury trial, Taylor and Gould were each convicted of felony murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c, robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-134(a)(2) and 53a-8, attempt to commit robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-134(a)(2), 53a-8 and 53a-49, and conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48(a) and 53a-134(a)(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Our Supreme Court affirmed the judgments of the trial court, with the exception of Taylor's conviction of attempt to commit robbery in the first degree.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gould\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"72554\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/241/1/#p24\">\n    241 Conn. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 24,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=695%20A.2d%201022\">\n    695 A.2d 1022\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2003, following their convictions, Taylor and Gould filed petitions for writs of\n   habeas corpus. At that time, Taylor was represented by Attorney Peter Tsimbidaros and Gould was represented by Attorney Joseph Visone. The defendant was assisting Tsimbidaros and Visone as a private investigator. The defendant previously had worked as an inspector with the New Haven state's attorney's office. At some point, the defendant went to see Stiles, who was in a nursing home in Manchester undergoing rehabilitation for her legs, and indicated that he was investigating Vega's murder. They spoke briefly and, upon questioning by the defendant, Stiles told the defendant that she was not present at the scene at the time of the murder.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   On December 6, 2006, Stiles\n   gave a signed statement to the defendant in which she indicated that her prior statements regarding the murder had been untrue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Following the defendant's initial meeting with Stiles at the nursing home, the defendant continued to visit Stiles approximately once a week for \"a year, maybe more.\" During those visits, the defendant came to the nursing home and checked to make sure he knew where Stiles was and kept her informed about the case. On two occasions during this period of time, the defendant drove Stiles to visit her mother. He also drove her to doctor appointments and bought her pizza and candy. On May 12, 2007, the defendant purchased a television and service plan for Stiles for a total of $204.43. He also gave Stiles money that she used to buy a stereo and told her that she might be able to obtain money in the future depending on the outcome of Taylor's and Gould's habeas trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2009, Stiles left the nursing home and moved into a motel with her husband, where she lived for approximately one year. During this time, the defendant periodically visited the motel to make sure that Stiles still lived\n   there and to tell her what was happening with the trial. When Stiles was living in the motel, the defendant took her to visit her mother. Stiles and her husband usually paid the monthly rent of $930 at the motel. There were \"a couple of months,\" however, when the defendant helped to pay the rent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   During this time, the defendant told Stiles that Taylor and Gould were trying to get a new trial, and that he did not think they were guilty of Vega's murder. According to Stiles, she and the defendant had become\n   friends and they sometimes discussed their personal lives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On August 3, 2009, Taylor's and Gould's habeas trial began. At that trial, Stiles testified that she had lied about seeing Taylor and Gould when she gave the two prior statements to the police in 1993, in her testimony at the probable cause hearing in 1993 and in her 1995 criminal trial testimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   On March 17, 2010, the habeas court,\n   <em>\n    Fuger, J.\n   </em>\n   , granted the habeas petitions, concluding that Taylor and Gould had met their burden of proof with regard to their claim of actual innocence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   On July 19, 2011, our Supreme Court reversed the judgments of the habeas court and remanded the matters for a new habeas trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Gould\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6775734\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/301/544/#p571\">\n    301 Conn. 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 571,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20A.3d%201196\">\n    22 A.3d 1196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Once the habeas trial ended, the defendant no longer visited with or spoke to Stiles. This surprised Stiles because prior to the trial, their friendship had been \"somewhat consistent\" and he had told her that he would stay in touch with her. After the habeas trial in 2009, Stiles and her husband moved from the motel to an apartment in New Haven. On July 6, 2011, Stephen Coppola, a detective with the New Haven Police Department, and Edwin Rodriguez, an inspector with the chief state's attorney's office, went to see Stiles at her apartment in New Haven to verify her address for the second habeas trial that was coming up.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   She accompanied them to the New Haven Police Department, where she indicated that the defendant had \"gotten inside [her] head\" and overwhelmed her when he talked about the trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Stiles indicated that the defendant had convinced her that her testimony in the previous trial was wrong and that she \"didn't see what she saw.\" Finally, Stiles informed Coppola and Rodriguez that the defendant had provided her with a television and stereo. On July 13, 2011, John H. Bannon, Jr., an inspector with the chief state's attorney's office, went to Stiles' apartment to talk to her regarding the\n   statements she had made to the other inspectors. While he was there, Bannon took photographs of a television and stereo. At that meeting, Stiles told Bannon that the defendant had told\n   her not to speak with the state at all and that the defendant continually was harassing and bothering her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The second habeas trial began on March 19, 2012. Because Taylor had died in 2011, the second habeas petition proceeded as to Gould only. Tsimbidaros and Visone both represented Gould at the second habeas trial. In preparation for the second habeas trial, Visone, Tsimbidaros and the defendant met with Stiles at her apartment in New Haven on April 11 or 12, 2012. As Tsimbidaros, Visone and the defendant were leaving Stiles' apartment, the defendant shook his head and said, in response to a question by Tsimbidaros, \"the places we've had to go and the things we've had to do, you don't want to know.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On May 7, 2012, prior to the conclusion of the second habeas trial, the police executed a search warrant at Stiles' apartment and recovered the television and stereo. That same date, the police arrested the defendant at his home. On May 23, 2012, Bannon served a subpoena on Stiles to testify at the second habeas trial. At that time, Stiles told Bannon that she was going to tell the truth and confirm her original trial testimony. At the second habeas trial, however, Stiles asserted her fifth amendment privilege and did not testify. On September 18, 2012, the second habeas judge,\n   <em>\n    Sferrazza, J.\n   </em>\n   , denied the second habeas petition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In this case, the defendant was initially charged with one count of bribery of a witness, in violation of \u00a7 53a-149, and two counts of tampering with a witness in violation of \u00a7 53a-151. The state subsequently filed a substitute information that added two counts of perjury in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-156. Following a jury trial in 2013, the defendant was found guilty of\n   bribery of a witness and one count of tampering with a witness.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result of his conviction, the defendant was sentenced to a total effective term of four years of incarceration. The defendant then filed the present appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The defendant first argues that the evidence was insufficient to establish his guilt of the crimes charged. With regard to the bribery charge, the defendant argues that the state failed to prove that his act of purchasing a television for Stiles on May 12, 2007 was performed with the specific intent to influence her testimony at the habeas hearing in 2009. With regard to the tampering with a witness charge, the defendant first argues that the state failed to prove that he induced or attempted to induce Stiles to testify falsely. The defendant further argues that the state failed to satisfy the \"one-witness-plus-corroboration\" standard of proof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Before considering the defendant's specific claims, we set forth the applicable standard of review. \"The two part test this court applies in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a criminal conviction is well established. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable\n   to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the jury reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174590\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/303/760/#p767\">\n    303 Conn. 760\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 767,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20A.3d%20670\">\n    36 A.3d 670\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012). \"This court cannot substitute its own judgment for that of the [finder of fact] if there is sufficient evidence to\n   support the [finder of fact's] verdict.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Andriulaitis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12488138\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/150/720/#p292\">\n    169 Conn.App. 286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 292,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12488138\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/150/720/#p292\">\n    150 A.3d 720\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We first consider the defendant's claim that the evidence was insufficient to establish that he was guilty of bribery of a witness in violation of \u00a7 53a-149. That statute provides: \"A person is guilty of bribery of a witness if he offers, confers or agrees to confer upon a witness any benefit to influence the testimony or conduct of such witness in, or in relation to, an official proceeding.\" General Statutes \u00a7 53a-149(a). To obtain a conviction under \u00a7 53a-149(a), \"[t]he state ... was required to establish the following: (1) that the defendant offered, conferred or agreed to confer a benefit, (2) to a witness, (3) with the intent of influencing the witness' testimony or conduct in relation to an official proceeding.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Brantley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12484978\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/347/#p472\">\n    164 Conn.App. 459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 472,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12484978\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/347/#p472\">\n    138 A.3d 347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=321%20Conn.%20918\">\n    321 Conn. 918\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=136%20A.3d%201276\">\n    136 A.3d 1276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). \"[I]t is unnecessary that the thing offered or given is to induce a witness to testify falsely.

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On December 6, 2006, Stiles gave a statement to the defendant recanting her initial trial testimony. On May 12, 2007, the defendant bought Stiles a television and service plan. Although Stiles' December 6, 2006 recantation predated the gift of the television by approximately five\n   months, the jury reasonably could have concluded that the defendant gave the television to Stiles with the intent to influence her testimony at the first habeas trial in 2009. Following the December 6, 2006 recantation, the defendant continued to visit Stiles over the course of the next \"year, maybe more.\" He drove her to visit her mother or to doctor appointments, bought her candy and pizza, and told her that she might be able to obtain money depending on the outcome of the first habeas trial. In addition to the television, the defendant also gave Stiles money that she used to purchase a stereo. He also helped her pay the rent when she lived\n   in a motel. During this time, the defendant told Stiles that Taylor and Gould were trying to get a new trial, and that he did not think they were guilty of Vega's murder. In discussing this case, the defendant made a comment indicating that Visone and Tsimbidaros did not want to know \"the places we've had to go and the things we've had to do ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Once the first habeas trial ended the defendant no longer visited Stiles. Stiles later told the police that the defendant had \"gotten inside [her] head\" and had convinced her that her prior testimony was wrong and that she \"didn't see what she saw.\" The defendant knew that Stiles had given different accounts as to where she was on the morning of the murder. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict, we conclude that the jury reasonably could have found that the defendant purchased the television for Stiles to ensure that she testified consistently with the December 6, 2006 recantation when she testified at the first habeas trial. We conclude, therefore, that the evidence was sufficient to convict the defendant on the charge of bribery of a witness.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The defendant next argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he was guilty of the charge\n   of tampering with a witness in violation of \u00a7 53a-151(a). That statute provides: \"A person is guilty of tampering with a witness if, believing that an official proceeding is pending or about to be instituted, he induces or attempts to induce a witness to testify falsely, withhold testimony, elude legal process summoning him to testify or absent himself from any official proceeding.\" General Statutes \u00a7 53a-151(a). \"[T]he witness tampering statute has two requirements: (1) the defendant believes that an official proceeding is pending or about to be instituted; and (2) the defendant induces or attempts to induce a witness to engage in the proscribed conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ortiz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=312%20Conn.%20551\">\n    312 Conn. 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 562,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=93%20A.3d%201128\">\n    93 A.3d 1128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"The language of \u00a7 53a-151 plainly warns potential perpetrators that the statute applies to\n   <em>\n    any conduct\n   </em>\n   that is intended to\n   <em>\n    prompt a witness\n   </em>\n   to testify falsely ... in an official proceeding that the perpetrator believes to be pending or imminent\n   ....

The defendant argues that he believes that Stiles lied in 1993 and 1995, when she inculpated Gould and Taylor, and that she told the truth in 2006, 2009 and 2013, when she exculpated Gould and Taylor. Absent evidence that Stiles was truthful in 1993 and 1995, the defendant argues that the jury could not reasonably have concluded that the defendant specifically intended and induced her to testify falsely in 2009. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The jury was presented with the following evidence from which it reasonably could have concluded that Stiles testified truthfully in 1993 and 1995, and that the defendant induced Stiles to testify falsely in 2009. Following Vega's murder in 1993, Stiles gave two written statements to the police in which she stated that she was in the vicinity of the store at the time of the murder, and she identified Gould and Taylor as the individuals involved in the incident. She testified consistently with these statements at the probable cause hearing in 1993 and the criminal trial in 1995. Youmans testified that she saw a woman with a limp in the vicinity of the store on the morning of the murder. Stiles testified at the criminal trial in 1995 that she has a disability in her leg and cannot move quickly. After Gould and Taylor were convicted in 1995, the defendant, who previously had worked with the New Haven state's attorney's office, visited Stiles in his capacity as an investigator for Visone and Tsimbidaros, the attorneys for Gould and Taylor in the first habeas action. After a very brief conversation, the defendant stated: \"[Y]ou really weren't there, were you?\" In response to this question, Stiles responded that she was not there and gave a signed statement indicating that her prior statements\n   were untrue. The defendant then followed up with weekly visits to Stiles in which he would give her gifts and drive her to different locations. He also told her that she might be able to obtain money in the future if Gould and Taylor were successful in the habeas trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   On\n   the basis of this evidence, the jury reasonably could have concluded that the defendant induced or attempted to induce Stiles to testify falsely at an official proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In the second part of his claim that the evidence was insufficient with regard to his conviction of tampering with a witness, the defendant argues that a conviction of tampering with a witness requires the same degree of proof as that necessary to support a perjury conviction, i.e., the \"one-witness-plus-corroboration\" rule, and in this case, the evidence did not satisfy that standard.

The defendant points out that the state offered into evidence Stiles' initial statement to the police, dated July 29, 1993, a redacted transcript of Stiles' October 14, 1993 testimony at the hearing in probable cause and a redacted transcript of her January 19, 1995 criminal trial testimony. The state also provided a three and one-half hour videotape of Stiles' criminal trial testimony. The transcription of Stiles' initial recantation on December 6, 2006, however, was marked as an exhibit for identification only, and Stiles' 2009 habeas trial testimony never was placed into evidence.

In support of this claim, the defendant argues that the trial became \"a trial within a trial within\n   a trial ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) On the contrary, a central question before the jury was whether it should credit Stiles' recantation of her original testimony and statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Stiles' 2006 statement was marked as a defense exhibit for identification. The defendant did not seek to have this statement admitted as a full exhibit during Stiles' testimony; he did, however, cross-examine John M.

Specifically, the court charged that Stiles' 1993 statement to the police, her 1993 testimony at the hearing in probable cause and her 1995 criminal trial testimony could be considered for credibility and substantive purposes; her statement to the police in 2011 recanting the previous recantation that she made to the defendant in 2006\n   could be considered only for credibility purposes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"The jury [is] presumed to follow the court's directions in the absence of a clear indication to the contrary.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Fernandez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489032\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/153/53/#p870\">\n    169 Conn.App. 855\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 870,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489032\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/153/53/#p870\">\n    153 A.3d 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). The record reflects that the court marked the jury charge as an exhibit and provided that exhibit to the jury for its use during deliberations. We note that during its deliberations, the jury did not send any notes to the court indicating that it was confused by this charge. The only notes from the jury pertained to evidence of audiotapes alleged to have been made of Youmans.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On the basis of the foregoing, we cannot conclude that the court abused its discretion in denying the defendant's motion to set aside the verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The defendant next argues that the court, when instructing the jury regarding the elements of tampering\n   with a witness, erred in failing to instruct the jury regarding the \"one-witness-plus-corroboration\" rule adopted for perjury prosecutions in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sanchez\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"501469\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/204/472/#p477\">\n    204 Conn. at 472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=528%20A.2d%20373\">\n    528 A.2d 373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . According to the defendant, whether the corroboration rule is viewed as an \"element\" of the crime or as the \"quantum of evidence\" required to prove falsity, the failure to give the instruction had the same harmful effect and clearly contributed to the verdict. The defendant concedes that this instructional claim was not preserved at trial, but requests that we consider it pursuant to the plain error doctrine; Practice Book \u00a7 60-5 ; or our supervisory authority over the administration of justice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conclude, in accordance with our discussion of the \"one-witness-plus-corroboration\" rule in the defendant's sufficiency of the evidence claim, that the defendant cannot prevail on this related instructional claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The court properly charged the jury regarding the elements of tampering with a witness. The court further\n   instructed that \"[i]f you think a witness has deliberately testified falsely, you should carefully consider whether you should rely on ... any part of that witness' testimony.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   As\n   we stated in part I B of this opinion, even if we assume that the \"one-witness-plus-corroboration\" rule applies to this case, the state presented sufficient evidence of corroboration for the jury reasonably to conclude that the defendant induced or attempted to induce Stiles to testify falsely at the first habeas trial. As pointed out by the state, evidence of the defendant's intent to induce Stiles' false testimony came from multiple sources, all of which corroborated each other. In particular, the defendant's statement indicating that Visone and Tsimbidaros did not want to know \"the places we've had to go and the things we've had to do\" regarding this case provides corroboration that the defendant was attempting to induce Stiles to testify falsely at the first habeas trial. Accordingly, we conclude that the court's failure to charge the jury regarding the \"one-witness-plus-corroboration\" rule was not plain error requiring reversal of the judgment. This is not a case in which \"the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Jamison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=320%20Conn.%20589\">\n    320 Conn. 589\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 595-96,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=134%20A.3d%20560\">\n    134 A.3d 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016).

According to the defendant, the denial of that request allowed the\n   prosecution to elicit, in the presence of the jury, Stiles' invocation of the fifth amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of this claim. On the second day of trial, the state indicated its intent to interrupt Bannon's testimony in order to call Stiles to the witness stand. The defendant objected and, during the discussion that followed, argued that the state did not know what the substance of Stiles' testimony would be.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thereafter, the state interrupted Bannon's testimony to call Stiles. Outside the presence of the jury, the defendant argued that Stiles had \"an unusual relationship with the truth and may or may not recall things the same way twice from moment to moment ....\" The defendant understood, however, that it was Stiles' \"present intent ... to take the [witness] stand and testify that the truth is what she said in 2009 ... and that her testimony in [1995] was untruthful.\" The defendant argued that the state was offering Stiles' testimony solely for the purpose of thereafter impeaching her with a prior inconsistent statement under\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Whelan\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"559597\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/200/743/#p753\">\n    200 Conn. at 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=513%20A.2d%2086\">\n    513 A.2d 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which was improper. The defendant renewed his claim that the state did not know what Stiles was going to say, but argued that it \"[doesn't] matter what she says. The state simply wants her up there as a warm pulse, which will either agree with them in its theory of this case or disagree, in which case it will seek to offer her prior inconsistent testimony.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The defendant noted that the state was prepared to immunize Stiles and asked the court to advise Stiles\n   with regard to her fifth amendment rights. The court declined to do so, noting that Stiles had her own attorney who was present in court, and had counsel when she invoked the fifth amendment in the second habeas trial. The defendant then asked that Stiles \"testify ... by way of proffer outside the jury's presence\" because the state did not know what she was going to say and could not offer her testimony solely for the purpose of impeaching her. The court responded by noting that Stiles had testified inconsistently in the prior proceedings, making it difficult to have \"great confidence\" in the substance of Stiles' testimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant then moved for a mistrial, arguing that the state had \"made no proffer, nor can [it] make a proffer of what this witness will say ....\" During the ensuing discussion, the court \"anticipated that [Stiles was] going to take the fifth amendment when she [took] the witness stand ... and be granted immunity and only then testify, and she's testified in a contradictory fashion on previous occasions.\" The state subsequently declined to make a proffer, noting that the defense was \"not entitled to a preview of each witness\" and that Stiles had been \"so contaminated, so tampered with, bribed, pushed by this defendant, that's why we're bringing these charges.\" Ultimately, the court denied the motion for a mistrial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   William Paetzold, Stiles' attorney, then introduced himself and represented that Stiles was going to assert\n   her fifth amendment right. Paetzold inquired about what procedure would be followed for her to do so, and the court instructed that it needed to be done in the presence of the jury and in response to specific questions. There was no objection to that procedure. The parties agreed that Paetzold could stand behind Stiles, who was in a wheelchair, until the fifth amendment issues were resolved. In the presence of the jury, the state then called Stiles as a witness. After some preliminary questions, the prosecutor asked Stiles to explain \"how it was that [she] personally became involved in the criminal investigation [pertaining to] Mr. Vega.\" At that point, Paetzold interrupted and stated that he was advising Stiles to invoke her fifth amendment right concerning the specifics of her involvement in the case. The court asked Stiles if she was invoking her fifth amendment right and Stiles answered affirmatively. The prosecutor then immunized Stiles pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-47a(1). The defendant inquired whether the immunity pertained to federal as well as state prosecution. After addressing the defendant's concern, the court noted that Stiles had counsel, and, as the defendant was not making an objection, the state could proceed. The state finished its direct examination, and the defendant cross-examined Stiles without Stiles invoking her fifth amendment right again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   According to the defendant, the court committed evidentiary trial error when it\n   refused his request to have Stiles testify, initially, by way of a proffer outside the jury's presence. The defendant argues that this ruling allowed the state to strengthen its case by means of an inference arising from Stiles' invocation of the privilege in the jury's presence. The state counters that the defendant's unpreserved evidentiary claim should not be reviewed. If reviewed, the state argues, that the defendant cannot prevail because allowing this testimony was neither erroneous nor harmful. We will review this\n   claim but agree with the state that the defendant cannot prevail on the merits of this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   We initially note that the defendant's claim that the court improperly allowed Stiles to invoke her fifth amendment privilege in the presence of the jury is a claim of evidentiary trial error.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dennison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"544949\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/220/652/#p661\">\n    220 Conn. 652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 661,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=600%20A.2d%201343\">\n    600 A.2d 1343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991). Thus, \"the claim is reviewable under the standard of harmless error applicable to nonconstitutional claims ... and the defendant bears the burden of establishing that the trial court's erroneous ruling was harmful to him in that it probably affected the outcome of the trial.\" (Citation omitted.)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=600%20A.2d%201343\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   According to the state, the defendant argued at trial that the court should have granted his request for a testimonial proffer to determine which version of Stiles' prior testimony she was going to set forth; on appeal, however, he argues that it was to prevent Stiles from invoking her fifth amendment right in the presence of the jury. Because the articulated basis for the request at trial differs from the argument raised on appeal, the state argues that we should decline to review this claim. Although \"we will not review a claim unless it was distinctly raised at trial ... we may ... review legal arguments that differ from those raised before the trial court if they are subsumed within or intertwined with arguments related to the legal claim raised at trial.\" (Citations omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5768135\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/294/165/#p203\">\n    294 Conn. 165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 203,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=982%20A.2d%20620\">\n    982 A.2d 620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). In the present case, although the specific argument in support of the defendant's request for a proffer differs from the argument raised at trial, we conclude that we may review it, as it is subsumed within or intertwined with the claim raised in the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Turning to the merits of this claim, \"[i]t is widely held that it is improper to permit a witness to claim\n   a testimonial privilege in front of the jury where the witness's intention not to testify is known beforehand.... Our appellate courts follow that general rule. Our Supreme Court has stated [that] ... [i]t is firmly established that [n]either [the state nor the defendant] has the right to benefit from any inferences the jury may draw simply from the witness' assertion of the privilege either alone or in conjunction with questions that have been put to him.... The rule is grounded not only in the constitutional notion that guilt may not be inferred from the exercise of the Fifth Amendment privilege but also in the danger that a witness's invoking the Fifth Amendment in the presence of the jury will have a disproportionate impact on their deliberations. The jury may think it high courtroom drama of probative significance when a witness takes the Fifth. In reality the probative value of the event is almost entirely undercut by the absence of any requirement that the witness justify his fear of incrimination and by the fact that it is a form of evidence not subject to cross-examination.... Accordingly, we have held that a witness may not be called to the stand in the presence of the jury merely for the purpose of invoking his privilege against self-incrimination.... Such testimony is not relevant, and could\n   be prejudicial.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Iverson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1063778\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/48/168/#p173\">\n    48 Conn.App. 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 173-74,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=708%20A.2d%20615\">\n    708 A.2d 615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"104203,104254,104087\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/244/930/\">\n    244 Conn. 930\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=711%20A.2d%20728\">\n    711 A.2d 728\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \"In\n   <em>\n    Namet\n   </em>\n   [v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11717069\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/179/#p186\">\n    373 U.S. 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 186-87,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11717069\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/179/#p186\">\n    83 S.Ct. 1151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11717069\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/179/#p186\">\n    10 L.

According to the defendant, this is a strong indication that the state wanted the jury to see Stiles invoke the privilege before she was given immunity. The record, however, reveals that the parties and the court assumed that Stiles would invoke the privilege, and that the state would immunize her. The state objected to the defendant's request for a proffer on the ground that the defendant was not entitled to \"a preview of each witness ....\" The state did not attempt to build its case out of inferences arising from the privilege, and it did not advocate for Stiles to invoke the privilege in the jury's presence.

With regard to the second area set forth in\n   <em>\n    Namet\n   </em>\n   , we note that after Stiles invoked her fifth amendment privilege and received immunity, she continued her testimony, and the defendant had the opportunity for cross-examination.

On the contrary, the jury had already heard evidence indicating that Stiles had given conflicting testimony\n   on prior occasions and that she had invoked the fifth amendment privilege in the second habeas trial. We likewise disagree with the defendant's contention that the invocation permitted the jury to infer that there was a direct connection between Stiles' possible criminal conduct and the defendant's possible criminal conduct. Contrary to the defendant's claim, the jury reasonably could infer that Stiles, who was represented by counsel, invoked the privilege to protect herself from criminal prosecution and not because she was connected to the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Accordingly, because the defendant has not established that the trial court committed evidentiary error, he cannot prevail on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   V\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The defendant's final claim is that the court erred in quashing the defense subpoena for information and\n   materials related to the witness protection program. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The following facts are necessary for the resolution of this claim. Prior to the commencement of trial, the defendant filed a subpoena, directed to the Office of the Chief State's Attorney, asking for \"[r]ecords of the Witness Protection Program; including number of witness[es] who applied to Program, number of witnesses admitted; terms of acceptance; cost of each witnesses' participation; moneys paid to or on behalf of witnesses; whether any such witnesses or state agents were prosecuted for crimes against the administration of justice in connection with Witness Protection Program activities.\" The defendant also filed an \"omnibus motion for further discovery, selective prosecution hearing, and dismissal.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   The state filed a motion to quash the subpoena on the grounds that it was overly broad, sought documents that were not relevant, and sought to compel the production of documents that included privileged and sensitive information. The defendant filed an objection to the state's motion to quash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   On September 18, 2013, the court heard arguments on the defendant's omnibus motion and the state's motion to quash. The defendant argued that the prosecution of the defendant reflected \"a vindictive reaction by the state to a defense team that embarrassed the state\" and contended that what the defense team did was not \"materially different\" from what the state does in the witness protection program, yet the defendant\n   was being prosecuted for his conduct. The defendant argued that he wanted all records of the witness protection program and indicated that he did not see a security issue, as the court could order him not to disclose the information that he received to anyone.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response, the state argued that because every person accepted into the witness protection program\n   was different, there was no \"certain threshold or certain type of blanket form that is filled out and submitted in order for someone to be accepted.\" Instead, these cases are handled on a case-by-case basis considering \"what the situation is, what the danger is, what types of resources these individuals have that they can continue to rely on if, in fact, they're accepted into the program.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   At the conclusion of the hearing, the court denied the defendant's omnibus motion in its entirety, granted the state's motion to quash, and overruled the defendant's objection to the state's motion to quash. In its ruling, the court first concluded that the evidence presented by the defendant did not justify an evidentiary hearing on the selective prosecution claim, and, since the threshold for an evidentiary hearing was not satisfied, the claim of selective prosecution also failed on\n   the merits. In rejecting the defendant's claim that he had been singled out, the court disagreed with his attempt to analogize the present case to the witness protection program.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court further found that the \"defendant's unsupported assertions [did] not suffice to demonstrate that the defendant [was] the victim of invidious discrimination based on impermissible considerations.\" With regard to the motion to quash, the court concluded that the information sought fell within the \"prosecutorial privilege\" and that, given the purpose of the witness protection program, i.e., the protection of witnesses, and the court's reasoning in addressing the selective prosecution claim, the defendant had failed to demonstrate good cause for the release of the requested information. See Practice Book \u00a7 40-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   On appeal, the defendant argues that the court erred in quashing the subpoena, thereby impairing his state and federal constitutional rights to present a defense, including a selective prosecution claim.

The court declined to provide the notepads and pens at that stage of the proceedings.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"25\">\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    The defendant initially requested that we review this claim pursuant to\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Golding\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"566558\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/213/233/#p239\">\n     213 Conn. at 239-40\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=567%20A.2d%20823\">\n     567 A.2d 823\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , the plain error rule; Practice Book \u00a7 60-5 ; and our supervisory authority over the administration of justice.

Although not reviewable under\n    <em>\n     Golding\n    </em>\n    , the defendant's claim is still subject to the plain error doctrine, as a\n    <em>\n     Kitchens\n    </em>\n    waiver does not foreclose claims of plain error.
