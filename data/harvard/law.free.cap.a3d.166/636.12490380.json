On appeal, the defendant claims that the court abused its discretion in (1) awarding attorney's fees based on its conclusion that his claims in a prior appeal were entirely without color and that he acted in bad faith, and (2) finding that an award of $30,000 in attorney's fees was reasonable under the circumstances of this case. We agree with the defendant's first claim that the court abused its discretion in awarding attorney's fees. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment awarding the plaintiff $30,000 in attorney's fees and remand the\n   matter for a determination of whether the defendant's claims in his previous appeal were entirely without color.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural posture, as outlined in\n   <em>\n    Lederle\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Spivey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=151%20Conn.%20App.%20813\">\n    151 Conn.App. 813\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 814-16,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20A.3d%201259\">\n    96 A.3d 1259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=314%20Conn.%20932\">\n    314 Conn. 932\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=102%20A.3d%2084\">\n    102 A.3d 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014), are relevant to our resolution of this appeal. \"The parties were married in Darien on December 31, 1998. One child was born of the marriage in 2000. Thereafter, the marriage broke down irretrievably, and, in March, 2005, the plaintiff commenced an action seeking to dissolve the marriage. On May 2, 2007, the court,\n   <em>\n    Abery-Wetstone, J.\n   </em>\n   , rendered a judgment of dissolution. As part of this decision, the court acknowledged the plaintiff's claim that she needed to move to Virginia in order to remain competitive in her employment with Lexmark, and found that it was in the best interest of the child to relocate with her to Virginia. The defendant appealed from the judgment, arguing, inter alia, that the court improperly permitted the plaintiff to relocate with their minor child to Virginia.

As the court explained, depending upon the decision, further evidentiary hearing and/or appeals might be necessary....

Although the trial court's memorandum of decision did discuss the defendant's knowledge of a factual stipulation pertaining to the \"but for\" legal issue of fraud in the underlying motion to open, this finding appears to relate to its determination on bad faith and not its determination on colorability.

Therefore, a new hearing is required at which the trial court must apply the proper standard applicable to a party as set forth in\n   <em>\n    Maris\n   </em>\n   , and its factual findings thereon must be made with a high degree of specificity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings on the plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees in accordance with the preceding paragraph.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"*\">\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    The listing of judges reflects their seniority status on this court as of the date of oral argument.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    We note that the defendant further argued that the trial court's conclusion was based on its clearly erroneous finding that the parties entered into a factual stipulation as to their respective positions on the motion to open, on which it relied in denying that motion.

The trial court summarized its finding that the defendant's conduct of maintaining the previous appeal was in bad faith by stating: \"At the very least, the defendant and his appellate counsel perpetuated an appeal knowing that counsel, the court, and the clients had agreed to proceed in a particular way. Nevertheless, in a bad faith and disingenuous way, the defendant and appellate counsel ... proceeded with an appeal that was wholly lacking a factual and legal basis.\" In reviewing this finding of bad faith under the clearly erroneous standard of review, we are convinced that the trial court's finding is sufficiently supported with a high degree of specificity in its memorandum of decision.

Therefore, contrary to the defendant's assertion, we conclude that the trial court's finding of bad faith was not clearly erroneous under the circumstances of this case.
