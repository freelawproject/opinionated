Plaintiff in this wrongful-death action appeals from a trial court judgment dismissing her complaint as untimely. Plaintiff contends the trial court erred in: (1) denying her motion to amend the complaint to include a certificate of merit; (2) declining to treat the motion to amend as a petition to extend the statute of limitations; and (3) dismissing a claim for personal injuries incurred during the decedent's lifetime. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. As this appeal is from dismissal of a complaint, we assume all well-pled allegations to be true.\n   <em>\n    Richards v. Town of Norwich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"174368\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/169/44/#p48\">\n    169 Vt. 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 48-49,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"174368,11587166\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/726/81/\">\n    726 A.2d 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 85 (1999). On May 18, 2013, plaintiff's adult daughter died from a lethal combination of prescription and nonprescription drugs. On May 15, 2015, three days before the expiration of the two-year statute of limitation for wrongful-death actions, plaintiff filed a complaint against her daughter's treating physician and his employer alleging that the physician had negligently prescribed multiple doses of sedatives and opiates which, taken in combination, caused her death. Service of the complaint was complete on June 18, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3. In July 2015, defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to file a certificate of merit, as required by statute. The statute in question provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   (a) No civil action shall be filed to recover damages resulting from personal injury or wrongful death occurring on or after February 1, 2013, in which it is alleged that such injury or death resulted from the negligence of a health care provider,\n   <em>\n    unless the attorney or party\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    filing the action files a certificate of merit simultaneously with the\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    filing of the complaint\n   </em>\n   . In the certificate of merit, the attorney or party shall certify that he or she has consulted with a health care provider qualified pursuant to the requirements of Rule 702 of the Vermont Rules of Evidence and any other applicable standard, and that, based on the information reasonably available at the time the opinion is rendered, the health care provider has:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   (1) described the applicable standard of care;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (2) indicated that based on reasonably available evidence, there is a reasonable likelihood that the plaintiff will be able to show that the defendant failed to meet that standard of care; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (3) indicated that there is a reasonable likelihood that the plaintiff will be able to show that the defendant's failure to meet the standard of care caused the plaintiff's injury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   12 V.S.A. \u00a7 1042(a) (emphasis added). The statute provides further that \"failure to file the certificate of merit as required by this section shall be grounds for dismissal of the action without prejudice, except in the rare instances in which a court determines that expert testimony is not required to establish a case for medical malpractice.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"174368,11587166\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/726/81/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1042(e). There is also a savings clause in the statute for claims that may expire before acquiring the necessary expert opinion: \"Upon petition to the clerk of the court where the civil action will be filed, an automatic 90-day extension of the statute of limitations shall be granted to allow the reasonable inquiry required by this section.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"174368,11587166\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/726/81/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1042(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 4. In their motion to dismiss, defendants asserted that plaintiff had failed to \"file a certificate of merit simultaneously with the filing of the complaint,\" as required by \u00a7 1042(a) ; that plaintiff had not alleged that the complaint fell within the \"rare\" category of cases in which expert testimony is not required, under \u00a7 1042(e) ; that plaintiff could not request a \"90-day extension of the statute of limitations\" under \u00a7 1042(d) because the statute had already expired; and therefore, that defendants had established the requisite \"grounds for dismissal\" under \u00a7 1042(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 5. In opposing the motion, plaintiff conceded that her attorney had not filed a separate certificate of merit but asserted that the \"complaint itself incorporate[d]\" the statutory requirements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff relied, in this regard, on the complaint's allegations that defendants had breached professional standards of care resulting in decedent's demise; that plaintiff's counsel had signed the complaint, implicitly verifying that there was evidentiary support for the allegations; and that plaintiff's counsel had already provided defendants' counsel with a copy of her expert's preliminary opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 6. Plaintiff also filed a motion to amend the complaint to add a certificate of merit. Plaintiff claimed an absolute right to amend under\n   Vermont Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and argued that the amendment containing the certificate should \"relate back to the time of the filing of the original complaint\" for purposes of compliance with the statute of limitation. Defendants opposed the motion, maintaining that the filing of a complaint without a certificate of merit was insufficient to toll the statute of limitations, and that granting the motion to amend would defeat the statutory purpose of eliminating meritless complaints before subjecting defendants to the time, expense, stigma, and anxiety of unwarranted litigation. In addition to the issues raised by the parties, the court requested briefing on whether it could \"treat the motion to amend as the equivalent of a request for a 90-day extension\" under the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 7. The trial court heard argument on the motions in November 2015 and issued a written ruling later that month. The court initially rejected plaintiff's claim that the complaint itself had effectively \"incorporated\" the certificate of merit requirements, observing that, even if it could be considered the equivalent of a certificate, the complaint did not describe the applicable standard of care or even allege that a qualified medical professional had been consulted. The court also ruled that the \"one-page preliminary report\" provided to defendants lacked the specific statutory elements required of a certificate of merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 8. As to plaintiff's motion to amend, the court concluded that Rule 15 was inapplicable because plaintiff was not seeking to add a party or claim to the complaint that might relate back to the date of the original filing, but rather to add a certificate \"entirely independent of the complaint itself.\" The court also agreed with defendants that routinely permitting plaintiffs to amend a complaint unsupported by the requisite certificate of merit would defeat the statute's purpose by subjecting defendants \"to the burden of hiring a lawyer, filing an answer, having a publicly available court case pending against him or her, and undergoing the stress of being the subject of a lawsuit\" with no assurance of its merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 9. Nor, finally, was the court willing to consider the motion to amend as the equivalent of a ninety-day extension request under \u00a7 1042(d) because the statute plainly required that the request be filed\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   filing the complaint, not after. This was evident, the court reasoned, from the plain language of the statute, which requires that the ninety-day extension request be filed with the clerk of the court \"where the civil action\n   <em>\n    will\n   </em>\n   be filed.\" 12 V.S.A. \u00a7 1042(d) (emphasis added). In short, the court concluded that, although the Legislature could have provided otherwise as other states had done, our statute plainly required the filing of a certificate of merit \"simultaneously\" with the filing of a complaint; that plaintiff failed to comply with this requirement; and that dismissal was therefore warranted. Because the statute of limitations had expired, the court dismissed the complaint with prejudice and entered judgment for defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 10. Plaintiff subsequently moved for reconsideration, raising an additional argument. Plaintiff claimed that a certificate of merit was not required in this case because her complaint included a \"survival action\" for personal injuries suffered by the decedent\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the statutory start\n   date of February 1, 2013. See\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"174368,11587166\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/726/81/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1042(a) (requiring simultaneous filing of certificate of merit with complaint in any medical malpractice action \"to recover damages resulting from personal injury or wrongful death\n   <em>\n    occurring on or after February 1, 2013\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis added)). The trial court denied the motion, finding that \"[t]he only harm alleged in the complaint is the death,\" and that \"there are no allegations of injury prior to that date.\" This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 11. Plaintiff first renews her belated claim that a certificate of merit was not required because the complaint sought recovery for injuries suffered by the decedent before February 1, 2013.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court correctly rejected the argument. As noted, plaintiff's complaint alleged, in relevant part, that decedent \"was drugged to death\" as a result of defendants' negligence \"in prescribing large quantities of both sedatives and opiates\" and other drugs. Under the caption \"Legal Claims,\" the complaint alleged:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   33. As a direct and proximate consequence of [defendant's] negligence, the Decedent died.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   34. The Decedent and her Estate have suffered damages as a result.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   35. The institution of this action by the Plaintiff against Defendants ...\n   <em>\n    is for the purpose of recovering all the damages\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    available to the heirs of Plaintiff's Decedent resulting from her death\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    pursuant to 14 V.S.A. \u00a7 1492\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (Emphasis added.) Title 14, \u00a7 1492 codifies the right of action by a decedent's estate to recover for the wrongful death of the decedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 12. As these allegations make clear, the only injury alleged in the complaint was the decedent's death, which occurred after the operative date of the certificate-of-merit requirement, and the only basis for recovery alleged was the wrongful death statute. Although plaintiff asserts that her general claim to have \"suffered damages\" somehow \"stated a claim for personal injuries,\" the context shows unmistakably that the only harm alleged was the decedent's death. Plaintiff also cites an allegation in the complaint's recitation of facts to the effect that decedent \"had a history of addiction to prescription drugs and an accidental overdose requiring hospitalization in May 2012.\" There was no allegation, however, that this overdose was caused by defendants' negligence or suggestion anywhere in the complaint that plaintiff was seeking recovery for any resulting personal injuries suffered by decedent. Even applying the \"exceedingly low threshold\" for withstanding a motion to dismiss,\n   <em>\n    Prive v. Vt. As\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    b\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    estos Grp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3697945\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/187/280/\">\n    2010 VT 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3697945\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/187/280/\">\n    187 Vt. 280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3697945\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/187/280/\">\n    992 A.2d 1035\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation omitted), nothing in this factual allegation would support a reasonable inference or provide the requisite \"fair notice\" that plaintiff was seeking to recover for personal injuries incurred prior to February 1, 2013.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15 (quotation omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 13. Plaintiff next contends the trial court erred in failing to grant her motion to amend the complaint to add a certificate of merit. The claim turns on the meaning of the certificate-of-merit statute. Our task, therefore, is to ascertain and implement the legislative intent. See\n   <em>\n    Tarrant\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    v. Dep't of Taxes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"174384\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/169/189/#p197\">\n    169 Vt. 189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 197,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"174384\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/169/189/#p197\">\n    733 A.2d 733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 739 (1999) (\"When interpreting a statute, our principal goal is to effectuate the intent of the Legislature.\"). In determining that intent, our principal source, at least initially, must be the language of the statute itself. \"Initially, in our attempts to ascertain legislative intent we look for guidance in the plain meaning of the words used. If legislative intent is clear, the statute must be enforced according to its terms without resorting to statutory construction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"174384\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/169/189/#p197\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   If the terms are ambiguous, however, intent may be inferred \"through consideration of the entire statute, including its subject matter, effects and consequences, as well as the reason and spirit of the law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"174384\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/169/189/#p197\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 14. As noted, the trial court denied the motion on essentially two grounds. First, it concluded that Rule 15 was simply \"inapplicable\" because plaintiff was not, strictly speaking, attempting to amend the complaint but to add a certificate of merit, a \"separate document ... entirely independent of the complaint itself.\" Although the certificate of merit certainly represents a separate and distinct statutory requirement, we are not persuaded that it is so \"entirely independent of the complaint\" itself that it is not subject to amendment in limited circumstances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The certificate-of-merit statute is not unique in requiring attachment of a separate document to a complaint. See, e.g., 12 V.S.A. \u00a7 4852 (providing that, in action for ejectment, \"[a] copy of the rental agreement, if any, and any notice to terminate the defendant's tenancy shall be attached to the complaint\"); V.R.C.P. 80.1(b)(1) (providing that, in foreclosure proceedings, \"[t]he plaintiff shall attach to the complaint copies of the original note and mortgage deed and proof of ownership thereof, including copies of all original endorsements and assignments of the note and mortgage deed\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 15. Attachments of this nature, which are expressly required by statute and thus essential to the underlying cause of action, may therefore be considered an integral part of the complaint itself and effectively merged into the pleading. Indeed, we have held that, in certain circumstances, we may consider exhibits referenced in the complaint and \"attached to the complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    Wilbur v. Univ. of Vt.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4662178\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/129/33/#p42\">\n    129 Vt. 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 42,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4662178\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/129/33/#p42\">\n    270 A.2d 889\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 895 (1970). Moreover, in determining the sufficiency of a complaint, we may consider the \"facts, reasonable factual inferences, and legal bases for recovery alleged in the complaint,\n   <em>\n    attachments thereto\n   </em>\n   , or ... matters the court may judicially notice.\"\n   <em>\n    Gilman v. Maine Mut. Fire Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2196302\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/175/554/\">\n    2003 VT 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 20,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2196302\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/175/554/\">\n    175 Vt. 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2196302\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/175/554/\">\n    830 A.2d 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (mem.) (emphasis added); see also\n   <em>\n    Roth v. Jennings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3484671\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/489/499/#p509\">\n    489 F.3d 499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 509 (2d Cir. 2007) (observing that, in certain circumstances, \"[d]ocuments that are attached to the complaint or incorporated in it by reference are\n   deemed part of the pleading and may be considered.\"). Accordingly, we conclude that where, as here, a document is required by statute to be attached to the complaint and forms an essential predicate to the underlying action, it may be considered a part of the complaint for purposes of amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 16. Apart from this procedural issue, however, the question remains whether-consistent with the legislative intent-a medical malpractice complaint may be amended to supply a certificate of merit wholly omitted when the complaint was filed. As noted, the statute requires the filing of a certificate of merit \"simultaneously with the filing of the complaint.\" 12 V.S.A. \u00a7 1042(a). That much is plain. The statute says nothing directly, however, about the possibility of later amending the complaint to add the required certificate. Nevertheless, we agree with defendants that permitting such an amendment would be fundamentally inconsistent with the statutory purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 17. That purpose may be gleaned, in substantial part, from the documented legislative history. The certificate-of-merit statute was part of a broader legislative reform effort aimed at medical-malpractice litigation in Vermont. The process began, as relevant here, in 2011, when the Legislature charged the Governor's Secretary of Administration with the task of submitting to the appropriate legislative committees \"a proposal for potential improvement or reforms to the medical malpractice system for Vermont.\" 2011, No. 48, \u00a7 2(a)(7). The result was a report submitted to the Legislature in January 2012, entitled \"Medical Malpractice Reforms: Report and Proposal of the Secretary of Administration Pursuant to Act No. 48.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 18. The report explained that research had found that the principal concern expressed by health care providers was the burden of being the subject of a meritless lawsuit, and that \"eventual dismissal\" was an \"inadequate remedy\" for the associated professional and personal costs. The report noted that many states had passed laws requiring either certificates or affidavits of merit \"to screen out meritless claims at the outset\" by requiring prior consultation with a qualified expert. The report recommended, accordingly, specific legislation-set forth in an appendix-to require a certificate of merit containing each of the requirements that was ultimately enacted in 12 V.S.A. \u00a7 1042(a). The report called specifically for the filing of the certificate \"simultaneous with filing a malpractice claim, rather than after, so that the 'screening' of unsupported claims occurs before a plaintiff actually files a case against a physician.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 19. About two years after the enactment of 12 V.S.A. \u00a7 1042, the Agency of Administration submitted a follow-up report to the Legislature \"to assess the impact these medical liability laws have had on the state of medical malpractice in Vermont.\" The report observed that Vermont was now one of twenty-two states with a certificate-of-merit requirement, although it also recognized that there was substantial \"variation between states in the timing of filing the certificate of merit.\" Although some states, including Vermont, had opted to require the filing of a certificate of merit \"at the same time as the complaint,\" others had chosen to be \"more lenient on the timeframe for submission of this document.\" The report cited New Jersey, which requires that plaintiffs file an affidavit of merit within sixty days after the defendant's answer, and authorizes the court to grant an additional sixty days for good cause. While acknowledging that data on the statute's impact in Vermont were relatively scarce in view of its recent enactment, the report found that lawyers generally\n   did not find the certificate-of-merit requirement to be an added burden to what normally would be done in preparation for the filing of a medical malpractice action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 20. As the foregoing background demonstrates, the Legislature enacted the certificate-of-merit statute with a clear understanding that the purpose of the simultaneous-filing requirement was to ensure that claims against health care providers had been adequately investigated and determined to have merit by a qualified expert before they were filed. Plaintiff's \"file first, review later, and amend as necessary\" argument utterly defeats that purpose. Indeed, as the Agency of Administration report explained, the Legislature had other, more \"lenient\" statutory models to choose from that allowed a later-filed certificate but had plainly chosen the more stringent option. While it is thus tempting for this or any court to apply its own rules allowing the liberal amendment of complaints, it is essential to resist that approach where, as here, it would undermine a clear and specific legislative mandate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 21. We do not reach this conclusion, moreover, in a legal vacuum. Other states, as noted, have enacted similar statutes and addressed similar claims. Michigan, for example, provides that a plaintiff in a medical malpractice action \"shall file with the complaint an affidavit of merit\" certifying that a qualified health professional has reviewed the allegations and specifying the applicable standard of care, how it was breached, and the manner in which the breach proximately caused the injury.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20600\">\n    Mich.

There may, however, be cases where a court could reasonably determine that a plaintiff's failure to file a conforming certificate of merit does not establish \"grounds for dismissal\" under 12 V.S.A. \u00a7 1042(e). Such a case might arise, for example, where the plaintiff files a timely certificate of merit that nevertheless fails in some particular to meet the statutory requirements, and where allowing an amendment to correct the deficiency-rather than ordering dismissal-would not undermine the legislative purpose.

Finally, plaintiff asserts that even if she could not amend the complaint to supply the missing certificate of merit, the trial court should have treated the motion to amend as the equivalent of a request for a ninety-day extension of the statute of limitations under \u00a7 1042(d). As noted, that section provides that, \"[u]pon petition to the clerk of the court where the civil action will be filed, an automatic 90-day extension of the statute of limitations shall be granted to allow the reasonable inquiry required by this section.\" The trial court correctly concluded, however, that the phrase \"where the civil action\n   <em>\n    will be filed\n   </em>\n   \" plainly requires that an extension-request\n   <em>\n    precede\n   </em>\n   the filing of the complaint. This is consistent with the legislative purpose of requiring that plaintiffs conduct their investigation and obtain the requisite expert opinion before subjecting defendants to the burdens of litigation. We\n   would add, moreover, that even if \u00a7 1042(d) could be construed to authorize an extension-request after the filing of a complaint, the trial court here could not have granted a ninety-day extension of a statute of limitation that had already expired when the motion to amend was filed.

The outcome in this case is not mandated by the statutory language or its purpose. The certificate-of-merit requirement is to provide a mechanism to easily identify and dismiss baseless malpractice claims against health providers. The statute recognizes, however, that plaintiffs with legitimate claims may require extra time to comply with this requirement and provides for an automatic ninety-day extension. Plaintiff's motion to amend the complaint should have been treated as such a request and allowed to go forward. Precluding plaintiff from doing so does not forward the goal of ferreting out unmerited claims and is inconsistent with this state's preference of deciding cases on their merits and preserving the constitutional right of access to the courts. Moreover, under our liberal pleading rules, plaintiff adequately pleaded claims for injuries occurring prior to the statutory effective date that were not subject to the certificate-of-merit requirement. For these reasons, I would reverse and dissent from the majority's affirmance of the dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 29. I have two main points. First, plaintiff's motion to amend the complaint sufficiently requested to extend the limitations period for ninety days to file the certificate and under the statute plaintiff was entitled to take advantage of this automatic extension. Second, a liberal reading of the complaint demonstrates that plaintiff pleaded acts occurring before the statutory requirement went into effect and therefore the court erred in dismissing the entire case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 30.

The statute modifies general pleading requirements by requiring that in cases seeking to recover damages for personal injury or wrongful death resulting from the negligence of a health-care provider, plaintiffs must file \"a certificate of merit simultaneously with the filing of the complaint.\" 12 V.S.A. \u00a7 1042(a). The requirement is tempered by an additional provision, which states: \"Upon petition to the clerk of the court where the civil action will be filed, an automatic 90-day extension of the statute of limitations shall be granted to allow the reasonable inquiry required by this section.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1042(d). The critical question is whether this automatic extension applied in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 32. In construing this statute, the aim is to \"effectuate the intent of the Legislature.\"\n   <em>\n    Tarrant v.

To do this we apply familiar rules of construction, looking first to the language and applying the ordinary meaning of the words used.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"174384\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/169/189/#p197\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 33. The plain language used in \u00a7 1042(d) indicates that the ninety-day extension, if requested, must be given. This follows from the language used in the statute indicating that the extension \"shall be granted\" following petition to the clerk and the use of the word \"automatic.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 34. The undisputed facts indicate that if plaintiff's motion to amend the complaint is construed as a petition to extend the limitations period, such extension would have brought plaintiff's claim within the time period for filing. The decedent died on May 18, 2013, and plaintiff filed the complaint on May 15, 2015, just days before the two-year statute of limitations expired. Plaintiff failed to append a certificate of merit, which was required for at least the wrongful death claim alleged. After defendant moved to dismiss for failure to submit the certificate, on August 4, 2015, plaintiff filed a motion to amend the complaint to add the certificate and attached both an amended complaint and the required certificate. This was done within ninety days of the expiration of the statute of limitations period. Therefore, the sole question is whether plaintiff in this case properly requested the extension because if it was requested than there was no basis to deny it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 35. No procedure is set forth in the statute; it simply states that an extension must be sought by \"petition.\" Because the statute is silent, and therefore ambiguous, on this point, the requirements for such a petition must be gleaned from a \"consideration of the entire statute, including its subject matter, effects and consequences, as well as the reason and spirit of the law.\"\n   <em>\n    Tarrant\n   </em>\n   , 169 Vt. at 197,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"174384\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/169/189/#p197\">\n    733 A.2d at 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the overall purpose of the certificate requirement, as the majority has determined, is to identify unmerited claims against health care providers early in the process to avoid unnecessarily subjecting defendants to the burdens of litigation. The inclusion of the ninety-day extension also indicates, however, that the Legislature did not intend to deny parties access to the courts where there was a meritorious claim, but there had been inadequate time for an investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 36. In addition, in construing this statutory provision, we should be mindful of the Vermont Constitution, which guarantees all litigants access to the courts. Vt. Const., ch. I, art. 4 (\"Every person within this state ought to find a certain remedy ....\"). Therefore, we should construe the provisions of the statute liberally so as to not restrict this right of access.

Based on these principles, plaintiff's motion to amend the complaint was sufficient to act as a \"petition\" to extend the limitations period by ninety days. The motion essentially asked that the period for compliance with the certificate requirement be extended. Indeed, the motion was so recognizable as such a petition that the trial court immediately recognized it as such. This Court has in the past looked at the substance of a motion, not the label it is given, to construe its meaning. See\n   <em>\n    In re Towne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3994963\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/182/614/\">\n    2007 VT 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3994963\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/182/614/\">\n    182 Vt. 614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3994963\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/182/614/\">\n    938 A.2d 1205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (mem.)

Nonetheless, the majority concludes that the motion could not be construed as a petition to extend the limitations period because the majority concludes that the statute requires a petition to be filed prior to the filing of the complaint and before expiration of the limitations period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 39. Beginning with the latter point, there is nothing in the statutory language that indicates the request for an extension must be made prior to the expiration of the limitations period. The statute is totally silent on this issue. Absent an express provision otherwise, the statute should be construed bearing in mind this state's preference of deciding cases on their merits, not technicalities, and so as to not preclude access to the courts.\n   <em>\n    Colby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3693268\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/184/1/\">\n    2008 VT 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3693268\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/184/1/\">\n    184 Vt. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3693268\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/184/1/\">\n    955 A.2d 1082\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Nichols v.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hofmann\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3698322\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/188/1/\">\n    2010 VT 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3698322\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/188/1/\">\n    188 Vt. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3698322\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/188/1/\">\n    998 A.2d 1040\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasizing importance of maintaining \"open access to the courts\" and \"preference for dispositions on the merits\"). Because adding a requirement that the extension be requested prior to expiration of the limitations period would restrict access to the courts and prevent adjudication on the merits without furthering the purpose of identifying unmerited claims, no such additional requirement should be read into the statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 40. The majority further concludes that the request for an extension must be made before the complaint is filed based on the language \"will be filed\" and the overall legislative purpose of requiring that plaintiffs conduct their investigation prior to filing a complaint. This interpretation is faulty for several reasons. First, the language used is not mandatory. \"It is generally well-accepted law that a statutory time period is not mandatory unless it both expressly requires an agency or public official to act within a particular time period and specifies a consequence for failure to comply with the provision.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Mullestein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4772199\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/148/170/#p173\">\n    148 Vt. 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 173-74,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4772199\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/148/170/#p173\">\n    531 A.2d 890\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 892 (1987) (quotation and alteration omitted). Words like \"shall\" or \"must\" indicate that provisions are mandatory not directory. See\n   <em>\n    In re Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3698223\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/187/1/\">\n    2009 VT 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3698223\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/187/1/\">\n    187 Vt. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3698223\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/187/1/\">\n    989 A.2d 482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (interpreting\n   use of word \"shall\" and inclusion of remedy as indication that provision is mandatory). Under this test, the statute is directory. The statute uses \"will,\" which appears to contemplate, although not require, that the extension be sought prior to filing the complaint and there is no consequence for failure to make a petition prior to expiration of the limitations period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 41. Second, requiring that the extension be requested before the complaint is filed does not further the statutory purpose or lessen any prejudice to a defendant. In practicality, whether the plaintiff files the complaint and then seeks the extension, or seeks the extension and then files the complaint, the burden on the defendant is the same. If an extension can be sought after the limitations period has run, then it is immaterial whether the complaint is filed before the request to extend time to file the certificate. In this case, an amended complaint was filed at the same time plaintiff filed the request for the extension. Therefore, even if plaintiff had to make the request before the filing of the complaint, plaintiff did so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 42. My second overall objection to the majority's dismissal of the complaint is that, even if plaintiff did not adequately request the automatic ninety-day extension, the court erred in dismissing plaintiff's entire complaint because some allegations were outside of the statute's scope. The certificate of merit is required for personal injuries occurring on or after February 1, 2013. 12 V.S.A. \u00a7 1042(a). Plaintiff did not have to file a certificate for injuries occurring before that date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 43. This Court reviews decisions on a motion to dismiss de novo and \"will uphold a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim only if it is beyond doubt that there exist no facts or circumstances that would entitle the plaintiff to relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Birchwood Land Co. v.

We assume the facts as pleaded are true and will allow the pleading to go forward if the allegations are sufficient to state a claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4167419\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/198/420/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 44. To survive a motion to dismiss, plaintiff had to allege that defendant was negligent, failed to conform to the standard of care, and that decedent's injuries were proximately caused by that negligent conduct. See\n   <em>\n    Senesac v. Assocs. in Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2388412\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/141/310/#p313\">\n    141 Vt. 310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 313,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2388412\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/141/310/#p313\">\n    449 A.2d 900\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 902 (1982) (setting forth elements of medical malpractice action). The facts as alleged in the complaint are sufficient to state a claim for medical malpractice for injuries that occurred prior to February 1, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 45. The complaint alleged that the decedent died on May 18, 2013 so recovery for negligence related to the death certainly fell within the scope of the statute. But the complaint also alleged facts that occurred before the February 1, 2013 cut off, including: Defendant Dr. Haddock began treating decedent in August 2009; over the next four years of treatment, decedent filled at least 500 prescriptions written by Dr. Haddock; Dr. Haddock was informed by decedent's pharmacist of concerns he had with the type and quantity of drugs prescribed by Dr. Haddock for decedent; plaintiff spoke to Dr. Haddock in May 2012 asking that he refrain from prescribing so\n   many narcotics; and decedent suffered an accidental overdose and required hospitalization in May 2012. In the legal claims section, the complaint states that defendant was negligent in prescribing large quantities of sedatives and opiates, deviated from the standard of care, and as a result of Dr. Haddock's actions, decedent and her estate suffered damages. The amended complaint includes language as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   28. Dr. Haddock was negligent, breached his duty to the Decedent, and deviated from the standard of care in prescribing repeated large quantities of both sedatives and opiates in the same time frames as these combinations are very likely to produce marked mental confusion, adding to the risks of accidental overdose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   29. Dr. Haddock was negligent, breached his duty to the Decedent and deviated from the standard of care in prescribing Venlafaxine and Citalopram in overlapping time periods as they raise the risk of serotonin syndrome, a life-threatening condition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   34. The Decedent and her Estate have suffered damages as a result.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The majority reads the complaint as stating a claim for damages suffered as a result of decedent's death only, but the complaint also alleges damages for injuries decedent suffered before she died as a result of Dr. Haddock's negligent acts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 46. The complaint alleged that defendant's negligent acts began in August 2009 and continued for several years, that those actions were below the standard of care, and that as a result plaintiff suffered damages. This is sufficient under our liberal pleading requirements to make a claim that decedent suffered injuries prior to death resulting from defendant's negligent conduct.
