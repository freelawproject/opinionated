The petitioner claims that, in concluding that the petitioner's action was time barred under General Statutes \u00a7 52-282, the court improperly rejected his argument that\n   General Statutes \u00a7 52-593a saved his cause of action. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history underlie this appeal. In 2011, following a jury trial, the petitioner was convicted of murder. On August 5, 2011, the defendant was sentenced to a term of incarceration of fortyfive years. This court affirmed the judgment of conviction following the petitioner's direct appeal.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415064\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/149/816/\">\n    149 Conn.App. 816\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=89%20A.3d%20983\">\n    89 A.3d 983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=312%20Conn.%20915\">\n    312 Conn. 915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=93%20A.3d%20597\">\n    93 A.3d 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On August 6, 2014, the petitioner commenced the underlying action, a petition for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence under General Statutes \u00a7 52-270,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   against the respondent when a state marshal,\n   Charles J. Lilley, served process on the respondent. On August 28, 2014, the respondent moved to dismiss the petition on the ground that it was time barred under \u00a7 52-582\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   because it was not commenced within the three year limitation period, which began to run when the petitioner was sentenced on August 5, 2011, and ended on August 5, 2014. The petitioner objected to the motion to dismiss. First, he argued that he delivered the writ, summons, and petition to the marshal on August 5, 2014, prior to the expiration of the three year limitation period codified in \u00a7 52-582. Second, he argued that \u00a7 52-593a\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   applied because it provided a thirty day remedial period in which service may be made after such time as process has been delivered, within the statutory time limit, to a marshal. Thus, the petitioner argued, his petition should not be dismissed. As a special defense to the petition, the respondent asserted that the petition\n   was barred by \u00a7 52-582 and that \u00a7 52-593a did not save the action \"because the process was not 'personally delivered' to a state marshal pursuant to [ \u00a7 52-593a (a) ] and the state marshal in this case failed to 'endorse under oath on his return the date of delivery of the process' pursuant to \u00a7 52-593a (b).\" In his reply to the special defense, the petitioner\n   alleged that the petition was \"served in substantial conformity\" with \u00a7 52-593a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Over the course of two days, the court held a hearing on the motion to dismiss. The petitioner presented testimony from two witnesses concerning the circumstances under which process was delivered to Lilley. The first witness was Donna Peat, the office manager of the Pattis Law Firm, which represented the petitioner in connection with his petition for a new trial. The second witness was Lilley, the Connecticut state marshal who, in this matter, served process on the respondent on August 6, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   During her brief examination, Peat testified that on August 5, 2014, she faxed \"a summons and complaint\" in the present action to Lilley's office. She testified that the fax cover sheet\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   admitted into evidence reflected that the transmission was competed at 5:01 p.m. that day, but that she did not have any personal knowledge with respect to whether, on that day, Lilley personally received the documents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Peat testified that Lilley's office \"confirmed that they served it the following morning.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Lilley, referring to the fax cover sheet admitted into evidence, testified that, by means of his fax machine, he \"received\" the complaint in this matter on August 5, 2014, at 5:01 p.m. He went on to explain, however, that he did not have any independent knowledge or recollection as to whether, on that date, he received the documents at issue \"personally,\" had \"custody\" of the documents at issue, or \"physically held\" the documents at issue in his hands. Lilley testified that he served the complaint in this matter on August 6, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During argument on the motion to dismiss, the parties agreed that \u00a7 52-582 was the statute of limitations governing the case and that it began to run on August 5, 2011. The parties agreed that the issue before the court concerned the application of the savings statute, \u00a7 52-593a, and, specifically, whether, under subsection (a) of the statute, process was personally delivered to a state marshal on or before August 5, 2014. The parties disagreed, however, with respect to what constituted personal delivery. The petitioner argued that he demonstrated by the evidence presented at the hearing on the motion to dismiss that personal delivery occurred on August 5, 2014; the respondent argued that such a showing had not been made. Additionally, as it relates to the applicability of \u00a7 52-593a, the respondent argued, and the petitioner agreed, that the marshal's return did not strictly satisfy subsection (b) of the statute because it did not specify the date on which process had been delivered to the marshal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The petitioner urged the court\n   to\n   conclude that he could satisfy this requirement by means of Lilley's testimony, but acknowledged that he was unaware of any authority that supported that proposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Later, the parties submitted briefs to the court in support of their respective arguments in support of and in opposition to the respondent's motion to dismiss. The respondent made clear that he did not dispute that Peat sent process to Lilley's office via fax on August 5, 2014, and that the fax successfully arrived at Lilley's office. The respondent, however, argued that because Lilley testified that he was unable to verify that he personally received the process on August 5, 2014, the petitioner was unable to avail himself of the remedy provided by \u00a7 52-593a. The petitioner, arguing that \u00a7 52-593a applied, urged the court to conclude that the remedial nature of \u00a7 52-593a weighed in favor of a liberal interpretation of the statute. The petitioner argued that the requirement set forth in \u00a7 52-593a (b), that the officer serving process endorse the date that process was delivered to him on his return, is directory and not mandatory. Relying on the evidence presented at the hearing, the petitioner argued that the date of delivery was August 5, 2014. Additionally, the petitioner argued that the policies underlying the statute of limitations and the saving statute were satisfied because process had been delivered timely to Lilley and that he served the petition within thirty days thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In relevant part, the court summarized the following undisputed facts in its memorandum of decision: \"The petitioner was convicted of murder and sentenced on August 5, 2011. Pursuant to \u00a7 52-282, the petitioner had until August 5, 2014, to file a petition for a new trial. On that date, the office manager of the petitioner's counsel sent the writ, summons, and petition (process) by facsimile (fax) to the state marshal's office at 4:59 p.m. The marshal does not recall receiving the process\n   that day or when he received the fax. The marshal's return ... does not indicate when the marshal received the process for service. The marshal served the process on the respondent the following day, August 6, 2014.\" The court observed that, because an action is commenced on the date of service of the writ, service had not been made within the three years of the date of sentencing and, thus, service occurred outside of the applicable statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   With respect to the dispositive issue, namely, the applicability of \u00a7 52-593a, the court observed that the petitioner did not provide the court with any support for the proposition that faxing process to Lilley's office was the equivalent of personally delivering process to him. The court determined that Lilley's failure to comply with \u00a7 52-593a (b) by endorsing on the return the date that process had been delivered to him was not a fatal defect, yet this omission harmed the petitioner because it deprived the court of evidence that delivery of process to Lilley had occurred prior to the expiration of the three year statutory period. Also, the court stated that, \"[h]ere, the marshal testified that he did not know whether he personally received the process on August 5, 2014, and would be unable to comply with \u00a7 53-593a (b).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The court concluded: \"Had the petitioner served the process on the respondent on or before August 5, 2014, in compliance with \u00a7 52-582, the action would have been timely commenced. Had the petitioner arranged\n   to have the process personally delivered to the marshal or had the marshal indicated the date he received service on the return as required by \u00a7 52-593a, the action would have been saved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"In the absence of any authority which finds the faxing of process to be personal delivery and in the absence of any evidence that the marshal received the process\n   on the date it was faxed, the court finds in favor of the respondent on its special defense that \u00a7 52-582 bars the petition. The petition for a new trial is dismissed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Reiterating the arguments that the petitioner raised before the trial court, he argues that the court erroneously interpreted the requirement in \u00a7 52-593a (a) that \"the process to be served is personally delivered to a state marshal\" to preclude the type of delivery that occurred in the present case. The petitioner argues \"that the undisputed evidence demonstrating the petitioner's delivery to [Lilley's] office by facsimile on August 5 is a sufficient basis upon which to receive the benefit of \u00a7 52-593a.\" The petitioner argues that (1) because the statute is remedial in nature, it should be interpreted liberally to afford relief in the present circumstances; (2) Lilley's failure to endorse the return in accordance with \u00a7 52-593a (b) should not preclude the petitioner from availing himself of the benefit of \u00a7 52-593a because the requirement at issue is directory and not mandatory, and he presented evidence to demonstrate that personal delivery occurred on August 5, 2014; and (3) in the present circumstances, permitting the petition to be heard would not thwart the policies underlying the statute of limitations or undermine the reliability of the fact-finding process. The respondent argues that the court properly interpreted \u00a7 52-593a in dismissing the petition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"The standard of review for a court's decision on a motion to dismiss is well settled.

Process must still be received by the serving officer on time. In other words, the plaintiff must get the process to the serving officer within the period allowed by the statute [of limitations].... Although the plaintiff is permitted to mail the process to the marshal, the determinative standard is when the marshal receives the process, not when it is mailed. 'All that \u00a7 52-593a requires ... is that the process be personally delivered. It does not require that the delivery be made by the plaintiff, his attorney, or any particular individual. The person making the delivery has no statutory role to perform respecting the delivery. He is neither required nor permitted to endorse his doings on the return. In addition, the statute does not detail the manner of making delivery. The word \"deliver\" includes a handing over for the purpose of taking even though both acts do not occur simultaneously.... Although delivery by mail is not\n   mentioned in the extension statute, such delivery is not precluded. The fact that the extension statute becomes operative only where the process has been delivered before the running of the statute of limitations, and the fact that the serving officer is required to attest to the date of delivery suggest that the purpose of the statute is to ensure that the process is received on time by the officer. The word \"personally\" means in a personal manner ... in person .... For something to be delivered in person it must be so delivered as to come into the possession of the person to whom it is to be delivered. Thus, where a delivery of process is to be made by mail, it has not been personally delivered until it has been received in person by the serving officer, at which point he can so attest.' \" (Citations omitted; footnote omitted.)

Applying the interpretation of the statute set forth in\n   <em>\n    Gianetti\n   </em>\n   to the facts of the present case, we conclude that the undisputed evidence, that the petitioner's counsel transmitted process to Lilley's office on August 5, 2014, by means of a fax machine, fell short of demonstrating that process was personally delivered to Lilley on August 5, 2014. The act of transmitting a facsimile, like the act of mailing in\n   <em>\n    Gianetti\n   </em>\n   , established that the process to be served was\n   <em>\n    sent\n   </em>\n   to Lilley on August 5, 2014, but did not shed any light on whether the process to be served came into Lilley's\n   <em>\n    possession\n   </em>\n   on August 5, 2014.

In response, the petitioner argues that the issue set forth in the briefing order was unpreserved and not reviewable. Alternatively, the petitioner argues that \"a facsimile or other electronic copy is legally sufficient and [for purposes of \u00a7 52-593a is] equivalent to an 'original' copy.\" Further, the petitioner argues that, if this court determines that \u00a7 52-593a requires the personal delivery of original copies of the process to be served and that the \"facsimile copy\" delivered to the marshal in the present case was not \"an original copy,\" the statutory requirement should be liberally interpreted to be directory and not mandatory and, in light of the evidence presented, should not be interpreted as a barrier to obtaining relief under the statute. Additionally, the petitioner argues that to interpret \u00a7 52-593a such that the facsimile copy was insufficient would arbitrarily burden his ability to present new evidence in support of his petition and, thus, violate his right to present a defense. The respondent argues that \u00a7 52-593a required personal delivery of the original writ, summons, and petition, but that, regardless of whether the faxed process at issue in this case satisfies that requirement, we should conclude that the court correctly ruled in the respondent's favor because it correctly found that there was no evidence that process in any form had been personally delivered to a marshal on or before August 5, 2014.

The purpose of the remedial savings statute would not be served by prohibiting the plaintiff from bringing the action only because the marshal did not perfectly fill out the marshal's return, as provided in subsection (b), when it is nonetheless clear from the marshal's return in this case that the marshal received the summons and complaint within the limitations period and served it on the defendant within thirty days, as required by subsection (a).\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=105%20A.3d%20338\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ; see also\n    <em>\n     Doe\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     West Hartford\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487769\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/147/1083/#p367\">\n     168 Conn.App. 354\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 377-79,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487769\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/147/1083/#p367\">\n     147 A.3d 1083\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\u00a7 52-593a available to save cause of action despite failure of serving officer to endorse on officer's return date of delivery of process to him pursuant to subsection [b] ), cert. granted,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12488740,12488749,12488742\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/323/936/\">\n     323 Conn. 936\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12488740,12488741,12488742\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/151/384/\">\n     151 A.3d 384\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2016).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    Thus, we do not view Lilley's failure to endorse the return in compliance with subsection (b) of \u00a7 52-593a to be a defect that precludes application of the statute.
