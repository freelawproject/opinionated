The Circuit Court sentenced Mr. Savage to 30 years for second degree murder conviction, 30 years for attempted second degree murder, and one year for reckless endangerment, to be served consecutively. For sentencing purposes, the convictions for attempted second degree murder and reckless endangerment were merged with his conviction for second degree murder. The Court of Special Appeals upheld all but one of\n   Petitioner's convictions in an unreported opinion, and he sought further review in this Court. We granted\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   in this case to examine the proper scope for the threshold evaluation of expert scientific evidence, as set forth in\n   <em>\n    Frye v.

As we explain below, we shall affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The underlying facts as recited by the Court of Special Appeals in its unreported opinion are essentially undisputed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 7, 2013, at approximately 6:30 p.m., Tynise Sparks arrived at the home of [Mr. Savage], along with Joshua Sparks, her husband, and Kenneth and Belinda Sparks, Joshua Sparks's parents.... Tynise intended to pick up her three children, two of whom were fathered by [Mr. Savage]. Tynise and [Mr. Savage] did not have a formal custody arrangement, but, prior to the events of July 7, 2013, Tynise allowed [Mr. Savage] access to the children at his convenience. On July 7, Tynise had arranged to pick up the children with Heather Morton, [Mr. Savage's] fianc\u00e9.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Upon arriving at the residence, Tynise parked at the end of the driveway, and remained in the vehicle, along with Joshua, Kenneth, and Belinda. [Mr. Savage] was standing in the driveway repairing Heather's vehicle with Joel Hills. The [Sparks's] sat in the car for several minutes before the children exited the house. [Mr. Savage] then approached the passenger side of the Sparks's vehicle, where Joshua was sitting, and initiated the altercation that culminated in Kenneth's death.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   [Mr. Savage] began by shouting at Joshua, informing him that he was not welcome on his property, and eventually reached into the vehicle and struck him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Joshua proceeded to exit the vehicle, followed closely by Belinda, who was seated in the rear passenger seat. [Mr. Savage] and Joshua proceeded to argue, and Belinda threw beer on [Mr. Savage]. By this time, Heather had come to the front yard, and,\n   with Joel Hills, was attempting to restrain [Mr. Savage]. Simultaneously, Tynise and Kenneth exited the vehicle, and attempted to get Joshua and Belinda to return to the car. As Heather and Hills pulled him back towards the garage, [Mr. Savage] brandished a knife.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   As [Mr. Savage] briefly disappeared into the house, he emerged from his house, carrying a gun. [Mr. Savage] walked down the steps of his home and began to run across the yard while firing shots at Joshua. As [Mr. Savage] was firing, Joshua ran to take cover behind his vehicle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   In total, [Mr. Savage] fired three shots, one of which struck Kenneth in the head, inflicting mortal injuries.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [Mr. Savage] then fled the scene, and surrendered himself to police on the following day. Before fleeing, he gave the handgun to Hills.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We shall recite additional facts below as they pertain to our discussion of the issues before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On August 5, 2013, a grand jury sitting in Wicomico County returned an indictment in 19 counts charging Petitioner with first degree murder, attempted first degree murder, and a number of related offenses arising out of the incident that took place at his home in Delmar.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Petitioner pled not guilty and elected a trial by jury. Prior to trial, the court conducted a\n   <em>\n    Frye -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Frye - Reed Hearing\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On January 15, 2014, Petitioner filed a pre-trial notice of intent to offer the testimony of Dr. William Garmoe (\"Dr. Garmoe\"), a board-certified neuropsychologist, who would \"testify regarding the psychological and cognitive effects of [Petitioner's] past brain injury and trauma\" due to the effects of gunshot wounds he suffered in 2003. The State responded by requesting a\n   <em>\n    Frye - Reed\n   </em>\n   hearing to address the prosecution's\n   \"significant concerns regarding the reliability and general acceptance of Garmoe's methods, and likely his opinion[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At the pre-trial\n   <em>\n    Frye - Reed\n   </em>\n   hearing, the defense offered that Dr. Garmoe would specifically testify on the basis of a report that he had prepared following his interview of Petitioner and the administration of various tests. Dr. Garmoe explained in detail his method for assessing and examining Petitioner:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   In my examination I did a number of things. I reviewed his records because there was a concern about the injury he had had and what affects that injury may have had, I reviewed the medical records. And in reviewing his medical records that's where it was clear to me in the medical records that at the time he had sustained the gunshot wound to the face that there also had been an injury to his brain. And that basis came from in the records the indication that he had suffered a subarachnoid hemorrhage, a subdural hematoma, and also swelling in the brain, which are hallmark signs that there had been an injury to the brain.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Following the review of Petitioner's medical records, Dr. Garmoe then decided to conduct:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   A neurophysiological battery [which is] a comprehensive assessment that looks at ... intellect, thinking and memory, attention, processing speed, what we call executive abilities, meaning the capacity to think through complex problems or novel problems, mental flexibility and psychological well-being. And it's designed to use standardized validated measures so that it's not just my opinion that's generating these scores, but they are actually formal scores that are generated and very often, in many cases there's computer programs that translate the scores into their kind of the what we call the standard scores that help us to judge the outcome of the assessment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   With respect to the specific tests he administered, Dr. Garmoe referred the court to the list of tests set forth in his report:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Tests Administered\n   </em>\n   : Test of Premorbid Functioning (TOPF); Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-4\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Edition\n   (WAIS-IV); Trails A &amp; B; Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWALT); Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST); Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT); Wechsler Memory Scale-4\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Edition (WMS-IV)-partial; Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure; Test of Memory Malingering (TOMM); Advanced Clinical Solutions effort measures; Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Based on his testing and evaluation of Petitioner, Dr. Garmoe's conclusions set forth the view that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Given the residual cognitive and psychological effects of his T[raumatic] B [rain] I[njury] [ (\"TBI\") ], under such conditions of chaos and stress Mr. Savage would be more likely to perceive himself to be facing an imminent threat and have greater difficulty controlling his reactions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Dr. Garmoe's report continued that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Mr. Savage views the world through an untrusting and suspicious perspective, and often is hyper-vigilant to possible threats.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   When the Circuit Court inquired about the purpose for which Dr. Garmoe's opinion would be admitted, defense counsel indicated Petitioner's theory of self-defense:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: The testimony at the time of trial is from a board certified clinical neuropsychologist, Dr. William Garmoe. He conducted a battery of tests on the Defendant, Mr. Savage, and has reached an opinion related to Mr. Savage's psychological profile but also a brain injury and the effect that had on Mr. Savage. It is in preparation of a potential self-defense and imperfect self-defense argument in this case. And the consistency of his findings and his assessment of the Defendant with what I believe will be the Defendant's testimony as to his perception the day of the event, if that makes sense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   THE COURT: So you're saying it's relevant-if it passes the Frye-Reed test you're saying it's relevant and material with respect to imperfect self-defense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Circuit Court inquired, for clarification, whether Dr. Garmoe's conclusions were intended to establish a \"Not Criminally\n   Responsible\" defense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"It's not an\n   NCR defense,\" defense counsel replied. Instead, she explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   It is what I expect based on his report his opinion to be is that the cognitive effects of the brain injury have affected his ability to process complex situations, I guess[.] ... But coupled with the psychological effects of that particular injury and the circumstances of that injury, which is a different part of the testing, I believe, that he is very untrusting, suspicious and has a tendency to be hyper-vigilant to threats.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defense counsel then elaborated on how the expected testimony would factor in establishing imperfect self-defense:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Because imperfect self-defense relies solely on his honest and subjective belief of the situation, then it is important for the jury to perhaps understand why that might be his belief, that there is actually a physical component to the idea that he may have that honest subjective belief. If there is an actual diagnosis that explains why someone would believe that, I think it is necessary for the jury to hear that, it is important for them to understand that that is a possible honest belief on the part of the Defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   What he would say is that Mr. Savage perceived threats as imminent based on the cognitive and psychological effects of his traumatic brain injury, I believe is what he just said his opinion was.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   With respect to Dr. Garmoe's qualifications as an expert, Dr. Garmoe, the sole witness at the pre-trial hearing, testified that he had been qualified as an expert in the field of neuropsychology in a number of Maryland civil and criminal cases. Although the prosecutor argued that Dr. Garmoe was not qualified to render any relevant diagnoses, such as a traumatic brain injury, his qualifications as a board-certified\n   neuropsychologist were not in dispute, and the Circuit Court indeed qualified him as an expert in that field.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   When defense counsel inquired of Dr. Garmoe whether \"all of the tests [he was] going to talk about ... [were] novel tests or ... new[,]\" Dr. Garmoe emphasized that none of the tests or measures that he employed \"are novel new tests or are used outside of the way in which they would be typically used in the neuropsychological assessment.\" Dr. Garmoe also explained that his examination and testing approach of Petitioner \"is very consistent with what [he] would typically use as well as what [his] colleagues, [his] colleague neuropsychologists would use in doing this type of assessment.\" When asked whether his conclusions were \"accurate to any degree of scientific certainty [,]\" Dr. Garmoe was confident in his assessment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Yes. I'm confident in that, and what would elaborate with that is one of the first things I look at when I do this kind of assessment is can I trust the data, are these data valid[?] ... So we look at the tests that I'm calling the performance validity measures to see.... So what the testing results showed is that he is having difficulties with his processing speed, he's slower at processing information. There are ways in which he has decreased flexibility of his thinking and he has some deficits in new learning and recent memory. Very consistent with the things he reported to me in terms of the cognitive symptoms that he experiences on a day to day basis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Dr. Garmoe explained what he considered in formulating his assessment in this case:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   What I considered for that were the things that he told me, the descriptions he gave me about his own functioning, my assessment of his current presentation as he was right in front of me, and then also what he looked like on instruments such as the PAI, so what that\n   shows about his psychological state. Because sometimes a person will tell you one thing or they'll say they're feeling one thing but if you examine it in a less direct way you may get information\n   that is different from what they tell you directly. Sometimes different from what they even consciously recognize of themselves.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The court again inquired of counsel what the defense sought to establish with Dr. Garmoe's testimony. Defense counsel elaborated in more detail, tracking the language in Dr. Garmoe's conclusions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   I believe it would be the statement that he gave regarding the cognitive and psychological effects of the traumatic brain injury that under conditions of chaos and stress Mr. Savage is more likely to perceive himself to be facing an imminent threat and have greater difficulty controlling his reaction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Mr. Savage views the world through an untrusting and suspicious perspective, is often hyper-vigilant to possible threats.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Following cross-examination of Dr. Garmoe by the prosecution, the Circuit Court inquired about the foundations of Dr. Garmoe's conclusions, and whether the doctor's method and its application were the subject of any professional disagreement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   THE COURT: Now I guess I'm going to go back to the same thing. How long has this technique been around, look at the medical data, then do the neuropsychological testing, then arrive at a conclusion? How long have psychologists been doing this?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   THE WITNESS: Probably the strongest burst of neuropsychology came after World War II when there were lots of wounded soldiers coming back.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   And traumatic brain injuries. All the brain injuries from the war, that's where the clinical discipline-the academic discipline has been around but that's when the clinical discipline most strongly developed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   If you look in terms of the judicial kind of the forensic realm, the growth of neurosurgery testifying within criminal cases over the last 15 years has been exponential.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   THE COURT: And one of the tests, of the things the Judge has to do is-the thing the Judge has to do is see that this approach has been accepted by the scientific community at large, in your scientific community. Usually that's proven by peer reviews, studies, literature, but your attorney is not proffering any articles that have been written on this topic. I mean is there literature?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   THE WITNESS: I would be happy, I actually have a text with me I'd be happy for us to copy the chapter for that and leave it for you that really lays that out.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   THE COURT: Has it even been debated at your psychological conferences?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   THE WITNESS: It's debated endlessly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   But it's my opinion that the scientific evidence supports the use of neuropsychological methods within this realm. And in the particular expertise we bring, in addition to our training as psychologists, our standardized measures and measures that are there to detect\n   whether somebody is trying to appear other than they really are.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Asked by the court whether Dr. Garmoe was rendering an opinion with respect to Petitioner's state of mind on the day of the events of this case, defense counsel clarified the defense's theory regarding his anticipated testimony:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   [T]he doctor is not ... giving the jury the impression that he can predict what [Mr. Savage] was thinking at that time. The Defendant would have already testified as to what his state of mind was. All the doctor is doing is giving an opinion as to his psychological state of mind, generally, not\n   on that particular day but in this case I think it's particularly important because the brain injury occurred prior to this event, the testing occurred after this event. The brain injury existed at the time of the event. The effects of the brain injury most likely existed at the time of the event since they existed a few months later and they occurred several years ago.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    Frye - Reed Ruling and Trial Testimony\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   On February 3, 2014, the Circuit Court filed its opinion, ruling that the\n   <em>\n    Frye -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   test had not been met, and precluded Dr. Garmoe from offering the disputed opinion as to how someone reacts in a situation of \"chaos and stress\" at trial. The hearing judge explained in his Order:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Dr. Garmoe has reviewed Defendant's medical records; he has interviewed Defendant; he has submitted Defendant to a battery of psychological tests from which he has derived extensive data. All of this, plus his underlying assumption that Defendant suffered a TBI in 2003, leads him to conclude how Defendant will react in a time of \"chaos and stress.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   Neither Dr. Garmoe nor Defendant, through counsel, offers any peer review studies or other literature from the neuropsychological community to substantiate the validity of this bipodal approach. Neither Dr. Garmoe nor defense counsel has identified any circuit court in Maryland or, for that matter, any state court in the country which has accepted such a methodology to show how someone reacts in a situation of \"chaos and stress.\" The\n   <em>\n    Frye -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   test has not been met.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Circuit Court's Order specified that Dr. Garmoe would not be excluded from testifying at trial but the court cabined his testimony:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   The fact that the above-mentioned opinions of Dr. Garmoe will be excluded at trial does not mean that he cannot testify. Counsel will keep in mind that Dr. Garmoe is not competent to reconstruct [Mr. Savage's] emotions at a specific\n   time and therefore he may not express an opinion as to what belief or intent [Mr. Savage] harbored at the time of his alleged crime.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The case went to trial, and while Dr. Garmoe was permitted to testify, his testimony was constrained by the trial court's\n   <em>\n    Frye -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   ruling. At trial, the following exchange took place during the doctor's testimony:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   [DR. GARMOE]: Sure. What the personality assessment inventory showed is that-well, one thing it showed is that Mr. Savage is an individual who has a higher than-he has a higher level of concern for physical functioning, higher level of focus on physical symptoms than most people would. It's not unusual to see that in an individual who has had some type of a major medical condition or a major neurological insult. There's a greater focus on the way his body is working, the physical symptoms that he's reporting than most people would have.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   What it also showed when you look at the other scales is that he is somebody who has experienced a lot of anxiety and tension on a regular basis, and that he tends to view the world in untrusting-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Objection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   THE COURT: Well, the basis for the objection is what?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Is that the opinion that was excluded by Your Honor's order of February 3, 2013?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   THE COURT: Well, it was, so sustained. Ask another question.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Closing Argument-Alleged Prosecutorial Misconduct\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   At trial, during the State's closing argument, the prosecutor suggested that the testimony of Mr. Savage's friend, Joel Hills, defied common sense, thus undermining Mr. Savage's theory of self-defense. Specifically, Petitioner points to the following remarks:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: The Defendant and Joel Hills would have you believe that Kenneth Sparks was the aggressor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   Joel Hills, the man that wants you to believe that Josh and Kenny Sparks were aggressive or advanced on the Defendant, remember he's the same man, ladies and gentlemen, that not once tried to take the knife or the gun or calm the Defendant. He did take him into the house, but he did nothing beyond that. Joel Hills is the same man that not once called 911, not once had anyone else call 911. He not once aided Kenneth Sparks or the Spark's family, and he didn't aid Heather getting those children into the truck.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   Joel Hills is the same man who aided the Defendant's escape, led the Defendant out the back, over the fence, and we know for the first time yesterday how the gun got wiped clean. The Defendant said he gave the gun to Joel Hills. Joel Hills is the one that dropped it, after he wiped it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   Take your common sense back there, ladies and gentlemen. I'm going to give you a hypothetical. Diane, your Bailiff, is at her house. Debbie, the Court Reporter, is at Diane's house. They are drinking hot tea and watching soap operas. I break and enter their house. Diane shoots and kills me because I break and enter. The first time that the police hear about my breaking and entering, the first time that the police hear about Diane's defense, the defense of herself and her property and her friend Debbie, will not be at her murder trial. Why? Because that defies all logic. Because at least Debbie would have told them initially.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Defense counsel objected, reasoning that the prosecutor was \"questioning the Defendant's Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.\" After the trial court overruled the objection, the prosecutor continued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Because Debbie would have told the police Diane did it in self-defense. Diane did what she had to do, and Diane would have stayed. We don't have that here because that's not how it went down. The Defendant and Joel Hills have concocted details to aid in this theory, which\n   is only a theory and not the reality of self-defense. You didn't hear them until yesterday.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Following his convictions by the jury and sentencing by the court. Petitioner noted a direct appeal to the Court of Special Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Court of Special Appeals' Opinion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Petitioner took issue with the Circuit Court's\n   <em>\n    Frye -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   ruling and also alleged\n   sufficiency errors with respect to his conviction for reckless endangerment and trial errors related to the State's closing argument. In rejecting Petitioner's challenge to the constraints placed on Dr. Garmoe's testimony, the intermediate appellate court first discounted Petitioner's assertion that an examination of Dr. Garmoe's opinions fell outside the scope of\n   <em>\n    Frye -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reed.\n   </em>\n   The Court of Special Appeals, citing\n   <em>\n    Chesson v.

The Court of Special Appeals addressed this contention as follows. It first summarized Petitioner's contentions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   [Petitioner] points out that Dr. Garmoe was the only witness at the hearing, and that he testified, without refutation that:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   (1) his methodology was generally accepted in the neuropsychological community;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   (2) none of the tests he used were novel or used \"outside of the way in which they would be typically used in the neuropsychological assessment\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   (3) he diagnosed [Mr. Savage] with Cognitive Disorder NOS, a diagnosis from the DSM-IV, and his diagnosis was\n   generally accepted because it is recognized under the DSM-IV; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   (4) Dr. Garmoe, as a neuropsychologist, was qualified to testify about the existence and cause of Mr. Savage's brain injury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   [Mr. Savage] asserts that \"[t]he admissibility of a neuropsychologist's testimony as to the existence of a brain injury is generally accepted in most jurisdictions.\" He concludes:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   In sum, the unrefuted evidence presented at the\n   <em>\n    Frye -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   hearing established Dr. Garmoe's methodologies were generally accepted in the neuropsychological community. Moreover, Dr. Garmoe diagnosed Mr. Savage under the DSM-IV with Cognitive Disorder NOS, which was based on Mr. Savage's traumatic brain injury. The generally accepted methodology coupled with a DSM-IV based diagnosis satisfied the\n   <em>\n    Frye -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   criteria.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Dismissing these arguments as \"miss[ing] the point,\" the Court of Special Appeals explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   The basis of the trial court's concerns was not whether Dr. Garmoe's methodology was sound, but whether his conclusions-that a person who suffered a traumatic brain injury would (1) be more likely to perceive himself to be facing an imminent threat and have greater difficulty controlling his reactions in conditions of chaos and stress, and (2) view the world through a suspicious and hyper-vigilant perspective-were generally accepted in the scientific community.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   As to that, and in response to a question from the court, Dr. Garmoe testified that the issue was \"debated endlessly\" at conferences of psychologists. Dr. Garmoe did not testify that the connection between traumatic brain injury on the one hand, and hyper-vigilance and similar behavioral traits on the other, was generally accepted by the practitioners of his field. To be sure, he did testify that he personally believed that the cause and effect relationship was valid but the \" '\n   <em>\n    ipse dixit\n   </em>\n   of the expert' \" is\n   not a basis for admitting opinion evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The Court of Special Appeals similarly rejected Petitioner's challenge to the trial court's limitation on Dr. Garmoe's trial testimony. The intermediate appellate court explained that, despite the limitations of the pre-trial Order and curtailment of some direct testimony, Dr. Garmoe was able to present extensive information before the jurors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   We see things differently [than does Mr. Savage]. We do not agree with [Mr. Savage's] characterization of Dr. Garmoe's testimony. After the court sustained the State's objection, Dr. Garmoe continued to testify about [Mr. Savage's] performance on the PAI tests and the conclusions that he drew from them. For example, Dr. Garmoe testified that [Mr. Savage] was \"mildly impaired\" in terms of \"the speed and efficiency with which somebody can process information,\" and that he \"is troubled by memories of what ... he subjectively experienced as a horrible experience in that he sometimes has difficulty in managing his temper.\" Moreover, Dr. Garmoe testified that [Mr. Savage's] score on the paranoia scale was \"clinically elevated,\" his scores for anxiety were \"a significant factor,\" and that he \"is an individual who has had a very short temper throughout his life and that is a form of impulse regulation [and that] he has difficulties with impulsivity,\" which \"got worse [after] his injury.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   In summary, it is clear that the trial court did not restrict Dr. Garmoe from testifying about the results of the PAI tests. Instead, the court sustained the State's objection when Dr. Garmoe attempted to testify, through clear implication, that he concluded\n   <em>\n    from the tests results\n   </em>\n   alone that [Mr. Savage] \"tends to view the world in untrusting [terms],\" when in the\n   <em>\n    Frye -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   hearing, he had testified that this conclusion was based on the\n   <em>\n    combination\n   </em>\n   of [Mr. Savage's] medical history of a traumatic brain injury\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the test results. The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it declined to permit Dr. Garmoe to recast his opinion as based solely on test results. To permit Dr. Garmoe to do so would have rendered the\n   <em>\n    Frye -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   hearing a meaningless exercise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The Court of Special Appeals also dismissed Petitioner's challenge to the prosecutor's summation.

Dr. Garmoe does not articulate a connection between the performance data from the testing or explain how Petitioner's representations during the interview lead to the evaluations of hyper-vigilance to \"possible threats,\" and an overarching \"untrusting and suspicious perspective,\" and how these affects emerge \"under such conditions of chaos and stress.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Dr. Garmoe testified at the hearing that his results were based on Petitioner's \"presentation and interview\" along with testing, including Petitioner's \"descriptions... about his own\n   functioning,\" as well as testing, including the results of the Personality Assessment Inventory. Dr. Garmoe recorded Petitioner's version of the events of this case, as well as the statement of charges and contrasting stories by the complainants. He also reviewed medical records from 2003, when Petitioner suffered multiple gunshot wounds to the face.\n   The testing showed \"difficulties with [Petitioner's] processing speed,\" \"decreased flexibility\" in thinking and \"deficits in new learning and recent memory.\" In his report, Dr. Garmoe observed that \"residual effects of [Petitioner's] traumatic brain injury\" as manifest by the above deficits \"fell primarily in the mild range.\" He reported that Petitioner \"became depressed, embittered, and developed a more suspicious/untrusting view of the world[,]\" and \"continues to struggle with depression and anger.\" Petitioner told Dr. Garmoe that he has a \"history of difficulties with anger management, and [that] his difficulties with emotional control did not start with the TBI, but [that] exacerbated the problems.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Petitioner admitted to a \"twice weekly\" marijuana habit to \"take away\" his anger. He also told the doctor about his struggles with depression and \"increased irritability and anger.\" With respect to Petitioner's \"Current Psychological Status,\" however, Dr. Garmoe related that Petitioner said that \"his current mood is generally good and his 'anger meter' is low[,]\" although Petitioner acknowledged a tendency to \"fly off the handle easily\" and had been enrolled in anger management classes while incarcerated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Perhaps one of the most important parts of Dr. Garmoe's report is his review of Petitioner's results on the Personality Assessment Inventory (\"PAI\") test:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-154\">\n   [Petitioner] completed the PAI. He showed a tendency to endorse items which present an unfavorable view, possibly reflecting a negative view he has of himself at this time. There were significant elevations across several clinical scales, suggesting that he is in considerable psychological distress. He shows a higher concern with physical symptoms and perceived impairment from them, though it should be\n   noted that he has a history of genuine severe medical problems. He also is experiencing high levels of anxiety and tension, which may in part being [sic] expressed through physical symptoms. Mr. Savage views the world through an untrusting and suspicious perspective, and often is hyper-vigilant to possible threats. At times he may appear to others to be aloof and even hostile. He subjectively feels a sense of confusion and difficulties with maintaining clear thought processes. Examination of critical items shows that Mr. Savage endorsed being troubled by memories and reliving a horrible experience and that his temper sometimes explodes and he loses control.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Although his methods in this case appear to be comprehensive, Dr. Garmoe does not adequately reveal, as shown by the above, how his ultimate conclusions are derived from the evidence he sets forth at the hearing and in his report. No adequate details, for example, are presented with respect to the PAI testing, and it is difficult to separate Petitioner's self-reporting from Dr. Garmoe's analysis of the presentation and interview, in our view.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   The PAI appears to be a major component of Dr. Garmoe's analysis. \"[T]he Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI; Morey, 2007), [is] an objective and commonly used personality inventory.\" Emily M.

The PAI can yield information that assists in determining\n   diagnosis, symptom severity, level of risk, and treatment planning, and due to its utility to assess factors salient to psycholegal decision making, the PAI has gained popularity in forensic settings. For example, the PAI can be used to assess for potential risk of aggression towards self and others, to classify offenders, and even to predict the likelihood of disciplinary action being taken against an inmate during incarceration or recidivism once an inmate is released from custody (Edens et al., 2001; Gardner, Boccaccini, Bitting, &amp; Edens, 2015; Morey &amp; Quigley, 2002; Reidy, Sorensen, &amp; Davidson, 2015; Sinclair et al., 2009; Walters &amp; Duncan, 2005; Walters, Duncan, &amp; Geyer, 2003; Wang et al., 1997). Furthermore, the assessment typically only takes about an hour to complete, most items are written at about a 4th grade reading level.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-159\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-160\">\n   In forensic evaluations, it is important to consider cognitive ability, discrete from psychiatric illness, as many times impaired cognitive ability co-occurs with a mental health diagnosis (e.g., Roesch, Zapf, Golding, &amp; Skeem, 1999; Ryba &amp; Zapf, 2011).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-161\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-162\">\n   The PAI consists of 22 non-overlapping validity, clinical, and supplemental scales. The clinical scales include Somatic Complaints (SOM), Anxiety (ANX), Anxiety-Related Disorders (ARD), Depression (DEP), Mania (MAN), Paranoia (PAR), Schizophrenia (SCZ), Borderline Features (BOR), Antisocial Features (ANT), Alcohol Problems (ALC), and Drug Problems (DRG) (Morey, 1991, 2007b). Ten of the full scales contain subscales to assist in further interpretation of complex clinical constructs, such as Antisocial Features (broken down into antisocial behavior, egocentricity, and stimulus-seeking) and Anxiety and Depression (each containing physiological, cognitive, and affective subscales). Though for the present study, only the validity scales (Infrequency [INF], Inconsistency [INC], Positive Impression [PIM], Negative Impression [NIM] ) were examined. The reliability and validity of this measure are well established,\n   including in correctional and forensic populations (e.g., Douglas et al., 2001; Edens et al., 2001; Morey, 1991, 2007b; Morey &amp; Quigley, 2002).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Tatiana M.

More specifically, the configural profile was obtained by (a) obtaining a mean T-score elevation on all of the eleven clinical scales, (b) subtracting the T-score of each clinical scale from the overall mean to obtain deviation scores, and (c) adding up the deviation scores and computing how far the deviation scores are from clusters presented by Morey (1991). The participant's profile is then assigned to the profile with which it is most similar. Intercorrelations between all the clinical scales were next completed (Table 4). Finally, exploratory factor-analyses were completed on the eleven clinical scales of the PAI: Somatic Complaints, Anxiety, Anxiety Related Disorders, Depression, Mania, Paranoia, Schizophrenia, Borderline Features, Antisocial Features, Alcohol\n   Problems, and Drug Problems (Table 5). Principal components extraction followed by varimax (orthogonal) rotation was performed; only factors with an eigen value of 1.00 or higher were retained for the final solution. This factor analytic approach is similar to Morey's (1991) approach as detailed in the PAI test manual.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   George J.

By presenting his opinion about Petitioner, Dr. Garmoe did not reveal any similar analytics in the requisite detail so as to build a connection between his methods and observations, especially in the PAI, and his ultimate conclusion. This is not to say that Dr. Garmoe was not able to do so, or that he neglected to engage in a more detailed presentation of the steps he took to get from Petitioner's test performance to the doctor's opinions. These analytics, if they existed, were left at the courthouse door. Indeed, defense counsel promised that more detail would be forthcoming at trial, but this defeats the purpose of the crucial \"gatekeeping\" function of the court. When outlining what the defense expected from Dr. Garmoe, defense counsel said:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-167\">\n   And I would expect honestly at the hearing at trial to get into the substance of why he came to that conclusion. I don't-as far as the description of the trauma that occurred before and why that psychologically affected him, which I think is not necessarily relevant to the\n   <em>\n    Frye - Reed\n   </em>\n   hearing because at today's hearing we're only addressing the scientific measures that he used to come to his conclusions and whether those are scientifically reliable. And I think his testimony has certainly established that. I haven't gotten into all of the details as to why he came to that conclusion certainly, but I do think that would probably be relevant for them to understand.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Contrary to defense counsel's representation, the \"details\" are exactly pertinent to the\n   <em>\n    Frye - Reed\n   </em>\n   gatekeeping function, and were due to be presented at the\n   <em>\n    Frye - Reed\n   </em>\n   hearing.

On the record before us, however, we are unable to conclude that Dr. Garmoe adequately \"connected the dots\" between the empirical foundation from his study of Petitioner and the doctor's ultimate opinions. We emphasize that, in passing on whether there exists an \"analytical gap\" between the data and the expert's conclusions, we may take as given the general acceptance of the expert's methods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Petitioner's attempts to distinguish our decisions in\n   <em>\n    Blackwell\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Chesson\n   </em>\n   are unavailing. He maintains that, unlike the present case, neither of those cases \"involved psychological or psychiatric testimony based on a standard battery of tests with a DSM diagnosis[,]\" and that the science in those cases was the subject of expert dispute. We do not share Petitioner's attempt to narrow the reach of these cases. In\n   <em>\n    State v. Baby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3559021\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/404/220/#p270\">\n    404 Md. 220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 270,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3559021\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/404/220/#p270\">\n    946 A.2d 463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 492-93 (2008), we pointed out that \"[w]e have reaffirmed the importance of\n   <em>\n    Frye - Reed\n   </em>\n   analysis\n   in determining the validity and reliability of a wide variety of scientific methodologies and conclusions, including various syndromes.\" Our conclusion, based in part as it is on our decision in\n   <em>\n    Blackwell\n   </em>\n   , militates against Petitioner's argument. The presence of an \"analytical gap\" between the information available to him and Dr. Garmoe's ultimate opinion undermines the validity of this evidence, regardless of whether the tests he administered and the DSM-IV diagnosis were the appropriate methodology.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   We next turn to Petitioner's contention that because Dr. Garmoe was the sole witness at the\n   <em>\n    Frye - Reed\n   </em>\n   hearing, and thus not contradicted, the Court of Special Appeals erred by upholding the trial court's\n   <em>\n    Frye - Reed\n   </em>\n   ruling. We must disagree. The fact that an expert's opinion is not contradicted does not require its admission. To so hold would abrogate the gatekeeping obligation of the trial court, which must inquire into the admissibility under\n   <em>\n    Frye - Reed\n   </em>\n   of even uncontradicted evidence. We also remind Petitioner that in\n   <em>\n    Frye\n   </em>\n   itself, the sole evidence at issue was the \"uncontradicted\" systolic blood pressure deception test. The\n   <em>\n    Frye\n   </em>\n   court was not troubled by the fact that the United States failed to submit conflicting scientific evidence. Nor is this Court bound by Dr. Garmoe's opinion because the State failed to respond with science and argument that contradicts his conclusions. It is the proponent's burden of satisfying\n   <em>\n    Frye - Reed\n   </em>\n   by a preponderance of the evidence, and to do so at the initial pre-trial stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Our holding that the Circuit Court did not err by precluding the specific opinions in question at the pre-hearing stage applies with equal force to the trial judge's decision to limit Dr. Garmoe's trial testimony. The pre-trial Order limits Dr. Garmoe's opinions with respect to how someone would react in a situation of chaos and stress. Although the pre-trial Order does not mention \"hyper-vigilance,\" mistrust or suspicion, we are satisfied that the Order embraces those aspects of Dr. Garmoe's opinions. We discern neither error nor an abuse of discretion on the part of the trial judge in this regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   <strong>\n    Closing Argument\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   Finally, we reach Petitioner's assertion that the Court of Special Appeals erred by upholding the trial court's denial of Petitioner's objection to improper closing argument by the prosecutor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   \"The Fifth Amendment, as applied to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, guarantees an accused the right to invoke his privilege against self-incrimination.\"\n   <em>\n    Coleman v.

Neither standard is perfect.
