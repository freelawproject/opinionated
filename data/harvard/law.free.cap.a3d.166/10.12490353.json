Healey, damages for unpaid wages pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-72.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On appeal,\n   the defendant claims that the court erred by charging the jury on the amended version of \u00a7 31-72 because the amendment took effect after this action had commenced. Therefore, the defendant argues, the court was required to charge the jury on the repealed version of that statute that had been in effect at the time the alleged injuries occurred. The defendant also claims that the court's instruction on the amended version of the statute was a clear, obvious, and indisputable error that warrants reversal under the plain error doctrine.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We conclude that the defendant's claim is unreviewable because it induced the alleged instructional impropriety by affirmatively requesting that the court charge the jury on the amended version of \u00a7 31-72. We also conclude that plain error reversal is not warranted in this case. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts, which are not in dispute for the purposes of this appeal, and procedural history are relevant to the defendant's claim. The plaintiff worked for the defendant as a medical malpractice attorney for more than seventeen years. In 2011, the plaintiff informed John I. Haymond, the defendant's principal, that he wished to retire from practicing law full time. Consequently, the defendant and the plaintiff agreed\n   that the plaintiff would continue to work for the defendant through 2012 on a part-time basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In September, 2012, the defendant and the plaintiff reached another agreement that further reduced the plaintiff's workload and modified the plaintiff's compensation. In particular, the agreement provided that (1) the plaintiff would retain responsibility only for a small number of medical malpractice cases; (2) the defendant would pay the plaintiff 50 percent of the legal\n   fees recovered in those cases; and (3) the defendant would pay the plaintiff 15 percent of any referral fees that the defendant received in cases that the plaintiff had referred to the law firm of Koskoff, Koskoff &amp; Bieder, P.C. (Koskoff, Koskoff &amp; Bieder).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In March, 2013, the plaintiff settled two medical malpractice cases for which he had retained responsibility pursuant to the September, 2012 agreement. Subsequently, the plaintiff requested that the defendant pay him 50 percent of the legal fees it received in those settlements. The defendant refused to pay the plaintiff 50 percent of the recovered legal fees and, instead, paid him only approximately 15 percent of the fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Around August, 2014, the plaintiff learned that one of the cases that he had referred to Koskoff, Koskoff &amp; Bieder had been settled and that the defendant received a referral fee from Koskoff, Koskoff &amp; Bieder for that case. The defendant never tendered any part of that referral fee to the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Thereafter, the plaintiff brought the present action, seeking recovery of (1) his full 50 percent share of the legal fees recovered in the two medical malpractice cases that he had settled, and (2) 15 percent of the referral fee that the defendant received from the case settled by Koskoff, Koskoff &amp; Bieder. Specifically, the plaintiff's complaint sought recovery principally\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   on the\n   basis of a statutory claim for unpaid wages made pursuant to \u00a7 31-72 and a breach of contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Regarding the statutory claim for unpaid wages, the governing statute, \u00a7 31-72, was amended while this action was pending. On June 19, 2013, when this action was initiated, the version of the statute that was in effect at that time provided in relevant part: \"When any employer [unlawfully]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   fails to pay an employee wages ... such employee ...\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   recover, in a civil action,\n   <em>\n    twice the full amount\n   </em>\n   of such wages ....\" (Emphasis added.) General Statutes (Rev. to 2013) \u00a7 31-72. Our Supreme Court also had provided the following interpretive gloss relating to double damages under that version of \u00a7 31-72 : \"The statute provides for a\n   <em>\n    discretionary\n   </em>\n   award of double damages ... to employees who are successful in actions against their employers for wages due.... Although \u00a7 31-72 does not set forth a standard by which to determine whether double damages should be awarded in particular cases, it is well established ... that it is appropriate for a plaintiff to recover ... double damages ...\n   <em>\n    only when the trial court has found that the defendant acted with bad faith, arbitrariness or unreasonableness\n   </em>\n   .\" (Citation omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Ravetto\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Triton Thalassic Technologies, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3957819\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/285/716/#p724\">\n    285 Conn. 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 724,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=941%20A.2d%20309\">\n    941 A.2d 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008). Also, in cases in which a discretionary award of double damages was sought under that version of \u00a7 31-72, the burden of proving an employer's bad faith, arbitrariness, or unreasonableness was on the plaintiff. See\n   <em>\n    Somers\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    LeVasseur\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"763461\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/230/560/#p568\">\n    230 Conn. 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 568,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=645%20A.2d%20993\">\n    645 A.2d 993\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994) (\"the traditional principle [is] that in a civil case [t]he general burden of proof rests upon the plaintiff\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In June, 2015, approximately two years after this action was commenced and four months before trial began, \u00a7 31-72 was amended by No. 15-86, \u00a7 2, of the\n   2015 Public Acts. The amended version took effect on October 1, 2015, several weeks before trial began. It provides in relevant part: \"When any employer [unlawfully] fails to pay an employee wages ... such employee ...\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   recover, in a civil action, (1) twice the full amount of such wages ...\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   (2) if the\n   <em>\n    employer establishes\n   </em>\n   that the employer had a\n   <em>\n    good faith belief\n   </em>\n   that the underpayment of wages was in compliance with law, the full amount of such wages ... with costs and such reasonable attorney's fees as may be allowed by the court....\" (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 31-72.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On October 20, 2015, the plaintiff submitted a preliminary request to charge, proposing that the court instruct the jury using the language in the amended version of \u00a7 31-72. After quoting the relevant part of the amended version of \u00a7 31-72 in his proposed instructions, the plaintiff requested the following specific instructions: (1) \"If you do find in favor of the plaintiff-that is, that the defendant unlawfully withheld his pay-you must then determine whether the [defendant] had a 'good faith belief that the underpayment of wages was in compliance with law.' It is the\n   <em>\n    defendant's burden\n   </em>\n   to prove to you that the defendant had such a good faith belief\"; and (2) \"If you find that\n   <em>\n    the defendant failed to prove that it had such a good faith belief\n   </em>\n   , then you\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   award the plaintiff twice the amount of unpaid wages ... [and the plaintiff] is\n   <em>\n    entitled\n   </em>\n   to collect his attorney's fees.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On October 26, 2015, the plaintiff filed a memorandum of law supplementing his preliminary request to charge. In that memorandum, the plaintiff argued that the court should conclude that the amended version of \u00a7 31-72 applied retroactively and, therefore, use that version in its instructions. The defendant did not file any response to the plaintiff's preliminary request to charge and accompanying memorandum of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On October 27, 2015, the defendant filed its own preliminary request to charge, which also quoted the\n   <em>\n    amended\n   </em>\n   version of \u00a7 31-72. In particular, the defendant asked the court to give the following instruction: \"I will summarize the law for you.... [Section] 31-72 provides criteria for an employee to collect unpaid wages. Section 31-72 states, in pertinent part [that] ... [w]hen any employer [unlawfully] fails to pay an employee wages ... such employee ...\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   recover, in a civil action, (1) twice the full amount of such wages, with costs and such reasonable attorney's fees as may be allowed by the court, or (2)\n   <em>\n    if the employer establishes that the employer had a good faith belief that the underpayment of wages was in compliance with law, the full amount of such wages or compensation, with costs and such reasonable attorney's fees as may be allowed by the court.\n   </em>\n   \" (Emphasis altered; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On October 28, 2015, the second day of evidence, the plaintiff filed two additional requests. The first was a request for jury interrogatories. That request proposed interrogatories tracking the language of the amended version of \u00a7 31-72, including an interrogatory asking the jury if it \"[found] that\n   <em>\n    the defendant failed to prove\n   </em>\n   that it acted in good faith in failing to pay the plaintiff in full the compensation he had earned.\" (Emphasis added.) Although the defendant did not file a written objection to the proposed interrogatories, the defendant's counsel subsequently made the following oral objection to the aforementioned interrogatory: \"[It is] unjustifiably prejudicial. I would suggest that it say, Do you find that the defendant had a good faith belief that it paid wages in compliance with the law, yes or no?\" The second request, filed by the plaintiff on October 28, 2015, was a revised request to charge. That request, like the plaintiff's preliminary request to charge, proposed that the\n   court instruct the jury according to the amended version\n   of \u00a7 31-72. The defendant did not file a written objection to the revised request to charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Also on October 28, 2015, the court heard argument from the parties regarding the proposed jury instructions. The plaintiff's counsel began argument by stating: \"[T]he defendant has agreed that the latest version of the \u00a7 31-72 statute, as amended effective October 1, 2015, is the statute that is in effect now and we don't have to be concerned about the question of retroactivity.\" It appears that the plaintiff's counsel concluded that the defendant had \"agreed\" that the amended version controlled because the defendant had quoted verbatim that version of the statute in its own request to charge. Thus, relying on the amended statute, the plaintiff's counsel requested the court to instruct the jury \"that it's the\n   <em>\n    employer's burden\n   </em>\n   to prove that it acted in good faith in failing to pay wages ....\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The defendant's counsel did not object to that requested instruction. Rather, in responding to the argument by the plaintiff's counsel, the defendant's counsel stated that \"[t]he plaintiff's attorney is correct that ... the statute has been amended going forward. What [the plaintiff's counsel] has not done ... though, is articulate that the court still maintains the discretion, under the new wording of the [amended] statute, whether or not to allow attorney's fees if there is a ... good faith belief that wages were paid.\" That is, the defendant's counsel apparently was contending that the amended version is ambiguous as to whether an award of attorney's fees for an employer's withholding of wages is mandatory or discretionary. In so arguing, the defendant was challenging the plaintiff's assertion that the amended version\n   <em>\n    requires\n   </em>\n   an award of attorney's fees where an employer unlawfully fails to pay an employee wages,\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   his assertion that the amended version\n   applied retroactively and that the employer now was required to prove good faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Moreover, later in that hearing, the following exchange occurred between the defendant's counsel and the court regarding the interpretation of the amended version of \u00a7 31-72 :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \"The Court: The burden of [proving] good faith, right. That is the defendant's burden. Are we clear about that?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \"[The Defendant's Counsel]:\n   <em>\n    We are clear about that\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \"The Court: Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \"[The Defendant's Counsel]: The language,\n   <em>\n    I will concede\n   </em>\n   ...\n   <em>\n    is very clear with respect\n   </em>\n   ...\n   <em>\n    to that\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   After the conclusion of evidence on October 28, 2015, the court reviewed the substance of its anticipated charge with counsel. In particular, the court asked the defendant's counsel the following question: \"[W]ith respect to the wages, I am going to charge what's in the statute. Is there any objection to that?\" The defendant's counsel replied, \"No.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On October 29, 2015, the court charged the jury. The charge contained the following relevant provisions. First, the court recited the amended version of \u00a7 31-72. Second, the court instructed that \"[i]f you do find in favor of the plaintiff [with respect to the claim made under \u00a7 31-72 ], that is, that the defendant unlawfully withheld his pay, you must then determine whether the [defendant] had a good faith belief that the underpayment of wages was in compliance with law. Please be clear that with respect to this element and this element alone,\n   <em>\n    the burden shifts to the defendant to prove to you that the defendant had such a good faith belief\n   </em>\n   .... If you find that the defendant had such a\n   good\n   faith belief, then the defendant is liable to the plaintiff only for the full amount of the unpaid wages. If you find that\n   <em>\n    the defendant failed to prove that it had such a good faith belief\n   </em>\n   , then you\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   award plaintiff twice the amount of unpaid wages. In addition, if the plaintiff prevails on this count, then he is entitled to collect his attorney's fees, although you will not make any determination with respect to attorney's fees. The amount of attorney's fees shall be determined by the court.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   When the court asked if counsel had any exceptions to the charge, the defendant's counsel replied: \"With respect to the request to charge, we would reclaim our objection to the charge that the General Assembly intended that attorney's fees are automatically recoverable under \u00a7 31-72 if a jury finds that a claim for unpaid wages has been sustained. Also, we would object to the inclusion in the charge of General Statutes \u00a7 31-71f\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   to the specific claims in this case because the authority has applied that subsection of the law in cases that are significantly different than claimed here.\" (Footnote\n   added.) The defendant did not raise any other objections to the charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   At no point during the trial court proceedings did the defendant ever argue that the court should instruct on the repealed version of \u00a7 31-72, which placed the burden of proving bad faith on the employee, rather than that statute's amended version. Furthermore, the defendant conceded that the amended version of \u00a7 31-72 places the burden of proving good faith on the employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff on all five counts asserted in his complaint and awarded him $262,930 in damages. In addition, the court awarded the plaintiff $114,742 in attorney's fees and interest, resulting in a total judgment for the plaintiff in the amount of $377,672. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court's jury instructions were improper because they retroactively applied the amended version of \u00a7 31-72 that was enacted after this action was commenced. Specifically, the defendant argues that the court improperly instructed the jury that, pursuant to the amended version of \u00a7 31-72, it\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   award the plaintiff double damages for unlawfully withheld wages\n   <em>\n    unless the defendant\n   </em>\n   establishes that it withheld the wages in good faith. According to the defendant, the court should have instructed the jury on the repealed version of \u00a7 31-72, pursuant to which the plaintiff\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   recover double damages\n   <em>\n    if he\n   </em>\n   proves\n   that the defendant withheld the wages in bad faith. The plaintiff responds that the defendant failed to preserve this claim for appeal and also that it \"induced by [its] own actions the alleged instructional defect that it now challenges.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) We agree with the plaintiff that the defendant induced the alleged instructional impropriety and, thus, decline to review the defendant's claim.\n   We begin with the relevant legal principles. \"This court routinely has held that it will not afford review of\n   <em>\n    claims\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   of error when they have been induced. [T]he term induced error, or invited error, has been defined as [a]n error that a party cannot complain of on appeal because the party, through conduct, encouraged or prompted the trial court to make the erroneous ruling.... It is well established that a party who induces an error cannot be heard to later complain about that error.... This principle bars appellate review of induced nonconstitutional and induced constitutional error.... The invited error doctrine rests on principles of fairness, both to the trial court and to the opposing party.\" (Emphasis added; footnote omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Gorelick\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Montanaro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4059400\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/119/785/#p796\">\n    119 Conn.App. 785\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 796-97,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=990%20A.2d%20371\">\n    990 A.2d 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). \"The rationale for declining to review jury instruction claims when the instructional error was induced ...

[t]he defendant cannot now complain when the trial court's jury instructions were based largely on [its] own proposed draft jury instructions\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Our review of the record reveals that the defendant induced the alleged instructional impropriety by affirmatively requesting\n   the language it now challenges. The defendant filed a written request to charge that cited and quoted the\n   <em>\n    amended\n   </em>\n   version of \u00a7 31-72. In particular, the request quoted the provision of the amended version that imposes liability for double damages on an employer who fails to prove that it withheld wages in good faith. Specifically, the defendant requested the following instruction: \"When any employer [unlawfully] fails to pay an employee wages ... such employee ...\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   recover, in a civil action, (1)\n   <em>\n    twice the full amount of such wages\n   </em>\n   ...\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   (2)\n   <em>\n    if the employer establishes that the employer had a good faith belief\n   </em>\n   that the underpayment of wages was [lawful], the full amount of such wages or compensation ....\" (Emphasis altered; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In accordance with the defendant's written request, the court instructed the jury on the amended version\n   of \u00a7 31-72. It charged the jury, in relevant part: \"If you find that the\n   <em>\n    defendant failed to prove\n   </em>\n   that it had ... a good faith belief [in withholding the plaintiff's wages], then you\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   award the plaintiff twice the amount of unpaid wages.\" (Emphasis added.) Thus, the defendant received an instruction consistent with the language that it had requested. Accordingly, we decline to review the defendant's claim of instructional impropriety because the defendant induced the alleged error of which it now complains.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The defendant also seeks reversal pursuant to the plain error doctrine. Specifically, it argues that the trial court's alleged error in determining that the amended version of \u00a7 31-72 applied retroactively was plain error. The plaintiff responds that \"[p]lain error review is not appropriate in this case\" because the defendant induced the error of which it now complains. He further argues that if we reach the merits of the defendant's plain error claim, the trial court did not err in retroactively applying the amended version of \u00a7 31-72. In particular, the plaintiff argues that although there is no authority addressing whether the amended version of \u00a7 31-72 applies retroactively, retroactive application is consistent with the general legal principles governing the retroactive applicability of statutes. We conclude that, to the extent that the plain error doctrine applies to claims of induced error, the defendant's alleged instructional impropriety does not rise to the level of plain error because it has failed to demonstrate that such error resulted in manifest injustice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We first review the relevant legal principles governing the plain error doctrine.
