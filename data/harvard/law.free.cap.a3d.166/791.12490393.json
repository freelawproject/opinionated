Jordan, appeals from the judgment rendered, following a bench trial, in favor of the plaintiff, Williams Ground Services, Inc., on the plaintiff's claim of payment due for unpaid landscaping and snow plowing services. On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court erred by (1) determining that the statute of limitations had been tolled because he unequivocally acknowledged the debt and (2) admitting certain documents that he argues are inadmissible under various provisions of the Connecticut Code of\n   Evidence. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts, as found by the court, and procedural history are relevant to the resolution of this appeal. The plaintiff's principal, Ronald Williams, beginning in approximately 2001, \"performed lawn, cleanup, lawn maintenance, and snow plowing services\" for the defendant at his single family home in Darien. These services were provided by Williams annually from 2001 through 2013, and were billed to the defendant, who made payments on an irregular and infrequent basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At some point, the plaintiff became aware that the defendant's house was for sale, and the two parties discussed the matter. When the sale of the home was imminent, the defendant asked the plaintiff to plow the driveway so that a moving company could move him out safely. The defendant indicated that the plaintiff would receive a \"fat check\" at the closing. He also indicated that the outstanding bill would be paid in full.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The plaintiff acceded to the defendant's request and plowed the driveway.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On January 6, 2015, the plaintiff commenced this action against the defendant to recover the outstanding balance due for his services. The defendant filed an answer and three special defenses asserting that (1) the plaintiff sought compensation for services he did not provide, (2) the plaintiff was not the entity the defendant knew to have performed work on his property, and (3) the plaintiff was not entitled to the punitive damages and attorney's fees he claimed. The parties subsequently submitted pretrial briefs in which the defendant for the first time raised a statute of limitations defense as a basis for dismissing the action, and the plaintiff argued that the continuing course of conduct doctrine tolled the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On August 18, 2015, following a bench trial, the court issued its memorandum of decision. The court found that the defendant had waived any statute of limitations defense by failing to raise it as a special defense. Alternatively, the court found that the defendant's several acknowledgments of the debt and the conduct of the parties tolled the statute of limitations. The court also found that the defendant had not proved his first and second special defenses, but it found, pursuant to his third special defense, that he had proved that the plaintiff was not entitled to punitive damages or attorney's fees. Finally, the court found in favor of the plaintiff on his claim for unpaid landscaping and snow plowing services, awarded him $32,558.70 in damages with taxable costs, and rendered judgment thereon. This appeal\n   followed. Further facts and procedural history will be set forth as necessary for the resolution of this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The defendant claims that the court erred in finding that the statute of limitations was tolled by, inter alia, his acknowledgments of the debt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Before addressing the court's determination that the applicable statute of limitations was tolled by the defendant's acknowledgments of the debt, we assess the trial court's reliance in this case on\n   <em>\n    Zatakia\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ecoair Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4242666\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/128/362/\">\n    128 Conn.App. 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20A.3d%20604\">\n    18 A.3d 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6779656,6779579,6779621\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/301/936/\">\n    301 Conn. 936\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20A.3d%20729\">\n    23 A.3d 729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011).

We reject this argument because we disagree with the defendant's characterization of the manner in which the court relied on\n   <em>\n    Zatakia\n   </em>\n   . The court quoted\n   <em>\n    Zatakia\n   </em>\n   for the applicable legal standard to determine whether an unequivocal acknowledgment of a debt has tolled the statute of limitations. At no point did the court refer to or rely on the facts of\n   <em>\n    Zatakia\n   </em>\n   as set forth by the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The defendant also claims that, under the rule stated in\n   <em>\n    Zatakia\n   </em>\n   , the conduct of the parties in the present case was insufficient to infer an unequivocal acknowledgment of the debt and, thus, the court's determination was clearly erroneous.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"The [s]tatute of [l]imitations creates a defense to an action. It does not erase the debt. Hence, the defense can be lost by an unequivocal acknowledgment of the debt, such as a new promise, an unqualified recognition of the debt, or a payment on account.... Whether partial payment constitutes unequivocal acknowledgment of the whole debt from which an unconditional promise to pay can be implied thereby tolling the statute of limitations is a question for the trier of fact....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"A general acknowledgment of an indebtedness may be sufficient to remove the bar of the statute. The governing principle is this: The determination of whether a sufficient acknowledgment has been made depends upon proof that the defendant has by an express or implied recognition of the debt voluntarily renounced\n   the protection of the statute\n   .... But an implication of a promise to pay cannot arise if it appears that although the debt was directly acknowledged, this acknowledgment was accompanied by expressions which showed that the defendant did not intend to pay it, and did not intend to deprive himself of the right to rely on the [s]tatute of [l]imitations.... [A] general acknowledgment may be inferred from acquiescence as well as from silence, as where the existence of the debt has been asserted in the debtor's presence and he did not contradict the assertion....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"We review the trial court's finding ... under a clearly erroneous standard.... [A] finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed....

In support of this conclusion, the court relied on the testimony of the plaintiff, stating: \"There was testimony by the plaintiff that the defendant said he was unable to pay the bill. There is testimony that the defendant said 'the property had been sold and the plaintiff would receive a fat check at the closing.' The defendant said 'the plaintiff would be paid when\n   the house was sold.' \" The court also found: \"Exhibit 2 shows payment by the defendant on October 28, 2011, being check [number] 6067 showing a $500 payment with a note on the front that it was 'on account-2011' indicating to this court that there was money due, and this was payment on it.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The defendant argues that evidence presented was insufficient to infer an unequivocal acknowledgment of the debt. Specifically, he asserts that the plaintiff's testimony regarding his promises to pay was \"undocumented, uncorroborated, and self-serving hearsay testimony from the party directly and materially benefitted by said testimony.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, he argues that his testimony contradicts that of the plaintiff. All of these arguments go to credibility and the weight to be given to the evidence presented. Credibility and weight of the evidence are matters for the finder of fact.\n   <em>\n    Baillergeau\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    McMillan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415949\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/143/745/\">\n    143 Conn.App. 745\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 754 n.2,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=72%20A.3d%2070\">\n    72 A.3d 70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Having reviewed the record, we determine that the testimony and other evidence submitted to the court support the\n   court's finding that the defendant unequivocally acknowledged the debt. The defendant acknowledges that the $500 payment could be considered as evidence of his unequivocal acknowledgment of the debt. He does not challenge any finding of the court made on the basis of this evidence. He merely claims that the amount of evidence supporting any such finding\n   is sparse. Although this evidence concerning the $500 payment, standing alone, could be enough to support the court's finding that the defendant acknowledged the debt,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   the court also considered the defendant's various statements that he was unable to pay his outstanding balance, his promise of a \"fat check\" upon closing, and his additional statement that the plaintiff would be paid when his house was sold. Any testimony by the defendant to the contrary, the plaintiff's interest in the outcome, and the plaintiff's lack of documentation and corroboration of the defendant's acknowledgments, are matters of credibility and weight that we do not consider independently on appeal. Accordingly, the defendant has failed to carry his burden of proving that the court's finding was clearly erroneous. The court's conclusion that the statute of limitations had been tolled by the defendant's several acknowledgments of the debt thus was not error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The defendant also claims that the court erred by admitting, for the truth of their contents, certain photocopies of invoices, which he describes as \"yearly summaries,\" of the monthly bills allegedly delivered to the defendant over more than a decade. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The following additional procedural facts are relevant to the resolution of this claim. When the plaintiff sought to admit the first invoice into evidence, which included landscaping charges for services performed over the course of 2001, the defendant objected as follows: \"Your\n   Honor, I'm going to object on the grounds that this is an incomplete business record. It has the top cut off of it. It has no date from when it was created and he doesn't really remember the specifics of when it was created.\" The court responded: \"The objection is overruled. It goes to weight, not admissibility.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On appeal, the defendant claims that the invoices are inadmissible because the yearly summaries were not business records under the legal definition and because the summaries, as photocopies, were incomplete business records and not complete and accurate copies of the originals sufficient to satisfy\n   \u00a7 8-4 (c) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence. We reject this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The defendant objected at trial that the invoices were \"\n   <em>\n    incomplete\n   </em>\n   business record[s],\" and the court, based on its ruling on the objection, understood his objection to go to completeness. The defendant did not seek to clarify or to add other grounds to his objection as each of the twenty-one other invoices was admitted into evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant, therefore, failed to preserve an objection related to a ground other than to lack of completeness.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"Our role in reviewing evidentiary rulings of the trial court is settled.

He testified that the document sought to be admitted into evidence was one of these photocopies. The defendant asked whether the plaintiff had testified at his deposition that he gave \"the originals\" to his attorney. The plaintiff clarified that he had photocopied the copies that he had kept for his records, kept those photocopies, and gave his attorney the copies that he first kept for his records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Section 8-4 (c) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence provides that a \"reproduction, when satisfactorily identified, shall be as admissible in evidence as the original in any judicial or administrative proceeding ....\" Although the defendant argues that the plaintiff sought to admit reproductions into evidence, the plaintiff sought to admit his\n   <em>\n    original business records\n   </em>\n   . His original\n   <em>\n    business records\n   </em>\n   , for the purposes of \u00a7 8-4 (c), were the photocopies of the invoices sent to the defendant that the plaintiff kept for his records. These were the documents that the plaintiff testified were being admitted into evidence. He did not testify that\n   <em>\n    reproductions\n   </em>\n   of business records were being submitted into evidence. The court, therefore, did not abuse its discretion when it admitted the invoices into evidence. In the circumstances of this case, any issue concerning whether they were substantively complete went to the weight to be given them and not to their admissibility.

At trial, the defendant did not object to the court's sua sponte insertion of such tolling doctrine into the case, and he has not raised the issue on appeal as it relates to any of his claims. We thus do not consider whether the court erred by inserting and relying on that doctrine.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    The defendant asserts that the court improperly considered a $2500 payment made by him in 2012 as part of its determination that he acknowledged the debt. As the defendant states, however, the court found that the payment was made as an advance payment and was made \"in order to induce the plaintiff to continue working.\" The court, thus, did not consider this payment in determining that the defendant unequivocally acknowledged the debt.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    As statements of a party opponent, the plaintiff's testimony about the defendant's statements falls within an exception to the hearsay rule.

The $500 payment made in 2011 could have tolled the six year statute of limitations if it applied. Because there also was evidence that the defendant acknowledged the debt within three years of the commencement of the action, we need not decide which statute applies.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    The defendant made his objection to the first landscaping bill for 2001. He seems to have attempted to maintain his objection on the same grounds with respect to other billing documents, stating, \"And if you're comfortable with it Your Honor, for expediency purposes, I don't need to voir dire every single invoice that looks like this,\" to which the court responded, \"Okay.\" The plaintiff submitted twelve other similar annual landscaping invoices, eight snow plowing invoices covering 2003 through 2013, and a single invoice for extra work in 2005, 2008, 2011, and 2013.
