On appeal, the defendant raises various claims pertaining to testimony by the\n   victim's mother\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   that the victim had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD testimony) and the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress statements that he made to the police during a custodial interrogation. With respect to the PTSD testimony, the defendant claims that allowing the victim's mother to testify about his medical conditions constituted a harmful evidentiary error, which was based on the PTSD testimony. With respect to his motion to suppress, the defendant claims that the interrogating detectives violated\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Arizona\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187603\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/451/477/\">\n    451 U.S. 477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187603\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/451/477/\">\n    101 S.Ct. 1880\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187603\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/451/477/\">\n    68 L.Ed.2d 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1981), by continuing to question him after he clearly and unambiguously invoked his right to counsel. Alternatively, the defendant argues that, even if his invocations were ambiguous or equivocal, and therefore ineffective under\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   , article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution required the interrogating detectives to clarify his statements before questioning him further. We reject the defendant's claims and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On the basis of the evidence presented at trial, the jury reasonably could have found the following facts. In 2002, the victim's parents adopted the victim, who had several medical conditions, including autism.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant is the victim's uncle by marriage. The victim and his family had only a casual relationship with the defendant, whom they saw on average three to five times a year for holidays and family events. The victim initially viewed the defendant as \"just an ordinary uncle,\" but, in 2010, when the victim was twelve and the defendant was seventy, the defendant began engaging in sexually inappropriate behavior with the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Three incidents in particular served as the basis for the defendant's conviction. In August, 2010, the victim, the defendant, and other family members went to lunch at a restaurant. After lunch, the defendant and the victim went to use the bathroom. While in the bathroom, the defendant began rubbing his penis and asked the victim to rub it. The victim refused, left the bathroom, and returned to the table where his family was sitting. In December, 2011, the victim and his father went to the defendant's house to visit his grandparents, who lived with the defendant and his wife. While the defendant and the victim's father spoke to the victim's grandfather in the basement apartment, the victim went upstairs to find the defendant's cats. The victim found one of the cats in the defendant's bedroom and began playing with it on the defendant's bed. Sometime thereafter, the defendant came into the bedroom and had contact with the victim's penis in a sexual and indecent manner. Finally, in August, 2013, the defendant and other members of the victim's family went to the victim's middle school to watch him perform in a school play. After the play, the defendant went to use the school bathroom, and the victim followed him inside so that he could remove his makeup. While in the bathroom, the defendant had contact with the victim's penis in a sexual and indecent manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In September, 2013, the victim's mother found pictures on the victim's Nintendo DS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   game console that concerned her, including pictures of the clothed stomachs of the defendant and the victim's father and two pictures of circumcised penises.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The victim's mother deleted the penis pictures. Later, she told the victim's father about the pictures she found and asked him to talk to the victim about them. Two weeks later, on Saturday, September 28, 2013, the victim's father\n   engaged in a discussion with the victim about his sexuality.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The victim's father asked if the victim liked girls or boys, to which the victim replied that he liked girls. The victim's father explained that, in the eyes of the Catholic Church, it is bad and a sin to like boys and that sex should occur between a man and a woman. The victim then acknowledged that he had started to like and think about boys but maintained, \"[i]t's not my fault.\" The victim told his father that the defendant \"has been having sex with me.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The following Monday, September 30, 2013, after the victim left for school, the victim's parents went to the police station to report his allegation. While at the police station, the victim's parents received a phone call from the victim's school social worker informing them that the victim told him that his \"Uncle Robert\" was having sex with him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The defendant was subsequently arrested on the basis of the victim's allegations. The operative long form information charged the defendant with seven offenses in connection with four separate incidents. Relative to the August, 2010 incident, the defendant was charged with risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21(a)(1). Relative to the December, 2011 incident, the defendant was charged with sexual assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-70(a)(1) and risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21(a)(2). Relative to an incident that allegedly occurred in April, 2012, the defendant was charged with sexual assault in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-71(a)(1) and risk of\n   injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21(a)(2). Finally, relative to the August, 2013 incident, the defendant was charged with sexual assault in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-71(a)(1) and risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After a trial, a jury found the defendant guilty of the risk of injury counts with respect to the August, 2010, the December, 2011, and the August, 2013 incidents. The jury found the defendant not guilty of all counts of sexual assault and not guilty of the risk of injury count relative to the alleged incident in April, 2012. The defendant was sentenced to a total effective term of sixteen years of imprisonment, execution suspended after nine years, and ten years of probation. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We begin with the defendant's claims pertaining to the PTSD testimony. The defendant claims that the PTSD testimony was hearsay and constituted a harmful nonconstitutional evidentiary error, and, therefore, the court abused its discretion by denying his motion for a mistrial. In particular, the defendant argues that\n   the PTSD testimony \"constituted an [improper] endorsement or confirmation of [the victim's] credibility-and the defendant's guilt,\" and improperly embraced an ultimate issue in the case, i.e., whether some or all of the events the victim described actually happened, thereby causing his PTSD. The defendant argues that the prejudicial nature of this evidence was beyond the curative powers of the court because the PTSD diagnosis related to the victim's credibility, which was crucial to a successful prosecution because the state's case lacked physical evidence of sexual assault and portions of the victim's testimony \"were highly implausible.\" The state responds that the court's \"clear and forceful curative instructions ... expressly broke any link between the\n   PTSD diagnosis and the charges for which the defendant was on trial ... and expressly removed [the PTSD] testimony ... from evidence entirely.\" As a result, the state argues, the PTSD testimony did not constitute a harmful evidentiary error and the court did not abuse its discretion by denying the defendant's motion for a mistrial. We agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to these claims. The victim's mother was the first witness as the trial commenced. She began her testimony by providing background on the victim and his medical conditions, including his autism. During a colloquy with the prosecutor about other medical conditions that the victim had been diagnosed with, defense counsel objected on the ground of hearsay. The court overruled the objection but admonished the victim's mother to limit her testimony to her understanding of her son's medical conditions and not to testify about what someone else told her. After further discussion about the victim's medical conditions, the following colloquy occurred:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: I think we're missing one or two other conditions, if the-if the court pleases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"The Court: Okay. That's the question then. What other conditions?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Fair enough.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"The Court: Yeah. Go ahead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"[The Victim's Mother]: Okay.\n   <em>\n    He also suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, which was a later diagnosis after why we're here.\n   </em>\n   I'm trying to think what else was on there. I think that's-\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Well, let me ask you this.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"[The Victim's Mother]: Yeah. Okay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Does he take any meds currently?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"[The Victim's Mother]: Yes, he does.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Okay. And what type of meds does he take?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \"[The Victim's Mother]: I'm sorry. He takes Concerta for [attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ]. He-\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Is that one of the-\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"The Court: The jury can be excused for a minute.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Thereafter, the jury exited the courtroom, and the court excused the victim's mother from the witness stand. The court then engaged in a lengthy discussion with counsel about how to address the PTSD testimony. The court observed: \"PTSD is somebody else's opinion that-that a person has suffered a stressful event and is reacting to it. So, it's almost a comment on circumstantial evidence of the credibility of the [victim].\" Defense counsel explained that he had never seen any evidence that the victim had been diagnosed with PTSD and opined: \"I don't know how we cure that at this point.\" Although the prosecutor acknowledged that he was aware of the PTSD diagnosis prior to the PTSD testimony,\n   he maintained that he did not know that the mother would testify about it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The prosecutor further disputed the court's suggestion that the PTSD testimony constituted circumstantial evidence of the credibility of the victim because it was his understanding that the victim was prescribed medication for PTSD based on his symptoms, not based on a discussion with someone about a traumatic event. The court explained: \"As soon as I heard that, I interpreted it-that, as someone\n   treated the [victim]. She said it was related to this event. They determined that it was a valid event and diagnosed him with a reaction to this event. That's my-my interpretation of when a person says, he's treated for PTSD as a result of this event.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   After discussing the import of the statement by the victim's mother with the prosecutor further, the court asked defense counsel for his opinion. Defense counsel stated: \"Your Honor, again, I was not prepared for that. I don't think it can be cured. I move for a mistrial at this point, Your Honor. I think it's an-she says that an expert has diagnosed him with this condition and it relates to the reason that we're here.\" The court and the parties continued to discuss how best to address the PTSD testimony. After a brief recess, the court issued the following ruling: \"Well, I don't think that there's enough for a mistrial at this point. I'll give defense counsel the option. I'll give the strongest instruction possible on this issue of PTSD, and point out to [the jury], as the prosecutor has said, that there's really nothing in the record which would indicate that the-whatever that's about is related to this event. Now, PTSD may-may come up later in the trial, but everything is context. At this point, it's-you know, link it-I would think that the jury would link that to this event, and it's somebody else's opinion about- really, about the credibility of the complainant, or I'll ignore it, if that's what you want.\" Defense counsel stated, \"I feel like I'm in a catch-22,\" because he did not want to highlight the testimony, but he decided that it would be \"prudent that a curative instruction be administered.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   When the jury returned to the courtroom, the court gave the following instruction: \"The witness will be back in a minute, but before she comes back, let me talk about-she said that there was-the PTSD-there was a PTSD diagnosis.\n   <em>\n    That has nothing to do with the evidence in this-in this case. There's nothing in the\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    record that links the PTSD to this case. Ignore it. Don't make any decision in this case, none, based on what she said about PTSD. Just completely and totally ignore it, like it isn't even part of the record, like it isn't even part of the evidence.\n   </em>\n   Okay. All right. She can come back.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We begin our analysis by setting forth the legal principles that govern the defendant's claims. \"When an improper evidentiary ruling is not constitutional in nature, the defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that the error was harmful.... [A] nonconstitutional error is harmless when an appellate court has a fair assurance that the error did not substantially affect the verdict.... [O]ur determination [of whether] the defendant was harmed by the trial court's ... [evidentiary ruling] is guided by the various factors that we have articulated as relevant [to] the inquiry of evidentiary harmlessness ... such as [1] the importance of\n   the ... testimony in the [state's] case, [2] whether the testimony was cumulative, [3] the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony ... on material points, [4] the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and, of course, [5] the overall strength of the [state's] case.... Most importantly, we must examine the impact of the evidence on the trier of fact and the result of the trial.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=311%20Conn.%2080\">\n    311 Conn. 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 89,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20A.3d%20595\">\n    83 A.3d 595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014) ; see also\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bouknight\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12488025\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/149/975/#p626\">\n    323 Conn. 620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 626,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12488025\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/149/975/#p626\">\n    149 A.3d 975\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016) (\"[t]he proper standard for determining whether an erroneous evidentiary ruling is harmless should be whether the jury's verdict was substantially swayed by the error\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \"In our review of the denial of a motion for mistrial, we have recognized the broad discretion that is vested in the trial court to decide whether an occurrence at trial has so prejudiced a party that he or she can no\n   longer receive a fair trial.

After that testimony, the court instructed the jury that the victim's PTSD diagnosis \"has nothing to do with the evidence ... in this case\" and that \"[t]here's nothing in the record that links the PTSD to this case.\" In addition, the court admonished the jury that it was not to \"make any decision in this case, none, based on what [the victim's mother] said about PTSD\" and that they were to \"completely\n   and totally ignore it, like it isn't even part of the record, like it isn't even part of the evidence.\" The defendant has offered no persuasive reason why this prompt, clear, and forceful instruction by the court was insufficient to break the link between the PTSD diagnosis and the charges for which the defendant was on trial and to prevent the jurors from considering this isolated statement by the victim's mother during their deliberations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   We recognize that the state's case was not particularly strong, given the lack of physical or eyewitness evidence, and that, as a result, the victim's testimony was crucial to a successful prosecution.

The defendant argues that his statements (1) \"See, if my lawyer was here, I'd, then I'd, we could talk. That's, you know, that's it,\" and, (2) \"I'm supposed to have my lawyer here. You know that,\" constituted clear and unequivocal invocations of his right to counsel, requiring the detectives to cease all questioning until counsel was present. Alternatively, the defendant argues that even if the disputed statements were ambiguous or equivocal, article first, \u00a7 8, required the detectives to\n   cease questioning immediately and to clarify his statements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree with both contentions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to this claim. On October 17, 2013, Detective Michael Zerella and Sergeant John Ventura interviewed the defendant\n   concerning the victim's allegations (first interview). The defendant agreed to come to the police station to discuss a complaint made against him, but he was not made aware of the nature of the allegations prior to arriving. When it became apparent that he was being accused of engaging in sexually inappropriate conduct with the victim, the defendant explained two instances that he could think of that served as the basis for the victim's complaint, but he maintained that nothing inappropriate happened. Approximately twenty minutes into the interview, Zerella wondered aloud whether, based on what he knew happened, \"(a) you're a sick, perverted person or, or stuff, stuff accidentally happened.\" The following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \"[The Defendant]: Let's, let's, let's stop this here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \"[Zerella]: Or stuff, stuff happened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \"[The Defendant]: It sounds, sounds, sounds, like I need a lawyer, right?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \"[Ventura]: It's up to you.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \"[The Defendant]: I know it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \"[Ventura]: Why would you say that, though? That you need a lawyer?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \"[The Defendant]: Well, it sound, sounds like, well, you, uh ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \"[Ventura]: You could get up and leave any time you want.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \"[The Defendant]: That I could be, possibly be, a sick, perverted person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \"[Zerella]: You didn't, you didn't let me, you didn't let me finish what I was gonna say.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \"[The Defendant]: But it sounds, sounds like you said it, I'm a, sounds like I might, might be a sick, perverted person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \"[Zerella]: Or something innocently happened that, that, that didn't, that didn't mean to happen. That's all. I, we need to know that. That's why I need to know from you the truth. That's, that's what I'm trying to get at here.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The interview continued. Approximately thirty minutes into the interview, however, when Zerella and Ventura began to press\n   the defendant about why the victim would make up these allegations and give \"specific incidents that Uncle Bobby and me had sex together,\" the defendant ended the interview because \"[t]hings are getting strange now.... It's a little bit too strange.\" The defendant was permitted to leave the police station.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   On November 26, 2013, the defendant was arrested and charged with sexual assault in the first degree and risk of injury to a child. That same day, Zerella and Detective Sean Fairbrother interviewed the defendant (second interview). Zerella began the interview by reading the defendant his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   rights and asking him to complete a\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   waiver form. The defendant asked: \"I can still, after, after, after I initial that, I can still stop answering then?\" Zerella replied: \"Oh, anytime you want. No problem.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   After the defendant completed the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   waiver form, Zerella asked the defendant whether he knew why he had been arrested. The defendant explained that he had received a letter from the Department of Children and Families (department) informing him that he was being investigated for allegations of child abuse with respect to the victim. When Zerella asked what he discussed with the department, the defendant stated that he had never talked to anyone from the department. Zerella asked why, and the defendant explained: \"Well,\n   I asked my lawyer, and he said, well, just not to, I, I think that's, I think that's all together wrong, but that's what he said.\" He went on to elaborate that \"my lawyer knows what's going on, you know? But, he says don't talk, I don't talk.\" When Zerella asked him how he felt about that, the defendant stated: \"Well, it's like I said, I probably wouldn't be here now if I talked to them.\" Zerella suggested that if he had elaborated more and been more forthcoming during the first interview, they might not be here. After some discussion about whether and why Zerella called him a pervert during the first interview, Zerella stated: \"Okay, well, we could, we could go on about the last interview if you want to, but-\" The defendant interjected: \"-I know, I know ... let's ... let's go on right, what, what more do you want to know?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   After remarking that the defendant knew he was under arrest and that a judge and prosecutor had found probable cause to arrest him, the defendant observed that it was because \"I didn't talk, that's why.\" Zerella remarked: \"Well, you did, you did talk to me. You did tell me a few things.\" The defendant agreed but acknowledged, \"not enough, I know.\" The defendant then expressed his belief that the victim's parents were acting wrongly by pressing charges against him and his concern that nobody would believe him over the victim's parents because they are both retired members of the police department. Zerella explained that it was the victim, not his parents, who was pressing charges and that he had already corroborated many of the victim's allegations. When Zerella asked the defendant to tell him some of the stories of his encounters with the victim, the defendant opined: \"I don't know the stories that he made up.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Fairbrother asked the defendant whether he knew the crime with which he was charged, and the defendant replied child abuse. Fairbrother explained that he was\n   charged with sexual assault and risk of injury to a child. The defendant asked whether that means that the allegation is that he did something sexual with the victim, and Fairbrother said that it did. The defendant adamantly denied having sexual relations with the victim. When the detectives pressed him about whether there were any moments that could be misconstrued\n   as inappropriate, the defendant responded: \"Well, yes, there's what, well, I, I, my lawyer said not to talk about it but, no, it's.\" The detectives both stated that it was up to the defendant whether to talk with them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The defendant observed that Zerella had told him that there was a picture of him naked on the victim's Nintendo DS during the first interview, and he asked repeatedly whether the picture actually existed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   When Zerella suggested that the defendant had personal knowledge that the picture existed, the defendant insisted that he did not and that he knew about the picture only because Zerella told him about it during the first interview. Zerella maintained that \"there's other, other things, there's other instances beside that,\" and, after the defendant asked what, Zerella observed that \"you just said, there [is] stuff but my lawyer told me not to talk about it.\" The defendant stated that he was referring to the picture. He further asked, \"what else is there,\" and opined that he wanted to know \"what they are pressing against me.\" Thereafter, the following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \"[Zerella]: Alls I got to say is, tomorrow, when you go in to court, you're gonna look at a judge and a prosecutor.... And they're gonna look at all this stuff, all these allegations that were made against you. ... That it's a, it's a very, very strong case against you.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Very, very strong.

On April 28, 2015, the defendant filed a second motion to suppress the statements that he made during the second interview, pursuant to the fifth and fourteenth amendments and article first, \u00a7 8, on the grounds that his statement \"was taken against his rights to counsel, to remain silent, and self-incrimination.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court was provided with a video recording and transcript of the second interview. A suppression hearing was held during trial on April 29, 2015, during which the court heard the brief testimony of Zerella and argument from counsel. At the end of the hearing, the court issued an oral ruling denying the defendant's motion to suppress.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   We begin by setting forth the legal principles that guide our analysis of the defendant's claim that the detectives violated\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   by continuing to question\n   him after he clearly and unequivocally invoked his right to counsel during the second interview.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Arizona\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/#p469\">\n    384 U.S. 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 469-73,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/#p469\">\n    86 S.Ct. 1602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/#p469\">\n    16 L.Ed.2d 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1966), the United States Supreme Court held that \"a suspect subject to custodial interrogation has the right to consult with an attorney and to have counsel present during questioning, and that the police must explain this right to him before questioning begins. ...

At the outset of the interview, the defendant\n   was informed of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights and waived them in writing. Shortly thereafter, the defendant told the detectives that he had consulted an attorney after he received a notice from the department concerning its investigation into the victim's allegations and that the attorney advised him \"not to talk about it.\" The defendant repeatedly expressed his misgivings with that advice and his belief that he would not have been arrested had he spoken with the department concerning the victim's allegations. Moreover, after referencing his attorney's advice \"not to talk about it,\" the defendant continued to talk to the detectives about the victim's allegations. Indeed, on one occasion, he opined that his attorney did not want him to talk about any moments that could be misconstrued as inappropriate, e.g., the picture purportedly on the victim's Nintendo DS, and then he proceeded to ask about the picture Zerella mentioned during the first interview. Finally, in the moments leading up to the disputed statements, it was evident that the defendant wanted both to avoid discussing his side of the story and to obtain more information about the victim's allegations and the evidence against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In light of these preceding circumstances, the defendant's first reference to counsel-\"See, if my lawyer was here, I'd, then I'd, we could talk.

This statement might well have been an attempt to persuade the detectives to limit the scope of the interview to the victim's allegations and the detectives' evidence, a reiteration of his attorney's advice that he should not discuss his\n   side of the story without counsel present, a request for an attorney, or something else entirely. Because of this ambiguity in the statement, it cannot be considered an effective invocation of the right to counsel under\n   <em>\n    Edwards.\n   </em>\n   The defendant argues that his next reference to counsel-\"I'm supposed to have my lawyer here. You know that\"-clarified any ambiguity. We disagree. This statement could also mean that the defendant simply believed that it was prudent for him to have an attorney present when speaking to authorities, not that he actually wanted to speak to an attorney before proceeding further with the interview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Accordingly, we conclude that the court properly denied the defendant's motion to suppress because he did not clearly and unequivocally invoke his right to counsel and, therefore, the detectives were not required to cease questioning him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Alternatively, the defendant argues that even if his invocation of the right to counsel was ambiguous or equivocal, the self-incrimination and due process clauses of article first, \u00a7 8, of our state constitution required the detectives to cease questioning immediately and to clarify his ambiguous references to counsel.

As a matter of state constitutional law, interrogating officers are not required to clarify ambiguous or equivocal references to an attorney.

In essence, the bright-line approach adopted by\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   prioritizes society's interest in effective law enforcement whereas the clarification approach the defendant advocates prioritizes the individual's right not to say something that may incriminate him by securing the advice of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Having performed a complete\n   <em>\n    Geisler\n   </em>\n   analysis of the defendant's state constitutional claim in this appeal, we conclude that article first, \u00a7 8, does not provide greater protection than the federal constitution with respect to ambiguous or equivocal references to counsel during a custodial interrogation. Having reviewed our own constitutional language, precedents and history, we cannot discern any meaningful difference between the state and federal constitutional protections against compulsory self-incrimination that would justify or require a \"third layer of prophylaxis\" that the United States Supreme Court has found to be unnecessary. Moreover, the vast majority of our sister states have concluded that their state constitutions do not afford greater protections than the federal constitution in this context. Although some states have elected to adopt the clarification approach as a matter of state constitutional law, the reasoning in those decisions is not persuasive. Finally, although the defendant's position finds some support in the academic and legal communities, we do not believe that countervailing policy arguments are sufficient justification to diverge from our Supreme Court's well established precedent holding that our self-incrimination and due process clauses are coextensive\n   with the federal self-incrimination and due process clauses. We therefore decline to adopt a new state constitutional standard at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Nonetheless, we believe that it is appropriate in this opinion to reiterate the advice offered by the United States Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   : \"[W]hen a suspect makes an ambiguous or equivocal statement\n   <em>\n    it will often be good police practice for the interviewing officers to clarify whether or not he actually wants an attorney\n   </em>\n   .... Clarifying questions help protect the rights of the suspect by ensuring that he gets an attorney if he wants one, and will minimize the chance of a confession being suppressed due to subsequent judicial second-guessing as to the meaning of the suspect's statement regarding counsel.\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39831\" index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/452/#p457\">\n    512 U.S. at 461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39831\" index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/452/#p457\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    General Statutes \u00a7 53-21 provides in relevant part: \"(a) Any person who (1) wilfully ... causes or permits any child under the age of sixteen years to be placed in such a situation that ... the morals of such child are likely to be impaired ... or (2) has contact with the intimate parts ... of a child under the age of sixteen years ... in a sexual and indecent manner likely to impair the health or morals of such child ....\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    \"Intimate parts\" means, in relevant part, \"the genital area ....\" General Statutes \u00a7 53a-65(8).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    In accordance with our policy of protecting the privacy interests of the victims of the crime of risk of injury to a child, we decline to identify the victim or others through whom the victim's identity may be ascertained.
