Following the accident, Mr. Reger was diagnosed with significant injuries, primarily to his back and neck, and was unable to perform his custodial work. Mr. Reger thereafter sought and received two different sets of disability benefits from the Employer and respondent Maryland Association of Boards of Education Compensation Self-Insurance Fund (\"Insurer\"), each awarded by a different state agency: he was granted temporary total disability benefits by the Workers' Compensation Commission (\"WCC\" or \"the Commission\") and ordinary disability retirement benefits by the State Retirement Agency, the administrative arm of the Maryland State Retirement and Pension System (\"MSRPS\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Employer and Insurer (collectively, \"Respondents\") subsequently petitioned the WCC to offset Mr. Reger's ordinary disability benefits against his temporary total disability benefits pursuant to the statutory offset provision in Maryland Code (1991, 2008 Repl. Vol.), Labor and Employment Article (\"LE\") \u00a7 9-610.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Commission agreed, finding that the\n   Respondents were entitled to a credit for the ordinary disability benefits already paid to Mr. Reger in the amount of $54,486.50, with that credit to be applied to any \"future Awards of indemnity\" assessed against Respondents in favor of Mr. Reger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mr. Reger petitioned for judicial review of the WCC's decision before the Circuit Court for Washington County. After holding a hearing as to cross-motions for summary judgment, the circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of the Commission, holding that \"[a]s a matter of law in this case, the benefits are indeed within the statute similar and therefore the statutory offset applies.\" Mr. Reger noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals from the circuit court's ruling and, in an\n   unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment of the circuit court. Mr. Reger thereafter petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari, which we granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The sole issue presented by this appeal is whether the WCC correctly applied LE \u00a7 9-610 to find that the Respondents were entitled to offset the ordinary disability benefits already paid to Mr. Reger against the temporary total disability benefits paid to him by the Respondents. We shall affirm the WCC's finding. Under the circumstances of this case, both sets of benefits were awarded to compensate Mr. Reger for the same back and neck injuries. Because both sets of benefits compensated Mr. Reger for the same injury, pursuant to LE \u00a7 9-610, the benefits were legally \"similar benefits,\" and the statutory offset properly applied to prevent a double recovery for the same injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    The Work Accident\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   For approximately 29 years, Mr. Reger worked as a custodian for the Washington County Board of Education. On November 12, 2007, while working at Williamsport High School, a large folding cafeteria table fell on Mr. Reger while he was moving it, pinning him to the ground. Mr. Reger suffered injuries to his neck, back, left leg, and left elbow. Immediately after the accident, Mr. Reger was unable to perform his regular duty custodial work, but was able to return to work on light-duty. His final day of work as a custodian was in May of 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    The Initial Medical Treatment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On February 29, 2008, roughly three and a half months after his work injury, Mr. Reger saw Dr. Thomas Larkin at Parkway Neuroscience and Spine Institute about his injuries. Mr. Reger's medical records from that visit indicate a diagnosis of \"SPONDYLOLISTHESIS (738.4).\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Reger returned for a follow-up visit to Dr. Larkin's practice on March 19, 2008, where a second diagnosis of \"CERVICAL STENOSIS (723.0)\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   was added. Dr. Larkin saw Mr. Reger for additional follow-up visits on June 4, July 2, and September 10, 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Workers' Compensation Claim\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Following the November 12, 2007 accident, Mr. Reger received initial temporary\n   total disability payments from the Insurer from March 6, 2008, through July 15, 2008. On July 18, 2008, Mr. Reger, through counsel, filed a claim with the Workers' Compensation Commission based on injuries sustained in the accident. In his claim, Mr. Reger stated that the accident occurred when he was \"moving [a] large cafeteria table-table fell on me and I fell to [the] floor hurting my back, neck, and hand and legs.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On November 7, 2008, the WCC held a hearing on Mr. Reger's claim. At that hearing, Mr. Reger's counsel provided the WCC with a surgical recommendation from a physician at the University of Maryland Medical Center that Mr. Reger undergo \"lumbar\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   surgery,\" which would involve a \"L5-S1 decompression with fusion and stabilization.\" On that basis, Mr. Reger's counsel requested that Mr. Reger continue to receive temporary total disability benefits until he could undergo the surgery. Counsel for the Employer and Insurer contested whether the proposed surgery was causally related to the November 12, 2007 accident and argued that Mr. Reger was capable of working.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In an attempt to prove a causal connection between the accident and the contemplated surgery, Mr. Reger's counsel asked him a series of questions during direct examination. Mr. Reger testified that he had never missed any time from work or sought any medical treatment for \"any back problems\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   prior to the November 12, 2007 accident. When questioned about an earlier 2004 injury involving a file cabinet, Mr. Reger acknowledged receiving an MRI and going to \"some physical therapy\" as a result of that incident, but denied that the incident had resulted in any back problems. He also testified that he went back to performing custodial work after the 2004 injury, describing it as \"very physical work\" that included regular bending and lifting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The WCC entered an order finding that Mr. Reger had reached maximum medical recovery and that the requested lumbar surgery was not causally related to the November 12 accident. On November 24, 2008, Mr. Reger filed a request for rehearing before the WCC. Attached as an exhibit, he provided a letter from his treating physician, Dr. Larkin, that stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [Mr. Reger] had a pre-existing spondylolisthesis in which he managed to work effectively for years with this problem until he had an accident at work. This temporal relationship of his accident indicates to me that there is a reasonable degree of medical certainty that his current condition is a result of his accident at work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The WCC denied Mr. Reger's request for a rehearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Thereafter, Mr. Reger timely sought judicial review of the WCC's decision in the Circuit Court for Washington County. A one-day jury trial was held on September 9, 2009. The jury returned a verdict finding that Mr. Reger's lumbar surgery was causally related to the November 12 accidental injury. On September 16, 2009, the circuit court vacated the order of the WCC and remanded the case to the WCC for entry of an order finding,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   1 Mr. Reger has not attained maximum medical improvement with regard to his work-related back injury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   2 That Mr. Reger's need for back surgery is causally connected to the accidental injury of November 12, 2007; and\n   3 Mr. Reger was temporarily totally disabled from July 16, 2008 to September 9, 2009[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    The Application for Disability Retirement Benefits\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   While Mr. Reger's petition for judicial review of the WCC decision that he had reached maximum medical recovery was pending before the Washington County circuit court, he sought benefits through a different avenue and filed an application with the State Retirement Agency for accidental disability retirement benefits on or about February 23, 2009. In the \"Statement of Disability\" section to be completed by the applicant, Mr. Reger was asked to describe his \"disability or medical condition.\" His response indicated conditions to his lower back, neck, shoulder, left leg, and left hand. He also described how he could not physically perform certain functions of his job, including climbing steps or ladders, standing for a long time, lifting items, mowing grass, scrubbing doors, shoveling snow, etc. In the application, Mr. Reger's witness described the November 12 accident stating, \"[Mr. Reger] was moving a folding table with assistance of [another custodian] when table lost balance and fell on Mr. Reger's legs and put him to the floor, landing hard on his back.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As part of the application, Mr. Reger's treating physician, Dr. Larkin, signed a Physician's Medical Report and described Mr. Reger's medical history as including \"cervical spinal stenosis\" and \"lumbosacral spondylosis,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   with \"cervical pain that radiates into [his lower] shoulder [and] thoracic spine, and low back pain that radiates into [his lower] calf.\" Dr. Larkin further noted that Mr. Reger was unable to work at the time of the application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On August 19, 2009, the Medical Board of the State Retirement Agency issued its written recommendation, which stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   It is the recommendation of the Medical Board that [Mr. Reger]\n   <em>\n    be approved ordinary disability\n   </em>\n   due to cervical spondylosis and stenosis lumbar spondylosis. The medical evidence submitted supports a conclusion that the member\n   is permanently disabled and unable to perform his job duties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   However, the Medical Board denied\n   <em>\n    accidental disability\n   </em>\n   since the evidence submitted concerning the accident did not prove that this event caused the permanent disability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On September 15, 2009, the Disability Unit of the State Retirement Agency transmitted a letter to Mr. Reger accepting the Medical Board's recommendation, that Mr. Reger was \"entitled to an\n   <em>\n    ordinary disability, due to Cervical Spondylosis and Stenosis\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lumbar Spondylosis\n   </em>\n   .\" Mr. Reger's accidental disability claim, however, was denied based on the Medical Board's recommendation. The letter outlined three options for Mr. Reger,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   1. Accept an ordinary disability retirement allowance and withdraw your claim for an accidental disability retirement allowance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   2. Accept an ordinary disability retirement allowance and pursue your\n   claim for an accidental disability retirement allowance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   3. Accept a service retirement, if eligible or continue to receive your service retirement allowance and pursue your claim for an accidental disability retirement allowance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On November 12, 2009, Mr. Reger submitted a letter of intent to the Medical Board Secretary electing the first option and withdrawing his accidental disability retirement claim. Mr. Reger began receiving ordinary disability benefits from the MSRPS on a payment schedule that began on his date of retirement, March 1, 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    Lower Back Surgery\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On December 1, 2009, Mr. Reger presented to Dr. Charles Sansur for a surgical consultation and examination. Dr. Sansur wrote to Dr. Larkin, Mr. Reger's treating physician for his back and neck symptoms, and stated that Mr. Reger \"was found to have a resultant spine injury from [the November 12, 2007] accident and has a diagnosis of a L5-S1 spondylolisthesis\n   with pars fractures bilaterally.\" On March 10, 2010, Mr. Reger underwent lumbar surgery-a surgical fusion at L5-S1-and, thereafter, participated in rehabilitative treatment. At some point during the course of Mr. Reger's surgical or post-surgical treatment, Dr. Sansur gave him a permanent restriction on returning to work as a custodian due to the condition of his back and neck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    Subsequent WCC Proceedings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   After Mr. Reger's surgery, a follow-up independent medical examination (\"IME\")-was conducted by orthopedic surgeon Robert A. Smith, M.D.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In his IME report dated September 23, 2010, Dr. Smith indicated that Mr. Reger had reached maximum medical improvement from the \"Grade I spondylolisthesis\" resulting from his work accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Thereafter, Mr. Reger once again filed issues with the WCC, and on January 5, 2011, Mr. Reger appeared once more before the WCC. At this hearing, Mr. Reger again testified at the WCC hearing that prior to the November 12, 2007 accident, he had never had any discomfort or sought treatment for a problem with his neck. Mr. Reger requested the continuation of temporary total disability benefits, this time based upon a recommendation from Dr. Sansur for cervical spine and left elbow surgery. Mr. Reger presented a report from Dr. Sansur, dated November 6, 2010, which stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Mr. Charles Reger has a known problem with spinal stenosis in both the lumbar and cervical spine. He also has an ulnar neuropathy. While the accident in 2007 is not the exact cause of [Mr. Reger's] spinal stenosis, it is quite clear that such an incident certainly exacerbated his symptoms and resulted in him requiring further medical and surgical treatment. While his lower back has been treated, the cervical spine and ulnar neuropathy appear to [be]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   progressing, and it is my feeling that these conditions have been worsened by the accident. He continues to be unable to work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Employer and Insurer contended that the elbow and spine injuries for which Mr. Reger was seeking surgery were not causally related to his November 12, 2007 accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In an order dated January 10, 2011, the WCC found that Mr. Reger was entitled to temporary total disability from September 25, 2010, and continuing \"until the completion of an independent neurosurgical evaluation and assessment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The WCC found\n   that the disability to Mr. Reger's elbow was not causally related to the November 12 accident and reserved ruling on whether the cervical spine injury was causally connected to the accident until the independent neurosurgical report was submitted. The parties engaged Kevin McGrail, M.D., to conduct another IME and prepare the neurosurgical report. On April 5, 2011, Dr. McGrail completed his report, which stated in pertinent part,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   The history, which I obtained from [Mr. Reger] in the office today, as well as the medical records reveal that [Mr. Reger] suffered a work-related accident which occurred on [November 12, 2007]. He was working as a custodian for the Board of Education in Washington County, Maryland. He was moving a large table when that table fell on him knocking him to the ground.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Following this traumatic injury, [Mr. Reger] complained of pain and discomfort involving his neck, upper extremities, as well as his lower back .... His back pain and lower extremity pain persisted and became unmanageable with conservative measures ... [S]urgery was recommended, and on [March 10, 2010] Mr. Reger underwent an instrumented lumbar spinal fusion at the L5-S1 level ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Mr. Reger also has a history of numbness, tingling[,] and pain in [his left arm] ... [He] was found to have compressive\n   neuropathy\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   of both the left ulnar and left median nerves ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   The medical records and history I obtained from Mr. Reger did indicate that he suffered the aforementioned traumatic injury [on November 12, 2007], which resulted in neck and low-back pain [ ]. He tells me that prior to this time he did have some issues with pain and discomfort in the lumbar spine but it was not constant, much lower in intensity[,] and clearly seemed to be manageable with conservative measures. Although Mr. Reger's L5-S1 grade 2 spo [n]dylolithesis was congenital and degenerative, the accident seemed to have significantly aggravated this condition to the point where it became unmanageable with anything but a surgical procedure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   Based on his history, it does seem that the traumatic incident was an aggravating factor to both his back pain and his ultimate requirement for surgery. I do not think, however, that the accident has anything to do with the [left arm] ulnar and median neuropathy...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   I think Mr. Reger has clearly reached a point of maximal medical recovery ... I hold all of the above opinions to a reasonable degree of medical certainty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   After reviewing the neurosurgical report, the WCC denied coverage for Mr. Reger's cervical surgery on or about November 11, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Mr. Reger filed a petition for judicial review of that decision on December 14, 2011. Following another one-day jury trial on August 8, 2012, the WCC's order was vacated and the case was remanded to the WCC for entry of an order finding Mr. Reger's second proposed surgery to be causally related to the November 12, 2007 accidental injury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Request for Benefit Offset\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   On October 23, 2013, the Employer and Insurer filed issues with the WCC arguing that, under LE \u00a7 9-610, the benefits paid for Mr. Reger's injury through workers' compensation should be offset by Mr. Reger's ordinary disability benefits. On November 8, 2013, another hearing was held before the WCC. Mr. Reger's counsel claimed at that hearing that the two benefits were \"not at all [for] the same condition\" and that \"there is clear evidence that there is pre-existing [injury].\" Mr. Reger's counsel further argued that when the State Retirement Agency granted Mr. Reger ordinary disability benefits and denied accidental disability benefits it was \"essentially saying we don't believe this [was] accident related and we believe it is due to some other things\" such as a \"degenerative condition.\" And, he claimed that \"the law is clear that there is no offset for ordinary [disability benefits].\" Therefore, he contended that the WCC was bound by that State Retirement Agency determination that the benefits were for ordinary disability benefits and could not offset those benefits. Counsel for the Employer and Insurer countered that both benefits stemmed from the November 12, 2007 accidental injury, and that under LE \u00a7 9-610 the General Assembly clearly \"want[ed] to prevent a public employee from receiving benefits from two sources for the same problem.\" By order dated November 13, 2013, the WCC found that the Employer and Insurer were entitled to an offset under LE \u00a7 9-610.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In that order, the WCC stated that Mr. Reger had been paid for three previous periods for which he had been granted temporary total disability benefits by the Commission-from July 16, 2008 to September 9, 2009\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   (granted by order of the WCC after Mr. Reger's first successful petition for judicial\n   review to the circuit court), from September 25, 2010 to January 14, 2011 (granted by order of the WCC on an interim basis following Mr. Reger's second claim for additional workers' compensation benefits until the WCC had the opportunity to review an independent neurosurgical evaluation and assessment), and from March 5, 2011 to July 28, 2013 (apparently\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   granted by order of the WCC sometime after Mr. Reger's second successful petition for judicial review to the circuit court). The Commission's order stated that the sum of Mr. Reger's temporary total disability benefits paid during all three periods was $91,125.86.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Commission found that during all three periods in which Mr. Reger received temporary total disability benefits, he also received ordinary disability retirement benefits. And, the Commission found that the sum of the ordinary disability retirement benefits paid to Mr. Reger during those three periods was $62,808.68. Therefore, the Commission found that the Employer and Insurer were \"entitled to a credit of $62,808.68 against future awards\n   of indemnity\" assessed against them by the WCC in favor of Mr. Reger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Commission also found that Mr. Reger was entitled to receive temporary total disability benefits from January 15, 2011 to March 4, 2011 and July 29, 2013 to November 18, 2013.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   When adding the new periods of temporary total disability to the extant periods, Mr. Reger ultimately received temporary total disability for two periods: from July 16, 2009 to September 9, 2009, and from September 25, 2010 to November 8, 2013. To reflect the newly added periods of Mr. Reger's temporary total disability, the Commission reduced the Employer and Insurer's $62,808.50 credit by $8322.28, leaving a credit balance of $54,486.50. Consequently, until the remaining\n   credit balance was exhausted, the Commission determined that Mr. Reger was not entitled to additional workers' compensation benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    Appeal to Circuit Court from Benefit Offset Ruling\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Mr. Reger petitioned for judicial review of the WCC's decision on November 22, 2013 pursuant to LE \u00a7 9-737,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   and requested a jury trial pursuant to LE \u00a7 9-745(d) (\"On a motion of any party filed with the clerk of the court in accordance with the practice in civil cases, the court shall submit to a jury any question of fact involved in the case\"). Both parties filed motions for summary judgment and, on September 24, 2014, the circuit court held a hearing on the cross-motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   At the summary judgment hearing, Mr. Reger's counsel argued that the ordinary disability benefits that Mr. Reger received were awarded for a permanent partial disability, and thus were dissimilar as a matter of law to his temporary and total disability benefits awarded through the WCC. When questioned by the circuit court judge as to why he likened ordinary disability benefits to permanent partial disability, Mr. Reger's counsel stated that they were equivalent \"because Mr. Reger is not precluded from returning to work [in a light-duty job] by receipt of ordinary disability [benefits], whereas [if he receives] accidental disability [benefits], he may not do any work of any kind.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Mr. Reger's counsel also reiterated the argument made before the WCC that Mr. Reger's ordinary disability benefits were \"based solely on his [pre-existing] spondylotic spinal changes, which is why the [State Retirement Agency] gave him ordinary disability, not accidental disability.\" The circuit court judge questioned him as to that claim,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   CIRCUIT COURT JUDGE: ... [I]n this case, you have the [S]tate [R]etirement [A]gency saying the board of trustees accepted the medical board's certification that [Mr. Reger was] entitled to an ordinary disability due to cervical spondylosis and stenosis lumbar spondylosis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   MR. REGER'S COUNSEL: Right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   CIRCUIT COURT JUDGE: Cervical and lumbar.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   MR. REGER'S COUNSEL: Yes. Back and neck.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   CIRCUIT COURT JUDGE: Same reports were provided, you know, I think Dr. Larkin said there was some preexisting. There's also exacerbation that's also related to Workers [Compensation]. Same reports are submitted to the [S]tate [R]etirement [A]gency.

REGER'S COUNSEL: True.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In response to Mr. Reger's arguments, counsel for the Employer and Insurer contended that Mr. Reger's November 12, 2007 work accident was the basis for his request for workers' compensation benefits as wells as his request for disability retirement benefits. And, counsel asserted that \"the same physical incapacity\" arising from the 2007 accident \"formed the basis for both the Workers['] Compensation [Comission] award and the retirement award.\" Counsel noted that Mr. Reger had testified three times during prior proceedings before the WCC that he had never experienced physical problems with his neck or back in performing his job duties prior to the 2007 accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Counsel for the Employer and Insurer disagreed with Mr. Reger's counsel's claim that an award of ordinary disability retirement benefits is equivalent to permanent partial disability. He also disputed Mr. Reger's claim that the ordinary\n   disability retirement benefits could not be offset as a matter of law,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   It doesn't matter whether [the retirement benefit] was accidental or ordinary. It matters whether or not the conditions for which he was granted both benefits are the same. And they are. He cannot say that-I was granted these ordinary disability benefits because of spondylosis in his back and in his neck. He didn't even know he had it .... [Mr. Reger's] position that he should receive both ordinary disability [retirement] benefits and his Workers ['] Compensation [Commission] benefits is the exact type of [ ] double-dipping that the [l]egislature intended to prevent when enacting [ LE \u00a7] 9-610 and its predecessor [statutes].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   After hearing the parties' respective arguments, the circuit court judge issued his summary judgment ruling on the record, stating,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   Now in the instant case, the same medical records were used to receive both the ordinary retirement disability payment as well as the Workers' Compensation awards in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   The injury occurred November 12th, 2007. The Workers' Compensation claim [was] first filed May 27, 2008. That resulted in a [c]ircuit [c]ourt order where a jury reversed, as I recall, the Commission's order. It said the [proposed] back surgery was causally related to the November 12th, 2007 accident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   And then September 15th, 2009, the state retirement agency accepted [Mr. Reger's] claim for ordinary disability retirement benefits based both on lumbar and cervical problems specifically due to cervical spondylosis and stenosis, lumbar spondylosis. And that's in the letter [from Dr. Larkin] that was attached to the papers. And, again, it's the same medical records for both claims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   So in using the Reynolds v.

Mr. Reger contrasts ordinary disability benefits with accidental disability benefits, which the State Retirement Agency awards for accidental workplace injuries and are thus, according to Mr. Reger, \"perfectly analogous to workers' compensation benefits.\" Mr. Reger also maintains that the legislative history of LE \u00a7 9-610, in particular an amendment to the statute enacted in 1997, indicates that the General Assembly intended the offset to apply solely to accidental disability benefits. Therefore, he claims that the Commission, the circuit court, and the Court of Special Appeals erred in holding that Mr. Reger's ordinary disability benefits were \"similar benefits\" to his temporary total disability benefits, and thus subject to the statutory offset.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Even if ordinary disability benefits were subject to the offset in LE \u00a7 9-610, Mr. Reger also contends that the offset should not apply in his case. He asserts that the State Retirement Agency awarded him ordinary disability retirement benefits \"based solely on [ ] preexisting degenerative back problems.\" And, he further claims that the Medical Board of the State Retirement Agency \"very specifically found Mr. Reger was not disabled because of his [accidental] injury of November 12,\n   2007\" that was the basis for the temporary total disability benefits he was awarded by the WCC. Because, in his view, his ordinary disability benefits and temporary\n   total disability benefits were granted based upon entirely distinct and separate injuries, he contends that \"they are not similar benefits within the meaning of [ LE \u00a7 9-610 ].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Mr. Reger insists that the Court of Special Appeals failed to recognize that the State Retirement Board awarded and paid him ordinary disability benefits based upon his degenerative back injuries and instead improperly focused on the fact that he had applied for accidental disability benefits based on the same November 12, 2007 accidental injury that was the basis for his WCC benefits. He claims that the Court of Special Appeals has thereby \"punished him for asking for[,] but not being paid[,] accidental disability retirement benefits by denying him his workers' compensation benefits.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   In contrast, the Respondents maintain that cases interpreting LE \u00a7 9-610 and its predecessor statutes have made clear that the General Assembly intended to ensure a \"single recovery for a single injury\" for public employees, and to prevent double payment from the public purse to a governmental employee who is covered by both a pension or other benefit plan and the workers' compensation statute. And, Respondents contend that LE \u00a7 9-610 was not limited to offsetting only accidental disability benefits, as it is clear from the language of the statute that \"there was never any intent by the Legislature to limit [that] offset to pension benefits, let alone one particular type of pension benefits.\" Respondents also offer a policy argument that construing the offset to apply solely to accidental disability benefits would increase instances of double recovery, as employees could easily avoid the offset by choosing to apply for ordinary disability benefits instead of accidental disability benefits from the State Retirement Agency, while also applying for workers' compensation benefits from the WCC for the same injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Instead, Respondents assert that the only limiting language in LE \u00a7 9-610 is that the offset only applies to \"similar benefits.\" Respondents claim that, in this case, the ordinary disability benefits paid to Mr. Reger by the MSRPS are \"similar benefits\" to his workers' compensation benefits and,\n   consequently, the Commission, the circuit court, and the Court of Special Appeals did not err in holding that the offset in LE \u00a7 9-610 applied. Respondents note that in\n   <em>\n    Newman v. Subsequent Injury Fund\n   </em>\n   this Court held that service retirement benefits awarded solely based on age and length of service had \"no relation whatsoever to [an employee's accidental] injury and the disability resulting therefrom,\" and therefore were not \"similar\" to workers' compensation benefits under the predecessor statute to LE \u00a7 9-610.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2071728\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/311/721/#p724\">\n    311 Md. 721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 724,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2071728\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/311/721/#p724\">\n    537 A.2d 274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988). Respondents contend that \"[i]mplicit in the\n   <em>\n    Newman\n   </em>\n   rationale is that when there is a relationship and both the [workers' compensation benefit] and the pension benefit result from or were triggered by the same injury, incapacity, or disability, they are legally 'similar.' \" Respondents also urge us to rely upon the holding in\n   <em>\n    Reynolds v. Board of Education of Prince George's County\n   </em>\n   , where the Court of Special Appeals upheld the application of the LE \u00a7 9-610 offset when an employee received both ordinary disability benefits and workers' compensation benefits based in part upon the Court of Special Appeals' holding that both benefits were awarded based on \"a single medical condition\" and the \"same physical incapacity\" that occurred when the employee's preexisting asthmatic condition was triggered by her exposure to\n   diesel fuel and fumes while at work.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"825482\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/127/648/\">\n    127 Md.

In support of that claim, Respondents note that Mr. Reger \"never experienced any physical limitation in the performance of his job duties prior to the November 12, 2007 accident,\" and that he submitted the same medical records and relied upon the November 12, 2007 accident before both the WCC and the State Retirement Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Finally, Respondents criticize Mr. Reger's reliance on the Medical Board recommendations and State Retirement Agency's decision to award Mr. Reger ordinary disability benefits, and to deny him accidental disability benefits. They insisted that the Medical Board's recommendation and State Retirement Agency's decision do not suggest that those benefits are not similar to Mr. Reger's temporary total disability benefits, noting that \"[i]rrespective of the label given the disability benefit provided by the [State Retirement Agency] ... it is without question that the dual benefits [Mr. Reger] received as a result of a disability triggered by the same event are subject to offset under [LE] \u00a7 9-610.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The amici curiae agree with the Respondents that \"the same injury can result in an\n   <strong>\n    ordinary\n   </strong>\n   disability retirement [benefit] and a compensable workers' compensation claim, but may not result in an\n   <strong>\n    accidental\n   </strong>\n   disability award.\" And, the amici agree with the Respondents that, in such a case, the statutory offset in LE \u00a7 9-610 should apply. However, the amici also urge this Court to make a somewhat broader ruling than that urged by the Respondents. The amici claim that \"[t]o ensure that a governmental employer is not required to pay double benefits for the same injury,\" this Court should hold that the offset in LE \u00a7 9-610 applies \"to ordinary disability [retirement] benefits to the same extent that it applies to accidental disability [retirement] benefits when the reason for the disability payment includes the same body part for which workers' compensation benefits are awarded.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   In order to resolve whether the WCC properly applied the statutory offset provision, we shall first determine the legislative intent behind that provision, in particular the intent behind the \"similar benefits\" language. Then, we shall determine whether, as a matter of law, a payment by a governmental employer of ordinary disability benefits could be deemed a \"similar benefit\" to a payment of temporary total disability benefits. Then, we shall decide whether, under the circumstances of this case, Mr. Reger's ordinary disability benefits were a \"similar benefit\" to his temporary total disability benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A.

In\n   <em>\n    Blevins\n   </em>\n   , we summarized the holding of\n   <em>\n    Kaponin\n   </em>\n   ,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   <em>\n    Kaponin\n   </em>\n   involved a county police officer who, as the result of a job-related injury, suffered a 75% permanent partial disability. He retired and, pursuant to the county pension plan, began receiving disability benefits of $260/month. Thereafter, the officer filed for workers' compensation benefits and received an award of $25/week, which, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, was less than the retirement benefit. The county sought judicial review, arguing that, by virtue of [Acts 1914, ch. 800, s. 34, by that time recodified as Article 101, \u00a7 33 of the Chapter Laws of Maryland], it was not liable. This Court viewed \u00a7 33 not as an offset provision, however, but as a qualification statute designed to give municipal employers an alternative to providing workmen's compensation by enacting legislation affording to their employees\n   benefits equal to or greater than those provided by the Workmen's Compensation Law. The comparison, we\n   said, was not to be on a case-by-case, dollar-for-dollar, basis, but rather on a law-by-law basis. The county pension plan at issue, while affording Officer Kaponin a higher weekly benefit, did not provide medical benefits or partial or permanent partial benefits, which were afforded under the workers' compensation law. Accordingly, we viewed the provisions of the county pension law as not being equal to or greater than the provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act and held that the officer could collect under both laws.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <em>\n    Blevins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"767726\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/352/620/\">\n    352 Md. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   636 to 637,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"767726\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/352/620/\">\n    724 A.2d 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).

The crucial operative fact is that of wage loss; the cause of the wage loss merely dictates the category of legislation applicable. Now if a workman undergoes a period of wage loss due to all three conditions, it does not follow that he should receive three sets of benefits simultaneously and thereby recover more than his actual wage.

Whether, As a Matter of Law, Ordinary Disability Benefits Can Be \"Similar Benefits\" to Workers' Compensation Benefits\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   We shall apply these principles to Mr. Reger's first contention that, as a matter of law, workers' compensation benefits awarded by the WCC should never be offset under LE \u00a7 9-610 by ordinary disability retirement benefits granted by the State Retirement Board to a governmental employee. Mr. Reger insists that \"the two benefits are paid for different purposes\" and that because ordinary disability benefits \"do not compensate for work-related injuries,\" those benefits are therefore not a \"similar benefit\" to workers' compensation benefits that should be offset pursuant to LE \u00a7 9-610. Mr. Reger contrasts ordinary disability benefits with accidental disability benefits, which he asserts are awarded for accidental workplace injuries and are thus \"perfectly analogous to workers' compensation benefits.\" However, under the principles set forth in\n   <em>\n    Newman\n   </em>\n   and the other cases described above, the \"purpose\" for which ordinary disability benefits are awarded-whether to compensate for lost wages, or for loss of future earning capacity, or for some other purpose-is entirely irrelevant to our analysis of whether the statutory offset in LE \u00a7 9-610 can apply to offset those benefits against a workers' compensation award. Instead, the only relevant inquiry is whether ordinary disability benefits can, as a matter of law, be \"similar\" to workers' compensation benefits-meaning that the two sets of benefits were awarded as a recovery for the same injury or, in other words, stemmed from the same cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   In his brief, Mr. Reger also asserts that the 1997 amendment to LE \u00a7 9-610\"indicates that legislature believed the 'similar benefits' in [LE] \u00a7 9-610 were limited to accidental disability benefits.\" Mr. Reger relies upon a fiscal note from the Department of Fiscal Services and a house committee floor report, which refer to the purpose of the 1997 amendment as providing for the offset of workers' compensation benefits against an \"accidental disability benefit\" paid to the retiree. However, as described above, that amendment modified the offset provision in SP \u00a7 29-118 to state that a retiree\n   who was employed by a county board of education who receives a disability benefit through that employer remains subject to the offset provision in LE \u00a7 9-610. Thus under the plain language of the 1997 amendment, the General Assembly intended that the offset in LE \u00a7 9-610 still apply to retirees of a county\n   board of education or their beneficiaries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   And, as this Court has consistently held, even prior to the 1999 amendment that once again added the word \"similar\" to the statute, the plain meaning of LE \u00a7 9-610 was to prevent a double recovery for the same injury by applying an offset to\n   <strong>\n    any\n   </strong>\n   benefit that is \"similar\" to workers' compensation benefit also received by the employee,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , when both sets of benefits were awarded to compensate the employee for the same injury.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Blevins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"767726\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/352/620/\">\n    352 Md. at 638-41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"767726\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/352/620/\">\n    724 A.2d 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Polomski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"850452\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/344/70/#p80\">\n    344 Md. at 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"850452\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/344/70/#p80\">\n    684 A.2d 1338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Fikar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2023761\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/333/430/#p431\">\n    333 Md. at 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2023761\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/333/430/#p431\">\n    635 A.2d 977\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Frank,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2083346\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/284/655/#p657\">\n    284 Md. at 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=399%20A.2d%20250\">\n    399 A.2d 250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The 1997 amendment did not add or delete language from LE \u00a7 9-610 that would change that plain legislative intent or limit the offset solely to accidental disability retirement benefits. And, the General Assembly has not subsequently amended the statute to limit the scope of the offset provision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore,\n   we are not persuaded by Mr. Reger's reliance upon the fiscal note and house committee floor report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   In order to determine whether ordinary disability benefits can be awarded on the basis of the same injury as workers' compensation benefits, we shall examine their eligibility criteria set by statute. As to ordinary disability retirement benefits, SP \u00a7 29-105(a) provides that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-178\">\n   The Board of Trustees [of the Maryland State Retirement and Pension System] shall grant an ordinary disability retirement allowance to a member if:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-179\">\n   (1) the member has at least 5 years of eligibility service; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-180\">\n   (2) the medical board certifies that:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-181\">\n   (i) the member is mentally or physically incapacitated for the further performance of the normal duties of the member's position;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-182\">\n   (ii) the incapacity is likely to be permanent; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-183\">\n   (iii) the member should be retired\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   The statute does not mandate that the Medical Board or the State Retirement Agency, the administrative arm of the MSRPS, must determine the cause of the physical incapacity of the employee. Instead, they must only determine that the employee is physically unable to perform his normal duties, and that his incapacitation is likely to be permanent and should result in retirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   In contrast, temporary total disability benefits \"are those paid to a [n] injured worker who is wholly disabled and unable to work because of the injury.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   <em>\n    Buckler v. Willett Const. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"400107\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/345/350/#p356\">\n    345 Md. 350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 356,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"400107\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/345/350/#p356\">\n    692 A.2d 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). They may be awarded on the basis of either \"an accidental personal injury or an occupational disease.\" LE \u00a7 9-618. Similarly, other workers' compensation benefits are awarded on the basis of a workplace\n   accidental injury or occupational disease.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   , LE \u00a7 9-614 (temporary partial disabilities); LE \u00a7 9-625 (permanent partial disability); LE \u00a7 9-635 (permanent total disability).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   As ordinary disability benefits may be awarded for\n   <strong>\n    any\n   </strong>\n   mental or physical injury that renders the employee unable to perform the normal duties of his position, those benefits certainly could be awarded on the basis of the same workplace accidental injury or occupational disease that would support an award of workers' compensation benefits. Therefore, we hold that if the record reflects that the cause of the incapacity for which ordinary disability retirement benefits were awarded was the same workplace accidental injury or occupational disease that was the basis for a workers' compensation award, the two sets of benefits are \"similar\" and the offset in LE \u00a7 9-610 applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   Our holding is consistent with the statutory purpose of the offset provision to prevent a double recovery for the same injury. We agree with the Respondents that Mr. Reger's position that we should restrict the offset solely to accidental disability benefits is contrary to the statutory purpose because it would increase instances of double recovery. As governmental employees may choose to apply only for ordinary disability retirement benefits from the MSRPS, such a ruling would incentivize them to do so, knowing that they could also obtain a second recovery for the same injury from the WCC that would not be subject to the statutory offset.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. Whether the Ordinary Disability Benefits Paid to Mr. Reger by the MSRPS Are \"Similar Benefits\" to the Temporary Total Disability Benefits Paid to Mr. Reger by the WCC\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   Although we have held that ordinary disability benefits may be \"similar benefits\" to workers' compensation benefits when both sets of benefits are awarded based on the same injury, we must still determine whether Mr. Reger's ordinary disability benefits were on the basis of the same injury as his\n   temporary total disability benefits. Mr. Reger focuses our attention on the Medical Board's recommendation and State Retirement Agency decision to deny him accidental disability benefits but grant him ordinary disability benefits. The Medical Board recommendation stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-191\">\n   It is the recommendation of the Medical Board that [Mr. Reger]\n   <em>\n    be approved ordinary disability\n   </em>\n   due to cervical spondylosis and stenosis lumbar spondylosis. The medical evidence submitted supports a conclusion that the member is permanently disabled and unable to perform his job duties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-192\">\n   However, the Medical Board denied\n   <em>\n    accidental disability\n   </em>\n   since the evidence submitted concerning the accident did not prove that this event caused the permanent disability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   Mr. Reger maintains that when the Medical Board denied his claim for accidental disability retirement benefits, it \"very specifically found [that] Mr. Reger was not disabled because of his [accidental] injury of November 12, 2007.\" The State Retirement Agency subsequently sent a letter to Mr. Reger accepting the Medical Board's recommendation, and stating that Mr. Reger was \"entitled to\n   <em>\n    an ordinary disability, due to\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cervical Spondylosis\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    and Stenosis\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lumbar Spondylosis\n   </em>\n   ,\" but denying him accidental disability benefits. Mr. Reger claims that letter shows that the State Retirement Agency awarded him ordinary disability benefits \"based solely on [ ] preexisting degenerative back problems,\" and not the November 12, 2007 accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   In contrast, the Respondents contend that the State Retirement Agency did not find that Mr. Reger's ordinary disability benefits were awarded for injuries that are separate and distinct from the injuries he sustained as a result of his November 12, 2007 accidental injury, for which he received temporary total disability benefits. And, Respondents claim that other evidence in the record, especially the fact that Mr. Reger made similar claims and submitted similar evidence before both the WCC and State Retirement Agency, show that both sets of benefits awarded to Mr. Reger stemmed from the same injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   <em>\n    1. The State Retirement Agency Did Not Make an Express Finding That the November 12, 2007 Accident Did Not Cause Mr. Reger's Disability, But May Have Found That the Proximate Cause of His Back and Neck Injuries Was His Preexisting Back and Neck Conditions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   Contrary to Mr. Reger's assertions, neither the Medical Board nor the State Retirement Agency ever expressly stated that they were denying accidental disability benefits based on a finding that Mr. Reger was not disabled as a result of the November 12, 2007 accident. Instead, the Medical Board stated only that \"the evidence submitted concerning the accident did not prove that this event caused the permanent disability.\" Just as for ordinary disability benefits, the criteria for accidental disability retirement benefits are set in statute. However, the criteria are significantly more stringent for accidental disability benefits. SP \u00a7 29-109(b) provides,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-197\">\n   (b) Except as provided in subsection (c)\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   of this section, the Board of Trustees [of the Maryland State Retirement and Pension System] shall grant an accidental disability retirement allowance to a member if:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-198\">\n   (1) the member is totally and permanently incapacitated for duty\n   <strong>\n    as the natural and proximate result of an accident that occurred in the actual performance of duty\n   </strong>\n   at a definite time and place without willful negligence by the member; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-199\">\n   (2) the medical board certifies that:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-200\">\n   (i) the member is mentally or physically incapacitated for the further performance of the normal duties of the member's position;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-201\">\n   (ii) the incapacity is likely to be permanent; and\n   (iii) the member should be retired.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   Thus, the Medical Board's recommendations and State Retirement Agency's decision may have simply reflected that Mr. Reger presented insufficient evidence to prove that his back injury was the \"natural and proximate result\" of the November 12, 2007 accident, but presented clear evidence that he was permanently incapacitated. Under those circumstances, the State Retirement Agency lacked the authority to award him accidental disability benefits for his injuries because he had not\n   met his burden of proof-even if, in fact, his injuries were the natural and proximate cause of the accident. But it could, and did, award him ordinary disability retirement benefits, which can be awarded for any incapacitating injury, even lacking proof or evidence as to causation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   However, an equally plausible interpretation of State Retirement Agency's decision to award Mr. Reger ordinary disability benefits is that the agency believed that the back and neck injuries he suffered were caused by preexisting conditions, and were not directly attributable to his November 12, 2007 accident. As Mr. Reger points out, the Medical Board's recommendation and State Retirement Agency decision stated that Mr. Reger was entitled to receive ordinary disability \"due to\" his preexisting back and neck conditions of cervical spondylosis and stenosis lumbar spondylosis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   <em>\n    2. Even If the State Retirement Agency and WCC Ascribed Different Causes to Mr. Reger's Back and Neck Injuries, That Does Not Imply That The Agencies Awarded Him Benefits for Separate And Distinct Injuries\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   Even if the State Retirement Agency did, in fact, award Mr. Reger ordinary disability benefits instead of accidental\n   disability benefits based upon a finding that his incapacity to work was proximately caused by his pre-existing back problems rather than the November 12, 2007 accident, that finding would not necessarily imply that he sustained two separate and distinct injuries. As we shall explain, because the State Retirement Agency applies a different legal standard when making disability benefit determinations than the WCC applies when deciding whether to award temporary total disability benefits, a single injury may result in the denial of accidental disability benefits but the grant of temporary total disability benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Courtney v. Board of Trustees of Maryland State Retirement Systems\n   </em>\n   , we interpreted the \"natural and proximate cause\" standard in the predecessor statute to SP \u00a7 29-109(b), and stated that an accidental injury under the statute \"does not include unexpected results not produced by accidental causes,\" and that \"[a]n unexpected result (the incapacitating injury) attributable to a preexisting condition is not, therefore, an accidental injury.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2085638\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/285/356/#p363\">\n    285 Md. 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 363,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=402%20A.2d%20885\">\n    402 A.2d 885\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1979) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).

But, although in such a case the WCC would be barred by law from considering any relation between the injury and the preexisting medical condition, no such restriction applies to the State Retirement Agency.

In the instant case, the circuit court and the Court of Special Appeals similarly concluded that Mr. Reger's benefits were awarded for the same injury based in part upon the fact that Mr. Reger's applications for disability benefits both referenced the November 12, 2007 accident, and that the same medical reports and evidence were presented in support of both applications. Before this Court,\n   Mr. Reger contends that it is improper to rely on what was submitted or claimed before the WCC or the State Retirement Agency to determine whether the benefits are \"similar.\" We disagree. The agency orders or letters awarding benefits may not specify the nature of the injury that was the basis for the award in sufficient detail for the Commission, or a reviewing court, to determine whether those benefits were awarded on the basis of the same injury for which the employee also received workers' compensation benefits. This is particularly true for State Retirement Agency letters awarding ordinary disability benefits, as there is no legal requirement that the agency identify the cause of the injury for which the benefit was awarded. Therefore, it may be appropriate for the Commission or a reviewing court to look at other documents and evidence in the record to determine if the benefits are for the same injury, including the applications and evidence submitted by the claimant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   Our sole point of disagreement with the intermediate appellate court's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Reynolds\n   </em>\n   is as to its alternate explanation for why the statutory offset should apply: that because ordinary disability retirement benefits and the workers' compensation benefits at issue in that case are both \"wage loss benefit[s]\" they are\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   \"similar\" benefits. As noted previously, we explicitly rejected that rationale in\n   <em>\n    Newman\n   </em>\n   , where we stated that the statutory offset now contained in LE \u00a7 9-610\"focuses only on dual recoveries for a single on-the-job injury\" and \"does not encompass setoffs for every type of wage-loss benefit available.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2071728\" index=\"235\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/311/721/#p724\">\n    311 Md. at 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2071728\" index=\"236\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/311/721/#p724\">\n    537 A.2d 274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We note that ordinary disability retirement benefits do not necessarily preclude an employee from working in the future-an employee need only show that he is \"incapacitated for the further performance of the normal duties of\n   the member's position\" to receive those benefits, not that he is unable to work at all.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SP \u00a7 29-105(a). Thus, an employee could hypothetically retire from a governmental employer on ordinary disability benefits for one incapacity, return to the workforce in a new position, and later incur a separate and distinct injury, for which he receives temporary total disability benefits\n   from his new employer. In that event, he would be receiving two wage-loss benefits, but for different injuries, and the benefits should not be offset merely because both benefits are designed to compensate him for lost wages. Conversely, the statutory offset provision in LE \u00a7 9-610 is not limited only to those benefits that might be characterized as \"wage loss benefits,\" but applies to any benefit awarded to compensate the same injury for which the employee also received workers' compensation benefits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Oros\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2250155\" index=\"237\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/56/685/#p686\">\n    56 Md.App. at 690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2250155\" index=\"238\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/56/685/#p686\">\n    468 A.2d 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (describing permanent partial disability benefits as \"more in the nature of earning capacity impairment benefits\" than \"wage loss\" benefits).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   In summary, as clarified by our above analysis about the differing standards the State Retirement Agency and WCC apply to award disability benefits, and as further supported by the Court of Special Appeals' reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Reynolds\n   </em>\n   and in the instant case, we conclude that when a claimant suffers a single overall injury that involves a preexisting condition that was exacerbated or triggered by an accidental injury, the State Retirement Agency and WCC may both award the claimant benefits for that single injury but make contrasting findings as to the cause of the injury. In order to ensure that the statutory intent and purpose of LE \u00a7 9-610 to prevent a double recovery for the same injury prevail, we hold that in those circumstances, the WCC may properly apply the statutory offset in LE \u00a7 9-610, and issue an order permitting the employer or insurer to set off the temporary total disability benefit against the ordinary disability retirement benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   In determining whether the two sets of benefits were awarded for the same injury, the WCC may consider any relevant evidence that may clarify the injuries for which the temporary total disability and ordinary disability retirement benefits were awarded, and whether the benefits were awarded for the same or separate injuries. That relevant evidence may include the Medical Board's recommendation or State Retirement Agency's order supporting an award of ordinary disability retirement benefits. But, because the State Retirement\n   Agency and WCC may have reached different conclusions as to the cause of a same injury, the WCC may also consider other evidence in the record, which may include medical reports, information stated in a claimant's application for benefits, or witness testimony presented to the WCC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   <em>\n    3. In the Instant Case, Mr. Reger Was Paid Both Sets of Benefits As Compensation For The Same Injuries to His Back and Neck\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   In the instant case, it is clear that Mr. Reger was paid both ordinary disability benefits and temporary total disability benefits as compensation for the same back and neck injuries. Although Mr. Reger's custodial position involved \"very physical work\" that included regular bending and lifting, he repeatedly testified to the WCC that he had never missed any time from work or sought any medical treatment for \"any back problems\" prior to the November 12, 2007 work accident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   After that accident, in early 2008, Mr. Reger saw Dr. Larkin for treatment, and was diagnosed for the first time with degenerative back conditions: spondylolisthesis and cervical stenosis. However, during the course of proceedings before the WCC in which Mr. Reger sought temporary total disability benefits until he could undergo and recover from a proposed lumbar surgery, he submitted a letter from Dr. Larkin to the Commission, in which Dr. Larkin stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-222\">\n   [Mr. Reger] had a pre-existing spondylolisthesis\n   <strong>\n    in which he managed to work effectively for years with this problem until he had an accident at work\n   </strong>\n   . This temporal relationship of his accident indicates to me that\n   <strong>\n    there is a reasonable degree of medical certainty that his current condition is a result of his accident at work\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   (emphasis added). Thus, Mr. Reger's own testimony before the WCC as well as the medical opinion of his own treating\n   physician submitted to the Commission plainly indicate that, while he may have had an undiagnosed degenerative back medical condition prior to the November 12, 2007 accident, he did not suffer from a back\n   <strong>\n    injury\n   </strong>\n   that caused him to miss work until after that accident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   The WCC initially denied Mr. Reger temporary total disability benefits but, after a petition to the circuit court for judicial review, a jury returned a verdict in his favor, and the circuit court vacated the order of the WCC and remanded for entry of an order finding,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-225\">\n   1 Mr. Reger has not attained maximum medical improvement with regard to his work-related back injury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-226\">\n   2 That Mr. Reger's need for back surgery is causally connected to the accidental injury of November 12, 2007; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-227\">\n   3 Mr. Reger was temporarily totally disabled from July 16, 2008 to September 9, 2009[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   Thus, it is clear that Mr. Reger's temporary total disability benefits from July 16, 2008 to September 9, 2009 were awarded on the basis of the back injuries he sought treatment for following the November 12, 2007 accident that required back surgery and rendered him unable to work. The same is true of his second period of temporary total disability benefits from\n   September 25, 2010 to November 8, 2013. Mr. Reger secured those additional benefits after he had again sought to receive temporary total disability benefits until he could undergo and recover from a second proposed surgery, for neck and left arm and elbow pain. He was again initially denied benefits by the WCC, and again successfully\n   appealed for judicial review in the circuit court, resulting in a jury finding that his second proposed surgery was causally related to the November 12, 2007 accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   Mr. Reger's application to the MSRPS for accidental disability benefits similarly reflects that he sought benefits for the same back injuries that he suffered after the November 12, 2007 accident. Mr. Reger's description of his \"disability or medical condition\" indicated conditions relating to his lower back, neck, shoulder, left leg, and left hand. He also described how,\n   <strong>\n    after\n   </strong>\n   the accident, he could not physically perform certain functions of his job, including climbing steps or ladders, standing for a long time, lifting items, mowing grass, scrubbing doors, shoveling snow, etc. Dr. Larkin, the same physician who submitted a report to the WCC on Mr. Reger's behalf, signed a Physician's Medical Report attached to the application, which gave a similar description of his degenerative back problems. Furthermore, as Mr. Reger's counsel conceded during questioning by the circuit court judge during the summary judgment hearing, the same medical records were submitted to the State Retirement Agency as to the WCC. The Medical Board concluded that Mr. Reger suffered a permanent disability, and recommended that Mr. Reger be approved ordinary disability benefits based upon the degenerative back problems identified by Dr. Larkin. The Medical Board's recommendations were thereafter adopted by the State Retirement Agency, which awarded Mr. Reger ordinary disability retirement benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   Thus, the record plainly demonstrates that both sets of benefits were awarded for the\n   <strong>\n    same injuries\n   </strong>\n   : the back injuries which Mr. Reger suffered in the aftermath of the November\n   12, 2007 accident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, we hold that Mr. Reger's ordinary disability benefits are \"similar benefits\" to his temporary total disability benefits, and the statutory offset in LE \u00a7 9-610 applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   In summary, we hold that the legislative intent behind the overall offset provision now contained in LE \u00a7 9-610 is to prevent employees of a Maryland governmental unit or quasi-public corporation who are covered by both a pension plan and workers' compensation from receiving a double recovery for the same injury. Similarly, we conclude that the legislative intent behind the specific language in the statute that \"payment of the benefit by the employer satisfies, to the extent of the payment, the liability of the employer ... for payment of\n   <strong>\n    similar benefits\n   </strong>\n   under this title,\" LE \u00a7 9-610 (emphasis added), was that the offset apply only to \"comparable\" benefits, which are \"\n   <strong>\n    benefits accruing by reason of the same injury\n   </strong>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Newman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2071728\" index=\"239\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/311/721/#p724\">\n    311 Md. at 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2071728\" index=\"240\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/311/721/#p724\">\n    537 A.2d 274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988) (emphasis added). And, we note that a benefit that compensates\n   an employee for wage loss is not necessarily a \"similar benefit\" subject to the statutory offset; the offset would not apply if the wage loss benefit was not awarded for the same injury as the workers' compensation benefit.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2071728\" index=\"241\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/311/721/#p724\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We further hold that, as a matter of law, ordinary disability benefits can be legally similar to workers' compensation benefits, if the record reflects that the cause of the incapacity for which ordinary disability benefits were awarded was the same workplace accidental injury or occupational disease that was the basis for the workers' compensation benefits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although Mr. Reger contends that the offset should be limited only to accidental disability benefits, such a holding would be contrary to the statutory purpose of the offset; it would incentivize governmental employees to apply only for ordinary disability benefits, knowing that they could also obtain a second recovery for the same injury from the WCC that would not be subject to the statutory offset.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   Finally, we hold that in this case, the record reflects that the ordinary disability benefits paid to Mr. Reger were based on the same injury as his temporary total disability benefits. Although the State Retirement Agency arguably found that the injury for which it was awarding Mr. Reger ordinary disability benefits was caused by his preexisting degenerative back problems, whereas his temporary total disability benefits from the WCC were awarded for his November 12, 2007 accident, that does not imply that each benefit was awarded for a separate and distinct injury. The State Retirement\n   Agency and WCC apply different legal standards to determine whether a beneficiary is entitled to a disability benefit. Therefore, when a disability claimant suffers an injury involving a preexisting condition that is triggered or exacerbated by a work accident, the two agencies may both award benefits for the same injury but ascribe different causes to that injury. Under those circumstances, in order to determine whether ordinary disability benefits and workers' compensation benefits were awarded on the basis of the same injury, the WCC is not bound to prior agency findings as to causation. Instead, the WCC may consider any relevant evidence or argument submitted as to the basis for each benefit, which may include: letters or orders granting a benefit, information stated in a claimant's application for benefits, and evidence submitted to the agency, such as medical records or witness testimony. Here, that evidence clearly shows that both sets of benefits were awarded to compensate the same injuries; Mr. Reger claimed in both applications for benefits that he was seeking benefits for the same back and neck injuries, submitted\n   the same medical records and similar medical expert opinions, and testified before the WCC that the first injury that he had suffered to his back occurred after the November 12, 2007 accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   Although Mr. Reger has been granted two sets of benefits for the same injury, he is entitled to only one recovery for that single injury. Therefore, we hold that the WCC did not err in its determination that the offset provision in LE \u00a7 9-610 applies in this case, and that the Respondents are entitled to offset Mr. Reger's ordinary disability benefits against his temporary total disability benefits. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

Furthermore, it appears that the Court of Special Appeals' opinion in\n    <em>\n     Zakwieia\n    </em>\n    relies primarily upon its prior holding in\n    <em>\n     Reynolds\n    </em>\n    , which we have already discussed in detail. Therefore, we shall not rely upon that decision in the instant appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"29\">\n   <p id=\"p-273\">\n    In testimony before the WCC, Mr. Reger acknowledged an earlier 2004 injury involving a file cabinet, which required an MRI and \"some physical therapy.\" However, Mr. Reger expressly denied that the 2004 injury had resulted in any back problems.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"30\">\n   <p id=\"p-274\">\n    The other medical reports and evidence in the record are in accord with Dr. Sansur's conclusions. Dr. Charles Sansur, who performed a 2010 lumbar surgery on Mr. Reger, submitted a report in subsequent WCC proceedings in which he stated in part that \"[w]hile the accident in 2007 is not the exact cause of [Mr. Reger's] spinal stenosis, it is quite clear that such an incident certainly exacerbated his symptoms and resulted in him requiring further medical and surgical treatment.\" The WCC sought an independent medical examination in addition to Dr. Sansur's report, and the parties engaged Dr. Kevin McGrail to examine Mr. Reger. Dr. McGrail similarly found that \"[a]lthough Mr. Reger's [back condition] was congenital and degenerative, the accident seemed to have significantly aggravated this condition to the point where it became unmanageable with anything but a surgical procedure,\" and that \"[b]ased on his history, it does seem that the traumatic incident was an aggravating factor to both his back pain and his ultimate requirement for surgery.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"31\">\n   <p id=\"p-275\">\n    To the extent that our analysis and reasoning differs from that set forth by the circuit court and the Court of Special Appeals, both of which relied in part upon the \"wage loss\" rationale stated in\n    <em>\n     Reynolds\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"825482\" index=\"261\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/127/648/\">\n     127 Md.App. at 655\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"825482\" index=\"262\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/127/648/\">\n     736 A.2d 391\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , that does not affect the outcome of this appeal. As we are tasked with reviewing \"the agency's decision directly, not the decision of the Circuit Court or the Court of Special Appeals,\"\n    <em>\n     Hollingsworth\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4308186,12486155\" index=\"263\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/448/648/\">\n     448 Md. at 654\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4308186,12486155\" index=\"264\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/448/648/\">\n     141 A.3d 90\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , our sole concern is the decision of the WCC, and any variance between our reasoning and that of the circuit court or intermediate appellate court is irrelevant. And, the record of the offset hearing before the WCC clearly reflects that the Respondents raised a claim before the agency that Mr. Reger was awarded both sets of benefits for the same back and neck injuries he was diagnosed with following the November 12, 2007 accident.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"32\">\n   <p id=\"p-276\">\n    Our holding today does not imply that an award of ordinary disability retirement benefits should always be offset against an award of temporary total disability workers' compensation benefits. Nor do we agree with the amici curiae's view that, as a matter of law, LE \u00a7 9-610 should apply \"to ordinary disability [retirement] benefits to the same extent that it applies to accidental disability [retirement] benefits when the reason for the disability payment includes the same body part for which workers' compensation benefits are awarded.\" Although the fact that an employee's ordinary disability benefits were awarded on the basis of an injury to the same body part for which workers' compensation benefits were awarded is certainly relevant to deciding whether the benefits were awarded on the basis of the same injury, it is not necessarily determinative. An employee may be able to prove to the Commission that the two benefits were each awarded on the basis of separate and distinct injuries involving the same body part. While that may be a difficult factual showing for an employee to make-and, as we have shown, is not one that is supported by the record of Mr. Reger's injuries in the instant case-we cannot say that, as a matter of law, it is an impossible one.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
