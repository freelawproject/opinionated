The court dismissed the plaintiff's complaint against the defendant, a nonresident of Connecticut at the time that the action was commenced,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   after determining\n   that the relevant long arm statute, General Statutes \u00a7 52-59b (a) (3) (B), did not provide jurisdiction over the defendant based on the facts alleged in the complaint and in an affidavit filed by the defendant in her reply to the plaintiff's memorandum in opposition to the motion to dismiss. On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court erred in its application of \u00a7 52-59b (a) (3) (B) to the facts as pleaded in this case. We affirm the judgment of the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts, as alleged in the plaintiff's complaint,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and procedural history are relevant to the resolution of this appeal. The plaintiff, a Connecticut\n   resident, commenced this action in Connecticut against the defendant on April 9, 2015. In the complaint, the plaintiff alleged that, on September 13, 2013, the defendant, while operating a motor vehicle, collided with the rear end of the plaintiff's vehicle in Maryland. The defendant's conduct or actions caused the damages to the plaintiff's vehicle in that she (1) was inattentive because she failed to a keep reasonable and prudent lookout for other vehicles on the road; (2) failed to operate the vehicle under reasonable and proper control to enable her to avoid causing damage to the plaintiff's vehicle; and (3) failed to operate her vehicle as a reasonably prudent person would have under the circumstances. The collision caused damages to the plaintiff's vehicle and a corresponding diminution in value to the automobile. The plaintiff sought $4737 plus interest from the time of the accident, as well as costs, fees, and other consequential damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On July 2, 2015, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiff's complaint, arguing that the court lacked personal jurisdiction over her under \u00a7 52-59b and that the exercise of jurisdiction would violate the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution. The plaintiff countered in his memorandum of law in opposition to the motion that the court had personal jurisdiction under \u00a7 52-59b (a) (3) (B), and he provided evidence purporting to establish that the defendant had maintained a calligraphy and graphic design business engaged in interstate commerce. In reply, the defendant argued, inter alia, that the plaintiff had failed to allege or provide evidence that she derived \"substantial revenue from interstate ... commerce\" under \u00a7 52-59b (a) (3) (B), as that phrase was defined by our Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Ryan\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cerullo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3951517\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/282/109/#p124\">\n    282 Conn. 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 124-25,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=918%20A.2d%20867\">\n    918 A.2d 867\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007), because there was no allegation or evidence that she had derived any revenue from Connecticut.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The court heard argument on October 26, 2015. On October 28, 2015, the court issued its memorandum of decision granting\n   the defendant's motion to dismiss. After setting forth the substantial revenue requirement under\n   <em>\n    Ryan\n   </em>\n   , the court determined that there was no evidence that the defendant derived any revenue from Connecticut residents. Additionally, the court determined that there was no evidence showing that the defendant earned enough revenue from Connecticut to have a commercial impact in the forum. Accordingly, the court granted the defendant's motion to dismiss. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Before addressing the plaintiff's claim on appeal, we set forth the applicable standard of review. \"The standard of review for a court's decision on a motion to dismiss is well settled. A motion to dismiss tests, inter alia, whether, on the face of the record, the court is without jurisdiction.... [O]ur review of the court's ultimate legal conclusion and resulting [determination] of the motion to dismiss will be de novo.... When a ... court decides a jurisdictional question raised by a pretrial motion to dismiss, it must consider the allegations of the complaint in their most favorable light....

Specifically, he argues that the statute does not require that substantial revenue be derived from Connecticut-based commerce; such revenue need only be derived from interstate commerce. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Section 52-59b (a) provides in relevant part: \"As to a cause of action arising from any of the acts enumerated in this section, a court may exercise personal jurisdiction over any nonresident individual ... who in person or through an agent ... (3) commits a tortious act outside the state causing injury to person or property within the state ... if such person or agent ... (B) expects or should reasonably expect the act to have consequences in the state and derives substantial revenue from interstate or international commerce\n   ....\" A trial court, therefore, has personal jurisdiction over a defendant under \u00a7 52-59b (a) (3) (B) when (1) the defendant, himself or through an agent, commits a tortious act outside Connecticut, (2) that act causes injury to a person or property in Connecticut, (3) that act gives rise to the cause of action claimed by the plaintiff, (4) the defendant expected or reasonably should have expected that the act would have consequences in Connecticut, and (5) the defendant derives substantial revenue from interstate or international commerce. See\n   <em>\n    Ryan\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cerullo\n   </em>\n   , supra, 282 Conn. at 123-24,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=918%20A.2d%20867\">\n    918 A.2d 867\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the present case, the court, in addressing the fifth prong, determined that the plaintiff had failed to provide evidence that the defendant derived substantial revenue from interstate commerce under\n   <em>\n    Ryan\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Ryan\n   </em>\n   , our Supreme Court for the first time determined the meaning of \"derives substantial revenue from interstate or international commerce\" under \u00a7 52-59b : \"Although this court never has been required to determine the meaning of derives substantial revenue from interstate or international commerce for purposes of \u00a7 52-59b (a) (3) (B), New York courts have concluded, in interpreting their identically worded long arm statute, that the substantial revenue requirement is designed to narrow the [long arm] reach to preclude the exercise of jurisdiction over nondomiciliaries who might cause direct, foreseeable injury within the [s]tate but whose business operations are of a local character .... Put differently, substantial revenue means enough revenue to indicate a commercial impact\n   <em>\n    in the forum\n   </em>\n   , such that a defendant fairly could have expected to be haled into court there.... Because of the indefinite nature of the substantial revenue requirement, the determination of whether that jurisdictional threshold has been met in any particular case necessarily will require a careful review of the relevant facts and frequently will entail an evaluation of both the total amount of revenue\n   involved and the percentage of annual income that that revenue represents.

This is in direct contradiction to how our Supreme Court has defined \"substantial revenue\" as \"enough revenue to indicate a commercial impact\n   <em>\n    in the forum\n   </em>\n   , such that a defendant fairly could have expected to be haled into court there.\" (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.)

The plaintiff did not allege, and did not produce any evidence in support of his opposition to the defendant's motion to dismiss, that the defendant derived substantial revenue from this state's residents. The applicable state long arm statute, \u00a7 52-59b (a) (3) (B), thus does not authorize the assertion of jurisdiction over the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Moreover, the plaintiff's proposed interpretation of the statute, if accepted by this\n   court, could place the statute in constitutional jeopardy.

That automobile accident is the sum total of the interaction between the parties upon which the plaintiff relies for the establishment of personal jurisdiction in Connecticut over the defendant.

Because the court properly determined that the plaintiff had not proved all of the requirements of \u00a7 52-59b (a) (3) (B) for long arm jurisdiction over the defendant, and because the court's exercise of jurisdiction over the defendant in this case would violate the due process clause of the United\n   States constitution, the court properly rendered judgment dismissing the plaintiff's single count complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    The plaintiff alleged in the complaint that the defendant was a resident of Virginia when this action commenced, but the defendant's affidavit filed in support of her reply to the memorandum in opposition to the motion to dismiss asserts that she was a resident of Maryland at the time the action was commenced.
