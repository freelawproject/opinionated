The defendant's arguments implicate two affidavits that were admitted at separate hearings; however, his claims attack only the use of these affidavits to the extent they were used to establish the amount of the debt, for which the court used only the second affidavit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The relevant\n   affidavit\n   was admitted at a hearing to determine the form of the judgment and was used to determine the amount of the debt pursuant to \u00a7 23-18 (a). The defendant argues that the trial court erred because \u00a7 23-18 (a) was not applicable to this case. He asserts that this was not harmless error because the affidavit was the only evidence offered to establish the amount of the debt. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the affidavit was admitted properly under \u00a7 23-18 (a) and, accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following procedural history and facts are relevant to our consideration. On July 6, 2007, the defendant executed a promissory note in favor of the Bank of New Canaan in exchange for a loan in the amount of $2,316,000, which was secured by a mortgage on the defendant's real property located at 215 Springwater Lane in the town of New Canaan. Thereafter, on July 13, 2007, the Bank of New Canaan assigned the note to Thornburg Mortgage Home Loans, Inc. (Thornburg), and it was recorded on April 9, 2009. Thornburg, in turn, assigned the note to the plaintiff, as trustee,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   on February 9, 2011, and it was recorded on February 17, 2011. By virtue of the latter assignment, the plaintiff is now the holder of the note and mortgage. The defendant defaulted on the note, and the plaintiff elected to declare the unpaid balance under the note to be due in full and to foreclose the mortgage securing the note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On March 5, 2012, the plaintiff commenced this action to foreclose by service of process on the defendant. The defendant filed an answer and special defense. The answer denied that the debt was in default and averred insufficient knowledge to admit or deny the alleged\n   amount of the debt and left the plaintiff to its proof.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Prior to trial, a joint trial management report was submitted by the parties in which they stated the sole factual and legal issue in dispute was \"[w]hether or not [the] [p]laintiff ... has standing to commence this foreclosure action.\" The matter was tried to the court on December 17, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Although we will not consider the defendant's arguments concerning the first affidavit as previously noted; see footnote 4 of this opinion; it is necessary at this point to provide some background on the first affidavit because the defendant's objection to the second affidavit incorporated his arguments as to the first affidavit. At trial, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 23-18 (a), the plaintiff offered the first affidavit, signed by the plaintiff's vice president, Michelle Simon (Simon affidavit), along with the original note and mortgage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court admitted the Simon affidavit into evidence over the defendant's objection that \u00a7 23-18 (a) did not apply because he had put forth a defense implicating the amount of the debt. At the conclusion of this proceeding, the court reserved judgment in order to consider motions made during trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After concluding that the plaintiff had standing to foreclose, the court held a hearing on May 27, 2015, to determine the amount of the debt and the form of the judgment to be rendered. In advance of that hearing, the plaintiff submitted the second affidavit of debt executed by one of the plaintiff's agents, KaJay Williams\n   (Williams affidavit), in support of the plaintiff's motion for strict foreclosure. The plaintiff sought to use the Williams affidavit to establish, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 23-18 (a), that the updated debt, taking into account additional costs, fees, and interest accrued since the Simon affidavit was submitted, was now $3,268,499.34. When the plaintiff offered the Williams affidavit at the hearing, the defendant objected to its admission, stating that his objection was the same as it was to the Simon affidavit, namely, that \u00a7 23-18 (a) did not apply because he had put forth a defense implicating the amount of the debt. The defendant did not inform the court of any new legal arguments, evidence, or witnesses that he anticipated presenting to dispute the amount of the debt contained in the Williams affidavit. The trial court overruled the objection on the ground that the Williams affidavit, like the Simon affidavit, was admissible under \u00a7 23-18 (a). Thereafter, on July 8, 2015, the court found in favor of the plaintiff, determined the debt to be $3,268,499.34, and rendered a judgment of strict foreclosure. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The defendant argues that the trial court erred in admitting the Williams affidavit under Practice Book \u00a7 23-18 (a) because he had disputed the amount of the debt. He argues that his answer contained responses to the allegations of the plaintiff's complaint that were sufficient to bar admission of the affidavits under \u00a7 23-18 (a). Because \u00a7 23-18 (a) did not apply, he argued that the affidavit was inadmissible hearsay and its admission deprived the defendant of his right to cross-examine the witness on this issue. The plaintiff counters that nothing in the defendant's answer to the complaint was sufficient to render \u00a7 23-18 (a) inapplicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The parties have asserted that the abuse of discretion standard of review applies in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   After carefully\n   reviewing the limited appellate decisions involving Practice Book \u00a7 23-18 (a), we cannot agree. There is ambiguity in the case law involving \u00a7 23-18 (a) claims, with many decisions not articulating or clearly applying a standard of review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Some decisions apply, as the parties in the present\n   case urge, the abuse of discretion standard.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   One notable outlier applies the clearly erroneous\n   standard.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, we take this opportunity to clarify the appropriate standard of review to be applied in claims involving an affidavit of debt admitted under \u00a7 23-18 (a). As will be explained herein, \"[t]he scope of our appellate review depends upon the proper characterization of the rulings made by the trial court.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Meyers\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Livingston, Adler, Pulda, Meiklejohn &amp; Kelly, P.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=311%20Conn.%20282\">\n    311 Conn. 282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 290,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=87%20A.3d%20534\">\n    87 A.3d 534\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In this appeal, the proper characterization of the trial court's ruling is clarified by examining the nature of an affidavit of debt and the function of Practice Book \u00a7 23-18 (a) in foreclosures. Without question, an affidavit of debt is hearsay evidence because it is an out-of-court statement, by an absent witness, that is offered to prove the truth of the amount of the debt averred in the affidavit. See\n   <em>\n    Midland Funding, LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mitchell-James,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=163%20Conn.%20App.%20648\">\n    163 Conn.App. 648\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 655,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=137%20A.3d%201\">\n    137 A.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016) (\"Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter\n   asserted....

As is relevant here, the purpose of \u00a7 23-18 (a) is to serve as an exception to the general prohibition of hearsay evidence when appropriate circumstances arise, namely, that the amount of the debt is not in dispute.\n   <em>\n    National City Mortgage Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Stoecker\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 798-99,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=888%20A.2d%2095\">\n    888 A.2d 95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, the defendant's claim that the trial court erred in determining that \u00a7 23-18 (a) applies is most properly characterized as challenging the trial court's determination that an exception to the general prohibition of hearsay applies to the affidavit of debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"A trial court's decision to admit evidence,\n   <em>\n    if premised on a correct view of the law\n   </em>\n   ... calls for the abuse of discretion standard of review....

He identifies his answer to the complaint as sufficiently denying the amount of the debt to render \u00a7 23-18 (a) inapplicable. Specifically, he asserts that this was achieved by denying that the debt was in default and claiming insufficient knowledge to admit or deny the amount of the debt. He argues that the trial court should have understood these responses to be a challenge to the amount of the debt such that \u00a7 23-18 (a) would not apply. The plaintiff rejects these claims and argues that the defendant failed to articulate a defense to the amount of the debt prior to trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Practice Book \u00a7 23-18 (a) provides that in any foreclosure action \"where no defense as to the amount of the mortgage debt is interposed,\" the amount of the debt may be proved by submission of an affidavit executed by an affiant familiar with the details of the debt. \"A defense is that which is offered and alleged by a party proceeded against in an action or suit, as a reason in law or fact why the plaintiff should not recover or establish what he seeks.... In a mortgage foreclosure action, a defense to the amount of the debt must be based on some articulated legal reason or fact.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Connecticut National Bank\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    N.

The case law is clear that a defense challenging the amount of the debt must be actively made in order to prevent the application of \u00a7 23-18 (a). \"[A] mere claim of insufficient knowledge as to the correctness of the amount stated in the affidavit of debt is not a defense for purposes of [ \u00a7 23-18 (a) ].\" Id., at 473,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=578%20A.2d%20655\">\n    578 A.2d 655\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   It is axiomatic that such a defense may be raised by pleading a special defense attacking the amount of the debt claimed, but it may also be raised by objection, supported with evidence and arguments challenging the amount of the debt, upon the attempted introduction of the affidavit in court.

A defense, however raised, must be squarely focused on the amount of the debt rather than other matters that are ancillary to the amount of the debt, such as whether the loan is in default, which is a matter of liability, or challenges that attack the credibility of the affiant or defects in the execution of the affidavit itself.

Similarly, where a counterclaim is made by a defendant in a mortgage foreclosure action, that counterclaim does not affect the applicability of Practice Book \u00a7 23-18 (a) unless it actually challenges in some manner the amount of the debt alleged by the plaintiff. See\n   <em>\n    Saunders\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Stigers,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"130412\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/62/138/#p144\">\n    62 Conn.App. 138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 144,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=773%20A.2d%20971\">\n    773 A.2d 971\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001) (counterclaim under Fair Debt Collection Practices Act was separate claim and not defense to amount of debt).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The pleadings that the defendant characterizes as challenges to the amount of the debt simply are not defenses to the amount of the debt. Regarding his claim of insufficient knowledge to admit or deny the amount of the debt, the case law is clear that this is not a defense to the debt sufficient to bar application of Practice Book \u00a7 23-18 (a).\n   <em>\n    Connecticut National Bank\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    N.

Turning to the defendant's denial that the debt was in default, this is similarly not a defense that negates the applicability of \u00a7 23-18 (a). To deny that the debt is in default is a defense that goes to liability, not the amount of the debt, because whether a debt is owed-liability-is a separate matter from whether the amount that is claimed to be owed is accurate. See\n   <em>\n    Busconi\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dighello,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1016786\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/39/753/#p771\">\n    39 Conn.

The defendant could have responded to the court's questions regarding his objections by informing the court that he had new legal arguments, evidence, or witnesses to present that would support his contention that the debt figure averred to in the affidavit was inaccurate. The defendant, however, made no such attempt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   It is clear that the defendant never raised any defense to the amount of the debt sufficient to prohibit the admission of affidavits of debt under Practice Book \u00a7 23-18 (a).
