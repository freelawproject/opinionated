The board thereafter on September 8, 1978, declared the sufficiency of the petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">On September 12, 1978, the Court ordered the defendants to show cause why the relief sought in the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint should not be granted and limited consideration to three questions: (1) whether the content of descriptive material that was attached to the petitions at the time of circulation and removed prior to filing was deceptive; (2) whether the heading \"Initiative Petition, Amendment to the Constitution\u201d was set forth on the side rather than the top of each petition sheet in violation of MCL 168.482; MSA 6.1482; and (3) whether the petitions should be invalidated, pursuant to MCL 168.482; MSA 6.1482 due to the inaccuracy of the second sentence of art 9, \u00a7 6 of the Constitution of 1963 as set forth on the petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">Oral arguments were presented September 27, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>1978. With the imminence of the election, an immediate determination is hereby rendered.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b481-4\"><em>Levin, Levin, Garvett &amp; Dill </em>(by <em>Erwin B. Ellmann, Marshall W.

Having reviewed the initiative petition against the allegation that the heading was placed contrary to MCL 168.482; MSA 6.1482, we hold the determination by the State Board of Canvassers, that the form of the petition complied with the statute, was not erroneous. Regarding the third question, considering the nature of the omission and the full text of the petition, we conclude this petition was sufficiently accurate to comply with statutory requirements. The complaint for mandamus is denied.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b482-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>Amici Curiae:</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b482-4\"><em>Marston, Sachs, Nunn, Kates, Kadushin &amp; O\u2019Hare </em>for Michigan State AFL-CIO and Detroit Federation of Teachers.</attorneys>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
