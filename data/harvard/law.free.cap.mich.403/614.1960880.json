The trial court directed a verdict of no cause of action in favor of General Motors on the ground that the Holloways had failed to establish a defect in the ball joint assembly of the automobile. The Court of Appeals affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">Both opinions on the prior submission are in agreement that a plaintiff may establish by circumstantial as well as direct evidence that there was a defect in the product when it left the manufacturer. The disagreement is whether it would be reasonable to infer such a defect from the circumstantial evidence in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">We conclude that it would be reasonable to draw such an inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">We have also considered General Motors\u2019 further contention, on rehearing, that a failure attributable to the manufacturer is not proven unless the specific cause of the defect is identified. We conclude that, although the specific cause was not so isolated, the Holloways satisfied their burden when they presented evidence from which the jury could reasonably infer that some defect in manufacture caused the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>We reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">On May 28, 1971, Ernest Holloway was driving at a speed of approximately 50 to 55 miles per hour along a gravel road in Eaton County when his automobile left the road. The vehicle struck a utility pole. Holloway was killed and his daughter, Brenda, seriously injured. The automobile was four years old, had been driven over 47,000 miles, and there were two previous owners. The Holloways alleged that the accident was caused by a defective ball joint assembly in the right front suspension which broke while the automobile was traveling over chuckholes in the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Sharon Holloway, as administratrix of her deceased husband\u2019s estate and as next friend of her daughter, commenced this action against General Motors and other defendants. The trial judge granted General Motors\u2019 motion for a directed verdict;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed in a split decision on the ground that a manufacturing defect had not been proven. This Court affirmed by a 3 to 3 division. The Holloways\u2019 application for rehearing was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">On the prior submission, one of the issues was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>whether the ball joint assembly of the Holloway automobile failed while it was on the roadway, as contended by the Holloways, or after it hit a ditch and then a utility pole,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as contended by General Motors. If the assembly did not break until after the automobile left the roadway that would indicate the cause of the failure was not a defect in the manufacture but, rather, the driver\u2019s loss of control of the automobile and its impact against the ditch or pole.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">The opinion for affirmance did not find it necessary to consider that issue because it concluded that, in all events, the circumstantial evidence was insufficient to support an inference of a manufacturing defect. The opinion for reversal concluded that there was sufficient evidence from which the trier of fact could conclude that the break in the assembly occurred on the roadway and, thus, that the break was not a result of the driver\u2019s loss of control of the automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">Although General Motors continues to argue that it would be more reasonable to infer from certain circumstantial evidence that the break occurred after the automobile left the roadway, it has conceded, for the purposes of this rehearing, that the break occurred on the roadway.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">We therefore proceed on the premise that it would be reasonable to infer that the ball joint assembly failed on the roadway before the driver lost control of the automobile and, thus, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>assembly was defective. Proceeding on that premise, it is also reasonable to infer that the defect in and failure of the assembly caused the accident.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">The still-disputed issue is whether that defect was shown to have been attributable to the manufacturer.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">A plaintiff has the burden of establishing that when the product left the manufacturer it was defective. He is not, however, obliged to eliminate all possible causes of the accident consistent with the view that there was no manufacturing defect.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He sustains his burden when he establishes with direct or circumstantial evidence a reasonable probability that the defect is attributable to the manufacturer.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>On a motion for directed verdict, the question is whether it is reasonable to infer from the evidence, direct or circumstantial, that the accident was probably caused by a defect attributable to the manufacturer. Questions of comparative probability are to be resolved by the trier of fact.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As stated in <em>Schoepper v Hancock Chemical Co, </em>113 Mich 582, 586, 589; 71 NW 1081 (1897), and since reaffirmed in <em>Schedlbauer v Chris-Craft Corp, </em>381 Mich 217, 230-231; 160 NW2d 889 (1968):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-6\">\"It is true that where an injury occurs that cannot be accounted for and where the occasion of it rests wholly in conjecture, the case may fail for want of proof. * * * But such cases are rare, and that rule should never be so extended as to result in a failure of justice, or in denying an injured person a right of action where there is room for balancing the probabilities, and for drawing reasonable inferences better supported upon one side than upon the other. * * * <em>[T]he question of whether the inference suggested by the plaintiff\u2019s theory is the correct one, or whether it was sufficiently rebutted, was for the jury. \u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">The opinion for reversal on the prior submission of this cause similarly declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-8\">\"Although the strength of an inference that the accident was caused by a manufacturing defect depends on the plausibility of competing explanations for the accident, plaintiffs did not have the burden of proving that the accident could only be attributable to a manufacturing defect or 'of effectively eliminating any other factors or circumstances which could have been respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>sible for the failure.\u2019 It was enough that they indicated 'a logical sequence of cause and effect * * * notwithstanding the existence of other plausible theories with or without support in the evidence.\u2019 <em>Schedlbauer v Chris-Craft Corp, </em>381 Mich 217, 220, fn 1; 160 NW2d 889 (1968). They were 'not required to offer evidence which positively exclude[s] every other possible cause of the accident.\u2019 <em>Swensson v New York, Albany Despatch Co, </em>309 NY 497, 502; 131 NE2d 902, 904 (1956).\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The opinion for reversal on the prior submission contrasted a defect in a wheel assembly with a failure in a part of the automobile subject to periodic maintenance, <em>e.g., </em>the braking system:<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-6\">\"Wheel assemblies are not expected to wear out and be replaced. There was no suggestion that this assembly had been tampered with or that it is a part of the car that is expected to be or reasonably should be inspected on a periodic basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-7\">\"While it may be necessary in some cases for a plaintiff to introduce evidence of proper maintenance to support an inference that the defect occurred before the product left the factory, where the defect alleged is latent in the very structure of the vehicle and may not in ordinary circumstances be discovered during routine maintenance, evidence of proper maintenance is not required.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-8\">\"While prior malfunction of a brake system may indicate a manufacturing defect, the absence of prior malfunction does not negative the existence of a latent structural defect. A defective break system may func<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>tion intermittently; it is the nature of a wheel assembly failure that there are no 'prior incidents.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">Where a failure is caused by a defect in a relatively inaccessible part integral to the structure of the automobile not generally required to be repaired, replaced or maintained, it may be reasonable, absent misuse, to infer that the defect is attributable to the manufacturer.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">The circumstantial evidence in the instant case adequately supports a reasonable inference that the accident was probably caused by a defect attributable to the manufacturer. Both the Holloways and General Motors agree that the break in the ball joint assembly was fresh, metallurgically clean, and due to an impact failure. This suggests that the failure was not a result of fatigue or wear,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and, indeed, General Motors\u2019 experts testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>fied that there were no signs of fatigue or wear. The fresh, metallurgically clean break, indicative of impact failure not attributable to fatigue or wear, .tended also to negative lack of requisite maintenance, improper repair and even prior misuse as alternative causes. We are left with a reasonable probability that something was inherently wrong with the ball joint assembly such that it was unable to withstand an impact it should have withstood.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">Counsel for General Motors, in his oral argument before this Court on rehearing, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-5\">\"It was a clean, fresh, metallurgically fresh, impact fracture. There is no dispute about that. Everybody that testified in the case admitted that it was a clean break, not a fatigue failure. And, therefore, if it is an impact failure, a clean break rather than something that wears down after 47,000 miles and six years and three owners, <em>there are only three alternatives: it was either designed </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number><em>improperly, or the material that was used was in some way inadequate for the expected life of the vehicle, or there was some combination of design and material.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Common to each alternative is that it is attributable to the manufacturer and indicates a product defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">On rehearing, General Motors principally argues that a plaintiff does not sustain his burden of proof unless he identifies the specific cause of the defect. It contends that the Holloways must demonstrate which of the possible alternatives (design, material, assembly or a combination) was the precise cause of the failure, or be barred from recovery. It advances the policy argument that one of the purposes of the tort law is to encourage those engaged in activity which causes injury to adopt remedial measures to avoid so injuring other persons. If in truth there was a defect in manufacture, General Motors needs specific identification of the cause so that it can effect corrective measures.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-9\">Acknowledging that encouraging tortfeasors to adopt corrective measures is one of the purposes of the tort law, another purpose is to compensate injured persons. It is the injury inflicted on the plaintiff that entitles him to a remedy, not his skill in discovering precisely where defendant\u2019s manufacturing process went wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-10\">Just as a plaintiff injured in an automobile collision need not identify a character or other personality defect which caused the defendant to drive negligently, either to educate him or others so that remedial measures may be adopted or to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>facilitate governmental determination of whether he should be permitted to continue to drive, neither need a person injured by product failure identify the specific defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">As stated in <em>Bronson v J L Hudson Co, </em>376 Mich 98, 102-103; 135 NW2d 388 (1965), where the Court acknowledged that the specific irritant had not been identified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-5\">\"In this regard, the case does not differ from some food poisoning cases: you eat and you get sick and what made you sick was something in the food. What the poison was may be impossible to identify. In this case, the favorable view of plaintiffs\u2019 proofs is that the new, unwashed slip (that is unchanged from time of purchase) bought and immediately worn close to the body with a nearly immediate skin reaction contained an irritant which caused Mrs. Berke\u2019s dermatitis. Defense proofs may well explode the inference, but standing alone it is neither fanciful or conjectural. Add to the hypothesis, of course, plaintiffs\u2019 other proofs: clothes worn that day (other than the slip) were ones usually worn; diet and habits on the day in question were usual and ordinary; no previous history of rash, dermatitis, or allergy. Upon such proofs, the reasonable mind could legitimately infer that the one new element in Mrs. Berke\u2019s life at that time, the new slip, was directly linked with her injury. The reasonable mind now demands explanation. This is the task of defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Moreover, even if the specific cause is identified, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>it may not be possible to adopt measures which would prevent recurrence of the failure \u2014 it may be that such failures occur irregularly and unpredictably, however great the care exercised to prevent occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Finally, General Motors suggests that even if a nonspecific defect has been circumstantially proven, \"it is the duty of the plaintiff to prove by the most accurate evidence that is reasonably available to him the particular defect or act or omission which to him was the cause of the injury for which he would recover\u201d. <em>Schedlbauer v Chris-Craft Corp, supra, </em>p 231. The Court in <em>Schedlbauer </em>suggested that the plaintiff might have been at fault in not retrieving an allegedly defective fuel pump from the water, thereby precluding examination of the pump by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">General Motors asserts that the Holloways\u2019 access to the ball joint assembly, coupled with their failure to call a witness expert in metallurgy or automobile design, constituted a failure to prove their case by the most accurate evidence reasonably available.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">While the plaintiff in <em>Schedlbauer </em>failed to produce the allegedly defective part, the Holloways produced the ball joint assembly so that both sides would have access to it. Production of the ball joint assembly enabled General Motors to present a metallurgical view of the matter. It did so. Metallurgical experts called by it opined that the break was fresh, metallurgical^ clean and due to an impact failure, not attributable to fatigue or wear, a view of the matter consistent with and, indeed, probative of the Holloways\u2019 theory of manufacturing defect.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>The Holloways were at liberty to establish that there was a reasonable probability of a manufacturing defect in the assembly by direct <em>or </em>circumstantial evidence. A manufacturing defect can be proved by circumstantial evidence without expert opinion testimony.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Accordingly, the Holloways were not under an obligation to present a metallurgist\u2019s view of the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b713-5\">Kavanagh, C.J., and Williams and Blair Moody, Jr., JJ., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b703-9\"> The judge said:</p>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">\"In this case, the plaintiff established through its expert Harris, that the suspension system broke while the vehicle was on the highway.

A directed verdict on behalf of defendant was therefore, improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">We find probative the evidence presented by plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses that the break in the ball joint assembly occurred on the roadway before the driver lost control of the automobile, rather than after the automobile left the roadway and collided with a ditch and then a utility pole. In fact, General Motors, for purposes of the rehearing, conceded that the break occurred on the roadway. In addition, there was uncontroverted evidence that the break in the ball joint assembly was fresh and metallurgically clean and caused by an impact failure rather than fatigue or wear. Further, defendant\u2019s expert testified that the automobile was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>designed to travel on roads even worse than the road on which the accident occurred. From this evidence, we believe that a jury question arises concerning a possible manufacturing defect in this particular ball joint assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Accordingly, we find, after rehearing, that defendant was not entitled to a directed verdict since there appears to have been a genuine question of fact upon which reasonable minds could differ.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">We concur in the remand.</p>\n<judges id=\"b714-8\">Coleman and Ryan, JJ., concurred with Fitzgerald, J.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
