Since Center Line did not itself contain \"more than 50% of the population\u201d of the 37th judicial district, its action was ineffective. Consequently, the 37th judicial district began operations on January 1, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">Until 1975, three of the four judges of the 37th judicial district had courtrooms in Warren; the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>fourth occupied facilities provided by Center Line. In 1975, Warren constructed a new judicial building with four courtrooms. Center Line apparently concluded that the district judges intended to remove court operations entirely to the Warren facility. The city filed a complaint in Macomb Circuit Court which sought declaratory and injunctive relief. It alleged that statutes required all criminal and civil cases to be heard in the political subdivision in which they arose and the small claims division to sit in the city:</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">The circuit court entered a judgment which required only small claims arising in Center Line and Center Line ordinance violations to be heard in the city; the remaining business of the court could be transacted \"at any place within the geographical area of the 37th judicial district\u201d. On March 3, 1977, the Court of Appeals said that \"arraignments on warrants from Center Line and preliminary examinations on all offenses committed in Center Line\u201d must be heard in the city;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in all other respects the panel affirmed the circuit court judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">The city argues that RJA \u00a7 9928 denies equal protection and due process and is therefore unconstitutional. The equal protection argument flows from the fact that other similarly situated cities were placed in a position to retain their municipal courts,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> while Center Line was effectively precluded from doing so by being arbitrarily placed with a city which could make Center Line\u2019s option <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>under \u00a7 9928 illusory. The due process violation is said to derive from the Legislature\u2019s delegation to Warren of the determination whether 1968 PA 154 would be effective in Center Line.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">The Court of Appeals said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-5\">\"A finding by this Court that MCLA 600.9928; MSA 27A.9928 is unconstitutional would in no way afford plaintiff the relief sought. The Center Line municipal court was abolished by MCLA 600.9921; MSA 27A.9921. Voiding MCLA 600.9928; MSA 27A.9928 would not reestablish the municipal court or provide any aid in doing so. We, therefore, decline to consider the question.\u201d 74 Mich App 97, 103; 253 NW2d 669 (1977).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">We agree. If \u00a7 9928 were to be held unconstitutional, it would clearly be severable<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> from the remainder of 1968 PA 154; success on this argument would avail the city nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">RJA \u00a7 8251(3) lies at the center of this controversy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-9\">\"In districts of the third class the court shall sit at each city having a population of 3,250 or more and within each township having a population of 12,000 or more and at such other places as the judges of the district determine. However the court shall not be required to sit in any political subdivision if the governing body of that subdivision by resolution and the court agree that the court shall not sit therein.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-10\">There appear to be no cases defining the word \"sit\u201d in the context in which it is used in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>\u00a7 8251(3).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Center Line would construe \"sit\u201d to require the location of one of the four judges of the 37th judicial district in the city, the situation it had enjoyed <em>de facto </em>from 1969 to 1975. Given the relative source of cases in the 37th judicial district, that construction would require Warren parties, witnesses and attorneys to travel to Center Line for disposition of Warren cases in order to allow the judge in Center Line to shoulder his share of the district\u2019s business. If we were to adopt the city\u2019s position, using the 1970 census, we would be creating many \"full-time\u201d judge locations in the state where none now are thought to exist. We will not interpret the legislative language to achieve a result that body could not have intended. The statute does not require a full-time judge in Center Line, only such services of a judge as may, consistent with the judicial needs of the district, be required to transact whatever judicial business is brought in the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">The statute requires only that some judicial business be conducted in Center Line. The question remains as to what then <em>must </em>be heard in Center Line. The parties agree that by statute the small claims division of the 37th judicial district must sit in Center Line \"once each 30 days\u201d.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Other civil cases were governed by RJA \u00a7 8312(5):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>\"In districts of the second or third class venue in civil actions shall be in the district in which the subject of the action is situated, the cause of action arose or in the district in which the defendant is established or resides. If there is more than 1 defendant, actions shall be filed in the district in which any defendant is established or resides.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">By arguing that civil actions arising out of transactions within Center Line \"ought to be heard\u201d rather than \"must be heard\u201d in Center Line, the city recognizes that this section does not require that general civil cases be tried at a specific location within the 37th judicial district. The city argues only that it is a convenient forum for certain litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">As a result of 1974 PA 319, RJA \u00a7 8312(5) now reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-6\">\"Venue in civil actions shall be governed by the provisions of sections 1601 to 1659 except that for purposes of this subsection all references to 'county\u2019 in sections 1601 to 1659 shall mean 'district\u2019 with respect to districts of the second and third class.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">In adopting by reference RJA \u00a7\u00a7 1601 to 1659, the Legislature has determined that a judicial district is a proper forum for cases arising in that district; we accept the Legislature\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">Center Line argues that all criminal violations alleged to have occurred in Center Line \"ought to be heard\u201d there. The relevant venue provisions are RJA \u00a7\u00a7 8312(3) and 8312(4)(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-9\">\"(3) In a district of the third class, venue in criminal actions for violations of state law and all city, village, or township ordinances shall be in the political subdivi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>sion thereof where the violation took place, except that when such violation is alleged to have taken place within a political subdivision where the court is not required to sit the action may be tried in any political subdivision within the district where the court is required to sit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-5\">\"(4) With regard to state criminal violations cognizable by the district court, the following special provisions shall apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-6\">\"(a) If an offense is committed on the boundary of 2 or more counties, districts, or political subdivisions or within 1 mile thereof, venue is proper in any of the counties, districts, or political subdivisions concerned.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">Under \u00a7\u00a7 8312(3) and 8251(3), it is clear that Center Line ordinance violations must be heard in Center Line. The parties agree that no part of Center Line is more than one mile from Warren; consequently under the exception clause, \u00a7 8312(4)(a), the circuit court concluded that state criminal violations could be heard in Warren. The Court of Appeals noted that the exception was limited to state criminal violations \"cognizable by the district court\u201d. Since the only state criminal violations cognizable by the district court are \"[misdemeanors punishable by fine or imprisonment not exceeding 1 year\u201d,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the panel said that other state criminal violations involving the district court (arraignments and preliminary examination in felony cases) must be heard in Center Line if the violation took place there, under \u00a7 8312(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">In the subsequently enacted 1970 PA 213, however, the Legislature provided a new subsection of MCLA 762.3; MSA 28.846 governing venue in state offenses cognizable by an examining magistrate.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>\"(3) With regard to state offenses cognizable by the examining magistrate and to examinations conducted for offenses not cognizable by the examining magistrate, the following special provisions apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-5\">\"(a) If an offense is committed on the boundary of 2 or more counties, districts or political subdivisions or within 1 mile thereof, venue is proper in any of the counties, districts or political subdivisions concerned.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Insofar as this later statute conflicts with RJA \u00a7 8312(3), it must control as the more recent expression of legislative intention. <em>Antrim County Social Welfare Board v Lapeer County Social Welfare Board, </em>332 Mich 224; 50 NW2d 769 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">We believe that the circuit court correctly determined what must be heard in Center Line. We would not preclude a request to invoke our administrative or rule-making authority if the city can demonstrate that judicial resources can be more effectively used in the 37th judicial district, and the judges do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">The judgment of the circuit court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b691-9\">Coleman, Ryan, and Blair Moody, Jr., JJ., concurred with Fitzgerald, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b685-9\"> 1968 PA 154; MCLA 600.8101 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 27A.8101 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b685-10\"> MCLA 600.8122(1); MSA 27A.8122G).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b685-11\"> MCLA 600.8103(3); MSA 27A.8103(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b685-12\"> MCLA 600.9921; MSA 27A.9921.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b685-13\"> MCLA 600.9928; MSA 27A.9928.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b686-9\"> 74 Mich App 97, 104; 253 NW2d 669 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b686-10\"> See, <em>e.g, </em>MCLA 600.8121(17); MSA 27A.812(17) and MCLA 600.8122(2); MSA 27A.8122(2), the former grouping five cities and one township, and the latter creating a one-city judicial district.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b687-11\"> See, <em>e.g., People v McQuillan, </em>392 Mich 511, 542-543; 221 NW2d 569 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b687-12\"> MCLA 600.8251(3); MSA 27A.825(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b688-8\"> Authorities we have found seem to agree that \"sit\u201d means \"to hold court\u201d or \"do any act of a judicial nature\u201d.

We would hold, however, that the Legislature, in requiring that the court shall sit at each city within the district having a population of 3,250 or more intended that it shall sit to transact all judicial business, civil and criminal, which, under the statutes, <em>may </em>be brought before it, and that the venue provisions do not impliedly confer on the judges any power to limit the scope of the sitting.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">The majority reasons that to the extent, under the venue statutes, the entire \"judicial district is a <em>proper </em>forum for cases arising in that district [emphasis supplied]\u201d, the judges are empowered to direct that all cases be heard in one place in the district.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">The venue provisions do not confer judicial power. They concern, rather, <em>a </em>\"proper\u201d county or district \"in which to commence and try\u201d an action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While it would, unless otherwise provided, be proper under the venue provisions to commence and try an action at any of the places the court sits, it does not follow that it is not proper to commence and try a case at another of the places the court sits. Nor is it implied that the judges of the court are thereby empowered to select the place in the district where the case shall be heard and to refuse to hear it at a statutorily-designated place.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">The act provides that \"[t]he thirty-seventh district consists of the cities of Warren and Center Line, is a district of the third class and has 4 judges\u201d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It further provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-9\">\"In districts of the third class the court <em>shall sit </em>at each city having a population of 3,250 or more and within each township having a population of 12,000 or more and at such other places as the judges of the district determine. However the court shall not be required to sit in any political subdivision if the govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>ing body of that subdivision by resolution and the court agree that the court shall not sit therein.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">It is thus clear that while the judges have the power to determine \"other places\u201d where the court shall sit and agree to a resolution of a political subdivision \"that the court shall not sit therein\u201d, they do not have the power to refuse to sit in a statutorily-designated place of sitting.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">The venue provisions seek to protect a defendant from being required to answer a complaint in an inappropriate county or district. The designation of multiple places of sitting in the district is for the primary convenience of litigants and lawyers at the locales designated and seeks to secure to the people a court at such locales. If the Legislature intended that the judges determine where within the district the court \"shall sit\u201d it would not have designated places of sitting statutorily. If the venue provisions were to govern, instead of the elaborate provisions regarding places of sitting all that should have been said was that \"the court shall sit at the places within the district the judges shall determine, except as otherwise required by law\u201d. The construction of the majority deprives the words \"shall sit\u201d of most of their meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">The majority avoids resolving where small claims \"must\u201d be heard, stating: \"The <em>parties agree </em>that by statute the small claims division of the 37th judicial district must sit in Center Line <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>'once each 30 days.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis supplied.) That disposition makes it unnecessary for the majority to decide whether the small claims venue provisions empower the judges of the 37th district court to require that all small claims arising in the district be heard in Warren.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">The act provides, paralleling the venue provisions applicable in civil actions generally (fn 1), that \"[i]n districts of the second or third class actions in the small claims division shall be commenced in the district in which the cause of action arose or in the district in which the defendant is established or resides\u201d.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">It would therefore appear, by the process of reasoning applied to civil actions generally (Part I, <em>supra) </em>and state law violations (Part III, <em>infra), </em>that the judges of this district court are empowered to require that all judicial business, including small claims, be conducted in Warren, except violations of City of Center Line Ordinances. If \"shall sit\u201d does not take precedence over venue provisions, neither does \"shall sit at least once each 30 days\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">The majority states that because \"venue in criminal actions for violations of * * * all city, village, or township ordinances shall be in the political subdivision thereof where the violation took place\u201d,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> charges of ordinance violations must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>heard in Center Line.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">It is stated, however, that charges of state law violations which occurred in Center Line need not be heard in Center Line because no part of Center Line is more than one mile from Warren<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and a 1970 amendment to the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that where \"an offense is committed on the boundary of\u2019 any political subdivision or \"within 1 mile thereof, venue is proper in any\u201d \"political subdivision concerned\u201d.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The amended provision concerns offenses committed so close to the boundary of a political subdivision that it is difficult or impossible to determine the subdivision in which they occurred; it is designed to facilitate the prosecution of offenders who otherwise might claim that the venue is improperly laid.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">The majority\u2019s construction means that the Legislature conferred power on judges of a district having the geographic configuration of the 37th district to concentrate all state law violations in one place of sitting, but did not confer such power where a statutorily-designated subdivision is not in its entirety within one mile of its boundary. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>would not ascribe such an anomalous intent to the Legislature. If it wished to confer such power on these or all district judges, it would have done so in a more congruous manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">The district court act was enacted pursuant to Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 26, which abolished the offices of circuit court commissioner and justice of the peace not later than five years from the date the Constitution became effective. \"Within this five-year period, the legislature shall establish a court or courts of limited jurisdiction with powers and jurisdiction defined by law.\u201d It was contemplated, as appears from the Address to the People, that the Legislature would \"re-evaluate the entire system of courts of limited jurisdiction and * * * develop a lower court structure better adapted to the needs of the people and the ends of justice\u201d. 2 Official Record, Constitutional Convention 1961, p 3389. Statutory courts, including municipal courts, were not abolished and these courts continued unchanged \"except as provided by law, until they are abolished by law\u201d.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">The district court act bears the hallmarks of legislative compromise. Cities of 3,250 or more, many of which stood to lose, as Center Line did, their municipal courts, were designated as places in which the district court shall sit. In that context it is apparent that the commitment was not that the court would sit in some truncated manner at the pleasure of the judges, but, rather, that it would sit to conduct the usual business of the court.
