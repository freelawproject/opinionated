I was of the opinion that such a policy would prevent arbitrary and capricious school board action. Justices Williams and Fitzgerald joined in that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Justice Coleman, joined by Justices Levin and Ryan, wrote to answer the question negatively, finding that while definite written notice of satisfactory or unsatisfactory work was mandated by the teachers\u2019 tenure act, MCL 38.71 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 15.1971 <em>et seq., </em>school boards were not required <em>to </em>include reasons for their conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Because of our even division we ordered the cause resubmitted and Justice Moody has written to adopt the view expressed in my first opinion. With apology for any embarrassment my change of mind may cause, I write to say that I am now convinced that reasons need not be stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">My confession of error should not be taken as a retreat from the position expressed in my first opinion that the tenure commission was correct in accepting jurisdiction to decide the question here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b642-10\">The act\u2019s provision, MCL 38.83; MSA 15.1983, that the board give written notice to probationary teachers of unsatisfactory work does not include a mandate that a statement of reasons accompany that notice. I find it unnecessary to read a \"reason\u201d requirement into the provision in order to effect the act\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-11\">A probationary period is provided in the act and distinguished from tenure to afford a trial period during which a controlling board may make a subjective determination of whether a certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>teacher satisfies that district\u2019s particular needs and policy. We should not require that such a procedure meet an objective standard applicable to all school districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">The absence of provision for hearing at the school board level and for review of a board\u2019s decision that a probationary teacher\u2019s work was unsatisfactory in this act, which provides such a procedure for hearing and a forum for review, the tenure commission, where the issue is the propriety of the discharge of a tenured teacher, indicates that it was not intended that a school board\u2019s determination of whether a probationary teacher has completed the period of probation satisfactorily would be subject to review by the tenure commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">The act identifies arbitrary and capricious policies <em>(Munro v Elk Rapids Schools, </em>383 Mich 661, 688; 178 NW2d 450 [1970], <em>On Rehearing, </em>385 Mich 618; 189 NW2d 224 [1971]) at which it is directed. A teacher no longer can be continued in a probationary status indefinitely; after two, and sometimes three, years of employment without timely notice of unsatisfactory work, the teacher obtains tenure and cannot thereafter be discharged except for cause. Notice of non-reappointment must be given within the time stated in the act so that the teacher has adequate time to seek other employment for the next school year.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Adoption of an impermissible policy contrary to the spirit of the act (see, <em>eg, Wilson v Flint Board of Education, </em>361 Mich 691; 106 NW2d 136 [1960]) is not demonstrated by showing that an arguably \"incorrect\u201d determination was made in a particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">The tenure commission may not assay a board\u2019s reason for concluding the work unsatisfactory. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>act is followed when the notice of unsatisfactory work is timely given whether based on good, bad or unstated reasons. If timely notice of unsatisfactory work is given, no entitlement to tenure arises under the act, and therefore the Due Process Clause does not require a hearing. See <em>Board of Regents v Roth, </em>408 US 564; 92 S Ct 2701; 33 L Ed 2d 548 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">For the reasons set forth in my opinion on the earlier submission, the circuit court and Court of Appeals erred in deciding that the tenure commission does not have jurisdiction to decide the question here involved. If a teacher claims tenure as a result of satisfactory completion of probation, the determination of timeliness or legal effect of a notice of unsatisfactory work is always within the jurisdiction of the tenure commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">The board\u2019s notice in this case was effective. The teachers did not satisfactorily complete their probationary period so as to be entitled to tenure.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">Accordingly, the Court of Appeals is reversed. The order of reinstatement is set aside and the matter remanded to the tenure commission with instructions to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-10\">No costs. A public question.</p>\n<judges id=\"b644-11\">Levin, Coleman, and Ryan, JJ., concurred with Kavanagh, C.J.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b644-12\">Blair Moody, Jr., J.</author>\n<p id=\"AzE\"><em>(dissenting). </em>We granted rehearing in these cases to reconsider the questions which previously had divided our Court. 399 Mich 704; 252 NW2d 770 (1977). In those cases, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>were presented with two questions involving the teachers\u2019 tenure act, MCL 38.71 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 15.1971 <em>et seq.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-4\">\"(1) Whether a teacher who alleges that the controlling board failed to provide him with proper notification as to whether or not his work was unsatisfactory and that his services would be discontinued at least 60 days before the close of the last school year of his probationary period achieves tenure status for the limited purpose of allowing him to appeal the board\u2019s action to the State Tenure Commission?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-5\">\"(2) Whether a controlling board must set forth the reasons why it has determined a probationary teacher\u2019s work to be unsatisfactory in the statement delivered to the probationary teacher pursuant to MCL 38.83; MSA 15.1983?\u201d 399 Mich 706-707.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">For the reasons set forth in the opinion of Chief Justice Kavanagh heretofore filed herein (with Justices Williams and Fitzgerald concurring) and reported at 399 Mich 706-720, we would answer both questions in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Specifically, we would hold:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-8\">\"(1) A teacher who alleges that the controlling board failed to provide him with proper notification as to whether or not his work was unsatisfactory and that his services would be discontinued at least 60 days before the close of the last school year of his probationary period, pursuant to MCL 38.83; MSA 15.1983, achieves tenure status for the limited purpose of allowing him to appeal the board\u2019s determination to the State Tenure Commission;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-9\">\"(2) The controlling board must set forth the reasons why it has determined a probationary teacher\u2019s work to be unsatisfactory in the definite written statement delivered to the probationary teacher pursuant to MCL 38.83; MSA 15.1983.\u201d 399 Mich 719.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Chief Justice Kavanagh succinctly analyzed the reason for allowing the probationary teachers to appeal the action of the school board to the State Tenure Commission:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-7\">\"Plaintiffs contend that they became tenured by operation of law due to the failure of the board to properly notify them at least 60 days before the close of the last probationary school year, and therefore were entitled to appeal the action of the board to the State Tenure Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-8\">\"Plaintiffs recognize that only teachers who have 'achieved tenure status may appeal any decision of a controlling board * * * to a state tenure commission\u2019. They argue, however, that because the required notice of nonretention was ineffective (see discussion, <em>infra), </em>they could not be denied tenure, and therefore 'achieved tenure\u2019 by operation of law on the 59th day prior to the close of the last school year of their probationary period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-9\">\"Defendants, however, point to MCL 38.81; MSA 15.1981, which states that '[a]ll teachers during the first 2 years of employment shall be deemed to be in a period of probation\u2019. Thus, as plaintiffs had not completed two years of employment, they were still probationary teachers and had not 'achieved tenure status\u2019 allowing them to appeal to the tenure commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-10\">\"In the case at bar, the tenure commission accepted the appeal and ordered plaintiffs reinstated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-11\">\"The circuit court agreed that the tenure commission had jurisdiction, finding that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-12\">\" 'since the notice was defective, it constituted no notice at all and thus the appellees acquired tenure by operation of law. * * * [W]hen the teachers received the defective notice they then acquired tenure on the 59th day before the end of the school year for this purpose. Nothing the school board could do after the 59th day before the end of the school year could remove the appellees from a tenure status that they acquired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>by virtue of the defective notice and from that time on the school board had to treat them as tenured teachers. Thus being tenured teachers they were within the purview of the tenure commission and had a right to immediately petition the tenure commission for a determination.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-4\">\"In <em>Young v Hazel Park School District, </em>No 64-2 (State Tenure Commission, June 23, 1965), the commission was presented with a case of alleged improper notice to a probationary teacher. The school board claimed that this teacher had no right to appeal to the tenure commission as he was still a probationary teacher.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-5\">\"The tenure commission found that it had jurisdiction, stating that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-6\">\" 'upon the failure of the appellee to act affirmatively, the appellant although serving under a probationary contract, became entitled to the right of appeal when the board failed to act at least 60 days before the end of the school year. His right to tenure status became fully vested as of that time and this right clearly grants to him the right of appeal. He was no longer deemed to be in a period of probation for the purpose of his appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-7\">\" 'We further believe that this determination is consistent with the general purpose of the tenure act, which is to resolve conflicts between the teacher and the board without the necessity of court action, so long as it is consistent with the general principle that the tenure commission is not assuming powers reserved to the courts under the wording of the act or its reasonable interpretation.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-8\">\"The State Tenure Commission followed the rule it had established in <em>Young v Hazel Park School District, supra, </em>for eight years and accepted jurisdiction in this type of case. We believe that was the correct practice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-9\">\"We are satisfied that the State Tenure Commission is well qualified to make the primary determination as to whether or not a teacher has, in fact, 'achieved tenure status\u2019. MCL 38.121; MSA 15.2021. Questions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>concerning tenure are peculiarly within the commission\u2019s expertise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-4\">\"We agree with the commission\u2019s observation in <em>Young v School District of Hazel Park, supra:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-5\">\" 'We further believe that this determination is consistent with the general purpose of the tenure act, which is to resolve conflicts between the teacher and the board without the necessity of court action, so long as it is consistent with the general principle that the tenure commission is not assuming powers reserved to the courts under the wording of the act or its reasonable interpretation.\u2019\u201d 399 Mich 710-715.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">We agree with the analysis of Chief Justice Kavanagh, the State Tenure Commission and the Sanilac Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">The teachers\u2019 tenure act, MCL 38.71 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 15.1971 <em>et seq., </em>provides that \"[a]ll teachers during the first 2 school years of employment shall be deemed to be in a period of probation\u201d.

The statute further provides in MCL 38.83; MSA 15.1983:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-9\">\"At least 60 days before the close of each school year the controlling board shall provide the probationary teacher with a <em>de\u00f1nite </em>written statement as to whether or not his work has been satisfactory.
