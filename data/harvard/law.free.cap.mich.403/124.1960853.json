Plaintiff filed a circuit court suit against both the church and the City of Lansing, alleging what he has denominated \"negligence\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiff later amended his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>complaint, alleging a count he has referred to on appeal as \"attractive nuisance\u201d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">The trial court granted the City of Lansing\u2019s motion for summary judgment grounded on governmental immunity. The Court of Appeals affirmed, <em>Rosario v </em>Lansing; 66 Mich App 597; 239 NW2d 428 (1976). We granted leave to appeal, 399 Mich 835 (1977). Because the case comes to us on summary judgment, we accept plaintiff\u2019s factual allegations as true.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">I \u2014 Nuisance</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">We first note that because the alleged cause of action arose after August 1, 1970, the date upon which 1970 PA 155 cured the constitutional defect in 1964 PA 170 (MCLA 691.1407; MSA 3.996[107]), we must consider the application of the governmental immunity statute<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to this case. <em>Thomas v Department of State </em>Highways, 398 Mich 1; 247 NW2d 530 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">We noted in <em>Thomas </em>that the Legislature has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>enacted several exceptions to immunity. In addition to the legislatively created exceptions, there exists a significant judicially created exception to governmental immunity from tort liability \u2014 the nuisance exception.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The nuisance exception arises solely from the case law. The statute is silent on the question of the relationship between governmental immunity and nuisance. Thus, we turn to our case law to determine the nature of the nuisance exception to governmental immunity. \"[T]he evolution of case-law precedent is exclusively committed to the judicial branch of government.\u201d <em>Thomas, </em>p 17, fn 4 (Kavanagh \u2014 Fitzgerald dissenting opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">The instant case presents two questions: Did plaintiff plead a nuisance claim? If so, is governmental immunity a defense to that claim?</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">The questions are not easily answered. As Dean Prosser explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\">\"There is perhaps no more impenetrable jungle in the entire law than that which surrounds the word 'nuisance.\u2019 It has meant all things to all men, and has been applied indiscriminately to everything from an alarming advertisement to a cockroach baked in a pie. There is general agreement that it is incapable of any exact or comprehensive definition.\u201d Prosser, Torts (4th ed), \u00a7 86, p 571.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Judge, now Justice, Levin, dissenting in <em>Maki v East Tawas, </em>18 Mich App 109, 134; 170 NW2d 530 (1969), heeded Dean Prosser\u2019s warning, and declined to take an excursion into that jungle.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>instant case requires that we embark on that excursion.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">First, has plaintiff pled a nuisance claim? Under our case law liability for nuisance is predicated on the existence of a dangerous condition.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-5\">\"Primarily, nuisance is a condition. Liability is not predicated on tortious conduct through action or inaction on the part of those responsible for the condition. Nuisance may result from want of due care (like a hole in a highway), but may still exist as a dangerous, offensive, or hazardous condition even with the best of care.\u201d <em>Buckeye Union Fire Ins Co v Michigan, </em>383 Mich 630, 636; 178 NW2d 476 (1970).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">See, also, <em>Munson v Menominee County, </em>371 Mich 504; 124 NW2d 246 (1963); <em>Bluemer v Saginaw Central Oil &amp; Gas Service, Inc, </em>356 Mich 399; 97 NW2d 90 (1959); and <em>Maki v East Tawas, </em>385 Mich 151; 188 NW2d 593 (1971). An improperly designed or maintained manhole cover may constitute a nuisance. <em>Dahl v Glover, </em>344 Mich 639; 75 NW2d 11 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">In <em>Bluemer v Saginaw Central Oil &amp; Gas Service, supra, </em>we explained one classification of nuisances, citing with approval 66 CJS, Nuisances, \u00a7 3, pp 733-734:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-8\">\" 'From the point of view of their nature, nuisances are sometimes classified as nuisances <em>per se </em>or at law, and nuisances <em>per accidens </em>or in fact. A nuisance at law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>or a nuisance <em>per se </em>is an act, occupation, or structure which is a nuisance at all times and under any circumstances, regardless of location or surroundings. Nuisances in fact or <em>per accidens </em>are those which become nuisances by reason of circumstances and surroundings, and an act may be found to be a nuisance as a matter of fact where the natural tendency of the act is to create danger and inflict injury on person or property. The number of nuisances <em>per se </em>is necessarily limited, and by far the greater number of nuisances are nuisances <em>per accidens. </em>For this reason whether or not a particular thing or act is a nuisance is generally a question of fact ***.\u2019\u201d 356 Mich 411.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">Plaintiff here alleged \"an extremely dangerous and hazardous condition * * * but that said defendant negligently failed and refused to take any steps whatsoever to secure the covering of said drain * * * The first amended complaint sufficiently alleges a nuisance in fact. Accordingly plaintiff should have been allowed to present proofs to the jury on the question of nuisance unless governmental immunity bars the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Second, does governmental immunity bar recovery of damages for personal injury or death caused by a nuisance in fact? The last time this question was squarely presented to the Court, because the governmental immunity statute was ruled unconstitutional, we found it \"unnecessary to decide what effect the nature of this nuisance recovery <em>(i.e., </em>'manner of operation\u2019) has on municipal immunity\u201d. <em>Maki, supra, </em>385 Mich 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">The fact that there exists some form of nuisance exception to governmental immunity emerges clearly from case precedent.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The limits of that exception present the more difficult question.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>We find it unnecessary to dwell at any great length on the early cases in which Michigan governmental immunity originated. As the doctrine crystallized, several different justifications for either governmental liability or non-liability can be discerned. The result is that a case can be found supporting almost any proposition concerning governmental immunity one chooses to advance.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">We turn then to more recent history. In the instant case the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial judge\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the City of Lansing by relying on <em>Royston v Charlotte, </em>278 Mich 255, 260; 270 NW 288 (1936).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-6\">\"Acts in the discharge of governmental functions which create a nuisance <em>per se </em>do not come within the immunity otherwise accorded. Want of care in maintenance, however, presents the question of negligence only, and not that of a public nuisance, which must rest on inherent danger even under the best of care.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>No authority was cited for that proposition.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The implication that only nuisances <em>per se </em>were outside governmental immunity was not well-grounded in prior case law. Injunctions regulating the activity of governmental entities have nearly always been available without regard to whether the nuisance was a nuisance per se or a nuisance in fact.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\"><em>Royston </em>was severely questioned in <em>Buckeye Union Fire Ins Co v Michigan, </em>383 Mich 630; 178 NW2d 476 (1970), where we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-7\">\"It must be concluded that <em>Royston </em>is not applicable to a case involving a nuisance, this Court having clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>held that the situation in <em>Royston </em>involved negligence only.\u201d 383 Mich 634,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">and,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-5\">\"Negligence, which is antecedent to and responsible for the nuisance, is not our concern here even though the nuisance in this case may have been created by negligent acts.\u201d 383 Mich 635,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">citing several cases since <em>Royston, </em>in which recovery was had for nuisance created by negligence, and, finally,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-7\">\"Damage to plaintiffs flowed from the nuisance and the mere fact that negligence may have existed in a variety of acts or by inaction by the state during the continuing period of the nuisance will not permit it to escape its liability.\u201d 383 Mich 638.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">We held that governmental immunity was not a defense to nearby landowners\u2019 claims for property damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">The nuisance in <em>Buckeye, </em>a building which was a fire hazard, was a nuisance in fact. The nuisance was created by negligent acts. Had nuisance been the sole basis for the decision that governmental immunity was not applicable in that case, we would without hesitancy state that <em>Buckeye </em>recognizes a nuisance in fact exception to governmental immunity.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">The decision in <em>Buckeye </em>also rests on the state\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>taking of private property without just compensation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Buckeye </em>dealt with the state\u2019s immunity. We said that the Legislature \"has dealt with waiver of the state\u2019s immunity from tort liability by 'a pattern of deliberate legislative choices\u2019 \u201d (383 Mich 640), citing <em>McDowell v State Highway Commissioner, </em>365 Mich 268; 112 NW2d 491 (1961). We reexamined <em>McDowell in Pittman v City of Taylor, </em>398 Mich 41; 247 NW2d 512 (1976), and concluded that <em>McDowell </em>was erroneous in concluding that the Legislature granted statutory tort immunity to the state in 1945. <em>Pittman, supra, </em>46-47, fn 1. We now recognize that governmental immunity is not solely a creature of the Legislature. <em>Pittman, supra. </em>Hence we find it unnecessary to resort to a constitutional provision to hold that the defense of governmental immunity may not be asserted against a claim properly alleging nuisance.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">That we did intend that <em>Buckeye </em>recognize a nuisance-in-fact exception to governmental immunity was soon assured. We said in <em>Ebel v Saginaw County Board of Road Commissioners, </em>386 Mich 598, 607; 194 NW2d 365 (1972): \"No state agency is free to maintain a nuisance, and hence it cannot permit or require another person to do so.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>One final question must be addressed. The first sentence of MCLA 691.1407; MSA 3.996(107) reads: \"Except as in this act otherwise provided, all governmental agencies shall be immune from tort liability in all cases wherein the government agency is engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Liability for nuisance was found in the case precedent without regard to the \"governmental function\u201d question.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The nuisance exception \"antedates the governmental-function defense by decades\u201d. Cooperrider, <em>The Courts, the Legislature and Governmental Tort Liability in Michigan, </em>72 Mich L Rev 187, 279 (1973). In <em>Buckeye, supra, </em>defendant asserted as. an affirmative defense the fact that it was not engaged in a proprietary function. The issue was not discussed by the Court. We agree with Professor Cooperrider\u2019s conclusion that the nuisance exception exists independent of the \"governmental function\u201d defense. <em>Ibid, </em>pp 280-281.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">In conclusion, plaintiff has sufficiently pled a claim grounded upon nuisance in fact. Governmental immunity does not bar the claim. Whether or not the open drain was a nuisance was a question for the jury. Therefore, the granting of the sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>mary judgment for the City of Lansing was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">II \u2014 Attractive Nuisance</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Plaintiffs complaint alleged that the open drain in which DeAndrea Rosario drowned was an \"attractive nuisance\u201d. The use of those words points to what is now called the landowner\u2019s liability for harm caused by artificial conditions highly dangerous to trespassing children, 2 Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 339. \"Attractive nuisance\u201d law is essentially negligence law. 2 Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 339, comment o; Prosser, Torts (4th ed), \u00a7 59, p 366. In those jurisdictions confining nuisance to the strict Prosser definition of public and private nuisance the use of the word \"nuisance\u201d to describe an \"artificial condition highly dangerous to trespassing children\u201d might well be a misnomer. Given our broader definition of the term \"nuisance\u201d, the phrase \"attractive nuisance\u201d is more accurate. Plaintiffs counsel stated in oral argument that it was not the negligence concept of \"attractive nuisance\u201d that he relied upon as an exception to governmental immunity, but that he relied upon \"nuisance\u201d as an inherently dangerous condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">At one time we did confine the term \"nuisance\u201d to public nuisance (referring to the obstruction of the right to travel on the public highway) and private nuisance (referring to the invasion by a neighbor of one\u2019s interest in person or property as a landowner). <em>Kilts v Kent County Supervisors, </em>162 Mich 646; 127 NW 821 (1910).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-8\">\"But a private person may use his own premises as he will, so long as he does no injury to the public, or to the property and rights of a private person, and one may erect a weak structure upon his premises, so far <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>from the street and other\u2019s property, that persons not entering upon his premises can be in no danger from it.\u201d 162 Mich 646, 650.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Later cases, however, have expanded \"nuisance\u201d so that the term now applies to members of the public injured on the landowner\u2019s premises. In <em>Munson v Menominee County, </em>371 Mich 504; 124 NW2d 246 (1963), the plaintiff was a state employee who was injured when a window shade fell on her while she was working in a county-owned building leased to the state. In <em>Bluemer v Saginaw Central Oil &amp; Gas Service, Inc, supra, </em>the plaintiff was a member of the public injured when he fell through an open trap door in a service station where he had gone to purchase gasoline. In <em>Maki v East Tawas, supra, </em>385 Mich 151, we affirmed plaintiff\u2019s recovery in nuisance when he was struck in the eye by an exploding bullet at defendant\u2019s city dump where he had gone to discard refuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Mildred Munson, Marvin Bluemer and Leo Maki all were in places where they were allowed to be when injured. What then of DeAndrea Rosario? She was a trespasser. This is where the doctrine of \"attractive nuisance\u201d comes into play. The doctrine takes into account the peculiar nature of children.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-7\">\"The moving about of the children upon the land where they were at liberty to go, while they were not actually employed, was as much an incident to their being there as is the loitering or playing by children outside the traveled part of the highway as they go upon it to school or upon errands. Children, wherever they go, must be expected to act upon childish instincts and impulses; and others who are chargeable with a duty of care and caution towards them must calculate upon this, and take precautions accordingly. If they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>leave exposed to the observation of children anything which would be tempting to them, and which they in their immature judgment might naturally suppose they were at liberty to handle or play with, they should expect that liberty to be taken.\u201d <em>Powers v Harlow, </em>53 Mich 507, 515; 19 NW 257 (1884).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">The fact that DeAndrea Rosario was a child of 19 months is one of the circumstances to be considered by the jury in determining whether or not the open drain was a nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Defendant contends the doctrine of attractive nuisance has never been adopted in Michigan. Defendant is incorrect. See <em>Lyshak v Detroit, </em>351 Mich 230; 88 NW2d 596 (1957); <em>Petrak v Cooke Contracting Co, </em>329 Mich 564; 46 NW2d 574 (1951); and <em>Elbert v Saginaw, </em>363 Mich 463; 109 NW2d 879 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">The Court of Appeals relied on <em>Royston v Charlotte, supra, </em>in holding attractive nuisance inapplicable to the case at bar. While it is true that the defective swing in a city park upon which the plaintiff\u2019s decedent was injured in <em>Royston </em>was not an attractive nuisance, the instant case can be easily distinguished. The swing in <em>Royston </em>was specifically designed to be attractive to children. The swing was placed in the park for the entertainment of children. It is glaringly apparent that such was not the purpose of the sewer in which the life of DeAndrea Rosario came to its tragic end.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">Reversed.

If the trier of fact finds the existence of a nuisance in fact, the trier of fact must then determine whether the nuisance in fact was created negligently or intentionally. When the trier of fact determines that the alleged nuisance was intentional, governmental immunity is not a bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">In order to find an intentional nuisance, the trier of fact must decide based upon the evidence presented that the governmental agency intended to bring about the conditions which are in fact found to be a nuisance. This finding comports with the definition of intentional nuisance set forth in <em>Denny v Garavaglia, </em>333 Mich 317, 331; 52 NW2d 521 (1952):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-8\">\"A second [type of nuisance] includes nuisances which are intentional, using that word as meaning not that a wrong or the existence of a nuisance was intended but that the creator of them intended to bring about the conditions which are in fact found to be a nuisance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">Therefore, in the present case, if the plaintiff pled an intentional nuisance claim, the trial court\u2019s summary judgment for the City of Lansing on governmental immunity grounds must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>Plaintiffs complaint against the governmental agency alleged the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-5\">\"That the City of Lansing, its agents, servants, or employees, knew or should have known that there was no top on said drain and that said open drain constituted an inherently dangerous condition, but that <em>the City of Lansing </em>neglected, failed and <em>refused to place any top on said drain, </em>failed to provide any barricades around said open drain, or to provide any warning or take any steps whatsoever to remove, repair, or eliminate this inherently dangerous condition.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The terms \"neglected\u201d and \"failed\u201d allege negligent activity.

The Court of Appeals affirmed. 66 Mich App 597; 239 NW2d 428 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">As was observed in <em>Thomas v Department of State </em>Highways, 398 Mich 1, 10; 247 NW2d 530 (1976):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">\"The historical context in which the governmental immunity statute was enacted suggests that the Legislature, alarmed at the prospects of liability for govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>mental activities previously protected, sought to restore the immunity enjoyed by municipalities prior to <em>Williams v Detroit; </em>364 Mich 231; 111 NW2d 1 (1961), <em>and to codify the state\u2019s existing immunity to insulate governmental entities from tort liability.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Consequently, in order to determine the scope of the now codified immunity, we must determine the scope of its antecedent \"existing immunity\u201d. Since the common-law or \"existing immunity\u201d doctrine included certain judicially created exceptions which defined its limits, the legislatively codified immunity is limited and defined by the same exceptions. One of these exceptions is here in issue: the doctrine of \"nuisance\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">In <em>Gerzeski v Department of State Highways; </em>403 Mich 149; 268 NW2d 525 (1978), we were asked to define the perimeters of the judicially created \"nuisance\u201d exception as it related to judicially created sovereign immunity. After reviewing prior case law, I concluded that the \"nuisance exception\u201d, as it is commonly known, is limited to two subclasses of nuisance, \"nuisances per se\u201d and \"intruding nuisances\u201d and observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-7\">\"The first exception entails those situations where the state creates or maintains a 'nuisance per se\u2019. <em>Royston v Charlotte, 278 </em>Mich <em>255, 260; 270 </em>NW 288 (1936). See, for example of 'nuisance per se\u2019, <em>Trowbridge v Lansing, </em>237 Mich 402; 212 NW 73 (1927), decaying garbage in 'piggery\u2019; <em>Attorney General ex rel Wyoming Twp v Grand Rapids, 175 </em>Mich 503; 141 NW 890 (1913), disposing of raw sewage in river.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-8\">\"Such activities or conditions are properly characterized as a 'nuisance per se\u2019 because they are nuisances without regard to the care with which they are conducted or the circumstances under which they exist. <em>Bluemer v Saginaw Central Oil &amp; Gas Service, Inc, </em>356 Mich 399, 411; 97 NW2d 90 (1959); <em>People v Detroit </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number><em>White Lead Works, </em>82 Mich 471, 476; 46 NW 735 (1890).\u201d <em>Gerzeski </em>at 149.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-4\">\"The second judicial exception to governmental immunity consists of those situations wherein damage is caused by the direct trespass of an instrumentality from government-owned land onto private property. <em>Buckeye Union Ins Co v Michigan, </em>383 Mich 630; 178 NW2d 476 (1960), fire spreading from state maintained hazard; <em>Herro v Chippewa County Road Commissioners, </em>368 Mich 263; 118 NW2d 271 (1962), flooding waters escaping from artificial reservoir; <em>Ferris v Board of Education of Detroit, </em>122 Mich 315; 81 NW 98 (1899), slippery condition created by ice and snow falling from roof of government-owned building onto neighboring land.\u201d <em>Gerzeski </em>at 149.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">For the reasons stated <em>infra, </em>those same conclusions are equally applicable to this legislatively created immunity case.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">In this case, plaintiffs\u2019 complaint against the City of Lansing alleged that the open sewer drain constituted an unreasonably dangerous condition. The liability of the city in connection therewith was essentially predicated upon the city\u2019s negligent conduct in failing to replace the top on the drain, provide barricades around the drain, or provide any warning of this dangerous condition after its representatives knew or should have known of the dangerous condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">It is readily apparent that plaintiffs\u2019 complaint does not allege a factual basis sufficient to establish either a \"nuisance per se\u201d or an \"intruding nuisance\u201d. Rather, the claim is one for damages predicated upon the city\u2019s carelessness in failing to remedy a dangerous condition. This Court has previously refused to except from the defense of governmental immunity, negligence claims brought under the guise and label of \"nuisance\u201d. <em>McDowell v State Highway Commissioner, </em>365 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>Mich 268; 112 NW2d 491 (1961); <em>Royston v Charlotte, supra; Daniels v Board of Education of Grand Rapids, </em>191 Mich 339; 158 NW 23 (1916).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">I reemphasize that the narrow judicial exceptions to governmental immunity extend only to \"per se\u201d and \"intruding\u201d nuisances.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Accordingly, I would affirm the finding of the Court of Appeals.
