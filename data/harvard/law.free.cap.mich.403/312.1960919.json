Two officers approached the automobile. Trooper Olson asked Hilber for his driver\u2019s license and registration. Olson smelled an odor of burned marijuana. After receiving and examining the license and registration, he asked Hilber if he had marijuana in the automobile. Hilber took a cigarette package from the dashboard, got out of the automobile and handed it to Olson. The package contained four hand-rolled cigarettes that appeared to Olson, based on his training and experience, to be marijuana cigarettes.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">Trooper Lahde escorted Hilber to the scout car, and arrested him. Olson searched the automobile and found marijuana paraphernalia and the amphetamines in a jacket lying on the front passenger seat. He also found a plastic container containing marijuana cigarette butts and a paper bag containing about five pounds of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Hilber moved to suppress the evidence seized in the search. The circuit judge suppressed the marijuana cigarettes because he found a violation of <em>Miranda v Arizona, </em>384 US 436; 86 S Ct 1602; 16 L Ed 2d 694; 10 ALR3d 974 (1966), but further found that the odor of marijuana justified the search of the automobile and denied the motion to suppress the other evidence that had been seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Hilber\u2019s appeal to the Court of Appeals raised six issues. The Court of Appeals, addressing only one issue, agreed that the marijuana cigarettes had been properly suppressed, but disagreed with the judge\u2019s ruling that the search was justified, and reversed Hilber\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">The people do not challenge the suppression of the marijuana cigarettes, and do not claim that the cigarettes justified the search. Nor do they claim that the search was an incident of Hilber\u2019s arrest.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">The people contend, rather, that the odor of burned marijuana provided reasonable cause to believe that Hilber had smoked the marijuana that caused the odor and that there was unsmoked marijuana in the automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">Hilber contends that, while the odor of <em>burning </em>marijuana indicates the presence of marijuana, the odor of <em>burned </em>marijuana indicates only the presence of marijuana in the past and does not alone establish probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b404-11\">Cases in other jurisdictions<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> where the officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>smelled unburned marijuana and upon a search discovered a large quantity are not in point. The odor of <em>unburned </em>marijuana indicates the actual presence of marijuana; the odor of <em>burned </em>marijuana indicates only that at some time in the past marijuana was present and burned.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">In still other cases, however, courts have held that the odor of burned marijuana may provide probable cause for an arrest or search.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We share the view that the odor of burned marijuana, in some circumstances, may provide reason to believe that a particular person smoked it (probable cause for arrest) or that there is a quantity of unsmoked marijuana (probable cause to search for it). In this case, however, the record supports neither conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Olson testified that he smelled \"a distinct, strong odor of marijuana coming from the car\u201d,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>in his opinion the marijuana had been smoked \"quite recently\u201d. When asked whether \"it could have been burned a day ago\u201d and \"be in the seats, in the fabric itself?\u201d he responded: \"It could be, but it was stronger\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Olsoh had attended lectures on narcotics \"at which time they burned marijuana\u201d. He had an opportunity to smell its \"distinct odor all of its own\u201d. He acknowledged, however, that he had not been trained in determining the length of time a residual marijuana odor has lingered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-6\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>* * * In your training, you \u2014 the only marijuana that you smelled was that burning directly in the room, is that correct? No residual odor of something that had been burnt prior?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-7\">\"A. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-8\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>Did you have any training for that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-9\">\"A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-10\">\"Q. As to how recently it had been burned?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-11\">\"A. No, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-12\">Hilber did not appear to Olson to be under the influence of marijuana.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-13\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b406-14\">\"Probable cause\u201d has been restated as \"reasonable cause\u201d. Reasonable cause is cause based on reason deemed adequate. The adequacy of the cause and reason depends on a balancing of the needs of law enforcement and of the individual\u2019s right to be protected against undue invasion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>reasonable expectations of privacy and on an appraisal of how a prudent person would view the factual circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The inquiry is not subjective, into the officer\u2019s good faith, but, rather, objective, measured by a standard determined by the court based on its balancing of all the factors and its appraisal of how a prudent person would view the factual circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">The people have the burden of proof on the probable cause issue.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">In contending that it was proper to conclude, from the odor of burned marijuana alone, that Hilber smoked the marijuana and that there was unsmoked marijuana in the automobile the people rely on multiple inferences:</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">\u2014an inference that, where there is an odor of burned marijuana in an automobile, a driver/sole occupant smoked the marijuana, and</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">\u2014an inference that a marijuana smoker carries a supply.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">Because most or all of us have no first-hand experience with marijuana, there may be a tendency to appraise the reasonableness of those inferences based on' our knowledge of the habits of tobacco smokers \u2014 still another inference in this chain of inferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">Even if it is reasonable to infer that a tobacco odor in an automobile was caused by the driver/ owner/sole occupant, although tobacco odor and other odors <em>(e.g., </em>beer and alcohol) are commonly caused by someone not the driver or other occupant at the time the odor is detected,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> it may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>unsound to assume that marijuana smokers have the same smoking habits as tobacco smokers and therefore it may be unsound to appraise evidence relating to the conduct of marijuana smokers by standards of reference inferred from the habits of tobacco smokers:</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">\u2014Marijuana, because it is a prohibited substance, is less available and more costly than tobacco. A marijuana smoker may therefore be less likely to have a supply of unsmoked marijuana and more likely to have run out than a tobacco smoker.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">\u2014Marijuana, like alcohol, dulls the senses. While persons who drink drive, generally they do not drink while driving. It may easily be that marijuana smokers do not generally smoke marijuana while driving even if passengers are smoking marijuana. If that be the case, an inference that a marijuana odor was caused by the driver, rather than some other occupant no longer in the automobile,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> may not be reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">We conclude, because of the multiple inferences involved and the uncertainty of the analogy to tobacco smokers, no other basis having been proffered, that it has not been made to appear that it is reasonable to infer that the driver/sole occupant smoked marijuana solely from a residual odor of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">The people rely, in addition to the multiple inferences, on Olson\u2019s testimony that the odor was \"strong\u201d and \"quite recent\u201d as other evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>Hilber was the person who smoked the marijuana and that there was a supply of unburned marijuana in the automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">Testimony of Olson\u2019s sensory perceptions is clearly admissible. Most often sensory perception testimony relates to visual and auditory perceptions. In contrast with sight and hearing, however, for which persons are tested and provided correctional aids, there is no standard or norm for the sense of smell. Additionally, again in contrast with sight and hearing, the sense of smell adapts to odors with the result that one person\u2019s perception may differ significantly from another\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Most persons recognize the odors of intoxicating liquor, beer and tobacco without special training. Many recognize the odors of burning and unburned marijuana. It is also commonplace to recognize the residual odors of spilled beverages and burned tobacco and perhaps even burned marijuana. It is, however, beyond ordinary experience to be able to determine with reasonable accuracy the length of time a persistent odor has lingered.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">A persistent automobile odor may be strong and appear to be recent although it has lingered for hours, days or even longer. (Where, for example, beer has been spilled or a large number of cigars have been smoked in an automobile there will be a strong odor even though no beer or cigars have been consumed for a considerable time.)</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Evidence of a person\u2019s past use of marijuana would not alone furnish probable cause to stop him on the street and search him for marijuana. Nor would it alone justify issuance of a warrant to search him, his residence or automobile for marijuana. It would, additionally, be necessary to establish when in the past the marijuana was used in relation to the time it is sought to conduct the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>search.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Similarly, it is not reasonable to infer present use of marijuana, or to conduct a search for it, on the basis of past use of marijuana evidenced solely by a residual odor of marijuana in an automobile occupied by the defendant, absent determination with reasonable accuracy of the time frame of use in relation to defendant\u2019s occupancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Since an occupant of an automobile cannot be arrested simply because there is an odor of burned marijuana, and probable cause depends on other circumstances indicating that he is the smoker, the officer\u2019s opinion regarding the length of time the odor has been present should be an informed opinion.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">Olson\u2019s statements that the odor was stronger than a day old, and that it was \"strong\u201d and \"quite recent\u201d, are indefinite and indeterminate of the length of time the odor lingered.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">Officers may rely on their special training or experience, but Olson acknowledged that he had no training, and the record does not indicate that he had any experience, which would enable him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>accurately to determine whether the marijuana was burned within a relevant time frame.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A1A\">Because Olson was without training and, so far as the record shows, without experience regarding residual marijuana odor, the judge had no basis for determining the reliability of his statements that the odor was strong and quite recent. And because of Olson\u2019s indefinite and indeterminate terminology, the judge had no basis for determining the time frame in which the marijuana was burned.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The oificers observed Hilber\u2019s automobile for only a few minutes before stopping it.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">No circumstance, other than the odor, is relied on as supportive of a finding of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">We conclude that the people did not discharge their burden of establishing the reasonableness of Olson\u2019s conclusion that it was Hilber who smoked the marijuana in the automobile.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>VI</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Even if it is reasonable to believe that a marijuana smoker would have in his possession or in his automobile a supply of unsmoked marijuana, since in this case it was not reasonable to conclude that Hilber was the smoker, Olson was not justified in searching the automobile on an assumption that any additional supply a smoker would carry would be found on Hilber or in the automobile.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">While some tobacco smokers leave their supply in an automobile and so may marijuana smokers,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>most tobacco smokers take their supply with them when they leave an automobile. Whatever may be the similarities and disparities in the habits of tobacco and marijuana smokers, it has not been shown that it is reasonable to expect to find unsmoked marijuana in an automobile apart from its occupancy by the marijuana user.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">We conclude that the odor of smoked marijuana does not provide probable cause for a search of an automobile separate and apart from a search of the smoker and of the automobile he is occupying or has just occupied following his reasonable identification as the smoker.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b413-6\">Kavanagh, C.J., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b402-13\"> MCL 335.341(4)(b); MSA 18.1070(41)(4)(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b402-14\"> MCL 335.341(l)(c); MSA 18.1070(41)(l)(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b402-15\"> Hilber was under arrest at the time of the search and could not destroy evidence or move the automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-16\">In <em>Chambers v Maroney, </em>399 US 42, 52; 90 S Ct 1975; 26 L Ed 2d 419 (1970), there had been an armed robbery. The defendants\u2019 automobile was stopped on a radioed description of the robbers. The defendants were arrested and the automobile was driven to the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>station and there searched. The Court declared that while the search could not be justified as an incident of the arrest, the circumstances furnishing probable cause for the arrest also furnished probable cause for a search of the automobile, and that there was probable cause to search the automobile for guns and money. The Court further reasoned that a warrantless search at the police station was justified because the car \"could have been searched on the spot when it was stopped since there was probable cause to search and it was a fleeting target for a search\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">The people contend that this is the \"on the spot\u201d search impliedly approved in <em>Chambers.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">Hilber relies on <em>Coolidge v New Hampshire, </em>403 US 443; 91 S Ct 2022; 29 L Ed 2d 564 (1971), and <em>People v White, </em>392 Mich 404; 221 NW2d 357 (1974). In those cases, however, the defendant was arrested at his residence and not after his automobile had been stopped. He had not been driving his automobile; it had been parked a considerable period of time before the arrest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b404-12\"> See <em>Chambers v Maroney, supra, </em>p 47.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b404-13\"> See, <em>e.g., United States v Barnard, </em>553 F2d 389 (CA 5, 1977); <em>United States v Andrade, </em>545 F2d 1032 (CA 5, 1977); <em>United States v Stricklin, </em>534 F2d 1386 (CA 10, 1976); <em>State v Houlf, </em>27 Ariz App 633; 557 P2d 565 (1976); <em>People v Maier, </em>366 NYS2d 660; 47 App Div 2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>344 (1975); <em>Commonwealth v Stoner, </em>236 Pa Super 161; 344 A2d 633 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b405-10\"> Generally, there were factors in addition to the odor of burned marijuana which, in combination, were held to constitute probable cause.

None of the parties seriously contend that the seizure of the cigarette package containing the four hand-rolled marijuana cigarettes was legal. Therefore, the subsequent search of defendant\u2019s automobile and the seizure of the additional controlled substances was also illegal. The trial judge should have suppressed this evidence as a fruit of the poisonous tree. <em>Wong Sun v United </em>States, 371 US 471; 83 S Ct 407; 9 L Ed 2d 441 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">It is submitted that while the officer\u2019s detection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>of the odor of burned marijuana may have prompted his original inquiry and led to the defendant\u2019s admission and arrest, it is rather farfetched to assert that the odor <em>alone </em>prompted the subsequent search of the automobile. Clearly, one cannot ignore the fact the initial illegal seizure and arrest played a significant role in the officer\u2019s subsequent decision to search the automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">I would affirm the Court of Appeals for this reason.</p>\n<judges id=\"b414-6\">Fitzgerald, J., concurred with Blair Moody, Jr., J.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b414-7\">Williams, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXo\"><em>(dissenting). </em>Defendant, Jeffrey Lee Hilber, was convicted of possession of amphetamines<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and possession of marijuana with intent to deliver,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in part as a consequence of seizure of these substances from his automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">The people appeal from the Court of Appeals reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction based on that Court\u2019s view that the trial court erroneously failed to suppress the seized evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">We reverse as to the suppression of evidence issue and remand to the Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b414-11\">On April 19, 1975, defendant Hilber was stopped by two state troopers for speeding. Trooper Olson approached the vehicle, advised defendant that he had been speeding and requested his driver\u2019s license and registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>Trooper Olson testified at trial that \"[a]s I was talking to the subject I got a distinct odor of what appeared to me as marijuana\u201d. The other trooper, Officer Lahde, testified that as he approached the driver\u2019s side of the vehicle, defendant was standing outside the car and Trooper Olson asked him if he could smell anything and \"[a]t that time I leaned forward toward the vehicle and I smelt <em>[sic] </em>the strong odor of marijuana coming from the interior of the vehicle, apparent marijuana\u201d. Both officers had been trained and experienced in visual and olfactory detection of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">Defendant Hilber was told by Officer Olson \"that * * * there was a strong odor of marijuana in the car\u201d and then the officer \"asked him if he * * * had any more marijuana in the car\u201d. At that point defendant reached onto the dashboard of the car and produced a cigarette package which contained four rolled marijuana cigarettes.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Defendant Hilber was turned over to Officer Lahde who took him to the patrol car and arrested him while Officer Olson proceeded to search the vehicle. The search uncovered more marijuana cigarettes, a large number of pills which were later found to be amphetamines, a marijuana (roach) pipe and a brown paper bag containing over five pounds of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The trial court found the original cigarette package inadmissible because it was the product of improper questioning of defendant without advice of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, but found the other evidence admissible because the strong odor of marijuana justified probable cause for a search of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">The Court of Appeals agreed that the cigarette package was inadmissible but reversed as to the failure to suppress the other evidence. <em>People v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number><em>Hilber, </em>69 Mich App 664; 245 NW2d 156 (1976). Application for rehearing was denied by the Court of Appeals on August 5, 1976, and delayed application for leave to apeal was granted by this Court March 24, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">II. Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">We granted leave to consider whether the evidence discovered in the car was admissible as a result of a proper search.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">We find that the evidence was admissible and therefore reverse the Court of Appeals, reinstate defendant\u2019s conviction and remand to the Court of Appeals for consideration of other issues raised in but not addressed by that Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">III. Search of the Automobile</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">All persons in Michigan are protected against unreasonable search and seizure by both the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the Constitution of the State of Michigan.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because of the exclusionary rule developed to enforce this right, evidence obtained as a result of an unlawful search and seizure is inadmissible as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>evidence against an accused whose rights were violated. <em>Wong Sun v United States, </em>371 US 471; 83 S Ct 407; 9 L Ed 2d 441 (1963); <em>Alderman v United States, </em>394 US 165; 89 S Ct 961; 22 L Ed 2d 176 (1969). Further, the basic constitutional rule, subject to certain exceptions, is that searches conducted without authority of a warrant are presumptively unreasonable. <em>Coolidge v New Hampshire, </em>403 US 443, 454-455; 91 S Ct 2022; 29 L Ed 2d 564 (1971); <em>People v Whalen, </em>390 Mich 672, 677; 213 NW2d 116 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">Under the facts of this case, it is one of these exceptions, specifically the automobile exception, which precludes the presumption of unreasonableness normally attendant upon warrantless searches and which supplies the applicable standards:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-5\">\"1. Reasonableness is the test that is to be applied for both the stop of, and the search of moving motor vehicles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-6\">\"2. Said reasonableness will be determined from the facts and circumstances of each case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-7\">\"3. <em>Fewer foundation facts are necessary to support a finding of reasonableness when moving vehicles are involved, </em>than if a house or a home were involved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-8\">\"4. <em>A stop of a motor vehicle for investigatory purposes may be based upon fewer facts than those necessary to support a \u00f1nding of reasonableness where both a stop and a search is conducted by the police.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>People v Whalen, supra, </em>682, cited as authority in <em>People v Lillis, </em>64 Mich App 64, 68; 235 NW2d 65 (1975).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">The evidentiary quality of odor was brought out in <em>Johnson v United States, </em>333 US 10; 68 S Ct 367; 92 L Ed 436 (1948), in which a defendant appealed her conviction of violation of a Federal narcotics law. Based on information supplied by an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>informant, police went to defendant\u2019s hotel room, independently verified that the odor of burning opium was emanating therefrom, and knocked on the door. Upon being admitted, the police announced to defendant, the sole occupant of the room, that she should consider herself under arrest and proceeded to search the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">The Court found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-6\">\"At the time entry was demanded the officers were possessed of evidence which a magistrate might have found to be probable cause for issuing a search warrant. We cannot sustain defendant\u2019s contention, erroneously made, * * * that odors cannot be evidence sufficient to constitute probable grounds for any search. * * * If the presence of odors is testified to before a magistrate and he finds the affiant qualified to know the odor, and it is one sufficiently distinctive to identify a forbidden substance, this Court has never held such a basis insufficient to justify issuance of a search warrant. Indeed it might very well be found to be evidence of most persuasive character.\u201d <em>Johnson, supra, </em>13.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">That Court held that under the facts of <em>Johnson, </em>the requirement of a warrant prior to search could not be dispensed with because inconvenience and slight delay were the only countervailing considerations and no exigent circumstances were present.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-8\">\"No suspect was fleeing or likely to take flight. <em>The search was of permanent premises, not of a movable vehicle. </em>No evidence or contraband was threatened with removal or destruction, except perhaps the fumes which we suppose in time would disappear. But they were not capable at any time of being reduced to possession for presentation to court. The evidence of their existence before the search was adequate and the testimony of the officers to that effect would not perish from the delay of getting a warrant.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Johnson, supra, </em>15.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>Therefore, the United States Supreme Court both acknowledged that odor can be sufficient probable cause for the issuance of a search warrant,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a more difficult standard to meet than the standard of reasonableness required in automobile cases generally, and further acknowledged that such odor in a movable vehicle could obviate the necessity of a warrant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">We need only decide, therefore, under the standards of reasonableness applicable to searches of automobiles, <em>Whalen, supra, </em>whether the odor emanating from defendant Hilber\u2019s car created a sufficient basis for the officers to believe that marijuana might be present,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and therefore permit search of the vehicle.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Defendant asserts that in so determining, this Court should distinguish among the odors of unburned, burning and burned marijuana and, although the first two odors may be sufficient to establish reasonable cause for search, the third does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>We find no basis in this case for drawing such a distinction. Certainly there are cases in which courts have used these terms as descriptive of the odor involved: the odor of \"unburned\u201d marijuana, see, <em>e.g., People v Cook, </em>13 Cal 3d 663; 119 Cal Rptr 500; 532 P2d 148 (1975); <em>People v Wolf, </em>15 Ill App 3d 374; 304 NE2d 512 (1973); <em>State v Zamora, </em>114 Ariz 75; 559 P2d 195 (Ct App, 1976) (very faint odor of marijuana sufficient probable cause for search even though the other officer present was unable to verify the existence of that odor); the odor of \"burning\u201d marijuana, <em>People v Parisi, </em>46 Mich App 322; 208 NW2d 70 (1973), reversed on grounds not relevant to the issue considered herein, 393 Mich 31; 222 NW2d 757 (1974); <em>People v Christensen, </em>2 Cal App 3d 546; 83 Cal Rptr 17 (1969), and the odor of \"burned\u201d marijuana, <em>Hicks v State, </em>534 SW2d 872 (Tenn Crim App, 1976); <em>State v Kern, </em>295 Minn 580; 205 NW2d 509 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">We find these terms, however, not to be determinative or necessitate differing results for two reasons. First, because in many of the above cases as well as others cited <em>infra, </em>the type of odor perceived and giving rise to cause for search can only be guessed at by a reading of the facts to discover the type of marijuana which was subsequently found during the search. In other words, the language employed by courts generally makes no distinction as to the classification of marijuana odor involved. See, <em>e.g., State v Hughes, </em>544 SW2d 99 (Tenn, 1976); <em>People v Wolf, </em>15 Ill App 3d 374; 304 NE2d 512 (1973); <em>Ford v State, </em>37 Md App 373; 377 A2d 577 (Ct Spec App, 1977); <em>State v Binns, </em>194 NW2d 756 (ND, 1972); <em>State v Compton, </em>13 Wash App 863; 538 P2d 861 (1975); <em>State v Benson, </em>198 Neb 14; 251 NW2d 659 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Second, we are not in a position to take judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>notice of the lengths of time the differing odors linger; we are in no position to know that a \"burning\u201d odor may remain for a certain number of minutes or hours at which point it becomes a \"burned\u201d odor. Although defendant claims that the odor of burned marijuana may linger and, therefore, there is no cause to believe the substance was still present, there is the same possibility that the odor of \"unburned\u201d or \"burning\u201d marijuana may linger in a small area such as an automobile for a period of time<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> beyond the actual presence of the substance. This creates a factual as opposed to legal conflict and that conflict was resolved by the finding of the trial court that the search was supported by reasonable cause. We do not find that conclusion contrary to the evidence before this Court and agree that the strong odor of marijuana, detected by an officer trained in olfactory detection of marijuana, provides reasonable cause to believe that marijuana was present in the automobile and that the search was justified.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">Beyond strong legal precedent for the finding of the trial court that there was reasonable cause to search<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> we feel that finding is supported by com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>mon sense. It is not necessary to have proof beyond a reasonable doubt to satisfy the exceptions to constitutional prohibitions against unreasonable search and seizure. Because of the exigencies of this case, it is not even necessary that there be probable cause sufficient to obtain a search warrant. All that is required is a reasonable belief. If courts are to bind police activity by the limits of reason, so must they allow the police to function freely within those limits, rather than requiring unrealistic exercises in caution in the performance of their duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The officers in the instant case detected a strong odor of marijuana, reasonably believed that the marijuana was present and, as ultimately demonstrated, their belief was well founded. They relied on their training and experience, and under these circumstances, violated no constitutional right in the search of the automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">Because the odor of marijuana provided the police officers with reasonable cause to believe that marijuana was present in violation of the laws of this state, we reinstate the conviction of defendant and remand to the Court of Appeals for consideration of issues not considered on prior hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b422-9\">Coleman and Ryan, JJ., concurred with Williams, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b414-12\"> MCL 335.341(4)(b); MSA 18.1070(41)(4)(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b414-13\"> MCL 335.341(l)(c); MSA 18.1070(41)(l)(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b414-14\"> Defendant raised six issues on appeal to the Court of Appeals.
