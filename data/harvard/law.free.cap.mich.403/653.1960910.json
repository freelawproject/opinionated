The conviction largely rested upon the testimony of two witnesses whose identities were discovered through statements illegally elicited from the defendant. We granted appeal limited to the issue of whether the Court of Appeals erred in concluding that the testimonial fruits of the illegally obtained statements should have been excluded at trial. Finding error, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">At approximately noon on July 31, 1974, John Kusowski was arrested by Saginaw County authorities for the murder of August Tvardos. On that day, the defendant was questioned twice by the police, once before and once after his arrest. The first interrogation session, which took place in the police patrol car parked in the defendant\u2019s driveway, resulted in his arrest. The second interrogation was conducted at the police station approximately three hours after the arrest. During both interrogations, defendant told the police that he had visited his friends, Richard Ban and Robert Sovine, at the Fordney Hotel after he hit the victim over the head with a shotgun on the night of July 28, 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">It was admitted at trial by Detective Sergeant Daniel Huff, one of the arresting officers, that at the time he interrogated the defendant in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>patrol car he did not know of the identity of either Ban or Sovine. Therefore, at least initially, knowledge of the identities of these witnesses was obtained solely through the statements elicited from the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">Neither Ban nor Sovine initiated contact with the police concerning their July 28, 1974, visit with the defendant. Richard Ban was approached by Officer Huff on July 31, 1974, the day defendant was arrested, and the police contacted Robert Sovine on August 8, 1974. Ban therefore did not divulge what he knew about the death of August Tvardos until 3 days after the defendant is said to have fatally injured him, and it was approximately 11 days before Sovine gave the police the information he had.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">On March 3, 1975, after receiving testimony concerning the circumstances under which the defendant was interrogated, the trial court excluded defendant\u2019s statements from use as evidence at trial. The reason assigned was that the prosecution had failed to carry the burden of showing that the defendant had waived his rights to silence and to appointed counsel before being questioned. On the first day of trial, the court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to exclude the testimony of Ban and Sovine.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">Both Ban and Sovine testified against the defendant and stated that Kusowski had come to their hotel room on July 28, 1974, blurting out that he thought he had killed Tvardos. Each witness testified that Kusowski had blood on his clothing and appeared to be extremely agitated.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">On appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the testimony of Ban and Sovine.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">Even though the trial court based the suppression order in part on the failure to show waiver of the right to appointed counsel, the defendant does not specifically argue that his Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated. In any event, we are convinced that the United States Supreme Court would not find such an argument persuasive. See <em>Michigan v Tucker, </em>417 US 433, 438; 94 S Ct 2357; 41 L Ed 2d 182 (1974); <em>Frazier v Cupp, </em>394 US 731, 739; 89 S Ct 1420; 22 L Ed 2d 684 (1969).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Neither are we presented with a violation of Kusowski\u2019s Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. It is uncontroverted that prior to each interrogation session the defendant was fully advised of his privilege and reminded that anything he said could be used against him. The defendant does not allege that he was threatened or forced into speaking at either interrogation. The interrogating officer testified that no such coercive tactics were employed. The first interrogation lasted from 10 to 13 minutes. There thus was \"no compulsion sufficient to breach the right against compulsory self-incrimination\u201d. <em>Tucker, supra, </em>445.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">Although we are convinced that no error of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>constitutional dimension was committed by the police in this case, the trial court did hold that the prosecutor failed to demonstrate that the defendant had waived his right against self-incrimination and his right to appointed counsel. Hence, the trial court found a violation of the requirement of <em>Miranda v Arizona, </em>384 US 436, 444; 86 S Ct 1602; 16 L Ed 2d 694 (1966), that a defendant must \"voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently\u201d waive his rights before being questioned. Finding such violation, the trial court suppressed the defendant\u2019s statements as required under <em>Johnson v New Jersey, </em>384 US 719; 86 S Ct 1772; 16 L Ed 2d 882 (1966). Whether these trial court determinations were proper is not before us because there was no application for review. The only issue properly appealed is whether the Court of Appeals erred in deciding that the testimony of Ban and Sovine was inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">In <em>Tucker, supra, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that third-party testimonial evidence derived from a <em>Miranda </em>violation is not to be excluded where the interrogation occurred before the decision in <em>Miranda. </em>The Court has not decided whether the same result obtains in a case such as this, where the questioning occurred after the <em>Miranda </em>decision. Our reading of <em>Tucker </em>convinces us that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">Prior to <em>Tucker </em>the Court appeared to equate a <em>Miranda </em>violation with an infringement of a constitutional right.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But <em>Tucker </em>makes it clear that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>majority of the Court does not now consider a violation of <em>Miranda </em>as necessarily involving a violation of the Constitution. Thus, <em>Wong Sun v United States, </em>371 US 471; 83 S Ct 407; 9 L Ed 2d 441 (1963), which held \"that the 'fruits\u2019 of police conduct which actually infringed a defendant\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights must be suppressed\u201d, is not controlling precedent where a <em>Miranda </em>violation is involved. <em>Tucker, supra, </em>445-446.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\"><em>Tucker </em>therefore indicates that the applicability of the exclusionary rule under circumstances involving testimony obtained as a result of a <em>Miranda </em>violation is not a foregone conclusion, but would in essence involve an extension of the suppression rule. In recent cases the Supreme Court has refused to extend application of the exclusionary rule beyond those circumstances in which it already operates.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">For example, in <em>United States v Janis, </em>428 US 433; 96 S Ct 3021; 49 L Ed 2d 1046 (1976), the Court considered whether the exclusionary rule operates in a Federal civil action to prevent the use of evidence seized by state authorities pursuant to an invalid search warrant. After balancing the interests involved, the Court held that suppression of the evidence in a civil proceeding was not justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">Furthermore, the Court in <em>United States v Ceccolini, </em>435 US 268; 98 S Ct 1054; 55 L Ed 2d 268 (1978), recently stated the <em>Tucker </em>holding in broad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>terms, not limiting it to interrogations occurring prior to <em>Miranda. </em>Writing for the majority, Justice Rehnquist said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-5\">\"[T]he Court has also held admissible at trial testimony of a witness whose identity was disclosed by the defendant\u2019s statement given after inadequate <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>Michigan v Tucker, </em>417 US 433, 450-451 (1974).\u201d <em>Ceccolini, supra, 278.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">This statement of the <em>Tucker </em>holding prompted no response from the dissenting members of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">We have found no case decided since <em>Tucker, </em>and none is pointed out, holding that third-party testimony discovered as a result of a <em>Miranda </em>violation is to be suppressed. Those courts which have addressed the question have concluded that the interest in preventing future police conduct which violates <em>Miranda </em>does not justify depriving the government of use of the evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">The Court of Appeals erred in deciding that the testimony of Ban and Sovine should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-9\">Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b746-10\">Levin, Coleman, Fitzgerald, and Ryan, JJ., concurred with Kavanagh, C.J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b746-11\">Williams, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9n\">This case concerns the \"inevitable discovery\u201d exception to the \"fruit-of-the-poisonous-tree\u201d exclusionary rule. At issue is the admissibility of the testimony of witnesses whose identity was discovered through statements made by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>The defendant\u2019s actual statements were suppressed by the trial court for failure to show a valid waiver. The testimony of the so-discovered witnesses was allowed over objection by defense counsel that the fruit-of-the-poisonous-tree exclusionary rule should be applied to any evidence derived from the defendant\u2019s suppressed statements. The Court of Appeals found the fruit-of-the-poisonous-tree doctrine applicable to the testimony of the witnesses, reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">We find that the instant case falls into the \"inevitable discovery\u201d exception to the exclusionary rule.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We reverse the Court of Appeals. Defendant\u2019s conviction is reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">On July 31, 1974, the body of August Tvardos was discovered in his house. While investigating the homicide the police were informed by a relative of the deceased that John Kusowski, the defendant, had some contact with the deceased concerning money. The same day the police went to defendant\u2019s home and escorted him to the squad car for questioning. At this time defendant admitted that he (1) knew Tvardos, (2) had been in his home and (3) had struck Tvardos over the head with a shotgun. Defendant also mentioned Robert Sovine and Richard Ban, friends he had visited after leaving Tvardos\u2019 home. Defendant was then arrested and taken to the police station for a formal statement. Part of the formal statement included the fact that defendant had talked with two friends, Richard Ban and Robert Sovine, at the Fordney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>Hotel after leaving the Tvardos home. The police questioned both men and their statements implicated defendant in the homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">March 3, 1975, prior to trial, defense counsel moved to suppress any and all incriminatory statements made by defendant. An evidentiary hearing was held and the trial judge granted defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the statements because the prosecution had not sustained its burden of proof that there had been a knowing and intelligent waiver of the privilege against self-incrimination, a <em>Miranda v </em>Arizona, 384 US 436; 86 S Ct 1602; 16 L Ed 2d 694 (1966), violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">On the day of trial, March 20, 1975, defendant moved to suppress all evidence procured through the use of the incriminating statements previously suppressed, including the testimony of Ban and Sovine. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">At trial Ban and Sovine testified for the prosecution. Their testimony implicated defendant in the homicide. The defendant was convicted of second-degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">In a separate record, made out of the presence of the jury, the investigating officer admitted that the only lead he had had to Sovine or Ban came from the statements made by the defendant. However, during the trial there was testimony that linked the defendant to Sovine, Ban and the Fordney Hotel. The defendant\u2019s father, when asked by defense counsel with whom his son associated, responded \"[w]ith Sovine at the county home\u201d. Defendant, Sovine and Ban had been residents of the county home. When questioned about the night of the homicide, defendant\u2019s father stated that his son told him he had spent the night \"at the hotel\u201d. Later, defendant\u2019s father identified the hotel as the \"Fordney Hotel\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for a new trial ruling that the testimony of Ban and Sovine was inadmissible under the fruit-of-the-poisonous-tree doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">We granted leave to determine the admissibility of the testimony of Ban and Sovine.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">In this case we are concerned with a possible violation of the Fifth Amendment right against compulsory self-incrimination. A violation of this constitutional right would require the application of the exclusionary rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">In the instant case it is not the inadmissible statements made by the defendant that are at issue, but the information derived from those statements, the identity of the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-9\">The United States Supreme Court has yet to directly address the question of an \"inevitable discovery\u201d exception to the exclusionary rule although it has in dicta recognized the existence of that doctrine.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Consequently, we must interpret <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>the doctrine in light of pronouncements on the protection of constitutional rights, in particular, the Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">In <em>Michigan v Tucker, </em>417 US 433; 94 S Ct 2357; 41 L Ed 2d 182 (1974), the United States Supreme Court analyzed the Fifth Amendment right against compulsory self-incrimination in light of the requirements of <em>Miranda </em>and decided the question was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-7\">\"whether the police conduct complained of directly infringed upon respondent\u2019s right against compulsory self-incrimination or whether it instead violated only the prophylactic rules developed to protect that right <em>[Miranda </em>warnings].\u201d 417 US 433, 439.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">The Court was faced with a unique factual situation. The defendant\u2019s arrest and interrogation was <em>pre-Miranda, </em>but his trial <em>post-Miranda. </em>At the time of the interrogation the police were in full compliance with the rules governing interrogations as established by <em>Escobedo v Illinois, </em>378 US 478; 84 S Ct 1758; 12 L Ed 2d 977 (1964). But, because not required by <em>Escobedo, </em>they did not advise defendant of his right to free counsel, a requirement later established by <em>Miranda. </em>Defendant\u2019s statements were therefore suppressed because he had not been accorded his <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">The United States Supreme Court, however, found the testimony of a witness, whose identity was learned through the suppressed statements, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>admissible. The Court found that the sanction, complete exclusion of all derivative evidence, would serve no useful purpose in this unique situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">The Court limited its decision to the particular factual situation it was presented.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-6\">\"We consider it significant to our decision in this case that the officers\u2019 failure to advise respondent of his right to appointed counsel occurred prior to the decision in <em>Miranda. </em>Although we have been urged to resolve the broad question of whether evidence derived from statements taken in violation of the <em>Miranda </em>rules must be excluded regardless of when the interrogation took place, we instead place our holding on a narrower ground. For at the time respondent was questioned these police officers were guided, quite rightly, by the principles established in <em>Escobedo v Illinois, </em>378 US 478 (1964), particularly focusing on the suspect\u2019s opportunity to have retained counsel with him during the interrogation if he chose to do so.\u201d 417 US 433, 447.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">The United States Supreme Court concluded that the \"case involved no compulsion sufficient to breach the right against compulsory self-incrimination ** * *\u201d.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Court found \"that the police conduct * * * departed only from the prophylactic standards later laid down by this Court in <em>Miranda </em>to safeguard that privilege\u201d.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Using that distinction as one of their bases, the United States Supreme Court, under these circumstances, found admissible the fruit-of-the-poisonous-tree testimony of a witness whose identity was learned through statements taken from the defendant without full compliance with the requirements of <em>Miranda.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">In <em>Brown v Illinois, </em>422 US 590; 95 S Ct 2254; 45 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>L Ed 2d 416 (1975),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The United States Supreme Court analyzed the exclusionary rule stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-4\">\" 'The rule is calculated to prevent, not to repair. Its purpose is to deter \u2014 to compel respect for the constitutional guaranty in the only effectively available way\u2014 by removing the incentive to disregard it.\u2019 <em>Elkins v United States, </em>364 US 206, 217 [80 S Ct 1437; 4 L Ed 2d 1669] (1960). But [d]espite its broad deterrent purpose, the exclusionary rule has never been interpreted to proscribe the use of illegally seized evidence in all proceedings or against all persons.\u2019 <em>United States v Calandra, </em>414 US [338], at 348 [94 S Ct 613; 38 L Ed 2d 561 (1974)]. See also <em>Michigan v Tucker, </em>417 US 433, 446-447 (1974).\u201d 422 US 590, 599-600.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Thus, the Court recognized valid exceptions to the exclusionary rule as it has been applied to both Fourth and Fifth Amendment violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">In unraveling the lower court\u2019s decision in <em>Brown, </em>the United States Supreme Court reviewed the Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination in relation to the <em>Miranda </em>warning and found:</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">\"This Court has described the <em>Miranda </em>warnings as a 'prophylactic rule,\u2019 <em>Michigan v Payne, </em>412 US 47, 53 [93 S Ct 1966; 36 L Ed 2d 736] (1973), and as a 'procedural safeguard,\u2019 <em>Miranda v Arizona, </em>384 US at 457, 478, employed to protect Fifth Amendment rights against 'the compulsion inherent in custodial surroundings.\u2019 <em>Id., </em>at 458. The function of the warnings relates to the Fifth Amendment\u2019s guarantee against coerced self-incrimination, and the exclusion of a statement made in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>absence of the warnings, it is said, serves to deter the taking of an incriminating statement without first informing the individual of his Fifth Amendment rights.\u201d 422 US 590, 600-601.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The <em>Brown </em>Court thus acknowledged the <em>Tucker </em>Court\u2019s concern with the \"genuine compulsion of testimony\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the role of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Both <em>Tucker </em>and <em>Brown </em>would require exclusion of a statement taken without the benefit of <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Therefore, any exception to the exclusionary rule, with reference to the Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination, would only occur at some point past the primary illegality, the illegally obtained statements. Any exception we find could only apply to the fruit of the poisonous tree, the derivative evidence. Yet, because of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s concern with coerced self-incrimination, we find there would be no exception to the exclusionary rule, even for the \"fruit\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>there has been a \"genuine compulsion of testimony\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> as contrasted with a mere violation of a prophylactic rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">If the \"inevitable discovery\u201d exception to the exclusionary rule has any place, in relation to the right against compelled self-incrimination, it can only be in instances where there was no conduct by the police abridging the right against compulsory self-incrimination as discussed in <em>Tucker. </em>Once such conduct is not found, a full review of the situation in light of the rationale of the \"inevitable discovery\u201d exception would be possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">In recent years a growing number of jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>tions, both federal and state, have recognized the validity of the \"inevitable discovery\u201d exception to the fruit-of-the-poisonous-tree exclusionary rule.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-5\">\"The so-called 'inevitable discovery\u2019 rule, a relatively recent refinement in American criminal law, is an evolving exception to the Constitutional exclusionary rules, in force in both federal and state jurisdictions, which prohibit the use in court of evidence procured by law enforcement officers in violation of the constitutionally protected rights of the accused.\u201d 40 Albany L Rev 483.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">The doctrine is limited to situations involving the \"fruit\u201d as opposed to the poisonous tree; it is only the derivative evidence that has in some instances been admitted under this exception.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The \"poisonous tree\u201d, the primary evidence seized in violation of a constitutional right or safeguard, has still been excluded by use of the exclusionary rule. The inevitable discovery exception has been applied in cases involving the Fourth Amendment right against \"unreasonable searches and seizures\u201d and the Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">The \"inevitable discovery\u201d doctrine has evolved from an analysis of similar exceptions to the exclusionary rule reviewed in <em>Wong Sun v United States, </em>371 US 471; 83 S Ct 407; 9 L Ed 2d 441 (1963):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>\"Hence this is not the case envisioned by this Court where the exclusionary rule has no application because the Government learned of the evidence 'from an independent source,' <em>Silverthorne Lumber Co v United States, </em>251 US 385, 392 [40 S Ct 182; 64 L Ed 319 (1920)]; nor is this a case in which the connection between the lawless conduct of the police and the discovery of the challenged evidence has 'become so attenuated as to dissipate the taint.\u2019 <em>Nardone v United States, </em>308 US 338, 341 [60 S Ct 266; 84 L Ed 307 (1939)]. We need not hold that all evidence is 'fruit of the poisonous tree\u2019 simply because it would not have come to light but for the illegal actions of the police. Rather, the more apt question in such a case is 'whether, granting establishment of the primary illegality, the evidence to which instant objection is made has been come at by exploitation of that illegality or instead by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint.\u2019 Maguire, Evidence of Guilt, 221 (1959).\u201d 371 US 471, 487-488.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">In <em>Wayne v United States, </em>115 US App DC 234; 318 F2d 205 (1963), a case involving an illegal search, Chief Justice Burger, then a circuit judge, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-7\">\"The contention is that the entry of the police into his apartment, which had been found by a District Judge on a pre-trial motion to have been illegal, and the seizure of the body immediately following such illegal entry, precluded the introduction of the coroner\u2019s testimony about the condition of the body and the cause of death.

[Citations omitted.] In other words, as one commentator put it, the inevitable discovery factor 'permits the government to remove the taint from otherwise poisoned fruit by establishing that the unlawful act from which it resulted was not a <em>sine qua non </em>of its discovery.\u2019\u201d 32 NY2d 499, 506-507.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">In <em>Government of Virgin Islands v Gereau, </em>502 F2d 914 (CA 3, 1974), one of the questions presented was whether evidence found as a result of an illegal statement, <em>Miranda </em>violation, obtained from the defendant was admissible. After reviewing the facts, the court found that the district judge was not in error in admitting the evidence because the government had shown that \"the police and F.B.I. agents would have found the luger <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>without utilization of Smith\u2019s [defendant\u2019s] statement\u201d. 502 F2d 914, 928.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">It appears that a number of jurisdictions<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> considering the issue have adopted the \"inevitable discovery\u201d rule as a valid exception to the exclusionary rule, fruit-of-the-poisonous-tree doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">The application of the \"inevitable discovery\u201d exception to the exclusionary rule therefore requires, as it applies to the Fifth Amendment right against compulsory self-incrimination, a two-prong test. First, has there been police conduct sufficient to abridge the constitutional privilege, a \"genuine compulsion of testimony\u201d, or just a breach of the prophylactic standards that safeguard the privilege. Second, \"would the police have discovered the tainted evidence through the utilization of legal and predictably performed investigatory procedures, and without resort to illegal methods\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">First, the trial court made no finding of force or violence. The court found the prosecution had not sustained its burden of proving a knowing and intelligent waiver of the privilege against self-incrimination and the right to court-appointed counsel. This refers to the prophylactic rule rather than the constitutional guarantee.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">Second, although the police admitted that their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>only lead to the witnesses came through defendant\u2019s statements, a review of the record presents a situation from which it would be inevitable that the police through \"legal and predictably performed investigatory procedures\u201d would have found the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">The witnesses were known friends of the defendant. They had lived together at the county home. Defendant\u2019s father testified that defendant was known to hang around with the witnesses. This information alone would seem sufficient to lead to the witnesses being questioned by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Defendant\u2019s father also testified that his son told him he spent the night in question at a hotel. The hotel was later identified as the Fordney Hotel. This was the residence of the witnesses. Again, this information alone would have led the police to the Fordney Hotel and then to the witnesses in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">We find there was no violation of the defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination, only a violation of \"the prophylactic rules developed to protect that right\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">We find also that there was sufficient information available to the police that the discovery of the witnesses was inevitable. We therefore conclude that the testimony of the witnesses Ban and Sovine was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-10\">The decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed and defendant\u2019s conviction reinstated.</p>\n<judges id=\"b759-12\">J.
