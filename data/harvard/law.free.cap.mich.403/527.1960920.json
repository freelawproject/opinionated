The defendant then appealed and the Court of Appeals remanded to the trial court because of a possible constitutional error in the imposition of sentence. <em>People v Jones, </em>47 Mich App 160; 209 NW2d 322 (1973). The original sentencing judge granted a defense motion to strike improper material from the presentence report, disqualified himself from resentencing and the case was assigned to another judge of the same court. The judge to whom the case was assigned granted another defense motion to strike improper material, also disqualified himself and the case was assigned to a third judge of the same court. The third judge assigned to the case knew its procedural history but did not know the length of the original sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He sentenced the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>ant on the basis of the expurgated presentence report to a substantially longer term in prison, 20 to 40 years. Defense counsel then brought to the judge\u2019s attention the trial judge\u2019s shorter sentence and argued that the sentence could not be increased unless some subsequent conduct warranted such action. The resentencing judge was not persuaded nor did he point to any such subsequent conduct. The defendant appealed and the Court of Appeals affirmed. 68 Mich App 660; <em>244 </em>NW2d 61 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Three questions have been presented to this Court. Finding one issue dispositive of the case, we will confine our opinion to the following question: Do the prohibitions of <em>North Carolina v Pearce, </em>395 US 711; 89 S Ct 2072; 23 L Ed 2d 656 (1969), apply to the facts of this case?</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">We hold in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">First, it is undisputed that the judge who imposed the 20 to 40 years sentence did not know the length of the original trial judge\u2019s sentence, although he did know that he was resentencing after remand by the Court of Appeals, several successful defense motions to strike and several disqualifications of his brethren on the bench. We impute to the experienced and well-respected judge no \"vindictiveness\u201d or intention to retaliate for a successful appeal. We make no judgment as to which was the more appropriate sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">The Court of Appeals found that because resen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>fencing was by a judge other than the one who first sentenced defendant, although from the same bench, and because he did not know the length of the first sentence and there was no indication of retaliatory motives, the <em>Pearce </em>limitations did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">In <em>North Carolina v Pearce, </em>the United States Supreme Court was faced with the question of whether the Federal Constitution imposed any limitations upon the general power of a judge to impose, upon reconviction, a longer prison sentence than the defendant received after his first trial for the same crime. The Court answered this question, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-7\">\"Due process of law, then, requires that vindictiveness against a defendant for having successfully attacked his first conviction must play no part in the sentence he receives after a new trial. And since the fear of vindictiveness may unconstitutionally deter a defendant\u2019s exercise of the right to appeal or to collaterally attack his first conviction, due process also requires that a defendant be freed of apprehension of such a retaliatory motivation on the part of the sentencing judge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">The Court then formulated the following rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-9\">\"[WJhenever a judge imposes a more severe sentence upon a defendant after a new trial, the reasons for his doing so must affirmatively appear. Those reasons must be based upon objective information concerning identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after the time of the original sentencing proceeding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-10\">The prosecutor argues that <em>Moon v Maryland, </em>398 US 319; 90 S Ct 1730; 26 L Ed 2d 262 (1970), narrows the application of <em>Pearce. </em>We do not agree. In that case, the Court dismissed a writ of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>certiorari that had previously been granted to consider the question of whether <em>North Carolina v Pearce, supra, </em>would be applied retroactively. In a brief per curiam opinion, the Court gave two reasons for dismissal. The first was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-6\">\"The facts that have emerged since the grant of certiorari impel us to dismiss the writ as improvidently granted. As an appendix to its brief, the respondent has filed an affidavit of the judge who presided at the second trial, setting out in detail the reasons he imposed the [longer] sentence. Those reasons clearly include 'objective information concerning identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after the time of the original sentencing proceeding.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">The per curiam then noted a \"dispositive development\u201d \u2014 petitioner was not claiming violation of the due process standard of <em>Pearce. </em>The Court does not decide what is not before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">The Court of Appeals, however, did not rely in any part upon <em>Moon. </em>Instead, it relied most heavily upon <em>Colten v Kentucky, </em>407 US 104; 92 S Ct 1953; 32 L Ed 2d 584 (1972), in which the Court was faced with the question of whether <em>Pearce\u2019s </em>prophylactic rule was applicable to Kentucky\u2019s two-tiered system for adjudicating certain crimes. Under that system, a defendant charged with a misdemeanor could first elect to be tried in an inferior court and, if dissatisfied with the outcome, then could elect to have a trial <em>de novo </em>in a court of general jurisdiction. Defendant Colten had elected to have a trial <em>de novo </em>and, after being convicted again, received a more severe penalty than he had received after his conviction in the inferior court. The Court first explained the holding of <em>Pearce:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-9\">\"Positing that a more severe penalty after reconvic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>tion would violate due process of law if imposed as purposeful punishment for having successfully appealed, the Court concluded that such untoward sentences occurred with sufficient frequency to warrant the imposition of a prophylactic rule to ensure 'that vindictiveness against a defendant for having successfully attacked his first conviction * * * [would] play no part in the sentence he receives after a new trial * * *\u2019 and to ensure that the apprehension of such vindictiveness does not 'deter a defendant\u2019s exercise of the right to appeal or collaterally attack his first conviction * * *.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">The Court then went on to hold that <em>Pearce\u2019s </em>rule was not applicable to Colten\u2019s situation, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-7\">\"Our view of the Kentucky two-tier system * * * does not lead us to believe * * * that the hazard of being penalized for seeking a new trial, which underlay the holding of <em>Pearce, </em>also inheres in the <em>de novo </em>trial arrangement. Nor are we convinced that defendants convicted in Kentucky\u2019s inferior courts would be deterred from seeking a second trial out of fear of judicial vindictiveness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">The Court considered several factors in distinguishing <em>Colten </em>from <em>Pearce:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-9\">\"We note first the obvious: that the court which conducted Colten\u2019s trial and imposed the final sentence was not the court with whose work Colten was sufficiently dissatisfied to seek a different result on appeal; and it is not the court that is asked to do over what it thought it had already done correctly. Nor is the <em>de novo </em>court even asked to find error in another court\u2019s work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-10\">\"The trial <em>de novo </em>represents a completely fresh determination of guilt or innocence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-11\">The facts in the case at bar are essentially the opposite from the <em>Colten </em>facts. Here, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>which resentenced the defendant was the same court which had originally sentenced him. It was also the court which the defendant claimed had sentenced him improperly the first time around. It was doing over again that which was initially thought to be correct. The situation did not amount to a \"fresh\u201d start by a completely different court as in <em>Colten.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">In <em>People v Payne, </em>386 Mich 84; 191 NW2d 375 (1971), this Court applied <em>Pearce </em>retroactively to a case in which the defendant had pled guilty and was sentenced before one judge, appealed and won the right to a new trial and, after reconviction, was sentenced to a longer term in prison by a different judge of the same court who knew the length of the original sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">In <em>Chaffin v Stynchcombe, </em>412 US 17; 93 S Ct 1977; 36 L Ed 2d 714 (1973), the Court was asked to extend the <em>Pearce </em>rule to jury sentencing. The defendant had been convicted and sentenced by one jury, had appealed and won a new trial and had been convicted and sentenced by another jury to a longer term in prison. The Court first explained the rationale behind <em>Pearce:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-8\">\"Under our constitutional system it would be impermissible for the sentencing authority to mete out higher sentences on retrial as punishment for those who successfully exercised their right to appeal, or to attack collaterally their conviction. Those actually subjected to harsher resentencing as a consequence of such motivation would be most directly injured, but the wrong would extend as well to those who elect not to exercise their rights of appeal because of a legitimate fear of retaliation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">The Court then went on to hold that the <em>Pearce </em>rule should not be extended to jury sentencing because \"[t]he potential for * * * abuse of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>sentencing process by the jury is <em>* * * de minimis\u201d </em>and because \"there is no * * * real threat of vindictiveness\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">The Court relied on several factors in reaching this decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-7\">\"The first prerequisite for the imposition of a retaliatory penalty is knowledge of the prior sentence. It has been conceded in this case that the jury was not informed of the prior sentence. * * * Other distinguishing factors between jury and judicial sentencing further diminish the possibility of impropriety in jury sentencing. As was true in <em>Colten, </em>the second sentence is not meted out by the same judicial authority whose handling of the prior trial was sufficiently unacceptable to have required a reversal of the conviction. Thus, the jury, unlike the judge who has been reversed, will have no personal stake in the prior conviction and no motivation to engage in self-vindication. Similarly, the jury is unlikely to be sensitive to the institutional interests that might occasion higher sentences by a judge desirous of discouraging what he regards as meritless appeals.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">If we were to isolate the statement that \"[t]he first prerequisite of a retaliatory penalty is knowledge of the prior sentence\u201d and then elevate that statement to an absolute rule of law, disposition of the case at bar would be simple. However, we believe this statement must be considered in the context of the case which gave it life.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">Unlike <em>Chaffin, </em>the case at bar does not involve jury sentencing. It involves judicial sentencing. In this respect it is much more like <em>Pearce. </em>The difference is significant. In this case, the second sentence was imposed by the same court which imposed the first sentence and the institutional interests absent in the context of jury sentencing are potentially present here. In addition, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>doubtful that the statement quoted above was intended to be an absolute rule for all cases or that the knowledge of the prior sentence was intended to be the only determinative factor. In <em>Michigan v Payne, </em>412 US 47, 50; 93 S Ct 1966; 36 L Ed 2d 736 (1973), decided the same day as <em>Chaffin, </em>the Court enunciated the dual purpose of the <em>Pearce </em>rule as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-6\">\"The two purposes for the resentencing restrictions imposed by <em>Pearce </em>were to ensure (i) 'that vindictiveness against a defendant for having successfully attacked his first conviction * * * [would] play no part in the sentence he receives after a new trial * * *\u2019 and (ii) <em>that apprehension of such vindictiveness would not 'deter a defendant\u2019s exercise of the right to appeal or collaterally attack his \u00f1rst conviction </em>* * V \u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">In a later case, <em>Blackledge v Perry, </em>417 US 21; 94 S Ct 2098; 40 L Ed 2d 628 (1974), the Court again had the opportunity to expound on the meaning of <em>Pearce. </em>Defendant Perry had originally been charged with a misdemeanor. After being convicted in an inferior tribunal, he exercised a state right to a trial <em>de novo </em>similar to that in <em>Colten v Kentucky, supra. </em>His first conviction was vacated and the case was set for trial. However, before trial began, the prosecutor secured an indictment charging the defendant with a felony for the same conduct that had led to the original misdemeanor charge. The defendant was convicted of the felony and sentenced to a substantially longer term in prison. The court first synthesized the previous decisions of <em>Pearce, Colten </em>and Chaffin as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-8\">\"The lesson that emerges from <em>Pearce, Colten, </em>and <em>Chaffin </em>is that the Due Process Clause is not offended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>by all possibilities of increased punishment upon retrial after appeal, but only by those that pose a realistic likelihood of 'vindictiveness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Blackledge, supra, </em>27.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">The Court then concluded that \"the opportunities for vindictiveness in this situation are such as to impel the conclusion that due process of law requires a rule analogous to that of * * * <em>Pearce\u201d.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">The Court relied on two factors in reaching this conclusion. The first was that the prosecutor \"has a considerable stake\u201d in discouraging appeals \"since such an appeal will clearly require increased expenditures of prosecutorial resources * * * and may even result in a formerly convicted defendant\u2019s going free\u201d. Second, \"if the prosecutor has the means readily at hand to discourage such appeals \u2014 by 'upping the ante\u2019 * * * \u2014 the State can insure that only the most hardy defendants will brave the hazards of a <em>de novo </em>trial\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">The Court in <em>Blackledge </em>made it clear that actual vindictiveness was not the key to whether a Pearce-type rule was required. Emphasizing the second purpose of the <em>Pearce </em>rule \u2014 freeing defendants of the fear of retaliatory motivations \u2014 the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-9\">\"There is, of course, no evidence that the prosecutor in this case acted in bad faith or maliciously in seeking a felony indictment against Perry. The rationale of our judgment in the <em>Pearce </em>case, however, <em>was not grounded upon the proposition that actual retaliatory motivation must inevitably exist. Rather, we emphasized that 'since the fear of such vindictiveness may unconstitutionally deter a defendant\u2019s exercise of the right to appeal or collaterally attack his \u00f1rst conviction, due process also requires that a defendant be freed of apprehension of such a retaliatory motivation </em>on the part of the sentencing judge.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>It is thus not decisive in this case that the resentencing judge lacked actual \"vindictiveness\u201d. The presentence report used to resentence the defendant in the same court was more favorable to him than the original report. He had appealed and won, filed a motion to strike and won and filed another motion to strike and won again only to receive a substantially longer term in prison. Two previous judges had disqualified themselves. The resentencing judge did not point to any conduct of the defendant since the original sentencing as having influenced the sentence finally imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">No subsequent affidavit to that effect has been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">We hold that the rule of <em>Pearce </em>applies to these circumstances. If we were to hold otherwise, for reasons similar to those stated in <em>Blackledge, </em>only the most adventurous defendant could be expected to challenge a sentence based upon defective information. He might win the battle, as here, but lose the war and end up in a worse position than before his \"victory\u201d \u2014 and through no fault of his own subsequent to the original sentencing. A defendant could realistically fear losing by winning and so be reluctant to press a meritorious appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">On the other hand, deletion of improper material from judicial consideration might make no difference in the overall determination and the sentence could well remain the same under <em>Pearce.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Had the resentencing judge in the case at bar applied the rule of <em>Pearce, </em>it is not doubted that he would have sentenced defendant to the same terms as the trial judge. He certainly would not have lowered the sentence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">Therefore, we reverse and remand to the trial court for reinstatement of the 10- to 15-year concurrent sentences.</p>\n<judges id=\"b624-8\">Kavanagh, C.J., and Levin, Fitzgerald, and Blair Moody, Jr., JJ., concurred with Coleman, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b614-8\"> The following exchange occurred at the final sentencing hearing prior to imposition of sentence:</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\"><em>\"The Court: </em>The court has reviewed at length the probation report. The matter was <em>not </em>tried in my court, and I think the <em>record </em>should so reflect.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-10\">\"Your attorney informs me this went to the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-11\"><em>\"The Defendant: </em>Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-12\"><em>\"The Court: </em>This I wasn\u2019t aware of.

The resentencing judge specifically stated that his intention was to reduce the original sentence. The Court of Appeals, despite finding \"no suggestion of vindictiveness\u201d, applied <em>Pearce </em>because the actual effect of the second sentence was to increase the potential time of incarceration and, as in the case at bar, the information available at resentencing was more, not less, favorable to the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b624-13\"> \"Now in my view of this probation report which you have had access to and you apparently did not dispute anything in the probation report, the seriousness of the offense, the prior offense, it is my best judgment that the sentence of not less than 20 and not more than 40 years is applicable to this case and that is what I have sentenced.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b624-9\">Ryan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ACZ\"><em>(dissenting). </em>The majority of the Court has concluded that the rule of <em>North Carolina v Pearce, </em>395 US 711; 89 S Ct 2072; 23 L Ed 2d 656 (1969), applies to nullify the greater sentence imposed on the defendant by a judge to whom his case was transferred for resentencing following a successful effort to have improper material excised from the presentence report.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">I respectfully disagree. I am convinced that re-sentencing of a defendant by a judge who is not informed of an earlier sentence is not a situation in which \"the possibility of vindictiveness\u201d inheres.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-11\"><em>Pearce </em>requires that, where it applies, a judge imposing a more severe sentence upon a defendant must state facts not made known to the first sentencing judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-12\">In <em>Chaffin v Stynchcombe, </em>412 US 17; 93 S Ct 1977; 36 L Ed 2d 714 (1973), however, the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>made it clear that <em>\"Pearce </em>was premised on the hazard of vindictiveness\u201d, 412 US 25, and that unless the likelihood a defendant will be penalized for exercising rights to post-conviction processes is perceived to exist, <em>Pearce </em>does not apply. The Court in <em>Pearce </em>\"intimated no doubt about the constitutional validity of higher sentences in the absence of vindictiveness despite whatever incidental deterrent effect they might have on the right to appeal\u201d. <em>Chaffin v Stynchcombe, </em>412 US 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">The majority opinion in <em>Chaffin </em>identified potential sources of vindictiveness in retrial and resentencing situations and found no real threat of vindictiveness where the jury is not informed of the prior sentence and the second sentence is not otherwise shown to be a product of vindictiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">\"The first prerequisite for the imposition of a retaliatory penalty is knowledge of the prior sentence.\u201d <em>Chaffin, </em>412 US 26. The second sentencing judge in this case had no knowledge of the original sentence or of the prior history of the case. See the majority opinion (fn 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Nor was the second sentence meted out by the same judge and thus there was no motive for self-vindication.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">At most, the second sentencing judge might have some tendency to be sensitive to certain institutional interests that could result in a propensity to sentence more harshly in order to discourage meritless appeals or resentencing procedures. The possibility of such institutional sensitivity alone was not seen to create an inherent likelihood of vindictiveness in a two-tier system of trial courts in <em>Colten v Kentucky, </em>407 US 104; 92 S Ct 1953; 32 L Ed 2d 584 (1972). I am not convinced that it does so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">In sum, I do not believe that the circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>presented in the case at bar present any likelihood of vindictiveness toward particular defendants. A defendant has no reason to fear that a judge who is unaware of a prior sentence will increase it out of vindictiveness. Moreover, there is no indication that the circuit judge was motivated by actual vindictiveness in imposing the second sentence. The sentence is certainly within a reasonable exercise of discretion in light of the crime and the defendant\u2019s record and would unquestionably stand had the questionable matter in the presentence report been timely raised before any sentence was imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">I would affirm the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b626-5\">Williams, J., concurred with Ryan, J.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
