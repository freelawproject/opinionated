Fuller\u2019s claims, <em>see Fuller v. SunTrust Banks, Inc., </em>744 F.3d 685 (11th Cir.2014), but this is the first time that Selet-hia Pruitt\u2019s case has been presented to us.</p>\n<p id=\"A9l\">While these appeals were pending, the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Tibbie v. Edison International, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 1823, 191 L.Ed.2d 795 (2015). In <em>Tibbie, </em>the Supreme Court determined that, under trust law, which illuminates the contours of. an ERISA fiduciary\u2019s duties, \u201ca fiduciary normally has a continuing duty of some kind to monitor investments and remove imprudent ones.\u201d 135 S.Ct. at 1828-29. Accordingly, the Supreme Court held that a plaintiff can effectively allege that a defendant breached its duty of prudence under ERISA \u201cby failing to properly monitor investments and remove imprudent ones[,] ... [and] so long as the alleged breach of. the continuing duty occurred within six years of suit, the claim is timely.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1829.</p>\n<p id=\"Ae1a\">The parties, in their supplemental discussions of <em>Tibbie </em>before this Court, agree with each other that these cases should be remanded to the district court for further proceedings, in light of <em>Tibbie. </em>We agree with the parties. The Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Tibbie </em>decision essentially abrogates that part of the prior panel\u2019s decision in Fuller\u2019s case concerning the application of ERISA\u2019s six-year statute of limitations. <em>Tibbie </em>similarly undermines the district court\u2019s dismissal of Pruitt\u2019s claims as barred by the six-year limitation. In light of <em>Tibbie </em>and the parties\u2019 supplemental notices and agreement that remand is appropriate, we no longer feel that oral argument is necessary in these cases.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We therefore VACATE the judgment and dismissal in Pruitt\u2019s case and remand to the district court for proceedings consistent with this opinion and <em>Tibbie. </em>Similarly, we VACATE the district court\u2019s denial of Fuller\u2019s motion under Rule 60(b), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and remand for further proceedings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aqv\">The plaintiffs also ask that we assign this case to a new district judge on remand because, they contend, the judge \u201chas made up her mind that it is not feasible to try [this] case, and that she would rule against Plaintiffs at every stage to prevent the case from going forward.\u201d Upon consideration, we do not believe that reassignment is warranted here.</p>\n<p id=\"ARg\">While reassigning a case to a different district judge falls within our authority, we have described that course of action as a \u201csevere remedy.\u201d <em>See Chuda-sama v. Mazda Motor Corp., </em>123 F.3d 1353, 1373 (11th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Remillong, </em>55 F.3d 572, 577 (11th Cir.1995) (per curiam). The propriety of doing so is informed by three factors: \u201c(1) whether the original judge would have difficulty putting his previous views and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1312\">*1312</page-number>findings aside; (2) whether reassignment is appropriate to preserve the appearance of justice; (3) whether reassignment would entail waste and duplication out of proportion to the gains realized from reassignment.\u201d <em>Chudasama, </em>123 F.3d at 1373 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Plaintiffs offer argument on the first and third factors only.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-4\">We disagree that the judge\u2019s ruminations on the potential quality of Pruitt\u2019s trial evidence suggest that she would improperly disregard or misweigh that evidence. Further, the fact that the district judge ruled against the appellants previously is of little impact; otherwise, every reversed case would have to be reassigned on remand. And as the defendants point out, the fact that the judge was able to reconsider and set aside her reasoning from Fuller\u2019s case when adjudicating Pruitt\u2019s suggests that she would not have a problem setting aside her previous views. Finally, although the case is still at the pleadings stage, the district judge has been assigned to Fuller\u2019s case for over four years and to Pruitt\u2019s for nearly three. She has expended significant effort on the not-so-simple issues of ERISA\u2019s fiduciary duties. Because we can discern very little, if any, benefit from reassignment, the \u201cwaste and duplication\u201d of a reassignment outweighs any gains. Accordingly, the request for reassignment on remand is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AN2\">. <em>See </em>11th Cir. R. 34-3 (f) (\u201cWhen an appeal is assigned to an oral argument panel, the oral argument panel ... may by unanimous vote determine that the appeal will be decided by the panel without oral argument, or transfer the appeal to the non-argument calendar.\u201d)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"A-N2\">. We note that procedurally, of course, <em>Tibbie </em>does not overturn our prior panel\u2019s affir-mance of the judgment in Fuller\u2019s case. By remanding Fuller\u2019s case, we are merely returning jurisdiction to the district court for consideration of any post-judgment motions Fuller wishes to make. We offer no opinion on the proper resolution of any such motions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
