So many titles have been jeopardized, and so many controversies have arisen, in consequence of imperfect publication, that the Court are disposed, <em>in limine, </em>to require a strict compliance with the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Notice held insufficient, and further publication ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
