Husband received interest, and a part of the principal, and then made an agreement with defendants, by which they were to pay ten per cent, interest on the judgment. The wife, just before her death, expressed a desire to the husband that \u201che should collect the note,\u201d that she \u201cwished the business settled up, and wanted him to have the money.\u201d Nothing was done however. The wife died \u2014 then the husband died, and administration was taken out on his estate. His administrator sued out a <em>sci. fa. </em>to revive the judgment. Afterwards, letters of administration were granted on the wife\u2019s estate \u2014 and her administratrix brings an action to recover the balance due on said judgment, and to enjoin the husband\u2019s administrator from further proceeding.

Emanuel Hahn after his intermar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>riage with Hannah Colvin, brought a suit in their joint names to recover the amount due upon a note given to her when sole, by the defendants Dennison and others. On leaving the note with his attorney for collection, he took a receipt therefor in his own name. A joint judgment was rendered in the action, for $1,500; upon which no execution was issued. The husband received the interest upon the judgment up to February 1851, and $300 of the principal: and then made a parol agreement with the defendants, by which they were to allow on the judgment, interest at the rate of ten per cent.; upon which it was claimed they were to have time upon the judgment; but of this there was no certain evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-5\">The wife was in a very infirm state of health for the last two years of her life; which was the occasion of heavy bills against the husband, on her account' \u2014 chiefly for medical aid. Some two or three weeks before her decease, (which occurred in June \u201951) she expressed much anxiety that the amount due upon the' judgment should be collected ; and in a conversation with her husband told him, \u201c that she did not think she would live1 long, and wanted him to go down to the city and collect <em>that note </em>\u2014 that she wished the business settled up; and she wanted him to have the money.\u2019\u2019 Before anything was done however, the wife died \u2014 afterwards the husband died, and the defendant was appointed his administrator, and sued out of the Common Pleas a <em>scire facias </em>to revive the judgment, which suit was still pending. Since then, administration having been granted to the plaintiff on the estate of the wife, she brought the present action to collect the amount due upon the judgment, and to prevent collection of the same by the defendant.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b425-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>Spencer, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The rule is well settled in Ohio, that the husband surviving his wife is not entitled to her choses in action, unless he reduce them into actual possession, or do some equivalent act; as, obtaining-judgment, or taking a new security, in <em>Ms own name\u2019, </em>(either of which merges the original consideration) or, transferring or releasing the same for a valuable consideration. But, the obtaining a judgment in the joint names of himself and wife, does not of itself operate as an extinguishment of the wife\u2019s interest in the original cause of action; nor is it regarded as equivalent to reducing the subject into possession; consequently, if the wife survive the husband in such case, the whole judgment belongs to her, as well at law, as in equity:</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">On the other hand, if the husband survive the wife, the whole debt at <em>law </em>becomes his by the survivorship; so far forth, that he is entitled to collect the same in his own name; but in the latter case, it must be accounted for to the use of his wife\u2019s representatives; for the debt being in fact uncollected during coverture, remained the wife\u2019s up to the time of her decease, and on his death, the right and duty of such collection, at law, would devolve upon his representatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Unless therefore, some other act of appropriation to the sole use of the husband, besides that of obtaining the judgment, can be shown, the plaintiff, as the representative of the wife, having the <em>beneficial </em>interest in the judgment, is entitled under the Code to bring a suit upon it in her own name, and recover the amount due from the original debtors, without waiting for its collection by the representative of the husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">And first, it is claimed on the part of his representative, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>that the circumstances of the husband\u2019s taking a receipt for the note in his own name, at the time of placing it in the hands of his attorney for collection; of bringing the suit; of receiving interest on the judgment, and part of the principal during the life of his wife; and the making of a contract with the debtors for farther time, and for receiving a higher rate of interest on the debt, than that reserved in the original note; were such acts of appropriation, as reduced the debt in contemplation of law into the possession of the husband. The obvious answer is, that all these acts show nothing more than an effort on the part of the husband, to obtain <em>possession </em>of his wife\u2019s right, and to subject it to his own use,- They only resulted in partial success; and to that extent his right was complete. They did not, however, in any wise change or purport to change, the condition of the original debt, nor of the judgment founded upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">2. It is claimed, that the declarations made by the wife to the husband, shortly before her decease, were intended as an appropriation by her of the debt, to his sole use; either, as an absolute gift, <em>inter vivos; </em>or as a <em>donatio mortis causa, </em>to become absolute on her death. Now it does not appear to us, that the language used by the wife on this occasion, can be fairly construed to express an intent to divest herself immediately of all interest in this judgment ; so that if her husband had died first, his representative should have the benefit of it, to the exclusion of herself. The words used by her, were not those of <em>grant, </em>in the present tense as, <em>UI give\u201d </em>but of desire, looking to the <em>future, </em>\u2014 \u201cI <em>want </em>you to go and collect that debt, #'c., and have the benefit of it \u2014 I want the business settled up;\u201d showing by this last expression her great <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>anxiety to have the debt collected, before her decease. In which case, it would belong to her husband by operation of law. This was the language of <em>entreaty, </em>urging the husband for his own sake, to collect and appropriate the debt; not that of <em>gift, </em>looking to an immediate destruction of <em>her own right. </em>A <em>gift, </em>to be valid, must pass by delivery, or that which is equivalent, at the <em>time </em>when made; and must be by words expressing a present change of ownership in the thing given; not, an intention in the future. It must be made by words and acts which are not revocable. Yet it will hardly be pretended, that the words used in the present case were not revocable at any time before the debt was collected; or that they might not have been recalled by the wife, without any breach of good faith, or propriety. If so, there was clearly no gift.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">But if, for the reasons thus given, this transaction cannot be supported as a gift, <em>inter vivos, </em>so neither can it be sustained as a <em>donatio mortis causa. </em>To support <em>either, </em>the act of giving and the change of possession must be <em>immediate. 2 Ves. Jr. </em>120. There is this difference however between the two classes of gifts; the former is <em>absolute; </em>the latter is <em>conditional; </em>to take effect only in the event of the donor\u2019s death. To make a valid transaction of the. latter kind, language must be used, denoting that the gift is not to take effect except in the event of the donor\u2019s death. Tote <em>vs. </em>Hilbeth, 2 <em>Ves. Jr. 121; 2 Bl. Com. </em>514. But, in the present case, if a gift was intended at all, it was <em>absolute, </em>not <em>conditional. </em>No language was used, from which it can be gathered that the donor intended the gift to be operative, only in the event of her decease. Indeed, the circumstance of her approaching death was only alluded to by the wife, as an inducement to her husband to be active in the collection of the debt.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A5B\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Miner, Clark &amp; Oliver for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Aaj\">Strait &amp; Hollister for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">On the whole, therefore, we are of opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to a recovery against the original <em>debtors </em>; and that the husband\u2019s representative should be enjoined from further proceeding to collect the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
