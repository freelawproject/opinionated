This could not be done. The Code allowed attachments against individuals who were nonresidents, but not against firms as such. A firm might be sued in its firm name, but only a firm that could be served with process at its place of business within the State. The attachment was therefore improperly issued and served, and ought to be dismissed. . A motion was \u2022made, however, for leave to amend petition and process. \u2022There could be no objection to an amendment of the petition; but to allow the process to be amended without prejudice to.the service, by inserting the individual names of the defendants, is a material amendment, which would affect substantial rights, and could not be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-10\">The original attachment is, therefore, dismissed, and leave granted to have amended petition, stand for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
