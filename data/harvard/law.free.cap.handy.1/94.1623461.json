The certificate was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>in this form: \u201cI W. D. Notary Public, do hereby certify, that S. O. Y. &amp; C. O. were by me severally sworn to testify the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, and that the depositions by them respectively subscribed, as above set forth, were reduced to writing by me, (I not being interested in the cause, nor of counsel for either party) and were taken at the time and place in the annexed notice specified.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Ac\">Woodruff &amp; Hopkins for plaintiffs.

On this point the authorities are clear, that something more than a presumption must be required. There must be \u201c direct proof that the requisitions of the statute have been fully complied with.\u201d If the certificate may be perfectly true, and yet, the deposition may not have been subscribed in the presence of the officer, I have no right to presume that it was so subscribed.
