L. c. 30, \u00a7 39K, a public body must pay to the contractor on a public construction job the amount of the final payment requisition within sixty-five days after the contractor fully completes the work. We hold that the town of Rockport, whose specially retained engineer had approved a final requisition in writing, is liable for the balance of the construction contract in the absence of facts indicating that the engineer\u2019s approval was made \u201cin bad faith, fraudulently, capriciously, or arbitrarily\u201d or was \u201cbased upon error of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b819-13\">We summarize the facts as they emerge from so much of the parties\u2019 pleadings as are uncontested and from cross affi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>davits filed with respect to the plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment. That motion was allowed and judgment entered for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">A. Bonfatti &amp; Co., Inc. (Bonfatti), the plaintiff, entered into a written agreement dated August 22, 1974, with the town of Rockport (the town) to build a water pollution control plant and a pumping station. The aggregate contract price, inclusive of approved change orders, was $2,641,828.98, of which the town had paid all but $32,049.02. Construction began shortly after the parties executed the construction contract. Earlier, on February 28, 1974, the town had executed a written agreement with Whitman and Howard, Inc. (the engineer), which had prepared the plans and specifications for the work, engaging the engineer\u2019s further services during the bidding, award and construction phases of the project. Those services included inspecting and overseeing Bonfatti\u2019s work; reviewing, approving or disapproving monthly payment requisitions by Bonfatti; passing on completion of the work; and approving or disapproving Bonfatti\u2019s request for final payment. Bonfatti submitted its request for final payment, in the amount of $32,049.02, on October 27, 1977, and that requisition was endorsed \u201cApproved for payment\u201d on November 17, 1977, by John T. Hannigan, who had acted for the engineer throughout the construction period. Sixty-five days elapsed without payment by the town or the submission by it of any list of unsatisfactory work. About eight months later, on September 1, 1978, Bonfatti filed a complaint claiming the balance due on its final requisition.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">In response to Bonfatti\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the town has asserted that the pollution plant has not worked properly, indeed, that it has been a calamitous failure, and that far from the town owing Bonfatti anything, the cost of making things right at the pollution plant will be \u201cwell over $1,000,000.\u201d Accordingly, the town urges, there is a material dispute of fact between it and Bonfatti and the latter\u2019s motion for summary judgment ought to have been denied. See <em>Community Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Dawes, </em>369 Mass. 550, 554 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>(1976); <em>First Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>North Adams Hoosac Sav. Bank, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 790, 795 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">We return to G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 39K, which was inserted in the statutory scheme by St. 1961, c. 627, \u00a7 1, an act which carried the caption heading: \u201cAn Act providing a method of prompt payment to contractors on contracts for the construction, reconstruction, altering, remodeling, repair or demolition of buildings by the Commonwealth or any political subdivision thereof.\u201d It provides, so far as material, that, \u201cAfter the receipt of a periodic estimate requesting final payment and within sixty-five days after <em>(a) </em>the contractor fully completes the work . . . the awarding authority shall pay the contractor the entire balance due on the contract less ... its estimate of the fair value of its claims against the contractor and of the cost of completing the incomplete and unsatisfactory items of work . . . .\u201d By St. 1971, c. 887, \u00a7 2, there was added to \u00a7 39K a provision that a \u201ccertificate of the architect to the effect that the contractor has fully or substantially completed the work shall ... be conclusive for the purposes of this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">By its endorsement of Bonfatti\u2019s final requisition the engineer<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> made a certification \u201cto the effect that\u201d the work had been completed. That was conclusive of Bonfatti\u2019s entitlement to payment of the balance due. Nothing in the town\u2019s pleadings or counter affidavits suggests a rebuttal of the statutory presumption of conclusiveness on the ground that the engineer\u2019s act was tainted with bad faith, fraud, or caprice or that his approval of the final requisition \u201cis unsupported by substantial evidence, or is based upon error of law.\u201d G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 39J, inserted by St. 1961, c. 538, \u00a7 1. Accordingly, the judge was right in allowing the motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>Nothing offered by the town bears on facts material to the procedure prescribed in \u00a7 39K, viz., final request for payment, response by the public body within sixty-five days as to what in the contractor\u2019s work is undone or unsatisfactory, and payment of so much of the final request as is left unchallenged. The town\u2019s position is that its detailed assertions concerning the inadequacies of the pollution plant put in issue whether Bonfatti fully completed the contract work in accordance with plans and specifications. None of those shortcomings were raised, however, in the time and manner required by \u00a7 39K. It was the duty of the town within sixty-five days to notify the contractor of its claims and to estimate the fair value of those claims and the cost of completing the incomplete and unsatisfactory items of work. On the record before us there was no informal communication by the town to Bonfatti of its grievances, let alone a formal one. Compare <em>D. Federico Co. </em>v. <em>New Bedford Redevelopment Authy., </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 141, 146-147 (1980). If the town desired its agent, the engineer, to withhold final payment by reason of asserted defects, it could have specified the defects and the estimated cost of removing them and directed the engineer to disapprove the requisition. Had the engineer refused to do so, his bad faith or arbitrariness under \u00a7 39J might be placed in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">Our cases have repeatedly held the contracting parties to compliance with the statutory requirements which govern public construction. <em>Albre Marble &amp; Tile Co. </em>v. <em>Goverman, </em>353 Mass. 546, 549 (1968). <em>D. Federico Co. </em>v. <em>New Bedford Redevelopment Authy., supra </em>at 145. <em>Glynn </em>v. <em>Gloucester, </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 454, 461 (1980). Were we to accept the town\u2019s position that the question of completion may be first raised well after the expiration of the statutory sixty-five days, the statutory purpose of achieving prompt final payments would be undone.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We presume that it is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>object of provisions such as G. L. c. 30, \u00a7\u00a7 39F through 39K, inclusive, that the public secure construction at the lowest price. Compare <em>Interstate Engr. Corp. </em>v. <em>Fitchburg, </em>367 Mass. 751, 757-758 (1975); <em>Paul Sardella Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Braintree Housing Authy., </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 326, 332-333 (1975), S.C. 371 Mass. 235 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">What we have said about compliance by public bodies with \u00a7 39 does not necessarily foreclose them from subsequent recovery for defects in construction. We do not intimate that they may not seek to use remedies available under the construction contract and general contract law.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">The judgment is affirmed and further interest on the judgment shall be assessed in accordance with \u00a7 39K.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b821-7\"> The engineer, Whitman &amp; Howard, Inc., it will be recalled, designed the pollution plant, as well as supervised the construction. The engineer, therefore, performed the architectural services for the job and was \u201cthe architect\u201d for purposes of the fourth paragraph of \u00a7 39K.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b821-8\"> Third parties had been added and the summary judgment was a partial one. Upon a determination that there was no just reason for delay, Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>R.Civ.P. 54(b), 365 Mass. 821 (1974), judgment entered on Bonfatti\u2019s complaint against the town.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b822-8\"> The town has argued that Bonfatti was timely notified by the engineer that its work was unsatisfactory because the engineer had notified Bon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>fatti on July 25,1975, that Bonfatti\u2019s selection of aerators for the plant \u201cis conditionally acceptable\u201d and that the contractor would be responsible for replacement should the aerators not \u201cperform as specified after installation and tested in place.\u201d We think it is obvious that the engineer\u2019s approval of the last requisition almost two years later superseded the document dated July 25, 1975.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
