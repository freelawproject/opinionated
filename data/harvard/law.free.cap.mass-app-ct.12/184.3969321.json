That order constituted a reduction in pay because, since 1971, the traffic supervisors had been paid on the basis of a forty-two week year (the school year runs between thirty-eight and thirty-nine weeks) and an assumed fifteen hours per week, without deductions for holidays, snow days or any other event which might cause the school not to be open.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">There is no dispute between the parties that this cutback in hours hard on the heels of union activity constituted a prohibited practice for a public employer under G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 10(a)(1) and (3). <em>See National Labor Relations Bd. </em>v. <em>Exchange Parts Co., </em>375 U.S. 405, 409 (1964); <em>Massachusetts Bd. of Regional Community Colleges </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>377 Mass. 847, 850 (1979); <em>Southern Worcester County Regional Vocational Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>377 Mass. 897, 904-905 (1979); <em>School Comm. of Stoughton </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., 4 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 262, 269-270 (1976). Indeed, as soon as he was consulted, Burlington\u2019s town counsel recommended that the selectmen rescind their order, and they did so. In the course of his inquiry into the matter, however, town counsel discovered that the town meeting had in 1974 adopted a bylaw relating to part-time employees which appeared to limit them to compensation for time actually spent on the job. Awakened to the existence of the 1974 by-law, the selectmen were pleased to don the mantle of statutory duty in order to do what they wanted to do all along: cut the hours for which traffic supervisors would be paid. The commission was not persuaded that the selectmen\u2019s action was anything other than retaliatory, so found, and ordered among other things that the traffic supervisors be paid prospectively and retroactively on the basis of the old formula. From that order the town appealed pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. No material subsidiary facts were in dispute, and upon cross motions for summary judgment, a Superior Court judge affirmed the decision of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>The town, on this appeal,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> argues that it has no alternative to enforcement of its laws and that such retaliatory motives as the selectmen may have had are simply not relevant. In contending that the town has a duty to administer a particular law irrespective of a past history of nonenforcement, the town is on reasonably well-established ground. <em>Scola </em>v. <em>Scola, 318 </em>Mass. 1, 7 (1945). <em>Mayor of Haverhill </em>v. <em>Water Commrs. of Haverhill, </em>320 Mass. 63, 70 (1946). Cf. <em>Doherty </em>v. <em>Woburn, </em>345 Mass. 523, 528 (1963). <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>McKenzie, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 553, 559 (1973). But the duty to apply the law carries with it the duty to apply the law impartially.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When it appears, therefore, that a statute or regulation is enforced in aid of an ulterior and forbidden purpose, courts have rejected the \u201cslave of duty\u201d defense. So, for example, in <em>National Labor Relations Bd. </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>200 F.2d 656, 659 (5th Cir. 1953), the grant of wage increases required by the Fair Labor Standards Act was, in the context of a labor dispute, held to be an unfair labor practice. By analogy, in <em>Nash </em>v. <em>Florida Industrial Commn., </em>389 U.S. 235, 239-240 (1967), it was held that enforcement of a Florida unemployment compensation statute in a manner which appeared to punish an employee for filing a claim of unfair labor practice in and of itself constituted an unfair labor practice proscribed by the paramount provisions of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 et seq. (1976). See <em>Murgia </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, </em>15 Cal. 3d 286, 297, 302 (1975). In the instant case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>the requirements of G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 10, are paramount to the Burlington by-law<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in circumstances where they come into collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">What motive underlies enforcement of a statute, therefore, takes on relevance in unfair labor practice cases because it provides the key to whether the conduct complained of was in the ordinary course or provoked by anti-union animus. See <em>National Labor Relations Bd. </em>v. <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp., </em>301 U.S. 1, 45-46 (1937); <em>Massachusetts Bd. of Regional Community Colleges </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>377 Mass. at 851; <em>National Labor Relations Bd. </em>v. <em>Gotham Indus., Inc., </em>406 F.2d 1306, 1309 (1st Cir. 1969). See generally Christensen &amp; Svanoe, Motive and Intent in the Commission of Unfair Labor Practices: The Supreme Court and the Fictive Formality, 77 Yale L.J. 1269 (1968). The timing of the town\u2019s action as to the traffic supervisors\u2019 pay was substantial evidence from which the commission\u2019s hearing officer could and did draw an inference of retaliatory motivation. See <em>Southern Worcester Regional Vocational Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>377 Mass. at 904; <em>Labor Relations Commn. </em>v. <em>Blue Hill Spring Water Co., </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 50, 62-63 (1980). In such circumstances, we defer to the commission\u2019s fact-finding role. <em>Wheelock College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>371 Mass. 130, 132-133 (1976). <em>Smith College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>376 Mass. 221, 224 (1978). The only evidence of proper independent purpose offered by the town to rebut the union\u2019s prima facie case on the issue of improper motive is that the selectmen prudently followed the advice of counsel. But that advice was solicited and received only after the selectmen had engaged in their first act of reprisal; it was too late for them then to ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>plain that they labored under compulsion of law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As the trial judge'observed, public action, \u201calbeit wholly legal in form, may be set aside if discriminatory in substance and intent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b206-14\">Traffic supervisors direct traffic at school crossings during the times of day when children are on the way to, or back from, school.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b208-5\"> As to factual issues, our standard of review is the \u201csubstantial evidence test.\u201d See <em>Labor Relations Commn. </em>v. <em>Everett, </em>7 Mass.
