Prior to the vote which is claimed to have effected rescission, agreements were signed with each of the benefited employees. Dullea, the recipient of one such agreement, brought suit in the Superior Court for its specific enforcement. The Authority replied with several defenses, only two of which remain alive on this appeal: (1) whether its board of directors had in fact empowered the general manager to execute final and binding agreements with the eligible employees, and, if so, (2) whether the board could properly vacate the vote establishing the plan. At the heart of the dispute is the question whether the plaintiff\u2019s agreement embodied a true contractual undertaking to defer payments of salary, or whether it represented a payment of pension benefits which is subject to a different analysis. A judge of the Superior Court ruled<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that the agreement is \u201csubject to a straightforward contractual analysis and not the more complex treatment afforded pension benefits,\u201d and he directed the entry of a judgment specifically enforcing its terms. The judgment was stayed pending disposition of the Authority\u2019s appeal. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">The statement of agreed facts and exhibits furnish these details. Dullea was employed by the Authority and its predecessor, the Metropolitan Transit Authority, from November 1, 1940, until he retired on March 1, 1976, serving during the last five years on its executive payroll as assistant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>treasurer-controller. Employees retiring from the Authority\u2019s executive payroll receive two types of payments. First, they are paid benefits under the contributory retirement fund (about which there is no controversy in this case). Second, the Authority has undertaken to pay them additional noncontributory benefits pursuant to a vote of the old Transit Authority\u2019s board of trustees approved on March 23, 1964. Under that vote, each eligible employee who thereafter retired from the executive payroll was to receive supplemental benefits equal to one percent of his average annual compensation multiplied by his number of years of service. These payments, however, are limited by a provision which restricts the annual combined (i.e. contributory and noncontributory) benefits to a maximum of sixty-five percent of the employee\u2019s average annual compensation. This arrangement remained in effect from 1964 through early 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">On March 26, 1975, the Authority\u2019s directors adopted a vote which purported to establish a separate pension and retirement system for executive employees and which authorized the general manager \u201cto implement the [e]xecutive [p]ension [s]ystem established by this [v]ote.\u201d It appears that the contemplated system never came into existence. Instead, in May, 1975, a proposal was submitted to amend the deferred compensation portion of the combined pension benefits. That proposal recommended an increase in noncontributory benefits by: (1) changing the average annual compensation used to compute deferred compensation to an eligible employee\u2019s five highest paid, rather than his last five years of service; (2) permitting the employee to receive two, rather than one, percent of his average annual compensation for each year of service; and (3) raising the ceiling on maximum combined pension benefits from sixty-five to eighty percent of the employee\u2019s applicable average compensation . The question whether this plan should be implemented was placed before the directors (meeting in executive session) on May 14, 1975, in the form of a proposed vote which read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>\u201c[T]hat the [b]oard of [d]irectors hereby authorizes . . . the [g]eneral [m]anager to execute on behalf of the Authority [d]eferred [c]ompensation [a]greements with all persons on the [e]xecutive [p]ayroll of the Authority, such [a]greements to be substantially in the form presented to this [m]eeting and filed with the records thereof with such modifications in form as may be approved by the [g]eneral [c]ounsel; and that as additional persons shall be added to said [e]xecutive [p]ayroll similar contracts shall be executed as in the form above; said [d]eferred [c]ompensation [a]greements to be in lieu of, and not in addition to, any presently existing [d]eferred [c]ompensation [a]greement which may have been executed between the MBTA and the individual involved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The board passed the vote with the addition of a sentence (as appearing in the formal minutes of the meeting) that \u201c[t]he back-up papers relative to the immediately preceding [v]ote are to be forwarded to Mr. Robert R. Kiley, Deputy Mayor, for his review.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The next day, counterparts of the deferred compensation agreement that had been approved at the meeting were signed with 138 employees, including the plaintiff.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>We now outline Kiley\u2019s role in the matter and the events which followed the May 14 vote. In May, 1975, the Authority was in the midst of transition. By May 14, Kiley had been appointed by the Governor and approved by the Authority\u2019s advisory board to succeed Kelly as general manager and to replace one Doolittle as chairman of the Authority\u2019s board of directors. Kiley formally assumed both positions on May 19, 1975, five days after the deferred compensation proposal was approved. It is obvious when the vote was passed and the 138 agreements signed that the directors were aware of the fact that Kiley would soon assume command. Some time after the meeting a copy of the vote and the so called back-up papers were forwarded to Kiley, via one of his assistants. Kiley, however, apparently failed to review the documents or become aware of the over-all significance of the board\u2019s action until on or about June 10,1975. At a board meeting on June 11,1975, over which Kiley presided, the directors authorized the release of the May 14 vote for general publication. The deferred compensation matter then resurfaced at the board\u2019s meeting on June 20, 1975. At that meeting, the directors (inferably acting on Kiley\u2019s recommendation) voted unanimously<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to vacate the May 14 vote and to refer the general subject of executive pensions to the personnel department for further study.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Authority thereafter publicly an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>nounced that it would not pay benefits under any of the documents signed on May 15. The parties have stipulated that there was no material change in the status of any employee on the Authority\u2019s executive payroll between May 14 and June 20, 1975, that no employee was hired onto or retired from that payroll during that period, and that Dullea\u2019s terms and conditions of employment were not otherwise altered in any respect between those dates. Of the total of 138 agreements, all were returned and cancelled except for those executed by the plaintiff and a handful of other employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">1. The Authority claims that the May 14 vote did not empower Kelly to execute binding agreements because the last sentence thereof conditioned his authority upon Kiley\u2019s prior approval of the plan. Thus, the Authority contends, Kiley\u2019s later action calling for retraction of the vote amounted to the exercise of his absolute right to veto the entire proposal. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The language of the May 14 vote explicitly \u201cauthorizes the . . . [g]eneral [m]anager to execute on behalf of the Authority [d]eferred [compensation [a]grcements with all persons on the [executive [p]ayroll . . . .\u201d This statement conferred express authority on Kelly to implement the plan by signing agreements with all eligible employees. The postscript which gave Kiley the opportunity to \u201creview\u201d the back-up papers obscures the meaning of the foregoing statement, and the original handwritten version of the postscript (see note 2, <em>supra) </em>is of relatively little assistance in determining the directors\u2019 intended role for Kiley. However, we may infer that, since only the \u201cback-up papers\u201d were to be submitted to Kiley, the directors were referring to him questions of implementation rather than underlying policy. We think it more appropriate in settling the question of the respective authority of the two general managers to look to events following the May 14 vote as some indication of the practical meaning placed on the vote by the parties themselves. See Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 42 &amp; Comment a (1957). Cf. Leach &amp; Liacos, Massachusetts Evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>dence 278-280 (4th ed. 1967); <em>Pittsfield </em>&amp; <em>No. Adams R.R. </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Albany R.R., </em>260 Mass. 390, 397-398 (1927); <em>Cooley </em>v. <em>Bettigole, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 515, 521 (1973). Certainly, Kelly\u2019s signing of 137 counterparts of the deferred compensation agreement and the signing of Kelly\u2019s agreement by three of the directors is significant evidence that the May 14 vote was to take effect immediately without Kiley\u2019s prior approval. Significant also are the board\u2019s actions at subsequent meetings which certified and adopted the May 14 vote and made it public.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The votes at the later meetings would be rendered largely nugatory if the May 14 vote were construed as conditional. Most telling, perhaps, is the fact that after Kiley had taken the time to review the plan, the directors voted to retract it. It seems unlikely that the board would have gone to the bother of formally vacating the May 14 vote if that vote had initially vested Kiley with an unfettered power of veto. We think that the last sentence of the vote was designed to give Kiley, in view of his imminent succession to office, the chance to study the merits of the plan and its ramifications on the Authority\u2019s fiscal condition, to provide him with the opportunity to express his views to the directors on the proposal\u2019s suitability, and to furnish him the right to make a recommendation as to whether the May 14 vote should stand or be retracted. This is the precise sequence of events which occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">2. Could the board then, thirty-seven days later, nullify the action by which it had created the plan? The answer to this question requires a threshold determination whether the benefits embodied in the plaintiff\u2019s agreement are to be analyzed under ordinary contract law principles or whether they are better suited for the analysis reserved for modifications of publicly funded pension programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">The characterization of the payments as deferred compensation is of no more than peripheral interest because we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>must be concerned with their substance and not the label put on them by the parties. The plaintiff s agreement describes the contemplated payments forthrightly as a constituent part of his \u201ccombined pension benefits.\u201d The agreement\u2019s relevant provisions postpone payments until the employee\u2019s retirement, when they then may be made \u201cin accordance with the . . . options [available under] the Authority\u2019s [retirement fund.\u201d Benefits are not assignable or alienable, terminate on the employee\u2019s death (unless any available survivor options are selected), and cease altogether \u201cduring any period that the [e]mployee is returned to service.\u201d The new plan remains part of the noncontributory benefits given to retiring employees and was developed as a means of upgrading existing benefits which had long been an element of the Authority\u2019s total executive retirement package. The benefits were intended to be part of an executive <em>pension </em>system. The plan differs from the State\u2019s statutory plan for deferred compensation (G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 64, as amended by St. 1976, c. 422, \u00a7 4), which enables certain public employees to postpone payment of a portion of their salaries which would otherwise be available immediately.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> No undue strain is required to fit the payments contemplated by the May 14 vote into traditional legal definitions of a \u201cpension\u201d. See <em>State ex rel. Bolen </em>v. <em>Seattle, </em>61 Wash. 2d. 196, 198 (1963) (a pension is \u201cdeferred compensation for services rendered\u201d); <em>Broadhurst </em>v. <em>Fall River, </em>278 Mass. 167, 169 (1932) (\u201cA pension is definite in amount, lasts during the life of the pensioner, and must be disbursed regularly out of the public treasury without any concurring service rendered by the pensioner for the public\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>Moreover, it is undeniable that the Authority is classified as a political subdivision of the Commonwealth (G. L. c. 161A, \u00a7 2), and that its employees are public employees. <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>344 Mass. 214, 218-219 (1962). <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Authy. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>356 Mass. 563, 565 (1970). There are, of course, differences between the instant plan and the complex system provided by the Legislature in G. L. c. 32 for certain categories of public employees.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> And it is true in a general sense that payments of this sort may be thought of as rewards for past performance or as incentives to retain employees in public service in the face of better prospects in the private sector. However, while these differences do exist, we do not consider them to be so fundamental as to compel disregard of helpful precedents regarding employee rights in public pensions. We conclude that the remaining issues are best resolved by a review and application of those still-evolving precedents, and to that task we next turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">3. For many years, the courts used one or the other of two radically different theories to determine the effect of modifications of governmental pension plans. A numerical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>majority of jurisdictions, including Massachusetts, treated benefits under these plans as mere gratuities which could be changed or revoked to the employee\u2019s detriment at any time \u2014 even if the promised benefits had been taken in part from an employee\u2019s own salary, and sometimes even if the employee had satisfied all the conditions required to qualify for his pension. See, e.g. (outside of Massachusetts), <em>Pennie </em>v. <em>Reis, </em>132 U.S. 464 (1889); <em>Bergin </em>v. <em>Trustees of Teachers\u2019 Retirement Sys., </em>31 Ill. 2d 566, 574 (1964); <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Baton Rouge, </em>309 So.2d 306, 311-313 (La. 1975); <em>Mollner </em>v. <em>Omaha, </em>169 Neb. 44, 59-65 (1959); <em>Dallas </em>v. <em>Trammell, </em>129 Tex. 150 (1937); and (in this State) <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>328 Mass. 59 (1951); <em>Kinney </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>330 Mass. 302 (1953); <em>Smolinski </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>346 Mass. 210 (1963). See also the discussion of the last three cases in <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>364 Mass. 847, 856-858 (1973). The remaining jurisdictions considered the promise of a pension, once accepted, as creating an irrevocable contractual commitment to pay the pension which was immune from any modification by the public employer which would effect a reduction in benefits. See, e.g., <em>Yeazell </em>v. <em>Copins, </em>98 Ariz. 109 (1965); <em>Bender </em>v. <em>Anglin, </em>207 Ga. 108, cert. denied, 340 U.S. 878 (1950); <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Allegheny County Retirement Bd., </em>390 Pa. 75, 79-80 (1957). As discussed in the margin, both the gratuity and the contract theories suffer from infirmities which undercut their utility in solving problems caused by today\u2019s complex public pension systems.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>The need for a better formulation was discussed in the 1973 <em>Opinion of the Justices, supra. </em>That opinion dealt with proposed changes which would adversely affect the \u201ccontractual\u201d rights (see G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 25[5], as appearing in St. 1956, c. 525) accorded employees of the Commonwealth and certain of its subdivisions by the contributory retirement system delineated in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7\u00a7 1-28. In expressing the view that a portion of the proposed legislation which would increase the burdens on covered employees without conferring corresponding benefits was presumptively invalid, the Justices had this to say (364 Mass. at 861-862) about existing modes of analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-5\">\u201cThe label \u2018gratuity\u2019 could never have been taken with sober literalness, and so also for \u2018contract.\u2019 It is not really feasible \u2014 nor would it be desirable \u2014 to fit so complex and dynamic a set of arrangements as a statutory retirement scheme into ordinary contract law which posits as its model a joining of the wills of mutually assenting individuals to form a specific bargain. As the commentators show, a retirement plan for public employees does not readily submit itself to analysis according to Professor Williston\u2019s canons. . . . When, therefore, the characterization \u2018contract\u2019 is used, it is best understood as meaning that the retirement scheme has generated material expectations on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>the part of employees and those expectations should in substance be respected. Such is the content of \u2018contract.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-5\">\u201cIt is true that a few cases that adopt the label of \u2018contract\u2019 have approached the terms of a retirement plan as they would a bond indenture, but closer to the realities is the view that \u2018contract\u2019 protects the member of a retirement plan in the core of his reasonable expectations, but not against subtractions which, although possibly exceeding the trivial, can claim certain practical justifications. Attention should then center on the nature of these justifications in the light of the problems of financing and administering these massive plans under changing conditions\u201d (citations and footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">The thrust of this opinion, as we read it, is that reasonably based reliance by public employees on an express promise that their pensions are irrevocable<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> gives those employees a vested right<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> sufficient to bar a reduction of those benefits below the level existing when the employees first began work, or the level existing at the point when the promise had created expectations firm enough to command judicial respect. The opinion left open the question when the last <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>level would be reached, and courts faced with future problems were directed to analyze the rights of the parties on the given facts under the more realistic guidelines adopted by California.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">The attitude in that State may be summarized as follows. First, the California decisions strongly suggest that an employee\u2019s rights to a pension will not vest until he has worked for a legally significant period of time in reliance on the belief that he will be protected by a pension. See <em>Kern </em>v. <em>Long Beach, </em>29 Cal. 2d 848, 855 (1947) (the right arises \u201cas soon as [the employee] has performed substantial services for his employer\u201d). See also <em>Houghton </em>v. <em>Long Beach, </em>164 Cal. App. 2d 298, 305 (1958); <em>Frank </em>v. <em>Board of Admn. of Pub. Employees\u2019 Retirement Sys., </em>56 Cal. App. 3d 236, 241 (1976). Second, despite the vesting of the employee\u2019s entitlement, the public employer retains some authority to make \u201creasonable\u201d modifications in its pension program in order to meet \u201cchanging conditions\u201d and to \u201cmaintain the integrity of the system,\u201d provided that \u201cchanges in a pension plan which result in disadvantage to employees [are] accompanied by comparable new advantages.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Long Beach, 45 </em>Cal. 2d 128,131 (1955). <em>Miller </em>v. <em>California, </em>18 Cal. 3d 808, 816 (1977). <em>Betts </em>v. <em>Board of Admn. of Pub. Employees\u2019 Retirement Sys., </em>21 Cal. 3d 859, 864 (1978). In the <em>Houghton </em>case, 164 Cal. App.2d at 306, for example, an increase in employee contributions without any compensating increase in benefits was upheld on a showing by the city that the additional revenues would result in improved financial stability for the system. These principles avoid rigid adherence to strictly formalistic doctrine by balancing the interests of the governmental employer in revising plans to ensure their soundness with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>the legitimate reliance interests of employees who look to pensions as a substantial benefit accruing from the satisfactory performance of long-term service. The essence renders the entitlements of both parties subject to reasonable limitations. The government, on the one hand, cannot make unilateral or capricious changes in pension programs which have been held out to employees \u201cas in substance delayed compensation for their services, and [relied upon] ... as a security against destitution in their old age and against catastrophe.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>364 Mass. at 858. Conversely, an employee may not insist that his expectations be fulfilled unless they are premised on an adequate period of service and practically justified in the circumstances.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">On an application of these principles to this case, we conclude that the plaintiff had not acquired a sufficient interest in the plan to prohibit retraction of the plan. The Authority\u2019s approval of the enhanced benefits, although absolute in form, was somewhat tentative. It was certainly short-lived \u2014 only thirty-seven days after the board\u2019s vote the plan was decisively and publicly renounced. The plaintiff took no decisive action in reliance on the promise of more benefits, nor did he perform any substantial services for a significant period based on his agreement. Importantly, the Authority\u2019s action did not reduce this plaintiff\u2019s retirement benefits below the level in effect at the time of his hiring or below the level in force during the bulk of service. To the contrary, his benefits were maintained at the level they had reached almost thirty-five years after he began his employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>ment and less than one year before his retirement. Moreover, the Authority can point to sound reasons for retracting the plan. It was adopted in the midst of turbulence at the agency, and it does not require an overly suspicious frame of mind to infer that the proposal might have sought to evade the more parsimonious attitude expected of the new administration. Because of the plan\u2019s potential for significant impact on the Authority\u2019s future revenues (see note 3, supra), its recommittal for further study was prudent and a decision which could in the long run produce a sounder plan. Careful study and evaluation are especially appropriate where a plan will introduce \u201cinto the computations . . . adventitious payments to employees which could place untoward, massive, continuing burdens on the retirement systems.\u201d <em>Boston Assn. of Sch. Admrs. &amp; Supervisors </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>383 Mass. 336, 341 (1981). Whether the present situation is viewed as one involving a failure of vesting, or as one where if vesting had occurred, the interest could be permissibly retracted because it \u201chad not been of such duration as to generate reasonable expectations that had to be respected\u201d (Mass<em>achusetts Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>Teachers\u2019Retirement Bd., </em>383 Mass. 345, 348 [1981]), we conclude that, on these facts, the plaintiff\u2019s interest is not sufficient to outweigh the Authority\u2019s interest in seeing that public funds are committed and expended in an orderly and deliberate manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">The judgment is reversed; a new judgment is to be entered which dismisses the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b105-9\"> The case was considered below on a statement of agreed facts and exhibits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b107-6\"><em> </em>The recording secretary\u2019s handwritten record of the board\u2019s addition to the vote read: \u201c[A]lthough it was voted, R.

L. c. 32, \u00a7 1], for the purpose of computing the retirement and pension benefits earned by any employee, but any sum so deducted shall not be included in the computation of any taxes withheld on behalf of any such employee.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b112-6\"> The plaintiff considers as significant that these benefits were offered only to a small number of the Authority\u2019s employees. He also states that the program was designed to remedy the erosion caused by inflation to the prevailing level of deferred compensation benefits, and to align the retirement benefits of executives on a percentage of salary basis with the higher benefits afforded to lower paid Authority employees. Thus, he claims that because the agreements were designed to remedy a specific inequity involving a limited number of executive employees, they lack the essential \u201cacross the board nature\u201d of a Statewide statutory pension system. Nevertheless, the proposal did establish a plan which was general in nature and which was to apply indiscriminately to all employees within the class. Moreover, like the statutory scheme, it did not grow out of any negotiations between the authorizing agency and the supposed beneficiaries, and the prospective recipients did not participate in the plan\u2019s formulation. The benefits were granted unilaterally, just as they are by a statutory pension program. The principal element of consideration for the agreement was the rendition of future services. The facts that the plan was established by a semi-autonomous board of directors of a public authority and that superficial contract formalities were used to implement the program would not change the basic nature of the benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b113-5\"> The chief defect of the gratuity hypothesis is that, in practice, it can be unjust. Public employees are likely to rely on promises of retirement benefits when initially accepting employment, when deciding whether to continue in government service, and when planning their future. They are exposed to severe hardship, if, after a long period of service, the promised pensions are reduced or retracted. See <em>Hickey </em>v. <em>Pittsburgh Pension Bd., </em>378 Pa. 300, 302 (1954); Note, Contractual Aspects Of Pension Plan Modification, 56 Colum. L. Rev. 251, 254 (1956); Note, Public Employee Pensions In Times of Fiscal Distress, 90 Harv. L. Rev. 992, 997 (1977). Contract analysis is cumbersome and suffers from at least two flaws. First, it distorts reality, because the establishment of a governmental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>pension plan bears at most only a general resemblance to negotiation and formation of a contract. These programs are almost always instituted unilaterally without prior consultation with prospective beneficiaries. The express consent of the employee, if it is required at all, is usually a formality, and there is no \u201cbargained-for\u201d consideration in the usual sense of that concept. The second infirmity in the contract analysis is that, by freezing the provisions of the plan without any adjustments, serious harm can occur to the governmental entity that created it. Changes in policies, commitments, and financial conditions can make plans drafted under favorable conditions unrealistic and burdensome on the government employer. See, e.g., <em>Talbott </em>v. <em>Independent Sch. Dist., </em>230 Iowa 949 (1941); <em>Newcomb </em>v. <em>Ogden City Pub. Sch. Teachers\u2019 Retirement </em>Commn., 121 Utah 503 (1952).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b115-7\"> The express legislative promise referred to in the opinion is the one contained in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 25(5), which makes membership in the retirement system established by \u00a7\u00a7 1-28 of the same chapter \u201ca contractual relationship under which members who are or may be retired for superannuation are entitled to contractual rights and benefits, and no amendments or alterations shall be made that will deprive any such member or any group of such members of their pension rights or benefits provided for thereunder . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b115-8\"> As a result of this vested right, a proposed increase in the contributory retirement system which would have raised salary deductions for members in the system from five to seven percent without any enlargement of benefits was considered presumptively invalid, but proper if applied prospectively to employees entering the system after January 1, 1974.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b116-6\"> The rule of qualified vesting has been adopted in Washington and Colorado. See <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Seattle, </em>81 Wash. 2d 479, 485-490 (1972), and <em>Police Pension &amp; Relief Bd. </em>v. <em>Bills, </em>148 Colo. 383 (1961). See also Cohn, Public Employee Retirement Plans \u2014 The Nature of the Employees\u2019 Rights, 1968 U. Ill. L.F. 32, 46-48 (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b117-6\"> This position substantially adopts, in different words, the rule which has prevailed with respect to private pension disputes. See, e.g., <em>Balkin </em>v. <em>Katz, </em>373 Mass. 419 (1977), holding that an employee\u2019s reliance on an oral promise to pay a pension by continuing his employment for six years after the promise was made constituted sufficient consideration to warrant a conclusion that a contract to pay a pension had been formed, and <em>Hoefel v. Atlas Tack Corp., </em>581 F.2d 1 (1st Cir. 1978), applying <em>Balkin </em>v. <em>Katz </em>to prevent termination of a private pension plan after the employee had served the company for a specified number of years in the reasonable belief that he would be entitled to a lifetime pension.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
