Defense counsel neither objected to the prosecutor\u2019s argument nor requested the trial judge to give curative instructions to the jury. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Killelea, </em>370 Mass. 638, 645 (1976); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gouveia, </em>371 Mass. 566, 571-572 (1976). To the degree that the prosecutor\u2019s argument was improper, therefore, it constitutes reversible error only if, examined against the backdrop of the entire case, a miscarriage of justice occurred. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>352 Mass. 556, 563-564 (1967). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shelley, </em>374 Mass. 466, 467 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">In the instant case the defendant took the stand and, while under direct examination by his counsel, testified that he had confronted one Murphy, who was the person who had been robbed, and that the defendant had told him, \u201cI was on probation right now and that if he thought I had anything to do with it for us to go to the station because Bobby [a reference to Robert Mackedon, a mutual acquaintance of the defendant and Murphy] had told me that he had warrants out for me. I said, \u2018Before-I get picked up, let\u2019s go to the station now.\u2019\u201d The prosecutor, in final argument, said: \u201c[The defendant] was so concerned about being on probation, and yet he states . . . that he did not go to the police. He says he knew that he was going to get in trouble, but did he ever go to the police station to straighten it out. No. He was arrested nine days later by his own testimony. Did he ever go to the police? He was so concerned because he was innocent and he wanted to straighten it out, but he never went to the police. The police had to come and get him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">A prosecutor\u2019s closing argument which invites a jury to draw an adverse inference from a defendant\u2019s failure to deny his guilt is improper. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haas, </em>373 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Mass. 545, 559 (1977). <em>Commonwealth v. Cobb, </em>374 Mass. 514, 520-521 (1978). <em>Commownealth v. Mosby, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 5-9 (1980). See <em>Commonwealth v. Sazama, </em>339 Mass. 154, 157-158 (1959). Assuming that the prosecutor intended such an invitation, rather than a comment on the implausibility of the defendant\u2019s testimony, the case here is substantially less egregious than <em>Commonwealth v. Haas, supra, </em>in which the prosecutor\u2019s comments were not about the evidence, but simply invited the jury to draw an adverse inference from Haas failure to deny his guilt, something the defendant in that case had not testified about and was, of course, not bound to do. Moreover, the defense in <em>Haas </em>sought curative instructions, and they were denied. No curative instructions were requested in the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">This case does not present a prosecutor\u2019s argument based upon facts not in evidence or on a misstatement of the evidence. Commonwealth <em>v. Shelley, </em>374 Mass. <em>at 470. Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 941 (1979). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mosby, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. at 5. Since the defendant had introduced into the case (presumably so that the jury would infer his innocence) his readiness to go to the police \u201cto straighten it out,\u201d the prosecutor\u2019s reference to that testimony in closing was proper and consistent with the state of the evidence. <em>Commonwealth v. Thurber, </em>383 Mass. 328, 334-335 (1981). Even if we view it in more damaging light, i.e., as a generalized comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to protest innocence, we doubt, reading the prosecutor\u2019s closing as a whole, that the passage complained of caused the closing argument to be unfairly prejudicial. <em>Commonwealth v. Ferreira, </em>381 Mass. 306, 316-317 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">2. <em>Claimed error in the charge to the jury. </em>In the course of his charge, the judge said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe there is any serious question as to the fact that there might have been a robbery although that is for you to say whether there was a robbery or not. You people have to make a determination as to whether there was a robbery . ...\u201d The judge did not say unequivocably that a robbery had occurred; he said one <em>might </em>have, and that comment was immediately followed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>with a correct instruction that whether there had been a robbery was for the jury to decide. The instruction, fairly read, does not amount to an instruction to the jury as to what inferences they were to draw. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sneed, </em>376 Mass. 867, 870 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Borges, 2 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 869, 869-870 (1974); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cote, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 365, 369-370 (1977), which illustrate a judge\u2019s usurpation of the fact-finding function of a jury. More significant, no objection was made to the judge\u2019s instructions, and the defendant\u2019s case was argued on the theory that a robbery had, in fact, occurred, but that the defendant was mistakenly implicated. In context and in its entirety, the charge was not misleading. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McInerney, </em>373 Mass. 136, 149 (1977); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>378 Mass. 217, 238 n.17 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">3. <em>Limitation on cross-examination. </em>Defense counsel, on cross-examination of Murphy, who was the Commonwealth\u2019s principal witness, put the following question: \u201cAny reason why [Mackedon, a scheduled defense witness and, as noted, a mutual friend of Murphy and the defendant] would get on that stand and testify that he was at your house Saturday morning? Would he be telling a lie?\u201d The judge excluded the question with the comment, \u201cLet\u2019s wait until [Mackedon] takes the stand and we hear his testimony.\u201d The question, therefore, was not excluded but postponed, should Mackedon\u2019s testimony make it apt. In any event, the question was scarcely an effective probe for Murphy\u2019s bias (its purported purpose); rather it dealt with the motives of a witness who had yet to appear. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ahearn, </em>370 Mass. 283, 287 (1976) (reasonable cross-examination for the purpose of showing bias and prejudice of a witness is a matter of right). See <em>Gynan </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 721, 724 (1980) (trial judge has abundant discretion in setting boundaries of cross-examination). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hicks, </em>377 Mass. 1, 8 (1979) (right to cross-examine not necessarily infringed by limitation of questioning where the information sought to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>be elicited has already been aired). Defense counsel had already asked questions which served the purpose of establishing Mackedon\u2019s lack of motive to testify falsely.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
