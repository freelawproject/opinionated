(Chomerics), appeals from a judgment of the Superior Court dismissing an action brought against Ehrreich, its former employee, and Ercon, Inc. (Ercon), a corporation in which Ehrreich is now a principal. The defendants appeal from the dismissal of their counterclaim. The complaint alleged misappropriation of trade secrets and confidential information relating to electrically-conductive plastics and gaskets made therefrom; the counterclaims were for malicious prosecution and unfair competition. The case was tried before a master (facts final),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> who concluded that the allegedly misappropriated information was not protectible as trade secrets but that some of the items of the information, though \u201cthey do not rise to the status of trade secrets,\u201d were protectible as what the master characterized as \u201cconfidential information.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b24-8\">The trial judge, after hearing, struck \u201cthe master\u2019s conclusion as to the protectibility of the plaintiff\u2019s information as confidential data [because it was] not supported by the subsidiary facts in the report. ...\u201d He also sustained objections to various portions of the master\u2019s report \u201cso far as they are directed to the face of the report and challenge the implied ultimate finding that the information was protectible.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b25-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>Our examination of the master\u2019s report likewise convinces us that, in context, the references to \u201cconfidential information,\u201d \u201cconfidential know-how,\u201d and similar expressions to which the trial judge alludes, are merely conclusions of law that certain matters are protectible. <em>Dynamics Research Corp. </em>v. <em>Analytic Sciences Corp., </em>9 Mass.

The defendants argue that they are entitled to recommittal of the report in connection with their counterclaim for malicious prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">1. <em>Facts in the master\u2019s report. </em>We summarize the background facts from the master\u2019s report: Chomerics was founded and organized in 1961 by a small group of engineers and scientists, including Ehrreich, who became its director of research, vice president and a member of its board of directors. It engaged in developing and perfecting electrically-conductive plastic materials for the electronics and other industries; plastics were rendered electrically-conductive by metal particles embedded in a plastic matrix. Chomerics obtained a patent on gasketing material using silver particles which did not fall below 10% by volume. Chomerics\u2019 effort in this field was pioneered largely through Ehrreich\u2019s inventions and research from 1961 until he left Chomerics\u2019 employ. As the master found, \u201che was responsible for the research program at Chomerics and was personally actively involved in all of the inventions and discoveries made at Chomerics concerning conductive plastics . . . .\u201d The master further found that the effort in conductive plastics \u201cwas peculiarly his [Ehrreich\u2019s] almost private domain at Chomerics,\u201d and that even at the trial, many years later, he \u201cshowed himself ... to have a very detailed memory of all phases of the work . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">Ehrreich, as employee, signed an employment agreement with Chomerics, as employer, which included, under the heading \u201cInventions and Confidential Technical Information,\u201d a provision (par. 6[a]) giving Chomerics exclusive rights in \u201call inventions and improvements made or conceived . . . while in the employment of the Employer . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>and also those made or conceived within one year after the termination of his [Ehrreich\u2019s] employment if <em>resulting from or suggested by said </em>employment\u201d (emphasis supplied). It also contained a two-year noncompetition provision.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The clause of the contract (par. 6[c]) which Chomerics claims was violated provides that the employee will not \u201cat any time disclose or use any trade secret, formula, process, method of manufacture or any confidential record, data or information of the Employer or any subsidiary (whether developed by the Employee or not) . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">In 1965, Ehrreich left Chomerics; and in 1967, after the expiration of his two-year noncompetition agreement, he and one Reti founded and became the principals of Ercon, a corporation the purpose of which was research and consulting to develop items for licensing. Their early endeavors were in the field of conductive plastics and were directed to obtaining gaskets with a minimal silver content. They succeeded in developing a product containing less than 10% silver in contrast to the 10% minimum achieved by Chomerics. Their gaskets also contained considerably greater compressibility than earlier products. The inventions embodying these features and the method of achieving them were patented by Ehrreich and Reti, who assigned the patent to Ercon. Ercon licensed Technical Wire Products, Inc. (Technical),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to use the patent and furnished it with further technical information. Technical thereupon marketed a gasket containing those features under the name CONSIL.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">The plaintiff claims that various \u201cconcepts,\u201d found by the master to be \u201cphrases describing ideas\u201d which (with one exception) \u201ccan be at least genetically read on CONSIL,\u201d were misappropriated by the defendants. The issue as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>posed by the plaintiff is whether these concepts<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> are protectible as either trade secrets or confidential information.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">2. <em>Protectibility of the information. </em>Whether information is protectible \u201cin each case depends on the conduct of the parties and the nature of the information.\u201d <em>Jet Spray Cooler, Inc. </em>v. <em>Crampton, </em>361 Mass. 835, 840 (1972) <em>(Jet Spray I). See Jet Spray Cooler, Inc. </em>v. <em>Crampton, </em>377 Mass. 159, 168 (1979) <em>(Jet Spray II). </em>In the context of the employer-employee relationship those two factors are interrelated.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We therefore look both to the nature of what Ehrreich acquired and the circumstances under which he acquired it.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">To begin with, it cannot be said that this is \u201cinformation acquired from another.\u201d <em>Jet Spray II, </em>377 Mass. at 165. Compare <em>Junker </em>v. <em>Plummer, </em>320 Mass. 76, 78-80 (1946), and <em>Jet Spray I, </em>361 Mass. at 840-844, with <em>Wexler </em>v. <em>Greenberg, </em>399 Pa. 569, 572 n.1, 575-576, 577-578 (1960), and <em>Amoco Prod. Co. </em>v. <em>Lindley, </em>609 P.2d 733, 745 (Okla. 1980). See also 2 Callman, Unfair Competition, Trademarks and Monopolies \u00a7 54.2(a), at 420 (2d ed. 1965). The master found that this area of research was Ehrreich\u2019s \u201calmost private domain at Chomerics\u201d and that at the time of trial he had a \u201cvery detailed memory of all phases of the work.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>The issue is then whether Ehrreich was guilty of reprehensible conduct (Restatement of Torts \u00a7 757, Comment b [1939]) in using the knowledge with which he left Chomerics or whether that use was the exercise of his \u201cright to use [his] general knowledge, experience, memory and skill.\u201d <em>J.T. Healy &amp; Son </em>v. <em>James A. Murphy &amp; Son, </em>357 Mass. 728, 740 (1970), quoted in <em>Dynamics Research Corp. </em>v. <em>Analytic Sciences Corp., </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. at 267.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 396, Comment b (1958). <em>Reed, Roberts Assoc., Inc. </em>v. <em>Strauman, </em>40N.Y.2d 303, 309 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">With respect to the nature of the information as described in the master\u2019s report, it belies the master\u2019s conclusion of law that there was \u201ca clear crossing of [the] line\u201d and a taking of protectible information. The master\u2019s report shows that while Ehrreich was at Chomerics the concepts were mere possibilities (\u201cvague mental conceptions . . . .\u201d <em>Lam-son </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>159 Mass. 557, 565-566 [1893]) which might result in a more economical gasket containing less than 10 % silver. The master\u2019s report characterizes them as \u201claboratory indications of possibly useful results . . . .\u201d Rut it is clear that these possibilities, in Ehrreich\u2019s exclusive area of research, were conceived by him and it was he who experimented on the basis of those possibilities, which did not go beyond (as put by Professor Alfred North Whitehead in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>somewhat different context) the \u201cstate of imaginative muddled suspense which precedes successful inductive generalisation.\u201d Whitehead, Science and the Modern World 8 (Pelican Mentor ed. 1948). The experiments, however, were unsuccessful; they \u201cdid not result in any commercial products of plaintiff through the time of Ehrreich\u2019s employment by Chomerics.\u201d Indeed, the experiments were regarded as valueless by Chomerics.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The master found that there was no \u201cconvincing proof that (1) plaintiff, during Ehrreich\u2019s employment at Chomerics, ever regarded or treated the concept [s] (even though in locked-up notebooks[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>]) as of any trade value whatsoever or that plaintiff ever regarded these preliminary laboratory experiments as proving anything of real technical or trade value; (2) the [plaintiff] fail[ed] to overcome the strong presumption that plaintiff did not so regard the same [as shown] by the lack of follow-up of the experiments, the lack of expenditure of effort or funds thereon, the failure to attempt to make a commercial grade product from the same or to consider such a possibility or even the marketing of any such product; and (3) [there was a] complete absence in the record of convincing evidence that plaintiff regarded [these] not only as valuable to its own business, but of any value to potential competitors.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Thus when Ehrreich left Chomerics he took with him nothing but possibilities and goals which had hitherto proved impossible to bring to fruition. That he had worked on these possibilities and goals<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> for Chomerics or that they occurred to him while at Chomerics does not make them (aside from misconduct, <em>USM Corp. </em>v. <em>Marson Fastener Corp., </em>379 Mass. 90, 104 [1979], which is not present here<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>) any the less a part of his experience and development <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>as a scientist which he was entitled to use, as put by the master, \u201cto design around the 10% silver limitation of Chomerics patent protection. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In this respect, this case is much like <em>Vendo Co. </em>v. <em>Stoner, </em>105 Ill. App. 2d 261 (1969), where the defendants, after leaving the plaintiffs employ, had produced a vending machine containing features which the plaintiff had been attempting to develop. In ruling that no trade secrets were involved, the court said, \u201cIf Vendo had discovered the <em>means </em>of achieving its goal, we might well have had a different view as to whether Vendo had a trade secret. . . . We know of no authority for the proposition that an ultimate goal or purpose, as distinguished from the means of achieving it, can be classified as a trade secret\u201d (emphasis original). <em>Id. </em>at 278. <em>Gabriel Co. </em>v. <em>Talley Indus., </em>137 U.S.P.Q. 630, 633 (BNA) (D. Ariz. 1963) (protection only for a \u201cperfected product or process\u201d). <em>Packard Instr. Co. </em>v. <em>Reich, </em>89 Ill. App. 3d 908, 916 (1980) (protection only for \u201cparticularized plans and processes\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">Nor does the employment contract help the plaintiff. In the circumstances, here, where all the parties regarded the information as of no value, it can hardly be said that the contract alerted the defendant Ehrreich to a duty to keep the information secret. Compare <em>USM Corp. </em>v. <em>Marson Fastener Corp., </em>379 Mass. at 99, and material cited. Moreover, fair dealing between the employer and employee negates such a duty in this case and makes par. 6(c) of the contract imposing such an obligation unenforceable as to these con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>cepts. <em>Dynamics Research Corp. </em>v. <em>Analytic Sciences Corp., </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. at 277-278.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Further, as the trial judge pointed out, the \u201cconfidential information\u201d referred to in par. 6(c) of the contract means \u201cdeveloped\u201d information, something more than the achievement of \u201ca preliminary indication.\u201d Such protection as there may be for \u201claboratory indications of possibly useful results\u201d is found not in par. 6(c) but in 6(a), with which it must be read <em>(Ucello </em>v. <em>Cosentino, </em>354 Mass. 48, 51 [1968]; <em>Avant, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tech Ridge, Inc., </em>4 Mass. App. Ct. 568, 574 [1976]), and which grants Chomerics the right to \u201call inventions and improvements made [by Ehrreich] . . . within one year after the termination of his employment <em>if resulting from or suggested by said employment\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). Thus, as the trial judge concluded, \u201c[t]he reference in subparagraph (c) to \u2018any trade secret, formula, process or any confidential record\u2019 . . . must, in our judgment, be taken to mean information that has gone beyond the mere \u2018laboratory indications of possible useful results . . . .\u2019\u201d The type of information for which Chomerics here seeks protection is \u201cmore properly the subject matter of a covenant not to compete\u201d <em>(Cudahy Co. </em>v. <em>American Labs., Inc., </em>313 F.Supp. 1339, 1345 [D. Neb. 1970]) which the contract provided and with which Ehrreich complied. <em>Koehring Co. </em>v. <em>E.D. Etnyre &amp; Co., </em>254 F.Supp. at 339, 340. See <em>Textile Rubber &amp; Chem. Co. </em>v. <em>Shook, </em>243 Ga. 587, 591-592 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">3. <em>The defendants\u2019 counterclaim. </em>This requires no extended discussion. The master found that \u201c[t]he elements of malicious prosecution have not in any sense been shown.\u201d The defendants\u2019 argument that they ultimately prevailed (compare <em>Cloon </em>v. <em>Gerry, </em>13 Gray 201, 202 [1859]) is of no help to them since nothing in the master\u2019s report or elsewhere in the record negates the plaintiff\u2019s \u201creasonable belief in the possibility that the claim [might have been] held valid.\u201d <em>Hubbard </em>v. <em>Beatty &amp; Hyde, Inc., </em>343 Mass. 258 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>261 (1961). Prosser, Torts \u00a7 120, at 854 (4th ed. 1971).

There is no reference to those statutes in the record \u2014 not even in the amended complaint filed in 1972, after the statutes had become effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-10\">We do not in any way intimate that these statutes change the ambit of trade secret protection in a civil action. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 470, 473 (1979); see also <em>Matter of a Civil Investigative Demand Addressed to Yankee Milk, Inc., </em>372 Mass. 353, 359-360 (1977). We find it difficult to believe that these statutes, read together with the definition of trade secrets in G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 30(4) , were meant to change the common law of trade secrets to permit damages where nothing of value has been taken or an injunction to protect valueless information contrary to traditional and long-settled equity principles. See Schneider &amp; Halstrom, Trade Secret Protection in Massachusetts, 56 Mass.L.Q. 239, 259-260 (1971).
