They arrived and left the scene of the crime, during daylight, in a silver Buick convertible automobile with the top down. It is hardly surprising that the police were able to catch the defendants within minutes of the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">1. <em>Lawfulness of the Automobile Search.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b570-11\"><em>As </em>a threshold issue, the defendants appeal from the refusal of a Superior Court judge to suppress a brown suede handbag which the police had found in the passenger compartment of the car. We summarize the findings which the judge made on the suppression motion, supplemented with undisputed details which appear in the transcript of the suppression proceedings. The defendants, young women, drove into a self-service filling station on Lexington Street in Waltham. The driver (at trial it developed this was DiMatteo) emerged and pumped gas. When she finished, the passenger (Donlon) went to the cashier\u2019s booth, placed a brown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>suede pocketbook on the counter, withdrew a gun from it, and ordered the cashier to give her \u201call the money.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A bulletin about the robbery was broadcast over the police radio promptly upon receipt of a complaint from the cashier who had been held up. That message described the suspects, their singular car, the direction in which they had headed, the brown suede purse, the handgun, and the amount of money stolen. Police officers in the first cruiser to spot the Buick convertible brought the defendants to a stop, approached them with their service revolvers drawn, and ordered the women out of their car. The officers separated the defendants, advised them of their rights and placed them under arrest. Meanwhile, a third officer, Lyons, arrived in another cruiser and looked into the open passenger compartment of the defendants\u2019 car. He found an empty gun holster on the car seat and the brown suede pocketbook on the floor below the front passenger seat. The snaps of the bag were open and Lyons saw in it a gun and eighty-three dollars in cash. Lyons also noted that the bag was suggestively heavy.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">No one challenges the legitimacy of the initial stop of the defendants\u2019 car; there was every reason to suspect the defendants of unlawful design. G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 98. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ling, </em>370 Mass. 238, 240-241 (1976). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferrioli, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 489, 491 (1980). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ellis, ante </em>476 (1981). It is also self evident that the police officers, in view of the radio bulletin, had probable cause to arrest the defendants and did, indeed, place them under arrest. Passing the point that in an open convertible the telltale brown handbag was in plain view, the officers, who had made a lawful arrest, had probable cause to believe that a search incident to that arrest would yield the fruits and the instrumentalities (the cash and the gun), as well as other evidence (the brown bag), of the crimes for which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>arrest had been made. G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 1, as amended by St. 1974, \u00a7 508.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dickerson, </em>372 Mass. 783, 786, 792 (1977). Compare the somewhat broader search power incident to an arrest countenanced by decisions of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Chimel </em>v. <em>California, </em>395 U.S. 752, 763 (1969); <em>New York </em>v. <em>Belton, </em>453 U.S. 454, 460-462 (1981). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>376 Mass. 349, 357-358 &amp; n. 7 (1978). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>366 Mass. 402, 408-410 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">But, the defendants argue, the handbag itself should not have been the subject of a warrantless search because the purse enjoyed a status akin to luggage. Searches of closed opaque containers in automobiles, subject to certain exceptions, were proscribed by <em>Arkansas </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>442 U.S. 753, 764-765 (1979). See also the recently decided case of <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>California, </em>453 U.S. 420 (1981), applying the <em>Sanders </em>rule to closed containers other than luggage. The reason for that rule is that persons have an expectation of privacy in closed containers and that, unless driven to do otherwise by exigent circumstances, the police should secure a search warrant before rummaging through a private container. In few possessions, the defendants contend, is there a greater expectation of privacy than a woman\u2019s purse.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">It is a line of argument that suffers from exposure to the facts in the case. The motion judge found that the handbag was open when Officer Lyons picked it up from the car floor and that he could see inside it. There is evidence in the record to support this finding, and we do not disturb it. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moon, </em>380 Mass. 751, 755-756 (1980). We have examined the bag and it is of the tote <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>bag variety, loosely constructed and without any narrowing at the neck. A person holding the bag will see into it unless making a conscious effort not to; we do not ask police officers to so avert their eyes from potentially incriminating evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ling, </em>370 Mass. at 241-242; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Corridori, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 469, 476-477 (1981). In addition to what one might see, it was possible, owing to the soft and thin material of the handbag, to feel a gun inside it. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>366 Mass. at 410.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Above all, it is well to bear in mind that the police had been alerted to look for a brown suede bag in which there was likely to be a gun. When Donlon, in sight of the gas station cashier, used the handbag as a carrying case for the gun she surrendered her rights of privacy in the handbag, and the defendants\u2019 protestations about the sanctity of a woman\u2019s pocketbook take on a tone of false piety.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">2. <em>Selection of the Jury.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">During the selection of the jury the defendants made a peremptory challenge of the only black juror on the venire.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> To this the Commonwealth objected on the ground that, except for her race, the juror\u2019s background (e.g., age, occupation) was consistent with other jurors to whom the defense had signified no objection. Therefore, the Commonwealth contended, the defendants\u2019 challenge must have been impermissibly used to exclude the prospective juror by reason of her membership in a particular group in the community. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soares, </em>377 Mass. 461, 486, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 881 (1979). A colloquy among counsel and the judge followed as to whether the <em>Soares </em>principle should be applied in the circumstances. When it became apparent that the judge was going to disallow the challenge because it appeared to be racially motivated, counsel for Donlon offered another reason: the juror was a widow. It was not lost on the judge that widowhood was a tenuous in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>dicator of bias in connection with the crime of armed robbery of a gas station. He expressed skepticism. Defense counsel shifted ground again, evincing concern about the way the juror \u201clooks at the defendant.\u201d Acknowledging that the reasons offered were credible ones, the judge nonetheless found they were \u201cinsufficient\u201d and denied the challenge. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">We take as the starting point for our analysis the principle already adverted to, viz., that it is a misuse of a peremptory challenge \u201cto eliminate jurors solely because of their membership in discrete groups.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Allen, 379 Mass. 564, 576 (1980). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>384 Mass. 247, 253 (1981). But the peremptory challenge retains effectiveness to remove from a panel jurors whose particular relationship to the case at bar \u201craises the spectre of individual bias.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soares, </em>377 Mass. at 485. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allen, supra. </em>For this reason peremptory challenges are presumptively valid. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soares, supra </em>at 489. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>379 Mass. 297, 301 (1979). But that presumption may be rebutted by a pattern of challenges of pot\u00e9ntial jurors of a discrete group and the likelihood that their exclusion is sought to purge the jury of a particular group. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soares, supra </em>at 489-490. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, supra. </em>Sorting out whether a permissible or impermissible reason underlies a peremptory challenge is the function of the trial judge, and we do not substitute our judgment for his if there is support for it on the record. <em>Id. Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>384 Mass. at 255-256.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Adequate basis for the judge\u2019s findings of improper exclusionary purpose appears in the record before us. The defendants are white, the prosecutor is black, and the juror in question, it will be recalled, was the only black person on the venire. When the Commonwealth protested the challenge, the response offered by the defense was largely that the <em>Soares </em>line of cases ought not to apply. The judge was correct in taking the position that the Commonwealth, as well as the defendant, was entitled to a jury which was not artificially stripped of members of a particular racial or eth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>nic group. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soares, supra </em>at 488, 489-490 &amp; n.35. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Little, </em>384 Mass. 262, 265 (1981). It was open to the trial judge to find, based upon the timing and manner of the reasons subsequently offered for the challenge, that those were not genuine. Widowhood, in the circumstances, had no significance and, while the way the juror \u201clooks at the defendant\u201d falls in the smirk category of justifications referred to in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 847 (1980), the judge could find in the instant case that the reason stated was not the real one.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">There is lacking from the case \u201ca pattern of conduct.\u201d While such a pattern is an earmark of improper use of peremptory challenges, we are not prepared to say it is an essential ingredient. If exclusion of a discrete population group from a jury for no better reason than membership in such group violates art. 12 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution, the dismissal of the only member of the banished group is as repugnant to the Declaration of Rights as the dismissal of all but one member of the target group. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>382 Mass. 189, 195-196 (1981). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>378 Mass. 392, 407 n.17 (1979), where the only black person among fifty potential jurors was challenged by the prosecution. The propriety of the challenge was upheld, not because of the want of a pattern, but because the record did not contradict the trial judge\u2019s finding that \u201cI have no facts nor evidence to suggest that he [the prosecutor] is making any purposeful challenge based upon race or sex.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here the record discloses circumstances sufficient to support an inference that the contested challenge was exercised with intent to exclude a juror on the basis of her belonging to a particular race. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>382 Mass. at 194-196; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 288, 292-295 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">3. <em>The Instructions to the Jury.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">DiMatteo, the driver of the car, claims that, in instructing the jury, the judge misstated the elements of the offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>of carrying a firearm under her control in a vehicle without a license to carry firearms. G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(a). According to this defendant, the flaw is that the judge did not inform the jury that the government was required to prove that the weapon was under her control. Only the most tortured dissection of the judge\u2019s charge could support DiMatteo\u2019s position. The judge said in defining control that it required \u201c[kjnowledge, ability to reduce to manual subjugation or dominion, and some conditional intent.\u201d Later he spoke of \u201ccontrol in a motor vehicle, as concerns Miss DiMatteo\u201d and that the jury must find beyond a reasonable doubt that \u201cMiss DiMatteo had control of the firearm in the vehicle.\u201d The instruction was consistent with the offense as described in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Albano, </em>373 Mass. 132, 133-135 (1977), <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 296, 299 (1977), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 583, 584 (1981). No confusion could have resulted from the judge\u2019s remark that \u201ccontrol\u201d was like \u201cpossession.\u201d Possession does imply \u201ccontrol and power.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harvard, </em>356 Mass. 452, 458 (1969); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Deagle, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 563, 567-568 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">After beginning their deliberation, the jury asked for further instruction on the difference between unlawful possession and unlawfully carrying a firearm. We have no quarrel with the judge\u2019s response and, in any event, the question could only have applied to the defendant Donlon, who made no objection to the written answer which the judge sent to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">4. <em>Required Finding of Not Guilty.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">DiMatteo, who had pumped gas and then returned to her car, moved for a required finding of not guilty on the charges of armed robbery, unlawful carrying of a firearm and unlawful possession of a firearm. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>370 Mass. 147, 150 [1976]), we find sufficient evidence to permit rational minds to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendants were engaged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>in a joint enterprise to commit an armed robbery. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whitehead, </em>379 Mass. 640, 653-654 (1980). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chinn, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 714, 716-717 (1978). DiMatteo drove away without paying for the gas. There was an empty gun holster in the middle of the front seat of the car DiMatteo was driving. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 218, 225 (1975). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>357 Mass. 149, 152 (1970). Similarly, there was sufficient evidence from which the jury might infer that the gun was under DiMatteo\u2019s control. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Albano, </em>373 Mass. at 134; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Deagle, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. at 567-568.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Although the defendants have not raised the point, we note that the sentences imposed under G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(a) (carrying or control in a motor vehicle), and under G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129C (possession), are duplicative because the elements of the former include those of the latter. Only the sentence imposed for the more serious crime is valid. <em>Kuklis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>361 Mass. 302, 306-309 (1972). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grasso, </em>375 Mass. 138, 140 (1978), in which the court noted duplicative sentences but did not disturb them because they were concurrent. But see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>382 Mass. 387, 396 (1981), which discusses adverse collateral consequences of duplicitous convictions and concludes that, even where the sentences are concurrent, the conviction and sentence on the lesser included offense should be vacated. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coburn, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 781, 783 (1977); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hanger, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 407, 408-409 (1978), S.C. 377 Mass. 503 (1979). Accordingly, the judgments on the complaints of unlawful possession are reversed, the verdicts on those complaints are set aside, and the complaints are dismissed. The judgments on all the other complaints are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b570-12\">G.
