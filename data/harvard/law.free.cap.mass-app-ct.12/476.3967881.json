Van Deusen </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b498-12\"><em>Robert M.

See G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32. A complaint charging him with possession was placed on file, without objection, and hence is not before us. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hoffer, </em>375 Mass. 369, 370 n.1 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-14\">The defendant claims that the stop of his automobile and the warrantless search of the pocket of a jacket seized from the floor of that automobile violated his Fourth Amendment rights. On the record before us it appears that the judge erred in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the contraband, as the stop of the defendant\u2019s car was not based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>reasonable suspicion that a crime had been committed, or was about to be committed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>366 Mass. 402, 405 (1974); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferrara, </em>376 Mass. 502, 504 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bacon, </em>381 Mass. 642, 643-644 (1980). See also <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>443 U.S. 47, 52-53 (1979); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Almeida, </em>373 Mass. 266, 270 (1977). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tisserand, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 383, 384-385 (1977); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moschella, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 1021, 1022 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The only information known to the police officer prior to his stop of the automobile and \u201cseizure\u201d of its occupants was that (1) three persons<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> had been conversing through the window of a car in a parking lot, (2) the person standing outside the automobile passed what the officer believed to be money into the automobile, and (3) something was returned to this person from inside the automobile. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Riggins, </em>366 Mass. 81, 86-87 (1974), and cases cited; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stinson, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">From the evidence, we conclude that the stop of the defendant\u2019s automobile was based solely on the officer\u2019s \u201chunch\u201d that he had observed the sale of drugs. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, supra </em>at 406. See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Price, </em>599 F.2d 494, 500 n.7 (2d Cir. 1979). There was no evidence to color the transaction. The officer had no information about the contents of the vehicle, contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferrara, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 818 (1980); nor was there independent information, such as a tip, that a crime was being committed, contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cantalupo, </em>380 Mass. 173, 175-176 (1980), and cases cited; <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>407 U.S. 143, 147 (1972). There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>had been no report of a recent crime in that area, contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Riggins, supra </em>at 83-84; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ling, </em>370 Mass. 238, 239 (1976); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 944, 945 (1978). Nor was there flight by the defendant, contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cavanaugh, </em>366 Mass. 277, 280-281 (1974), or even a rapid departure from the area, contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Battle, </em>365 Mass. 472, 474 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Moreover, no additional information was gained by the officer upon following the car, contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra </em>at 946; no traffic violation was committed, contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hawkes, </em>362 Mass. 786, 787 (1973); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 343, 344 (1975), nor was any suspicious activity by either occupant observed prior to the stop, contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>366 Mass. 394, 400 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">If the motion to suppress had been allowed the Commonwealth\u2019s case as presented would have been lacking in essential proof. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty must now be allowed. See e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, supra </em>at 410-411.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">\n<em>Verdict set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b499-7\"> Deciding as we do that the search was invalid in its inception, we do not find it necessary to reach the question whether \u201cthe scope of the search was justified by the circumstances.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>366 Mass. 402, 405 (1974). See <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 19 (1968). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferrara, </em>376 Mass. 502, 504 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b499-8\"> Although the officer knew the defendant prior to this incident, it is unclear from the transcript whether, prior to the stop, he was aware that the defendant was the operator of the car.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
