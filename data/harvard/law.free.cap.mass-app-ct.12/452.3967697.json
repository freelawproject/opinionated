The Boston Housing Court affirmed the orders of the board. We affirm the judgments of the Housing Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">Sargent-T owne Estates is an apartment complex in Brighton which consists of eighty-eight small buildings containing four units each. In August and September, 1976, the Boston building department issued citations which notified the landlord that the main common entry doors of all buildings were not equipped to \u201cclose and lock automatically,\u201d in violation of G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 3R.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On October 8, 1976, the landlord appealed these citations to the State Building Code Appeals Board (Appeals Board) on the ground that G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 3R, did not apply to these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>buildings because they were constructed before its effective date. However, this appeal was withdrawn on November 12, 1976, for reasons not stated in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">On November 24, 1976, the board ordered a general adjustment increasing maximum rents for all controlled units, and on December 16, 1976, the board promulgated Regulation 11 to implement that order. \u201cRegulation 11\u201d provided that the adjustment would be effective January 1, 1977 (\u00a7 12[D]), but that landlords would hold in escrow the amount of rents attributable to the increase until February 28, 1977 (\u00a7 3[C]). It further provided that the adjustment would be \u201csubject to the . . . condition\u201d that \u201c[a]s of January 1, 1977, the building . . . shall comply with all laws governing conditions of habitability\u201d (\u00a7 5[A][3]), and that, if this condition were not met, \u201cthe landlord shall not be entitled\u201d to the adjustment (\u00a7 5[B][1]) and that the board could order the landlord to refund to tenants any increase already collected (\u00a7\u00a7 5[B][2], 6[A][l][b]).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">On January 18, 1977, tenants of Sargent-Towne Estates filed an affidavit opposing the adjustment, see \u00a7 6(A) (1) (a), on the ground that the buildings were in violation of G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 3R. After several hearings on the matter, the board\u2019s hearing officer found that there were no locks on the main common entry doors of any of the buildings, and that the Boston building department had determined those conditions to be in violation of G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 3R. On June 23, 1977, the board ruled that the buildings were not in compliance with all laws governing habitability, as required by Regulation 11, \u00a7 5(A)(3). Since the adjustment had been conditioned on such compliance, the board ordered the increase rescinded as to all units until such time as the landlord remedied the violations and obtained a certificate of compliance under \u00a7 9 of Regulation 11. In addition, the board ordered the landlord to refund to tenants the amounts held in escrow for the increase. At the request of the landlord, however, the board stayed its orders pending a decision by the Appeals Board on a renewed appeal which the landlord had filed on May 17, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>The Appeals Board held a public hearing on the issues raised by the landlord and thereafter obtained an opinion from the Attorney General regarding the applicability of G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 3R. On February 15, 1978, the Appeals Board adopted that opinion and ruled that the statute applies to all buildings containing the requisite number of apartments, including those constructed prior to its effective date. The Appeals Board also ruled that the statute does not require electric striker mechanisms on main common entry doors but requires only that such doors close and lock automatically.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, due to difficulties presented by the \u201cunique configuration\u201d of these buildings, the Appeals Board granted a waiver of this requirement, as permitted by the statute, on the condition that the landlord install specified alternative systems which the Appeals Board found adequate to protect the tenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Following this decision, the landlord requested the board to vacate its prior order denying the general adjustment. After hearing, the board\u2019s hearing officer found that the landlord had installed neither locks nor any of the systems required as a condition of the Appeal Board\u2019s waiver. The hearing officer also construed the waiver to be prospective only. On March 23,1978, the board confirmed its order denying the rent increase and dissolved its prior stay of that order, thus requiring the landlord to refund the amounts already paid into escrow for the increase. The board ordered that rents be paid at the levels existing prior to the general adjustment until the landlord installed the systems required by the waiver and obtained a certificate of compliance from the board. It appears, however, that the landlord ultimately chose not to install those systems and installed locks with electric striker mechanisms instead. On June 22, 1978, after hearing and inspection, the board issued a certificate of compliance on these buildings and granted the general adjustment, effective July 1, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>On review in the Housing Court, the landlord challenged the board\u2019s denial of the adjustment for the period January I, 1977, to July 1, 1978.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The tenants moved for summary judgment, and the board supported that motion. All three parties submitted documents and memoranda of law in support of their positions, but none of the parties submitted affidavits as permitted by Mass.R.Civ.P. 56(a), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). Treating the motion as presenting only issues of law, the court granted summary judgment and affirmed the board\u2019s orders. The landlord then took this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">1. The landlord\u2019s principal argument in the trial court was that G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 3R, is not a law \u201cgoverning conditions of habitability\u201d within the meaning of Regulation 11, \u00a7 5(A)(3). In support of this argument, the landlord first points out that the statute was not incorporated in the State Sanitary Code on January 1, 1977, the operative date of the regulation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 3R, had at that time long been incorporated in the State Building Code,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that is sufficient to bring it within the scope of the implied warranty of habitability.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">Recent opinions of the Supreme Judicial Court have made clear that the warranty includes, as a minimum, not only the requirements of the Sanitary Code but also those of the Building Code. <em>Crowell </em>v. <em>McCaffrey, </em>377 Mass. 443, 451 (1979). <em>Berman &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Jefferson, </em>379 Mass. 196, 201 n.9 (1979). See also <em>Boston Housing Authy. </em>v. <em>Hemingway, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>363 Mass. 184, 207-208, 210, 218 (1973) (Quirico, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). We therefore conclude that G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 3R, is a law \u201cgoverning conditions of habitability,\u201d at least in so far as it is incorporated in the State Building Code.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The landlord\u2019s next argument is based on the Housing Court\u2019s finding that \u201cwhile the apartments were not rendered uninhabitable, certainly habitability was in fact affected.\u201d The landlord suggests that since the absence of the locks required by G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 3R, did not render the apartments uninhabitable, the statute is not a law \u201cgoverning conditions of habitability.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">\u201cHabitability\u201d is a term of art, and an apartment need not be literally uninhabitable to be in violation of the implied warranty. The revised Sanitary Code, see note 5 <em>supra, </em>draws a distinction between a condition, which makes a unit \u201cunfit for human habitation\u201d (defined as a condition justifying condemnation), 105 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 410.022 (1978), and a condition which \u201cmay endanger or materially impair the health or safety and wellbeing of an occupant\u201d (defined as a condition which may expose those interests to harm), 105 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 410.023 (1978). The latter condition is sufficient to violate the warranty of habitability. <em>Boston Housing Authy. </em>v. <em>Hemingway, supra </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>at 200 n.15 (proof that \u201cCode violations exist which \u2018may endanger or materially impair . . .\u2019 would constitute evidence of a material breach . . .\u201d). See also <em>id. </em>at 200 n.16. An apartment need not be totally uninhabitable before the implied warranty is violated. See <em>id. </em>at 202 (material breach may result in either \u201cpartial or complete\u201d abatement of rent); <em>McKenna </em>v. <em>Begin, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 304, 310-311 (1977) (adopting rule of damages based on percentage impairment of use). Thus, it is properly said that \u201c[a] dwelling afflicted with a substantial Sanitary Code violation is not habitable,\u201d in the sense that it is not in compliance with the warranty, <em>Berman &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Jefferson, supra </em>at 201-202, even though the breach is not so severe as to abate the rent to zero, see <em>McKenna </em>v. <em>Begin, supra </em>at 313 (Brown, J., concurring), or force the tenant to vacate, see <em>Boston Homing Authy. </em>v. <em>Hemingway, supra </em>at 199-200.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Likewise, a statute which fixes minimum requirements for residential premises may have a direct and significant bearing on habitability even though a violation of the statute does not render the premises totally uninhabitable. Here, the Housing Court found that \u201ccertainly habitability was in fact affected\u201d by the violations of G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 3R.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We cannot say that this finding is clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Mass.R.Civ.P. 52(a), 365 Mass. 816 (1974). <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Boston Homing Authy., </em>379 Mass. 703, 705 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>2. The landlord\u2019s principal argument in this court is that the board lacked authority under the prevailing enabling statutes, St. 1969, c. 797, as amended by St. 1970, c. 863,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to condition the general adjustment on compliance with \u201call laws governing conditions of habitability.\u201d The landlord also makes the related argument that the board lacked authority to deny the entire amount of the adjustment because such denial conflicts with the statutory requirement that landlords receive a \u201cfair net operating income\u201d from controlled units. St. 1970, c. 863, \u00a7 2. The defendants maintain, however, that the landlord never raised these contentions below. The record shows that the defendants are correct. In particular, we find no mention of these arguments either in the board\u2019s summary of its proceedings or in the summary of issues set out in the Housing Court\u2019s opinion. The landlord may not raise these issues on appeal where he failed to raise them in the trial court, see <em>Milton </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., </em>365 Mass. 368, 379 (1974); <em>Royal Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Blakely, </em>372 Mass. 86, 87-88 (1977); <em>Drury </em>v. <em>Abdallah, </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 865, 866-867 (1980), or before the board, <em>Niles </em>v. <em>Boston Rent Control Admr., </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 135, 151 (1978); <em>Whitehall Co., Ltd. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Commn., </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 538, 542-543 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Nevertheless, the landlord contends that those issues are \u201cin substance the same\u201d as those raised below (\u201calbeit through expanded and somewhat differently formulated arguments\u201d) and points to four isolated phrases in the amended complaint as support for this contention. However, even if we construed the amended complaint as raising the issues now argued, the landlord not only failed to pursue those arguments but, in fact, took a contrary position in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>memorandum in opposition to summary judgment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Moreover, the Housing Court specifically noted, in passing, that the \u201c[p]laintiff does not in fact contest the validity of Regulation 11.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Ordinarily, the conclusion we reach above would end our analysis. We note, however, that the issues raised here present only questions of law, contrast <em>Milton </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., supra; </em>they have been briefed and argued by all parties, and they implicate the rights of numerous landlords and tenants beyond this case. See <em>Royal lndem. Co. </em>v. <em>Blakely, supra. </em>For those reasons, and because the result we reach is not changed by our analysis, we discuss for future guidance the landlord\u2019s arguments that the board lacks authority to condition a general adjustment on compliance with laws governing habitability.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">A. Rent control in Boston is currently authorized by St. 1969, c. 797, as amended by St. 1970, c. 863.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The 1969 statute was unusually brief and broadly authorized the city to \u201ccreate a rent board and empower it to establish as the maximum rent[s] . . . such . . . amount[s] as may be necessary to remove hardships or correct inequities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">Section 2 of the 1970 statute inserted language which specified that the city \u201cmay authorize the board <em>by regulation </em>to make such general adjustments in such maximum rents\u201d (emphasis inserted) as may be necessary for the same purposes. Section 2 also provided that in making general adjustments the board \u201cshall observe the principle of maintaining maximum rents ... at levels which will yield to landlords a fair net operating income,\u201d which was to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>determined by giving \u201cdue consideration ... to the following, among other relevant factors: ... (5) substantial deterioration of the housing accommodations, other than ordinary wear and tear, or failure to perform ordinary repair, replacement or maintenance.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The scope of the authority of such special enabling acts is limited to \u201conly those powers which are expressly conferred by statute or necessarily implied from those expressly conferred . . . .\u201d <em>Church </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>370 Mass. 598, 601 (1976). However, where the exercise of a particular power is, in fact, necessary to carry out the purposes expressed in the statute, general principles of agency authority establish that a \u201cregulation may be authorized even where it cannot be traced to specific statutory language.\u201d <em>Grocery Manufacturers of America, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>379 Mass. 70, 75 (1979), and cases cited. See <em>Town Taxi, Inc. </em>v. <em>Police Commr. of Boston, </em>377 Mass. 576, 581 (1979) (holding that commissioner\u2019s broad statutory authority to \u201cfix maximum and minimum rates\u201d for taxi industry includes power to adopt order reducing fares for elderly and handicapped). It is further established that where, as here, an agency is vested with \u201cbroad authority\u201d to effectuate the purposes of an act, the agency may do so by all means which are \u201creasonably related\u201d to those purposes. See <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Board of Registration &amp; Discipline in Medicine, </em>378 Mass. 519, 524-525 (1979), and cases cited; <em>Grocery Manufacturers of America, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, supra </em>at 75-76 (collecting the cases). Moreover, the cases involving special rent control acts show that municipalities do possess regulatory powers of some dimension beyond those which are specifically enumerated. See <em>Church </em>v. <em>Boston, supra </em>at 601-602 (power to decontrol units entirely when vacated); <em>Grace </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>379 Mass. 43, 49-52 (1979) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>(power to bar all condominium developers from obtaining certificates of eviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">The considerations set out in factor (5), quoted <em>supra, </em>are clearly relevant to habitability, the subject of Regulation 11, \u00a7 5(A)(3). The landlord argues, however, that factor (5) applies only to a \u201cdeterioration\u201d of the premises from its previous condition, or to a lack of \u201crepair, replacement or maintenance\u201d regarding existing facilities. Thus, the argument continues, factor (5) does not apply to a \u201cfailure to install fixtures\u201d which had never previously been provided, and Regulation 11, \u00a7 5(A) (3), therefore exceeds the scope of factor (5) to the extent that such devices would be required to comply with \u201call laws governing conditions of habitability-\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">We have no difficulty in determining that the board had authority under factor (5) to promulgate Regulation 11, \u00a7 5(A) (3), requiring compliance with laws governing conditions of habitability. Although we find no Massachusetts cases which guide us in our construction of the criteria set out in factor (5), cf. <em>Sherman </em>v. <em>Rent Control Bd. of Brookline, </em>367 Mass. 1, 6 n.5 (1975), our conclusion that the board had authority derived from factor (5) to promulgate a regulation linking rents to repairs is amply supported by authority from the World War II period of rent control.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Section 2 of the present Boston statute is based on the prior Statewide enabling act, St. 1953, c. 434, \u00a7 5(a), which was derived in turn from the Federal Housing and Rent Act of 1949, c. 42, \u00a7 203(b), 63 Stat. 18 (1949). As relevant here, the provisions of these three sections are \u201csubstantially identical,\u201d see <em>Marshal House, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rent Control Bd. of Brookline, </em>358 Mass. 686, 705 (1971), including the five factors used to determine fair net operating income. The language of factors (4) and (5) had first appeared in regulations promulgated under two earlier Federal statutes enacted in 1942 and 1947, respectively.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>Where an amendment actually incorporates into a statute the precise language of a regulation which sets out the administrative construction of the statute, that enactment constitutes an express ratification of that construction. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Leslie Salt Co., </em>350 U.S. 383, 396-397 (1956); <em>Red Lion Bdcst. Co. </em>v. <em>Federal Communications Commn., </em>395 U.S. 367, 380-382 (1969); <em>Trans World Airlines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hardison, </em>432 U.S. 63, 76 n.11 (1977). It was thus the opinion of Congress that a regulation tying rent levels to habitability (i.e., \u201crepair . . . and maintenance\u201d) was within the authorizing language of the Federal act. Given this, we think it significant that the language enacted by the Massachusetts Legislature in the Boston statute is virtually identical to that of the Federal act. Cf. <em>Prudential Ins. Co. of America </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>369 Mass. 542, 546 (1976).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Following the expiration of the Federal act, Massachusetts continued to control rents under St. 1953, c. 434. Although one section of that statute was held constitutional, <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Recr. Gen., </em>331 Mass. 501, 509 (1954), we find no case directly on point in construing the section relevant here, \u00a7 <em>5(a). </em>Cf. <em>Nayor </em>v. <em>Rent Bd. of Brookline, </em>334 Mass. 132, 133-134 (1956) (involving formula which evaluated all five factors and permitted standard<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>ized percentage increases \u201caccording to the services given a tenant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Recently, however, the exercise of regulatory power under a rent control statute has been upheld on a different basis. In <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>383 Mass. 152, 158 (1981), the Supreme Judicial Court reaffirmed that \u201c\u2018a grant of an express power carries with it all unexpressed, incidental powers necessary to carry it into effect.\u2019 3 C. Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 64.02 (4th ed. 1974).\u201d Pursuant to such implied powers, it was held that the city of Cambridge had authority under its enabling statute, St. 1976, c. 36, to regulate the removal of rental units from the housing market, including removals for condominium conversion. \u201cThe power to control rents ... is not so illusory that it does not comprehend the right and responsibility of preventing removals from its reach\u201d where the rate of conversion would otherwise transform it into \u201cthe power to control nothing.\u201d <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>383 Mass. at 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Under reasoning of the <em>Flynn </em>case, we think that the present statute, which contains an express policy favoring \u201crepair, replacement or maintenance\u201d of rental units, must be construed as giving Boston at least the general authority to link a rent increase with habitability, since that power is necessary to preserve the <em>quality </em>of its rental housing stock. New Jersey has specifically approved a rent control law which includes such a regulation. In <em>Orange Taxpayers Council, Inc. </em>v. <em>Orange, </em>169 N.J. Super. 288 (1979), the Appellate Division upheld a municipal ordinance which required \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with city and State housing codes as a condition of periodic increases in rent. \u201cThe coupling of certain rental increases with . . . the basic habitability of the rental unit is . . . reasonable .... Rent control would be self-defeating were landlords permitted to reduce maintenance expenditures and allow buildings to deteriorate because their profits have been regulated downward.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 303. The State Supreme Court affirmed. <em>Orange Taxpayers Council, Inc. </em>v. <em>Orange, </em>83 N.J. 246 (1980). That court held that the inclusion of the habit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>ability requirement was within the city\u2019s general statutory authority to act for the public \u201csafety\u201d because that authority goes \u201cbeyond mere regulation of price,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 257, and because the maintenance of habitable conditions is reasonably related to the purposes of a rent control ordinance, <em>id. </em>at 258 n.14. \u201cNo one would applaud the wisdom of lawmakers who by controlling the price of rental housing but not its quality, insured that their constituents could live in affordable dwellings that are unsafe, unsanitary and harmful to health.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 257.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The reasoning set forth above strikes us as sound. The fact that the Legislature included in the Boston statute a policy favoring maintenance of housing conditions suggests that it also shared these concerns. Cf. <em>Berman &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Jefferson, supra </em>at 198-199 n.4 (noting \u201clegislative judgment\u201d that tenant\u2019s duty to pay rent is \u201cbound up with\u201d landlord\u2019s duty to maintain premises, as manifested by enactment of G. L. c. 239, \u00a7 8A). We therefore hold that it is necessarily implied that the board has at least the general authority to tie a rent increase to compliance with laws governing habitability. Contrast <em>Babson </em>v. <em>Boston Rent Control Admr., </em>371 Mass. 404, 405 (1976) (regulation unauthorized where plainly in conflict with unambiguous statutory definition). Otherwise, the rent control power granted by the statute could ultimately be transformed, in the language of <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>Cambridge, supra, </em>into \u201cthe power to control nothing\u201d of a quality worth controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">B. The landlord next argues that the board lacked authority to promulgate \u00a7 5(A) (3) of Regulation 11 in so far as the denial of the entire amount of a general adjustment conflicts with the landlord\u2019s statutory right to receive a fair net operating income. See <em>Zussman </em>v. <em>Rent Control Bd. of Brookline, </em>371 Mass. 632, 638-640 (1976), and cases cited; <em>Niles </em>v. <em>Boston Rent Control Admr., </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. at 141-148. This argument suggests that the amount of any denial should be determined by the extent to which the use of a unit is impaired by violations of the implied warranty. See <em>McKenna </em>v. <em>Begin, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. at 310-311.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>The landlord does not suggest, however, that the amount of the increase which the board actually granted (although conditionally) was insufficient to constitute a fair net operating income. Nor does the landlord contend that the board, in fixing that amount, erred in failing to consider any of the factors set out in the statute. Rather, the landlord\u2019s objection is to the emphasis which \u00a7 5(A) (3) of Regulation 11 places on factor (5). The short answer to this objection, however, is that the \u201cstatute provides no formula for ascribing relative weights to these factors,\u201d and \u201csubstantial discretion is left with [the board] in deciding . . . what rent adjustments are to be allowed,\u201d <em>Sherman </em>v. <em>Rent Control Bd. of Brookline, </em>367 Mass. at 8, so long as it exercises \u201cinformed judgment\u201d in its consideration, see <em>id. </em>at 10; <em>World Wide Realty </em>v. <em>Boston Rent Control Admr., </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 327, 332 (1979).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Accordingly, we do not think it unreasonable for the board to have concluded that it may be necessary to deny the entire amount of a rent increase to ensure compliance with the habitability requirement.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>While the views embodied in a regulation do not bind us where its very authority is in issue, see <em>Niles </em>v. <em>Boston Rent Control Admr., </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. at 149, such an administrative judgment is entitled to weight, particularly where the legislative policy is only broadly set out in the statute. See <em>Consolidated Cigar Corp. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>372 Mass. 844, 850 (1977); <em>Amherst-Pelham Regional Sch. Comm. </em>v. <em>Department of Educ., </em>376 Mass. 480, 491-492 (1978). Further, it is generally the rule that a properly promulgated regulation is accorded \u201call rational presumptions in favor of [its] validity ...\u201d under the statute, <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Board of Registration &amp; Discipline in Medicine, </em>378 Mass. at 525, quoting from <em>Consolidated Cigar Corp. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, supra </em>at 855, and this rule also applies under special enabling statutes, see <em>Grace </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>379 Mass. at 49-50 (town by-law presumed valid).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">In addition, we do not think that \u00a7 5(A) (3), abrogated the landlord\u2019s right to a fair net operating income. Rather, it merely delayed the commencement of the adjustment, in effect leaving it up to the landlord to determine when it would begin. Analytically, the situation here is not unlike that presented in <em>Grace </em>v. <em>Brookline, supra. </em>There it was held that the town\u2019s denial of certificates of eviction to all condominium developers furthered the statutory purpose of preserving the supply of rental units by \u201cretarding\u201d conver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>sion to condominiums, but also \u201cfairly accommodate[d] the interests of building owners\u201d in so far as it did not \u201cpreclude condominium conversion altogether.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51. Likewise here, the board has not precluded the landlord from \u201cany possibility\u201d of receiving a fair net operating income. See <em>Orange Taxpayers Council, Inc. </em>v. <em>Orange, </em>83 N.J. at 260. Rather, the landlord could have avoided any delay in the adjustment by remedying the violations for which it was imposed. \u201cSince the notion of a \u2018just and reasonable return\u2019 embraces a landlord\u2019s responsibilities to his tenants as well as his right to receive sufficient income, we perceive no inherent defect in ... [a regulation] that prevents increases in rent for defective premises.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See also <em>Rosen v. Weaver, </em>7 Misc. 2d 576, 578 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">3. The landlord also makes a series of arguments based on what is said to be the reasonableness of its actions here. The landlord first argues that it could not reasonably determine what equipment was required by G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 3R. It is apparently true that on May 10, 1977, the Boston building department reversed its prior position and adopted the view that the statute required electric striker mechanisms. But there is nothing in the record to establish that the landlord had previously made any effort to comply with the statute during the nine months when the building department agreed with the landlord as to its requirements. Nor did the landlord subsequently install even the locks which it believed to be required (and which were ultimately held to be required) during the pendency of its action before the Appeals Board. The fact of the matter is that the landlord was never in compliance with-the statute during the period for which the general adjustment was denied. For that reason, such denial was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">As to the other arguments based on the alleged reasonableness of the landlord\u2019s actions, we conclude that they either lack merit or raise no question of law not already considered above.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">4. Finally, the landlord alleges a number of procedural defects in the board\u2019s proceedings. We think that the ten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>ants\u2019 affidavit in opposition to the adjustment was properly processed under \u00a7 6(A)(1) rather than \u00a7 6(A)(2) of Regulation 11. As to the landlord\u2019s other allegations, we need not deal with them individually, because all of them are without significance in the present circumstances. See <em>Niles </em>v. <em>Boston Rent Control Admr., </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. at 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b475-11\"> General Laws c. 143, \u00a7 3R, inserted by St. 1965, c. 464, \u00a7 1, and as amended through St. 1974, c. 541, \u00a7 13, provides in pertinent part as follows: \u201cAt least one of the doors of the main common entryway into every apartment house having more than three apartments shall be so designed or equipped as to close and lock automatically with a lock, including a lock with an electrically-operated striker mechanism, a self-closing door and associated equipment, and such lock, door or equipment shall be of a type approved by the state building code commission .... provided, however, that the said commission may, in writing, waive . . .

Cir. 1970) (requiring \u201csecure windows and doors\u201d). In addition, several jurisdictions have specifically held that the implied warranty creates an obligation to provide reasonable security against foreseeable criminal activity. See <em>Trentacost v. Brussel, </em>82 N.J. 214, 227-228 (1980) (absence of lock on common entry door, as here, constitutes breach of implied warranty); <em>Kline </em>v. <em>1500 Massachusetts Ave. Apartments Corp., </em>439 F.2d 477, 485-486 (D.C.

We read the emphasis contained in the judge\u2019s language above as indicating a finding that habitability was, in fact, materially affected.
