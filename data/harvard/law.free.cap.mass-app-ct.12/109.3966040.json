L. c. 123A, \u00a7 4, prior to sentencing, as a possible sexually dangerous person. We find no error and affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>1. <em>The motion for directed verdict. </em>The evidence pertinent to this claim may be summarized as follows. On the afternoon of March 6, 1976, the victim, a seventeen year old college student who has been blind from birth, walked from her home to a drug store in Plymouth to make some purchases. She paid for her purchases with a five dollar bill and put three one dollar bills in change in her purse. As she left the store, at about 4:30p.m., a man offered to assist her to another store. Instead of taking her to the store, the man led her to a secluded spot in a wooded park known as the Jenny Grist Mill pond area which she was able to identify from the sound of a waterwheel. The man was identified at trial as the defendant by five witnesses, including one of his relatives, all of whom saw him on the street with the victim about 4:30 p.m. and one of whom testified that she saw the defendant lead the blind girl into the park.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The victim argued with the man as to what was going on. He told her that he wanted to have sex with her and that he had a knife. He led her into the woods repeating what he wanted to do to her sexually. At one point he said he loved her and he attempted to hug her. Eventually, the man threw her to the ground, took her belongings, including her cane, glasses and purse, and had forced intercourse with her. When she resisted, he became violent, choked her and repeatedly hit her in the face. After that he said he would be back to kill her. Altogether she was in his presence for more than an hour. She testified that he talked incessantly during the entire episode. She got up and made her way to a street by listening to the traffic. There, a passing motorist with whom she was acquainted stopped and took her to the police station. She told the police that her assailant wore a denim coat and had long hair and an unshaven face. From the police station she was taken to a hospital for treatment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>She suffered various injuries, was bleeding and had bruises. There was medical evidence that she had just recently had intercourse. On the following morning a police officer examined the scene and found the victim\u2019s cane, glasses and her purse. There were twenty-six cents left in the purse; the currency was missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The defendant argues that the foregoing evidence was insufficient to warrant his conviction of armed robbery because the evidence pertaining to the disappearance of the three one dollar bills is equally consistent with a conclusion that they had fallen from the victim\u2019s purse during the struggle and had been lost in the woods as with a conclusion that they had been taken in a robbery. He also maintains that if a theft occurred, it happened after the rape. As a consequence, he asserts that the theft was not accompanied by the requisite force when the property was taken and that the resulting crime was larceny, not robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">We find no merit to either argument. The above recounted evidence, viewed as it must be in a light most favorable to the Commonwealth <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>359 Mass. 77, 86 [1971]; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>378 Mass. 392, 404 [1979]; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-677 [1979]), would have permitted a rational jury to conclude that the defendant had a continuing intent to rob as well as rape the victim and that he accomplished both purposes. The fact that the victim\u2019s purse, containing at least three one dollar bills, was removed from her possession by force, backed by the defendant\u2019s statement that he had a knife, his subsequent threat to return and kill her, and the discovery at the scene on the following morning of the purse with the currency missing but with the loose coins intact, established a sufficient basis for a jury verdict convicting the defendant of armed robbery. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>360 Mass. 566, 567-568 (1971). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>362 Mass. 83, 90 (1972). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montmeny, </em>360 Mass. 526, 530 (1971). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Novicki, </em>324 Mass. 461, 464 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>2. <em>The motions to suppress. </em>The defendant was arrested by the Taunton police on a warrant about 6:15 p.m. on March 8, 1976. At the Taunton police station, he was advised of his Miranda rights<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and informed of his right to make a telephone call pursuant to G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 33A. The Plymouth police were notified that he was in custody and were advised to pick him up. While at the Taunton police station, the defendant made a telephone call. Shortly after the call was completed, his father appeared at the station and spoke with him. The defendant was not questioned, nor did he volunteer any statements while he was held at the Taunton station.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">About 7:00 p.m. , Sergeant Murphy of the Plymouth police arrived in Taunton, took custody of the defendant, and, prior to transporting him to Plymouth, advised him of his Miranda rights. Upon arriving at the Plymouth police station, Murphy again advised the defendant of his Miranda rights.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He was then booked by Sergeant Budge who warned him a further time of his Miranda rights,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and re-advised him of his right to make a telephone call to speak to friends, arrange for bail or consult a lawyer. Murphy testified that at the completion of the booking procedure, the defendant signed a slip indicating that he had \u201cunderstood\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>the Miranda warnings.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Later that evening, the defendant gave Murphy a tape recorded statement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">On March 8,1976, Sergeant Murphy interviewed the victim at her home. After discussing the incident with her for about twenty minutes, he told her that he was going to play a tape recording and advised her not to say anything until the machine had been shut off. Nothing else was said prior to the tape being played. Upon hearing a brief portion of the cassette, the victim identified the defendant\u2019s voice as that of her assailant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> There was evidence that the victim had, because of her blindness, developed an ability to identify the voices of different persons, and that she could accurately identify the voices of each of thirty or forty college acquaintances promptly after they would greet her.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">The judge concluded in his written memorandum that \u201cthe defendant was fully advised of <em>his </em>rights as required under Miranda . . . , that it [was] proven beyond a reasonable doubt that he understood them and that he exercised a knowing, intelligent and voluntary waiver of his . . . rights when he spoke with Sergeant Murphy on . . . March 8, 1976.\u201d He also found that the statutory requirements of G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 33A, with respect to a telephone call had been met. As to the voice identification, the judge found that the victim\u2019s \u201cmeans of identification by voice was developed to the similar extent that a sighted person is able <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>to make a visual identification.\u201d He concluded that while the voice identification procedure used by the police is \u201cnot to be recommended,\u201d it was not so suggestive as to require the identification\u2019s suppression. In reaching this conclusion, he relied primarily on the evidence of the victim\u2019s aural acuity, together with the facts that she had been in her assailant\u2019s presence for a considerable period of time, in circumstances that would tend to fix the defendant\u2019s voice in her mind, and that she had made an almost immediate identification of the defendant\u2019s voice on the tape recording without any prompting by Sergeant Murphy.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">A. <em>The statement. </em>The defendant contends that he was not properly advised of his Miranda rights because the warnings furnished in Taunton failed to indicate that anything he said could be later used against him, and because the warnings provided by the Plymouth police failed to make it clear that he had the right to consult with and seek the advice of an attorney, separate and apart from having an attorney present during any questioning. Based on these perceived deficiencies, and the fact that the record does not contain a formal waiver, the defendant claims that the Commonwealth failed to establish that he had intelligently and voluntarily relinquished his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">The warnings given in Taunton were deficient, but the shortcomings are of no consequence because no questioning was undertaken, nor statement given, while the defendant was being held there for the Plymouth police. The at least thrice repeated warnings furnished by the Plymouth police complied in all essential respects with the command of Miranda that a suspect \u201cbe warned prior to any questioning that he has the right to remain silent, that anything he says can be used against him in a court of law, that he has the right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for him prior to any questioning if he so desires.\u201d <em>Miranda </em>v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 479 (1966). The rights recited by the Plymouth police are virtually identical to the rights given by the officers and approved by the Supreme Judicial Court, in <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>374 Mass. 203, 204, 205 (1978). Moreover, the police complied with the \u201cbetter practice\u201d of furnishing the defendant with the so called optional \u201cfifth warning\u201d that he could stop any questioning at any time if he so desired. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>364 Mass. 145, 148 n.1 (1973); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fielding, </em>371 Mass. 97, 115 (1976). Undoubtedly, in most cases, the police will supplement the warnings by instructing the suspect of his right to consult with counsel prior to, and during the course of, any questioning. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 226, 229 n.3 (1975), and cases cited. But the omission of that piece of advice will not render an otherwise clear and comprehensible statement of \u201cthe four required Miranda warnings\u201d (374 Mass. at 205) constitutionally defective. The defendant\u2019s argument to the contrary confuses what must be said under Miranda to meet fundamental constitutional requirements, with what the police should do if a suspect chooses to exercise any of his rights. See 384 U.S. at 469-470. We hold that the Miranda requirements were fully satisfied in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">There is also ample support for the judge\u2019s conclusion that the defendant voluntarily waived his rights prior to making the statement.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201c[I]f the record demonstrates that a defendant has been clearly and accurately told of the Miranda rights and that he has affirmatively acknowledged his understanding of those rights, a knowing and intelligent waiver of those rights may be inferred, in circumstances not otherwise casting doubt on voluntary waiver.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra </em>at 230, and cases cited. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roy, 2 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 14, 19-20 (1974). <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 839, 840 (1980). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 915, 916 (1980). Explicit statements that the defendant understood his rights and waived them are not essential. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Valliere, </em>366 Mass. 479, 487 (1974). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>378 Mass. 217, 226 n.7 (1979). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Monteririo, 4 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 349, 351 (1976). See <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>441 U.S. 369, 373 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">In addition to the oft-repeated Miranda warnings (see <em>Procunier </em>v. <em>Atchley, </em>400 U.S. 446, 453 [1971]), the evidence indicates that the defendant was fairly and courteously treated while in custody and during the taking of the statement. There is no evidence that the police engaged in any threats, trickery or deception, nor any evidence that the defendant suffered any disability or impairment of physical or mental functions. It is conceded that the defendant is of average intelligence and there is no suggestion that he was not alert at the time of the questioning. The questioning was not unduly lengthy or prolonged. Cf. <em>Watts </em>v. <em>Indiana, </em>338 U.S. 49, 53 (1949); <em>Clewis </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>386 U.S. 707, 709 (1967). Like the tri\u00e1l judge, we cannot find anything in the record which would show that the statement was involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">B. <em>The voice identification. </em>The defendant maintains that the voice identification procedure amounted to an impermissibly suggestive one-on-one confrontation which violated his right to due process. The scope of due process protection against the admission of evidence derived from pretrial identification procedures is, by now, firmly established constitutional doctrine. Such evidence is not admissible where \u201cthe confrontation conducted . . . was so unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable mistaken identification that [the defendant] was denied due process of law.\u201d <em>Stovall </em>v. <em>Denno, </em>388 U.S. 293, 301-302 (1967). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Venios, </em>378 Mass. 24, 26-27 (1979). In deciding this threshold question, it is necessary to examine the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d surrounding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>the identification alleged to be impermissibly suggestive. <em>Stovall </em>v. <em>Denno, supra </em>at 302. Although this test was enunciated with regard to visual identifications produced by photographic displays and lineups, it is equally applicable to a voice identification. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>367 Mass. 737, 740 (1975), and cases cited. The use of a single taped voice raises suspicion of a constitutional violation, but that factor alone will not constitute sufficient ground for exclusion of the out-of-court identification. <em>Id. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nolin, </em>373 Mass. 45, 51 (1977); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Venios, supra </em>at 29; <em>Nassar </em>v. <em>Vinzant, </em>519 F.2d 798, 801 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 898 (1975). Rather, \u201c[t]he crucial determination ... is whether the identification sought to be admitted in evidence is the product of the witness\u2019 observations at the time of the crime or is instead the product of improper suggestions by the police.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 387, 392 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">We agree with the trial judge that the procedure used here is not one to be recommended as a substitute for obtaining such identifications by an impartially constructed array of voices.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Nevertheless, we are not prepared to say, after careful scrutiny of all the circumstances pertaining to this identification, including its one-on-one feature, that constitutional standards were violated. The judge\u2019s findings, which are amply supported by the underlying evidence, indicate that the victim had developed extraordinary powers of aural perception, and that she listened to her assailant\u2019s voice continuously for a lengthy period of time in circumstances which made her attention inevitably intense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>and which were likely to fix his voice in her mind. The playing of the tape was not corrupted by any \u201cspecial elements of unfairness.\u201d See <em>Russell </em>v. <em>United States, </em>408 F.2d 1280, 1284 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied, 395 U.S. 928 (1969); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barnett, </em>371 Mass. 87, 93 (1976). For example, she was not told that the defendant was in custody. Indeed, the judge found, on the evidence he determined to be more credible, that the police sergeant gave the victim no prompting before or during the playing of the tape (contrast <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Peyton, </em>359 F.2d 199, 201 [4th Cir. 1966]; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moon, </em>380 Mass. 751, 758 [1980]) and the record does not indicate that he otherwise engaged in behavior which might have prejudiced the identification. Contrast <em>Sanchell </em>v. <em>Parratt, </em>530 F.2d 286, 297 (8th Cir. 1976). Moreover, the identification was made (as found by the judge) \u201calmost immediately\u201d after the tape was started. There is no claim that the victim vacillated and arrived at the identification only after the defendant had uttered incriminating remarks.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Importantly, the identification was found by the judge, on competent evidence, to be based \u201csolely upon\u201d the victim\u2019s independent memory of her assailant\u2019s voice as recalled from the impressions made by that voice at the scene of the crimes. Thus it bears sufficient indicia of trustworthiness to satisfy either the reliability test formulated in the <em>Biggers-Brathwaite </em>cases or the independent source standard stated in the <em>Botelho-Venios </em>decisions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The constitutional protections <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>in this area are designed, among other things, to preserve the integrity of the truth seeking process by eliminating, to the extent reasonably possible, convictions based on highly suspect identifications. See <em>Neil </em>v. <em>Biggers, </em>409 U.S. at 198; <em>Foster </em>v. <em>California, </em>394 U.S. 440 (1969); <em>Caver </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>537 F. 2d 1333, 1335 (5th Cir. 1976). Such a risk, in the constitutional sense, was not present here because the victim had not been \u201cmanipulated so that the mental image derived from the identification procedure supplant[ed] that derived from [her] own experience.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pheaster, </em>544 F. 2d 353, 370-371 (9th Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1099 (1977). Thus, we conclude that due process standards were met, and that any infirmities in the challenged identification were properly left for the defense to raise at trial and for the jury to weigh in deliberations. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cincotta, </em>379 Mass. 391, 396-397 (1979), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">3. <em>Use of the identification at trial. </em>We find unavailing the defendant\u2019s contention that, because the victim did not attempt to identify the defendant at trial, evidence of her prior out-of-court identification was not admissible for substantive purposes. A constitutionally proper out-of-court identification is admissible for substantive purposes even if the victim is unable or unwilling to identify the defendant at trial <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Swenson, </em>368 Mass. 268, 272 n.3 [1975]; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>376 Mass. 402, 408-409 [1978]; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vitello, </em>376 Mass. 426, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>458-459 [1978]), and even if no attempt to obtain an identification at trial is made. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, supra </em>at 738-739. See also Rule 801 (d)(1)(c) of the Proposed Massachusetts Rules of Evidence. The defendant\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>Torres </em>on the ground that it involved an out-of-court identification of an actual voice and not a tape-recorded voice is without merit. We see nothing to the contrary in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Repoza, </em>382 Mass. 119 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The defendant also argues that there was no testimony before the jury which established that the voice on the tape played by the sergeant to the victim was that of the defendant. The relevant testimony was as follows. The victim was asked on direct examination if she heard a tape when visited at her home by the police sergeant and if she identified the voices on it. She said that she identified \u201cSergeant Murphy\u2019s and the defendant\u2019s\u201d voices. Upon objection of defense counsel, the prosecutor said \u201c[D]o you mean the man who assaulted you?,\u201d and she said, \u201cYes.\u201d The only other evidence with respect to the tape and the voice identification came from Murphy\u2019s testimony that he had advised the defendant that a tape was being made of a conversation (between him and the defendant), and that this tape might be used in an identification of his voice.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">From this evidence, we think that the jury could have inferred that the voice on the tape was that of the defendant. However, even if the evidence of the voice identification was arguably incompetent, there would be no error where the defendant\u2019s counsel did not move to have the victim\u2019s statements struck after it became apparent that sufficient testimony identifying the voice on the tape with that of the defendant was not forthcoming.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number><em>Dyer, </em>243 Mass. 472, 507 (1922), cert. denied, 262 U.S. 751 (1923); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knight, </em>257 Mass. 421, 424-425 (1926); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Demboski, </em>283 Mass. 315, 320 (1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">4. <em>Other issues. </em>The remaining claims do not require extended discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">(a) Although it would have been preferable to have permitted defense counsel to call Sergeant Budge from Plymouth as his last witness at the suppression hearing, the judge\u2019s failure to do so does not constitute reversible error in view of evidence which warranted a conclusion that the defendant\u2019s telephone rights had been satisfied by the Taunton police.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">(b) No abuse of discretion can be found in the judge\u2019s exemption of Sergeant Murphy from the sequestration order. The judge implicitly found him to be \u201cessential to the management of the case.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Therrien, </em>359 Mass. 500, 508 (1971). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Washburn, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 195, 197 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">(c) The judge acted within his discretion in sentencing the defendant to a penal facility instead of referring him, as requested by defense counsel, for immediate examination and diagnosis by psychiatrists under G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 4, in order to determine whether he was a sexually dangerous person. See <em>Thibodeau </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>366 Mass. 452, 455-456 (1974). Although the defendant was convicted of a sexual crime involving the use of force, and although his background disclosed a history of sexual offenses, the judge could properly have decided that continued imprisonment was the more appropriate disposition, leaving the question of an examination under \u00a7 4 to be resolved, as the judge stated \u201cadministratively.\u201d See <em>Id. </em>at 457. Once he was sentenced further proceedings would be under G. L. c. 123A, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>\u00a7 6. This is particularly so where the defendant was already serving a life sentence. The existence of the statutory option of treatment \u201cdoes not imply . . . that traditional sentencing concerns and alternatives have been preempted by the remedial concerns of this statute. A sentencing judge may consider other factors, such as punishment and deterrence, despite the existence of the sexually dangerous offender provisions.\u201d <em>Thibodeau </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>428 F. Supp. 542, 545 (D. Mass. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b132-11\">A sentence of forty-five to fifty years to the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Walpole was imposed on the rape indictment, and a from and after life sentence on the armed robbery indictment. Both of these sentences were to take effect upon the expiration of a life sentence which the defendant was then serving. The defendant\u2019s convictions on indictments charging assault and battery and kidnapping were filed with his consent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b133-5\"> These witnesses testified to out-of-court identifications of the defendant made from photographic arrays shown to them by the Plymouth police shortly after the incident. These out-of-court identifications were not challenged as suggestive. The witnesses also made in-court identifications of the defendant at the trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b135-6\"> A Taunton police detective testified that he advised the defendant at the time of arrest that he had a right to remain silent, that he did not have to answer any questions unless a lawyer was present, that he could refuse to answer questions, and that if he could not afford a lawyer one would be provided for him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b135-7\"> Murphy testified that this advice consisted of warnings that the defendant had the right to remain silent, that if he agreed to answer any questions anything he said could be used as evidence against him in a court of law, that he had a right to have an attorney present during any and all questioning, that if he agreed to answer questions he could stop the interrogation at anytime, and that in the event he could not afford an attorney and desired counsel, a lawyer would be provided for him without charge before he was asked anything.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b135-8\"> The rights given by Sergeant Budge were described as the same as those given a short time before by Sergeant Murphy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b136-7\"> The portion of the slip which contained the defendant\u2019s signature was not introduced in evidence, nor were the contents of that slip explained.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b136-8\"> The contents of this statement were not introduced at the voir dire on the suppression motions but its substance was introduced at trial. In his statement the defendant admitted that on the day of the incident he had helped the victim to cross the street, because she was blind, that he left her in the vicinity of the food store she wanted to shop at, that he was wearing dungarees and a blue denim jacket, and that although he had shaved that day he had not shaved for about three weeks before.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b136-9\"> The identification procedure was conducted with the use of two tape recorders. While the tape containing the defendant\u2019s voice was played a separate tape recorder was run to transcribe the conversations between the victim and Sergeant Murphy and the material from the defendant\u2019s statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b138-6\"> This conclusion could have been established more easily if the tape recording or a stipulated transcript thereof had been introduced at the voir dire, because prior to taking the statement the officer fully repeated all of the Miranda warnings. This portion of the statement was not introduced, however, at this hearing or at the trial. Although the judge appended a copy of a transcript of the tape recording to his memorandum of decision on the suppression motions, there is no indication that he relied upon it in deciding the waiver issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b140-6\"> As stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marini, </em>375 Mass. 510, 517 (1978): \u201cAt all events, police and prosecutors are warned to take particular pains to avoid suggestive conditions in making arrangements for <em>out-of-court </em>tests where a witness tries to match live voices with his recollections of a voice heard in the usually stressful original setting. One-on-one auditions ought certainly to be avoided . . .; there should be the best approach to a \u2018lineup\u2019 with precautions against directing undue attention to any participant.\u201d <em>Marini </em>also suggests other safeguards and protocol to minimize the risk of suggestiveness on voice identifications.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b141-5\"> The portions of the tape heard by the victim at the voice identification procedure were in large part transcribed by the court reporter as \u201cinaudible.\u201d The victim appears to have made her identification based on a few fragments of the tape which stated (as far as we have them) \u201cI walked down through. . . on the left hand side a . . . it goes . ...\u201d The defendant states in his brief that the victim heard only a \u201cminor portion\u201d of the defendant\u2019s voice. There is no claim that any of the statements upon which the identification was made were inculpatory in nature.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b141-6\"> The references here are to the familiar decisions in <em>Neil </em>v. <em>Biggers, </em>409 U.S. 188 (1972); <em>Manson </em>v. <em>Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. 98 (1977); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Botelho, </em>369 Mass. 860 (1976); and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Venios, supra. </em>We recognize, of course, that the reliability and inde<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>pendent source formulations are usually applied in the context of the admissibility of a proposed in-court identification after an out-of-court identification has been suppressed as unnecessarily suggestive. The victim did not make an in-court identification in this case. The judge made alternative findings under both of the foregoing tests in the event that we should find the voice identification procedure to be impermissibly suggestive. We think that this was a proper mode of analysis in the peculiar circumstances of this case, because a study of the totality of events necessarily implicates, and is intrinsically connected with, this victim\u2019s perceptions of her assailant at the time of the commission of the crimes and her ability to retrieve and apply those impressions. In so deciding, we have given weight to the testimony of the victim\u2019s description (see <em>supra </em>at 111-112 &amp; 114 n.7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b143-7\"> While the judge did not state explicitly that the victim\u2019s testimony was being admitted conditioned on subsequent testimony concerning the tape, such could be implied from the colloquy between him and defense counsel. The judge was not obliged to advise defense counsel that it was his burden to move to have the testimony struck in the event the subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>quent testimony was not introduced. See Annot., 88 A.L.R. 2d 12, 79, \u00a7 10 (1963). It is of special note that defense counsel made effective use of the scantiness of the evidence concerning the voice identification in his closing argument, a fact which suggests that he was content as a matter of purposeful trial strategy to leave that point to the jury\u2019s consideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
