Four alleged attempted extortion from Peter Corbin on separate dates, in late 1979 and early 1980. The others charged possession of a class B controlled substance (cocaine) with intent to distribute, and possession of a class D controlled substance (marihuana). A motion to suppress certain items found in taking an inventory (partly without a warrant) of the contents of a rented automobile was denied after hearing. The cases were tried together in November, 1980. Ellis was found guilty on the charge of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute the same, and on the four charges of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>attempted extortion. He was found not guilty on the charge of possession of marihuana. Ellis has appealed from the convictions and from the denial of a motion for a new trial. There was evidence from which the jury reasonably could have found the circumstances to have been as outlined in the following paragraphs designated (A) to (R).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">(A) In 1979, Peter Corbin needed financing for a dance club in Williamstown to be known as Rollo\u2019s Disco. After negotiations, financing of $40,000 was provided by Ellis for which he was to receive twenty percent of the stock of a corporation to be formed (Rollo\u2019s, Inc.) to operate the club and twenty percent of most payments made by Rollo\u2019s, Inc., to Corbin and certain members of his family. On May 4, 1979, Ellis delivered to Corbin and his attorneys $40,000 in cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">(B) Rollo\u2019s opened on July 1,1979. A manager was hired. Corbin himself worked at Rollo\u2019s part time, as well as in various capacities at another \u201cfamily business,\u201d a restaurant known as The British Maid, across the street from Rollo\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">(C) In August, 1979, Ellis came to Rollo\u2019s and told Cor-bin \u201che was wondering when he would get any money.\u201d Corbin told Ellis that \u201cthe place [Rollo\u2019s] had not yet made anything.\u201d Corbin had received a few wage checks (about $1,000 in all) from Rollo\u2019s, Inc., but was paid principally by The British Maid, which paid \u201ceveryone who . . . worked at Rollo\u2019s . . . until Rollo\u2019s got on its feet.\u201d Ellis continued to tell Corbin of his concern at not receiving any money from Rollo\u2019s. On one occasion Ellis accused Corbin of taking all the money and said that \u201cif it continued, he would really think of cutting . . . [Corbin\u2019s] throat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">(D) In October, Ellis told Corbin that the latter was treating the situation \u201cmuch too lightly\u201d and that he (Ellis) had Boston friends \u201cwho would just love to throw dynamite in the building.\u201d He added that the \u201cBritish Maid would burn real well because it was so old, and if he didn\u2019t get paid, he was going to put . . . [Corbin] out of business.\u201d In October, after a conference with Ellis, Corbin discovered that his truck tires all had been cut. In another conversation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>Ellis told Corbin that he was so annoyed \u201che decided to put some money down on a contract on . . . [Corbin] in Miami\u201d to make Corbin realize that the situation was \u201cserious\u201d so that the latter would \u201ccome up with some money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">(E) About November 14, 1979, Corbin and Ellis met at the office of Corbin\u2019s attorneys. A new agreement was executed by which Corbin then paid Ellis $20,000, and undertook to pay $25,000 more (including $5,000 as a \u201clender\u2019s fee or interest\u201d) to Ellis on or before January 18, 1980, in exchange for a release of all Ellis\u2019s interest in Rollo\u2019s, Inc., and its assets and real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">(F) At some time after signing the new agreement, Ellis told Corbin that he \u201cwas looking at a very short life\u201d and that, if he did not pay Ellis, Ellis was going to make Corbin and his family \u201cincredibly sad\u201d and that Corbin \u201cmight be in the hospital, if . . . lucky, the rest of . . . [his] life.\u201d The $25,000 was not paid by January 18, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">(G) In December, 1979, Corbin had a telephone talk with Ellis, then in Miami, which Corbin \u201ctaped\u201d with a portable tape recorder. The talk contains thinly veiled threats of \u201cvery serious after effects\u201d of any failure by Cor-bin to make further payments. On January 31, 1980, Cor-bin paid Ellis an additional $10,000. Ellis again called Cor-bin by telephone in March, 1980, to ask whether Corbin would have $15,000 for him when he came to Williamstown \u201cwith two associates from Miami.\u201d Corbin replied that he would not. Ellis then said that if Corbin did not have the money he (Ellis) was \u201cgoing to walk out,\u201d leaving Corbin to deal with Ellis\u2019s two associates. A telegram to Corbin from Ellis in Hollywood, Florida, dated March 25, 1980, confirmed that Ellis would \u201cbe arriving before the week-end with Miami associates. Expecting payment in full.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">(H) Ellis left Florida soon after talking with Charles R. Whiteman, a resident of Williamstown, who on March 25, 1980, was at his apartment in Miami Lakes, Florida. White-man had known Ellis for about four years. He had done Ellis various favors and had lent him, interest free, substantial sums of money which had been repaid. They for some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>time had shared a house rented by Whiteman. In any event they arranged to go to Williamstown from Boston together.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> They went to Boston separately and met in Ellis\u2019s room in a Boston hotel. Whiteman told Ellis that he had some drugs to pick up. On the next day in Boston Whiteman obtained on credit a substantial amount of cocaine, worth by White-man\u2019s estimate at least $66,000 \u201con the street\u201d and, appropriately \u201ccut\u201d possibly worth as much as $420,000. Whiteman showed the cocaine to Ellis who said \u201che thought he knew a few people who might\u201d buy it. For this help Ellis was to have cancelled any obligation to repay some money lent to him by Whiteman. Subsequently, Ellis talked, in Whiteman\u2019s presence, with one person about the possibility of selling the cocaine and with at least one other who did not want to become involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">(I) Ellis unsuccessfully tried to rent from the Hertz Company a 1980 Cadillac Seville automobile and asked Whiteman for assistance. Whiteman (in the absence of Ellis) then rented, in his own name, from Hertz a new Cadillac.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">(J) On March 28, Ellis and Whiteman drove the rented automobile to Cambridge and picked up Anthony Owens, a \u201cbig\u201d man about thirty years old, six feet six inches tall.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The cocaine was then in the trunk of the Cadillac where Whiteman had placed it in a zipper bag purchased by him in Florida. With Ellis driving, they proceeded to an inn in North Adams.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">(K) On the trip, Whiteman was sniffing cocaine and let Owens (who was told by Whiteman that it was in the trunk) try some. Whiteman also gave Ellis $4,000 in cash, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>Ellis \u201cwanted to have some money to flash around.\u201d At the hotel, Owens and Whiteman had a drink at the bar. Ellis left them and soon returned to give them \u201ca couple of room keys.\u201d They all then drove to Rollo\u2019s in Williamstown where Ellis expected to receive from Corbin the $15,000 final payment. Ellis had mentioned this earlier in Boston, although Whiteman denied in his testimony that he knew \u201cany threat was to be made to Corbin,\u201d evidence which the jury was not required to believe.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">(L) Corbin had been greatly upset by his telephone talks with Ellis and shortly prior to March 28, had told his attorney about them. The police had been notified and four officers were across the street or in or near Rollo\u2019s Disco on the evening of March 28. About 11:30 p.m. Ellis, Owens, and Whiteman drove up in the Cadillac, with Ellis driving. Ellis parked the automobile under the canopy at the entrance to the disco. They walked inside. The officers waited outside the front entrance. Corbin was tending bar. Owens sat down near the bar talking with Ellis, but looked at Corbin \u201cfor a period of about twenty seconds with a straight eye to eye stare.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">(M) At some stage, Ellis and Whiteman went into the office to use the telephone. Ellis came back alone, found that Corbin was busy, and went outside. There he was arrested by State Trooper Mott after some conversation with a local police officer named Morin. The State police, upon a complaint by Corbin, had obtained a warrant for Ellis\u2019s arrest. Whiteman met two friends as he entered the disco and went with them to another bar from which he returned after about a half hour. Before Whiteman left for the other bar, Ellis had told him that he wanted to keep the Cadillac with him. Thus, Ellis was in possession of the automobile keys.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">(N) After Ellis had been handcuffed, he asked Officer Morin, whom Ellis had known for some time, to remove the Cadillac\u2019s keys from Ellis\u2019s jacket pocket and give them to Whiteman. Ellis made no objection to Officer Morin concerning moving the automobile or to his taking the keys. Later, Officer Morin talked with Whiteman at the Wil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>liamstown police station. Whiteman did not want to have the new Cadillac towed and gave Officer Morin permission to drive it to a garage. Officer Morin then moved the automobile to Grudney\u2019s Garage (owned by the officer), which on occasion was used by the Williamstown police for storage of certain motor vehicles involved in accidents and for inventory searches of vehicles. Owens and Whiteman also were arrested that evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">(O) At the garage Officer Morin and Special Officer Paul Thompson made an inventory of the automobile\u2019s contents which started at the front of the automobile and went back. Underneath the front seat, among other items, were found in a paper bag three vials of mannitol, a substance often used to \u201ccut cocaine,\u201d a mortar and pestle, and a small rubber-type tourniquet, as well as a check book and driver\u2019s license in Ellis\u2019s name. In the glove compartment were registration and other papers from Hertz Rent-a-Car, and traces of a white powder inside the glove compartment door. In the rear seat were found various items of costly photographic equipment, a package of personal papers, and a plastic bag containing a substance. In the pouch back of the front seat was found a smoking pipe with a residue and a steel bowl with white residue. In the automobile trunk was a Samsonite brown case with a zipper more than half closed. In that case, among other items, were two plastic bags containing a white substance. Throughout the automobile were items of clothing and personal effects not now relevant. Various items found were not opened, such as bags containing photographic equipment, a black disc container found in the glove compartment, and the package of personal papers. This search is more fully described below in discussing the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">(P) Following this initial inventory action, Trooper Flaherty of the State Police and Officer Morin obtained a search warrant. They opened the black disc container which was found to contain a white powder and they scraped up some white powder from the creases of the driver\u2019s side of the front seat. All the white powder, tested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>by a State laboratory, was analyzed as cocaine. The residue in the pipe and the contents of the plastic bag lying on the back seat were found to be marihuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">(Q) On April 23, 1980, Ellis called Corbin by telephone and said that Cubans, who apparently had let Whiteman have the cocaine on credit, see par. (H), <em>supra, </em>had been upset by the loss of the cocaine and were \u201cabout to have . . . [Corbin] done up.\u201d Ellis said he alone could save Corbin, if he would \u201ccome up with the other ten grand.\u201d Later, on September 18, 1980, Ellis saw Corbin at a North Adams garage and said that the Cubans were going to wait until after the trial of the case against Ellis and \u201cblow . . . [Cor-bin] away after that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">(R) During trial, Whiteman had negotiations through his counsel with the office of the district attorney. It was disclosed to the jury that Whiteman was to be allowed to plead guilty to a charge of intimidating a witness and had been adjudicated a drug dependent person so that, if certified that he could be aided by treatment, he could be assigned to a treatment center. In any event, Whiteman thereafter gave a long statement to the district attorney and, called by the prosecution, gave testimony at Ellis\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">1. Ellis\u2019s first contention is that he was tried in the Superior Court on unrelated offenses without his written consent in violation of Mass.R.Crim.P. 9,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 378 Mass. 859 (1979). We perceive no such violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>Improper joinder of offenses was not made an issue at trial in any way. No written motion in behalf of Ellis for relief from allegedly prejudicial joinder was filed before trial pursuant to rule 9(d) (2). The issue was first raised (by new counsel) on a motion for a new trial before the judge who had heard the motion to suppress and who had presided at the trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">The trial judge, in rejecting Ellis\u2019s contention, pointed o\u00fct that at trial the Commonwealth had taken the position that Whiteman was the \u201cprincipal possessor of the\u201d cocaine and that Ellis\u2019s involvement \u201cwas only on the basis of a joint venture in that he had . . . [undertaken] to assist in the proposed sale.\u201d The judge expressly found that \u201cthe various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>indictments would have to be proved by substantially the same evidence arising out of the continuous series of acts unbroken in time.\u201d This finding was wholly warranted by the evidence, see pars. (H), (I), (J), and (K) of the statement of facts above, which revealed (a) the close relationship between Ellis and Whiteman over a period of four years, (b) Whiteman\u2019s knowledge that Ellis was trying to collect money from Corbin, (c) Ellis\u2019s willingness to participate with Whiteman in disposing of the cocaine, (d) the joint participation in the drive to Williamstown under the guidance of Ellis, and (e) Ellis\u2019s threatening conversation with Corbin on April 23, 1980, describing the annoyance of unidentified Cubans at the loss of the valuable cocaine which they had entrusted to Whiteman. See par. (Q) of statement of facts, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">The trial judge was warranted in viewing all the offenses with which Ellis was charged as arising out of the same \u201ccourse of criminal conduct.\u201d The judge reasonably could have inferred that this had begun in Miami and ended with the Williamstown arrests on March 28. Much the same evidence was needed to prove each of the charges against Ellis. The case appears within the general scope of pertinent authorities sustaining joint trials without a defendant\u2019s consent or the refusal of a defendant\u2019s motion to sever offenses. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>373 Mass. 676, 690-691 (1977). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cullinan, </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 895 (1980). Severance of offenses is largely a matter in the discretion of the trial judge in the light of the particular facts before him. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jervis, </em>368 Mass. 638 (1975), which (at 645) distinguishes from cases like that before us the decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blow, </em>362 Mass. 196, 200-201 (1972), on the ground that in the <em>Blow case </em>\u201cthere was no single course of conduct in the several offenses charged nor was there any proof of guilt by substantially the same evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>Ellis contends that Mass.R.Grim.P. 9 (see note 3, <em>supra) is </em>more explicit than the comparable Federal rule, Fed.R. Grim.P. 8(a), in that rule 9 requires the consent of the defendant to the joinder for trial of \u201cunrelated\u201d offenses. The definition of \u201crelated\u201d offenses in Massachusetts rule 9(a) (1) is not shown to be materially different in impact from that in the similar Federal rule 8 (a). If the offenses are \u201crelated\u201d within the meaning of the rules, joinder for trial under the Massachusetts rule, as well as under Federal rule 8(a), requires no consent by the defendant. See rule 9, pars, (a) (2) and (a)(3), and (b). It is only where the offenses are \u201cunrelated\u201d within the meaning of the Massachusetts rule that the defendant\u2019s written consent or motion may be necessary. We follow the broad interpretation, in decisions already cited, of the terms in rule 9(a)(1), \u201csame criminal conduct\u201d and \u201ccourse of criminal conduct . . . connected together.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">The provisions of Mass.R.Crim.P. 9(d)(2) require that a defendant, desiring severance as \u201crelief from [alleged] prejudicial joinder\u201d file a written motion \u201cbefore trial\u201d with an exception not here pertinent. There is no showing here that the facts concerning the offenses charged were not known to Ellis\u2019s trial counsel before trial, or of any other reason for relieving Ellis of the obligation to file a written motion before trial. See Reporters\u2019 Notes to Mass.R.Crim.P. 9, Mass. Ann. Laws, Rules of Criminal Procedure at 135 (1979). See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Quinones, </em>516 F.2d at 1312, 8 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00a7 14.02[2], at 14-11 - 14-12 (2d ed. 1981 rev.), and cases cited in 1 Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7\u00a7 221 and 222 (1969 &amp; 1980 Supp.). We perceive nothing in the evidence at trial showing prejudice to Ellis of a character requiring the trial judge to act <em>sua sponte.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>2. Ellis\u2019s second contention is that the trial judge should have allowed the motion to suppress items found in taking an inventory of the Cadillac\u2019s contents. On the motion to suppress, the trial judge made the following findings, among others, upon the evidence at the hearing on the motion: (a) When arrested outside Rollo\u2019s Disco, Ellis \u201ctold the arresting officers that the Cadillac was not his\u201d and asked them \u201cto take the keys from his pocket\u201d and give them to Whiteman, the lessee of the automobile from Hertz, see par. (N) of the statement of facts, <em>supra, </em>(b) The Williams-town police department \u201chad a long standing policy ... to inventory all property taken into custody.\u201d The inventory policy was to protect \u201cthe owner as well as the police officers from any claim for missing . . . property.\u201d (c) White-man indicated that the Cadillac might \u201cbe moved to a nearby garage, provided that it was driven with the garage\u2019s repair registration plates so as not to jeopardize . . . [White-man\u2019s] insurance.\u201d (d) In their initial search, after listing clothing and camera equipment inside the body of the automobile, \u201cthey opened the trunk and saw a partially unzipped leather travel case\u201d inside of which \u201cthey found a Vermont license plate [which had been issued to White-man] and two plastic bags with a white substance which led them to believe the contents were cocaine.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> After finding the drug paraphernalia mentioned in par. (O) of the statement of facts, <em>supra, </em>the officers \u201cconducted a field test on the white substance, determined it to be cocaine,\u201d and applied for a search warrant. On these and related findings, the judge found (a) that because Ellis was \u201cneither owner nor lessee\u201d of the Hertz Cadillac, he had \u201cno standing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>object to the search of the automobile\u201d; (b) that the inventory \u201cwas justified by the fact that expensive camera equipment was ... in plain view\u201d and by the long established Williamstown police practice; and (c) that until the discovery of the narcotics the focus of the investigation was on the alleged extortion and not on narcotics activity. The judge\u2019s findings on the evidence on the motion to suppress are consistent with the evidence at trial summarized above in the statement of facts, pars. (N), (O), and (P).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">We note the following additional considerations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-6\">(a) Ellis was not the owner or lessee of the Cadillac or, so far as appears, of any property found in the automobile\u2019s trunk. He was not shown to have had any interest in such property (except on the theory of possession of the cocaine as a joint venturer). He did not place the cocaine in the trunk, and seems to have treated it as Whiteman\u2019s property. Under the recent cases, he lacked standing to object to the search of the trunk because, in the circumstances, he had no expectation of privacy for the contents of a zipper bag which did not belong to him. See <em>Rakas </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>439 U.S. 128, 148-150 and 150-156 (1978) (Powell, J. concurring); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Salvucci, </em>448 U.S. 83, 86-95 (1980). See also <em>Rawlings v. Kentucky, </em>448 U.S. 98, 104-106 (1980); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Goshorn, </em>628 F.2d 697, 700-701 (1st Cir. 1980).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-8\">(b) The finding that this inventory was of a type called for by the Williamstown police policy was warranted as was the finding that expensive cameras were in plain view on the rear seat of the Cadillac. The evidence on the motion to suppress did not show that any locked piece of luggage was searched before a warrant was obtained. The present somewhat uncertain status of inventories of this type is noted in the margin.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In any event, the zipper bag, if viewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>as luggage, was clearly the property of Whiteman and its contents were primarily his or in his possession. Whiteman does not appear to have placed any limits on the use of the keys to the Cadillac or to have objected in his own behalf to the search at any time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">4. We hold that Ellis in the circumstances had no standing to object to the search of the trunk. A majority of the panel take the view that we need not consider whether this inventory was valid. The author is of opinion that the police conduct, shown by the evidence on the motion to suppress, meets the standards of those decisions (see note 7, supra) permitting such inventories.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">\n<em>Order denying motion for a new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b637-8\"> Ellis was \u201cto receive some money from . . .

These decisions have been affected in some measure, at least with respect to locked luggage and sealed parcels and containers. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chadwick, </em>433 U.S. 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>12-16 (1977); <em>Arkansas </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>442 U.S. 753, 757-766 (1979); <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>California, </em>453 U.S. 420, 423-428 (1981); <em>New York </em>v. <em>Belton, </em>453 U.S. 454, 457-462 (1981). Cf. <em>Harris </em>v. <em>United States, </em>390 U.S. 234, 236 (1968). Most of the Massachusetts decisions are not directed very clearly to situations such as that before us. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>374 Mass. 132, 140-141 (1977); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benoit, </em>382 Mass. 210, 213-214, 219-220 (1981), where (at 219) it is said, of a warrantless search, that if it \u201cis to be recognized as a lawful inventory search, there must be at least a showing that it was conducted for some legitimate police purpose other than a search for evidence.\u201d See, however, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tisserand, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 383, 386-387 (1977). See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dall, </em>608 F.2d 910, 913-915 (1st Cir. 1979); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Markland, </em>635 F.2d 174, 176-177 (2d Cir. 1980).

Until there is clarification of the present somewhat confused state of the decisions, police may be wise to obtain a warrant before taking an inventory, upon a showing that one is reasonable for a legitimate police purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
