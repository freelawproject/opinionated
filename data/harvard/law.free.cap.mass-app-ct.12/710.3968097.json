That decision granted the petition of Joseph F. Wanczyk (defendant) for the removal of a condition imposed on a variance previously granted to him which restricted the duration and transferability of the variance. The Superior Court affirmed the decision of the board. We affirm the judgment of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-14\">The defendant owns twelve acres of land in Hadley. Since 1958, the defendant has used a portion of this land adjacent to Route 47 for the operation of a business which manufac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>tures and sells precast concrete products. In 1961, the town adopted a zoning by-law which prohibited manufacturing in the district where the land is located. Following the adoption of the by-law, however, the defendant was allowed to continue his manufacturing operation as a nonconforming use. See G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 5, as in effect prior to St. 1975, c. 808, \u00a7 3. See now G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Over the next twelve years, the defendant expanded his business substantially, constructing a new building and outfitting it with specialized heavy equipment at a total investment of approximately $170,000. In 1973, the defendant became concerned that the expansion of the business exceeded that permitted for a nonconforming use, and petitioned the board for a variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">On May 18, 1973, the board granted the defendant a variance allowing the expanded use subject, however, to seven specific conditions enumerated in its decision. The condition in issue here (number 6) restricted the variance to Wanczyk\u2019s \u201clifetime\u201d and it prohibited the variance from being \u201ctransferred to anyone else.\u201d The 1973 decision was not appealed, and all parties to this action concede the present validity of the variance and the validity of that condition at the time it was imposed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">In 1976, the defendant petitioned the board to remove condition number 6. Since Hadley had not then adopted G. L. c. 40A, as appearing in St. 1975, c. 808, \u00a7 3 (hereinafter present c. 40A), as permitted by St. 1977, c. 829, \u00a7 4, amending St. 1975, c. 808, \u00a7 7, the decision on this petition was governed by the provisions of G. L. c. 40A, as in effect prior to St. 1975, c. 808, \u00a7 3 (hereinafter former c. 40A). See <em>Casasanta </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Milford, </em>377 Mass. 67, 71-73 &amp; nn. 10, 11 (1979); <em>Shalbey </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Norwood, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 521, 524-527 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>After notice, which the trial court held \u201cproper,\u201d including notice to abutters, the board held a public hearing on the defendant\u2019s petition. See former G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7\u00a7 17-18 (now \u00a7\u00a7 10-11). The board also viewed the defendant\u2019s property and found that the defendant had erected fences, as required by one of the conditions imposed on the 1973 variance, to prevent the manufacturing operation from being visible to abutters or to the public. Based on its view, the board made a general finding that the defendant was, in the words of the trial court, \u201cin substantial compliance with all the conditions imposed\u201d by the 1973 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">On March 15, 1976, the board granted the defendant\u2019s petition to remove condition number 6. In support of its action, the board stated that the termination of the variance on the defendant\u2019s death would cause substantial hardship because it would render his specialized manufacturing equipment useless, or virtually so, thus causing his investment to be lost to his estate. The decision also stated that even if a subsequent board were willing to grant a new variance for this use, the suspension of operations at the defendant\u2019s death would inevitably cause a period of uncertainty and lost income for the defendant\u2019s family, and that such needless hardship should be foreseen and avoided. The board concluded that \u201cthe continuation of all [the] other restrictions provides assurance that there will be no substantial detriment to the public good and that the intent and purpose of the by-law will continue to be met.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">The plaintiff, Huntington, is the owner of land abutting the south side of the defendant\u2019s property. Located on her land is a building known as the Huntington House, which is an historic structure visited by tourists. The plaintiff, who lives in Boston, opposed the 1973 petition for the variance by means of a letter to the board, which was read at the public hearing. The grounds of her opposition do not appear in the record, nor does it appear whether she stated any opposition to the 1976 petition. It does appear, however, that the board\u2019s primary ground of concern in both proceedings was the visibility of the defendant\u2019s operation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>to visitors to the Huntington House and to the public traveling on Route 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Following the board\u2019s decision on the 1976 petition, the plaintiff brought this action against the defendant and the board, alleging that the board exceeded its authority in removing the condition because the requirements for a new variance had not been met. See former G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 15 (see now \u00a7 10). She did not testify at the hearing in the Superior Court. The trial court found for the defendants, holding that each of the three statutory prerequisites had been met. The court also noted, however, that \u201cas a practical matter\u201d the 1976 decision did not really amount to a grant of a new variance, but rather, involved a \u201cmodification of an existing variance which had been in effect for . . . [nearly] three years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">The plaintiff rejects the suggestion that the board\u2019s action constituted merely a \u201cmodification\u201d of the original variance, arguing that the board could properly have removed the condition only upon satisfaction of the requirements for a new variance contained in former G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 15. The plaintiff argues further that it was the defendant\u2019s burden to make such a showing, <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Amherst, </em>383 Mass. 1, 10 (1981), and cases cited, and that the board and the court both erred in ruling that the statutory requirements had been met here, see <em>Raia </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of No. Reading, 4 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 318, 321 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">In our view, it is unnecessary to consider whether the removal of the condition required the same showing necessary for the grant of a new variance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nor is it necessary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>hold that a local zoning board possesses a broad general power to modify substantive conditions attached to an existing variance.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rather, we think that the board\u2019s power to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>remove the condition here is most appropriately analyzed in terms of the nature and effect of the condition itself and in light of the statutory concerns relevant to the grant of a variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">We look first to the statute. Under the former \u00a7 15, the critical factual showing required for a variance was that of unique hardship, i.e., \u201csubstantial hardship\u201d which was created by \u201cconditions especially affecting <em>such parcel or such building </em>but not affecting generally the zoning district in which it is located\u201d (emphasis supplied). The exception made available by this statute was a narrow one. At its root is a concern that the grant of a variance be based only upon circumstances which directly affect the real estate and not upon circumstances which cause personal hardship to the owner. \u201cThe criteria in the act . . . relate to the land, not . . . [to] the applicant.\u201d <em>Dowd </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Dover, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 148, 156 (1977) (special permit case). The decisions cited previously (see note 3, <em>supra) </em>have made this differentiation quite clear by consistently overturning grants of variances predicated only on a showing of personal hardship. The present \u00a7 10 continues this emphasis on the land itself and makes the concept even more restrictive by specifying that the special circumstances justifying the grant of a variance must relate to \u201cthe soil conditions, shape, or topography\u201d of such land or structures.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">In contrast, the condition in issue here bears no relation to any circumstance which affects the underlying real estate. Nor is it aimed at the nature, character, or extent of the use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>permitted of the estate.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Rather, it serves only to limit the duration of the variance itself by tying it to the lifetime and ownership of a particular individual. We view this as inconsistent with the explicit statutory emphasis on the real estate and its use as the basis of the board\u2019s inquiry. In effect, such a condition \u201cinjects criteria not found in the enabling act.\u201d <em>Dowd </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Dover, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. at 156. We further view it as inconsistent with the generally accepted principle that \u201ca variance applies to the land rather than to its current owner, and . . . runs with the land when it is conveyed to [another] person.\u201d 3 Anderson, American Law of Zoning \u00a7 18.64, at 311 &amp; cases cited at n.24 (2d ed. 1977). See 3 Rathkopf, Zoning and Planning \u00a7 38.06[1], at 38-61, and cases cited at nn. 2, 4 and \u00a7 40.02, at 40-2 \u2014 40-3, and cases cited at n.2 (4th ed. 1981); 6 Rohan, Zoning and Land Use Controls \u00a7 43.02[1], and cases cited at n.15 (1981); 5 Williams, American Land Planning Law: Land Use and the Police Power \u00a7 133.02 (1975). See also <em>Dowd </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Dover, supra. </em>Cf. <em>Colonial Acres, Inc. </em>v. <em>North Reading, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 384, 385 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Personal conditions of the sort presented here are held in disfavor in other jurisdictions. See <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Shriver-Allison Co., </em>28 Ohio App. 2d 175, 181-182 (1971); 3 Anderson, American Law of Zoning \u00a7 18.69, at 323-324; Strine, The Use of Conditions in Land Use Control, 67 Dick. L. Rev. 109, 133 (1963); Note, Zoning Amendments and Variances Subject to Conditions, 12 Syracuse L. Rev. 230, 237 (1960). See also <em>Dexter </em>v. <em>Town Bd. of Gates, </em>36 N.Y. 2d 102, 105-106 (1975). As aptly expressed by Chief Justice Kenison in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number><em>Vlahos Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Little Boar\u2019s Head Dist., </em>101 N.H. 460, 463-464 (1958), such restrictions are inappropriate because they \u201cplace the emphasis on the regulation of the person rather than the land, and tend to make [a variance] an ad hominem privilege rather than a decision regulating the use of property.\u201d In the only Massachusetts case which has addressed the question, the court was inclined to the view that such a condition may be invalid when imposed on a variance. See <em>Todd </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Yarmouth, </em>337 Mass. 162, 169 (1958).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">The Legislature has recently made a clear policy judgment rejecting the attachment of such a condition to the grant of a variance. The present \u00a7 10, as appearing in St. 1975, c. 808, \u00a7 3, contains new language which specifically prohibits the imposition of \u201cany condition, safeguards or limitation based upon the continued ownership of the land or structures to which the variance pertains by the applicant, petitioner or any owner.\u201d While this section also includes general language retained from the former \u00a7 15, which allowed the board to impose \u201climitations both of time and of use,\u201d it is not clear to us that this language was ever intended to sanction a condition of the sort presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>here, and the available evidence tends to indicate that it was not. The legislative history of the present G. L. c. 40A, for example, states that the quoted prohibition was inserted in \u00a7 10 for the purpose of eliminating \u201cthe practice of some local boards of appeals to condition the grant of a variance on the continued ownership of property by a particular person,\u201d which practice was deemed \u201cimproper, considering that hardship must be unique to the land or building and not merely to an individual.\u201d 1973 House Doc. No. 6200, at 20. See 1972 House Doc. No. 5009, at 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Despite the parties\u2019 assumption that condition no. 6 was valid under the former \u00a7 15 when imposed, two conclusions now become apparent: (1) the validity of a condition tying the duration of a variance to ownership by a particular person was questionable even under the former statute, in light of the statute\u2019s emphatic focus on the land and its use, and in light of the general disfavor in which such conditions are held; and (2) this condition could not now be imposed under the present \u00a7 10, because of that statute\u2019s express judgment that such conditions are to be prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">To these conclusions we add the evidence at the hearing in the Superior Court which suggests that the board\u2019s decision to impose the condition rested on factors unrelated to the land\u2019s use or the operative criteria in \u00a7 15. That evidence shows that the board\u2019s concerns in 1973 about the visibility of the business had been substantially satisfied in 1976 by the defendant\u2019s erection of fences in compliance with one of the conditions imposed,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and that the defendant had substantially complied with the other conditions of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>variance, all of which the board continued in effect.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, there was testimony by the chairman of the board that condition no. 6 was originally imposed as an additional safeguard to ensure that the manufacturing use would not be continued unless the defendant brought a new petition to remove it, which would necessitate a new public hearing at which the defendant\u2019s compliance with the other restrictions would be scrutinized. This testimony suggests that the condition was not intended to be appurtenant to the land, and that the board, in fact, contemplated future relief from its effect if the other restrictions, which did bear directly on the land, were satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">In view of the evidence and for the reasons stated, it makes little sense in this case to force the owner and the board on to the horns of a dilemma. On the one hand, the owner should not be compelled to undertake the virtually impossible burden of proving the \u00a7 15 criteria for a new variance before he can obtain redress. On the other hand, the board should not be forced, if it is inclined to give relief, to bend the theory underlying a variance in the search for a proper solution. We hold that the condition was essentially a personal one which the board could subsequently delete in the exercise of its sound \u201cadministrative discretion\u201d (see <em>Pendergast </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Barnstable, </em>331 Mass. 555, 558-559 [1954]; cf. <em>Ranney </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Nantucket, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 112, 115-116 [1981]), and we turn to the question whether the board\u2019s exercise of its discretion was justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">In the exercise of its discretion, the board could properly take into account the change effected with respect to such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>conditions by the present \u00a7 10, and the fact that the other conditions, which ran with the land to bind subsequent owners, would continue to regulate the scope of the use. The board could properly consider the defendant\u2019s testimony that if the condition were not removed, the business would be lost as a livelihood to his family and the specialized equipment would have to be sold at auction \u201cfor 10% of its value,\u201d and his further unrebutted testimony that, although the work building might be used for another purpose, the property is unsuitable for farming or for building lots and that the loss of income caused by the operation of the condition might require his family to sell the land following his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">As to the plaintiff\u2019s interest, it may be that she chose not to appeal the original grant of the variance because she felt she could endure a use limited to the defendant\u2019s lifetime or his ownership of the property. Although the existence of such an expectation would not preclude the board from removing the condition, it would, if demonstrated, be entitled to consideration. See and contrast <em>Day </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Review of Cranston, </em>92 R.I. 136, 139-140 (1961) (quashing decision of board which removed a condition, on ground that abutters had withdrawn objections to the original grant of the variance in reliance on such restriction). Cf. <em>Shuman </em>v. <em>Aldermen of Newton, </em>361 Mass. 758, 764 (1972). See generally Note, Indiana Variance Proceedings and the Application of Res Judicata, 46 Ind. L.J. 286, 289-290 (1971). Here, however, it has not been shown that the board failed to consider any legitimate expectations which the plaintiff might have harbored, or that it accorded her interest little or no weight. Beyond that point, the record does not specify the grounds of the plaintiff\u2019s opposition to the 1973 petition, and the plaintiff did not appear before the board or the court in 1976 to express her reliance on the condition, or to articulate what harm she might incur from its removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">Finally, the board found, on the evidence before it, that the use as restricted by the remaining conditions could con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>tinue beyond Wanczyk\u2019s ownership of the land without any \u201csubstantial detriment to the public good.\u201d See former \u00a7 15 (now \u00a7 10). That finding, added to the other considerations previously discussed, indicates that removal of the condition is in conformity with the goal that the zoning law be applied to further, not hinder, the stabilization of land use. See <em>Kane </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Medford, </em>273 Mass. 97, 104 (1930); <em>Yaro </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Newburyport, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 587, 589-590 (1980). We conclude that the board\u2019s decision to delete the condition was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b733-8\"> Wanczyk does not argue that the board lacked power to impose the condition under former G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 15, as amended through St. 1958, c. 381.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b735-8\"> The plaintiff is correct that if the board\u2019s action were deemed to require such a showing, it could not be sustained here. First, the board failed to make one of the \u201cspecific findings necessary\u201d to justify the granting of a variance under former \u00a7 15. <em>Wolfson </em>v. <em>Sun Oil Co., </em>357 Mass. 87, 89 (1970). See <em>McNeely </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Boston, </em>358 Mass. 94, 103 (1970). Cf. present G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 10. Although the board determined that the condition constituted a \u201chardship\u201d to the defendant, it failed to find any facts which demonstrate that such hardship derived from circumstances \u201cespecially affecting\u201d the land or buildings, as re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>quired by former \u00a7 15, as amended through St. 1958, c. 381. The absence of such factual findings would leave the board\u2019s decision \u201cinvalid on its face.\u201d <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Amherst, supra </em>at 10. Likewise, the trial court\u2019s failure to find such facts would render its holding of special hardship \u201ca bare recital of the statutory conditions\u201d which is insufficient to support the granting of a variance. <em>Id., </em>quoting from <em>McNeely </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Boston, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">Second, unique hardship could not properly be found on the facts presented here. See, e.g., <em>Bicknell Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Boston, </em>330 Mass. 676, 680 (1953); <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Amherst, supra </em>at 11; <em>Raia v. Board of Appeals of No. Reading, </em>4 Mass. App. Ct. at 321-322; <em>Planning Bd. of Watertown </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Watertown, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 833 (1977). Contrast <em>Dion </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Waltham, 344 </em>Mass. 547, 551-552 (1962); <em>Sherman </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Worcester, </em>354 Mass. 133, 135-136 (1968). The hardship in this case does not arise out of any circumstance \u201cespecially affecting\u201d the land or buildings, as construed in the decisions above, but rather arises out of circumstances which are \u201cpersonal\u201d to the defendant. <em>Barnhart </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Scituate, </em>343 Mass. 455, 458 (1962). <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>Appleton Nursing Home, Inc., </em>355 Mass. 217, 221 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b736-8\"> The former \u00a7 15 is silent with respect to the modification of a variance. Although the former \u00a7 19 contained a reference to the board\u2019s power to \u201cmodify any order or decision,\u201d this court has expressed the opinion that such language was \u201cintended to apply to a case in which a board of appeals acts as an appellate tribunal in an appeal taken under [former] G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7\u00a7 13 and 15(1).\u201d <em>Potter </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Mansfield, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 89, 95 n.8 (1973). Cf. Smith v. <em>Building Commr. of Brookline, </em>367 Mass. 765, 772-774 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-9\">Most of the cases relevant to the question of the board\u2019s power of modification involve special permits rather than variances. Two propositions are established. First, it is clear that a board has \u201cinherent power ... to correct an inadvertent or clerical error in its decision so that the record reflects its true intention.\u201d <em>Selectmen of Stockbridge </em>v. <em>Monument Inn, Inc., </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 158, 164 (1979). <em>Dion </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Waltham, </em>344 Mass, at 553. <em>Burwick </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Worcester, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 739, 742 (1974). See also <em>Goldman </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Burlington, 347 </em>Mass. 320, 324-325 (1964). Second, the board may not make a substantive amendment which changes the result of an original deliberate decision, or which grants relief different from that originally granted, without compliance with the relevant notice and hearing requirements. That is not the case here. See <em>Fish </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Falmouth, </em>357 Mass. 774, 775 (1970); <em>Potter </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Mansfield, </em>1 Mass.

L.J. 286, 291 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b738-6\"> Since the original grant of the variance was never appealed, we are bound to presume that the board properly found each of the specific criteria required by the former \u00a7 15, including the element of hardship arising from \u201cconditions especially affecting [the] parcel . . . but not affecting generally the zoning district in which it is located,\u201d and that the use allowed by the variance itself is valid. See <em>LaCharite </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Lawrence, </em>327 Mass. 417, 421 (1951); <em>Ploski </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Somerset, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 874, 875 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b739-6\"> In the <em>Todd </em>case, which dealt with the validity of a special permit, the court upheld a condition which provided that the permit \u201cruns only to the applicant.\u201d However, in addressing the argument that this condition was \u201cinvalid because primarily related to ownership of property, rather than its use,\u201d the court suggested in dictum that this \u201ccontention may have more force in respect of a variance under [former] \u00a7 15, cl. 3, than of a permit under [former] \u00a7 15, cl. 2. See <em>Olevson </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Review of Narragansett, </em>71 R.I. 303 [,307-308 (1945)]; <em>Soho Park &amp; Land Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Adjustment of Belleville, </em>6 Misc. (N.J.) 686 [(1928)].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">We note that such conditions have continued to be upheld with respect to special permits. See <em>Maki </em>v. <em>Yarmouth, </em>340 Mass. 207, 212-213 (1960); <em>Shuman </em>v. <em>Board of Aldermen of Newton, </em>361 Mass. 758, 766-767 &amp; n.11 (1972). It has also been noted, however, that the <em>Shuman </em>case, <em>supra, </em>\u201cholds merely that the grant of a special permit may be limited to a particular \u2018applicant.\u2019 But the considerations on which the grant is based still relate to the land rather than the applicant. An analogous distinction is found in the criteria for the grant of a variance.\u201d <em>Dowd </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Dover, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. at 156.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b740-7\"> That condition required that such fences be six feet high, \u201cof solid construction such that one cannot see through them,\u201d and that they be placed along the south side of the defendant\u2019s work area (facing the Huntington House) as well as the north side (facing another abutter). It appears that the view from Route 47 on the east was already substantially blocked by the defendant\u2019s work building. We therefore infer that the erection of these fences left the operation visible only from the river on the west side of the property, as to which the defendant was required to construct a fence \u201cof any material.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b741-7\"> These restrictions limited the nature of the manufacturing processes allowed, limited the operation to a prescribed work area, and provided that an existing barn may be used only for storage. They also prohibited the defendant from constructing any new buildings or subdividing the land. The defendant\u2019s 1976 petition sought to remove the latter restriction as well as the durational condition, but the board denied that request. These restrictions are plainly proper since they were limitations which directly affected the use and therefore ran with the land.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
