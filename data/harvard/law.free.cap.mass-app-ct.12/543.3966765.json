Six weeks later, the defendant filed a motion for leave to withdraw guilty plea and for a new trial claiming (1) that his sentence was invalid because he had never formally pleaded guilty, and (2) that his plea had been involuntary because the judge had failed to inform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>him of the maximum possible sentence on the charge. We find no error and affirm the order denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">1. <em>The claim in regard to the entry of the plea. </em>The defendant claims that his sentence was invalid because it was in violation of G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 6, as appearing in St. 1979, c. 344, \u00a7 19, which states, in part, that a person cannot be convicted \u201cexcept by confessing his guilt in open court, by admitting the truth of the charge against him by his plea or demurrer or by the verdict of a jury accepted and recorded by the court or, in any criminal case other than a capital case, by judgment of the court.\u201d The defendant was charged in a complaint with being an escapee from the Massachusetts Correctional Institution, Lancaster. The complaint was filed in the District Court Department, and the defendant elected to have his case transferred to a first-instance jury session. On June 13, 1980, the defendant was present in the jury session court with his attorney, Mr. Hanlon. The judge inquired as to the wishes of the defendant and was informed by defense counsel that the defendant was going to change his plea from not guilty to guilty. The defendant agreed that it was his desire to plead guilty.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After asking a series of questions in regard to the voluntariness and the factual basis for the plea,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the judge began the recitation of the rights that would be waived, as follows: \u201cIf you decide to have a plea here ...\u201d and concluded the recitation, by saying, \u201cIs that what you want to do?\u201d The defendant replied, \u201cYes, your Honor,\u201d and the judge said, \u201cAll right.\u201d There followed an extended discussion among the judge, the probation officer, the prosecutor, defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>counsel, and the defendant in regard to the parole eligibility date for the sentence that the defendant was serving at the time of the proceedings. After the discussion was concluded, the judge sentenced the defendant. At no time did the defendant say, \u201cI plead guilty,\u201d or \u201cguilty\u201d to the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">There are no reported cases in the Commonwealth that set out the precise words, if any, that are to be used by the defendant in pleading guilty. The Massachusetts Rules of Criminal Procedure are also silent on this point. However, other States have held that the absence from the record of the words, \u201cI plead guilty\u201d or \u201cguilty\u201d does not, of itself, invalidate a purported guilty plea. <em>People </em>v. <em>Bellis, </em>78 App. Div. 2d 1014 (N.Y. 1980). <em>Neighbors </em>v. <em>State, </em>591 S.W. 2d 129, 130-131 (Mo. App. 1979) (\u201cthere is no requirement that a trial court specifically ask the defendant \u2018how do you plead\u2019\u201d). In this case, although the words, \u201cGuilty\u201d or \u201cI plead guilty,\u201d were not used, the circumstances compel the conclusion that the defendant did enter a plea of guilty and that the plea was accepted by the judge. The defendant acknowledged to the judge that it was his intention to plead guilty (n.1). The defendant, after the recitation of relinquished rights, when asked, \u201cIs that what you want to do?\u201d answered affirmatively. The record also shows that the defendant was familiar with court proceedings and understood that he had the right to ask questions at any point in the proceedings. The defendant admitted that the summary of facts outlining the essential elements of the crime was correct. We hold that upon this record the absence of the words \u201cI plead guilty\u201d or \u201cguilty\u201d does not invalidate the defendant\u2019s sentence. We urge judges to follow Mass. R.Crim.P. 12, 378 Mass. 866 (1979), in accepting guilty pleas and to follow the established practice of having the session clerk read the complaint or indictment to the defendant and ask him how he pleads. The defendant must utter the appropriate words before the guilty plea is accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">2. <em>The failure of the judge to advise the defendant of the maximum possible sentence. </em>Because of the failure of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>judge to inform him of the maximum possible sentence, the defendant claims that his plea of guilty was not voluntary. Counsel for the defendant and the prosecutor had agreed on a sentence recommendation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, defense counsel had reserved the right to request a lesser sentence. Mass.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(1)(C), 378 Mass. 867 (1979). The judge, after listening to defense counsel, imposed the recommended sentence. At no time did the judge inform the defendant of the maximum possible sentence that he could impose on the charge.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant must be informed, where appropriate, of the maximum possible sentence. Mass.R.Crim.P. 12(c)(3)(B), 378 Mass. 868 (1979). Here, the judge did not exceed the agreed recommendation for a sentence. If there was error in the failure of the judge to advise the defendant of the maximum possible sentence, it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curry, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 928, 929 (1978).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">\n<em>Order denying motion to withdraw guilty plea and for new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b566-6\"> \u201cThe Court: What are we doing?</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">Mr. Hanlon: This is going to be a change of plea, Judge, not guilty to guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">The Court: Okay.
