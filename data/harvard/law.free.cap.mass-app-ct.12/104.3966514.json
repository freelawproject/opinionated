The victim testified that during the early morning hours of February 17, 1980, while in her room she was forced by the defendant to submit to six acts of sexual intercourse. The defendant admitted in his testimony that the victim was a stranger to him but maintained that she consented to the acts. On appeal, the defendant alleges that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>(1) the trial judge committed error in permitting the prosecuting attorney to ask a series of questions of the defendant in the course of cross-examination relative to his authorship of a certain letter sent from the jail to the district attorney\u2019s office; and (2) the prosecutor engaged in prejudicial final argument. We affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">1. <em>The \u201cskinner\u201d letter issue. </em>Prior to the defendant\u2019s taking the stand, the prosecutor had in her possession a letter sent to the district attorney\u2019s office, purportedly signed by the defendant and by individuals named Gosselin and Partridge, in which the signatories called themselves \u201cskinners\u201d. Shortly after receiving the letter, the prosecutor showed the letter to defense counsel. On cross-examination, the defendant testified, without objection, that the expression \u201cskinner\u201d meant \u201crapist\u201d and that he had heard the expression in jail. He denied that he was a \u201cskinner\u201d and further testified that he did not recognize the letter although he admitted that he knew Gosselin and Partridge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Without objection, the defendant testified that he had known Gosselin and Partridge for about two or three months. At that juncture, the judge refused a request by the prosecutor to have the defendant write his name on the blackboard. At the bench, the prosecutor requested that the judge give her an opportunity to bring the other alleged signatories from the jail in order to have them testify. The judge granted the request, and defense counsel moved for a mistrial on the ground that the prosecutor had intentionally asked questions knowing that the answers would indicate that the defendant was in jail. The judge denied the request and shortly afterwards gave the instructions outlined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>in the margin in regard to the role of negative answers to leading questions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">The objection and the request for a mistrial were not timely. It is the rule in this Commonwealth that when something occurs during the course of a civil or criminal trial which constitutes the basis for one side to request a mistrial \u201cit must be called to the attention of the judge immediately, or when the aggrieved party first learns of it, in order that the judge may take whatever action may be required in the circumstances.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiPietro, 373 </em>Mass. 369, 387 (1977). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Homer, </em>235 Mass. 526, 536 (1920). Defense counsel knew of the \u201cskinner\u201d letter prior to the cross-examination and an inference could have been drawn that the prosecutor would attempt to use the letter during cross-examination.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Spann, 383 </em>Mass. 142, 149 (1981) (\u201cIn the case before us, the inference was obvious that the prosecution would seek to prove that the ring was similar to one normally worn by the victim\u201d). Appellate counsel argues that, by posing a series of questions to the defendant, the prosecutor conveyed to the jury the \u201cinnuendo\u201d that the defendant had signed and mailed a letter to the prosecution describing himself as a \u201cskinner,\u201d a jailhouse term for \u201crapist,\u201d and that these questions unduly prejudiced the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. This ground was never argued to the trial judge and need not be considered by us. See <em>Common</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number><em>wealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>374 Mass. 453, 458 (1978).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because the objection to the \u201cseries\u201d of questions was not timely we will not consider it. Furthermore, a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice does not exist in this case. The prosecutor had in her possession a letter purportedly signed by the defendant. Therefore, there was a foundation for the questions. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>367 Mass. 280, 284 (1975) (\u201c\u2018the attempt to communicate impressions by innuendo through questions which are answered in the negative . . . when the questioner has no evidence to support the innuendo, is an improper tactic which has often been condemned by the courts\u2019\u201d). Appellate counsel admits in his brief that under the facts of this case the \u201cskinner\u201d letter, had the defendant admitted writing it, might have been received in evidence as an admission. Therefore, the questioning was permissible in that it \u201cdid not relate to extraneous or immaterial matters.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>367 Mass. at 284-285.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In addition, the judge\u2019s reasonably prompt instructions were more than adequate in placing the role of the negative answers to leading questions in proper perspective.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">2. <em>Claim of error in prosecutor\u2019s argument. </em>At the close of the prosecutor\u2019s argument, defense counsel objected to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>the argument on two grounds: (1) the argument implied that the defendant had to prove \u201csomething\u201d; and (2) the argument appealed to the emotions of the jury. The words to which the defendant objected came at the end of the argument and are stated in the margin.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> After the defendant made known his objections, the judge immediately gave his charge to the jury. We note that at the beginning and near the close of his instructions the judge, using forceful words, stated that the defendant does not have to prove anything. Also the judge emphasized that \u201cemotion\u201d plays no part in reaching a verdict. We are satisfied that the judge\u2019s instructions removed any taint, if there was any, from the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. We also note that the defendant, at the close of the judge\u2019s instructions, did not renew his objections, which indicates to us that his complaints had been corrected to his satisfaction. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grammo, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 447, 457 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The prosecutor asked the defendant at that point, \u201cIsn\u2019t it fair to say that you sent this letter to the District Attorney\u2019s office, which indicated that you were a \u2018skinner,\u2019 and you signed the letter?\u201d Defense counsel objected and the judge forbade the prosecutor to quote further from the letter. The judge further stated that he would give instructions to the jury relative to the meaning of negative answers to leading questions. The judge gave the instructions at a later point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b128-6\">\u201cThis is cross-examination, and, again, I think I\u2019ve told the jury before, on cross-examination, ladies and gentlemen, questions that suggest an answer are permissible. But unless it\u2019s confirmed by the witness, it\u2019s absolutely no evidence at all of what was suggested. Testimony comes from the witnesses, not from counsel. You can believe what the witness says or not believe it. That\u2019s up to you. But unless the suggestion is confirmed, it is absolutely no evidence at all, and shouldn\u2019t even be considered.\u201d We note that the judge had previously given the same instruction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b128-7\"> The fact that defense counsel knew of the letter presented a situation wherein a motion in limine would have been an appropriate device to raise the issue prior to the defendant\u2019s taking the stand. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>383 Mass. 497, 500 n.2 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b129-6\"> The ground for the mistrial that was argued to the judge, i.e., that the purpose of the questions was to indicate to the jury that the defendant was in jail, was handled in the judge\u2019s charge, apparently to the defendant\u2019s satisfaction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b129-7\"> Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Homer, </em>235 Mass. 526 (1920). In <em>Homer, </em>the defendant was accused of robbery and, on cross-examination, was asked if he had filed a petition in bankruptcy. The defendant answered in the negative. The court held that there was error because \u201cit was an attempt to establish an immaterial but harmful fact in an improper way.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 535.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b129-8\"> Appellate counsel also objects to the inclusion of the name \u201cAppleby\u201d in one of the prosecutor\u2019s questions. The prosecutor asked the defendant if he had heard the expression \u201cskinner\u201d from Appleby. The defendant answered, \u201cCould be.\u201d There was no objection. We note that Appleby was convicted in Hampden County, twenty-two months before this trial in Hampshire County. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Appleby, </em>380 Mass. 296 (1980). It is doubtful that the jurors in this case ever heard of \u201cAppleby\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b130-6\"> \u201cAnd when you consider all this evidence, I\u2019m going to ask you to consider what is reasonable. Does his story make any sense to you whatsoever, or does his story insult your intelligence? And I also ask you, when you go into the Jury Room to deliberate, are you going to come out and say to that Defendant, we don\u2019t believe your story, Mr. Defendant; your story is not believable? Or are you going to come out and say to Sarah, we don\u2019t believe you Sarah; we don\u2019t believe what you told us; and you\u2019re right, it\u2019s really hard to prove a rape charge. And we don\u2019t believe you on this one Sarah. You lied to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">\u201cAre you going to say that to Sarah? Is she going to go through all her testimony, all those times for naught? Did she go through all this testifying, all those occasions, so that you could tell her we don\u2019t believe you? I would suggest and I would submit that you will not do that, and that you will come back and find the Defendant guilty as charged.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
