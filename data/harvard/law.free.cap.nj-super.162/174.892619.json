J. Super. </em>249 (Law Div. 1978). We comment brifly on certain points.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Defendant urges that his conviction did not denote moral turpitude because the trial judge at the criminal proceeding struck out charges in the fourth count of the indictment that defendant and Paul J. Lombardo, municipal Director of Public Safety and one of the alleged conspirators, defrauded Taffaro Lumber Company. The fourth count charged defendant and Lombardo with obtaining \u201cmaterial aud other things of value\u201d from Taffaro Lumber Co. and Union City with intent to cheat and defraud them.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">But the fact remains that defendant on the first count of the indictment was found to have \u201cwillfully and knowingly\u201d conspired \u201cto pervert the due administration of the laws of the State of New Jersey pertaining to the requirements for public advertisement for bids and public bidding in public contracts\u201d and \u201cto violate the criminal laws of the State of New Jersey pertaining to the misconduct in office of public officials.\u201d Had the jury not found the necessary intent to have existed, it would not have found defendant guilty. Accordingly, we concur in the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that the offense charged was one which involved moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">We also agree with the trial judge that in a case such as this, where the conviction of a crime of moral turpitude is clearly present, defendant cannot go behind the \u201cconviction\u201d mentioned in the statute, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>.2A:135~9, in order to circumvent the statutory mandate of forfeiture of his office.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
