A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AKt\">Defendant was convicted of robbery <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>2A.T41-1) in a jury trial. In an earlier trial the jury could not agree upon a verdict. Defendant was sentenced to State Prison for a term of five to seven years.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">On this appeal defendant contends: (a) the prosecutor\u2019s remarks in summation were prejudicial and the trial judge failed to deal properly with that conduct, and (b) the cross-examination of defendant on his prior convictions improperly exceeded the permissible use of the evidence. We agree with these contentions and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">There was ample evidence tending to support defendant\u2019s conviction, but the transgressions of the prosecutor warrant our stern condemnation and the reversal of this conviction in an effort to stem prosecutorial misconduct. Improper conduct of prosecutors is becoming \u201cmuch too prevalent.\u201d <em>State v. Farrell, </em>61 <em>N. J. </em>99, 104 (1972); <em>State v. Spano, </em>64 <em>N. J. </em>566, 568 (1974). It must be deterred. See <em>State v. DiPaglia, </em>64 <em>N. J. </em>288, 298 (1974) (Clifford, J., dissenting) ; <em>State v. Thornton, </em>38 <em>N. J. </em>380, 400 (1962), <em>cert. </em>den. 374 <em>U. S. </em>816, 83 <em>S. Ct. </em>1710, 10 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 1039 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-11\">There was evidence to show that a Carl Swanson was assaulted and robbed by two men near Bamberger\u2019s Department Store in Newark. When the two miscreants fled they were pursued by a motorist, Samuel Griffin, who captured defendant. The victim had also joined in the pursuit of his attackers. However, defendant\u2019s accomplice escaped. Defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>ant struggled to escape until the police arrived and he gave a false name to the arresting officer, but a search failed to disclose any of the victim\u2019s property in defendant\u2019s possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">Defendant testified in his own behalf. He claimed that he was sitting on a porch fixing a nail in his shoe when Griffin ran past him, ran up a stairway as if he were looking for someone, came back to defendant, looked at him, and then \u201cgrabbed\u201d and \u201cpunched\u201d him. A struggle ensued but defendant could not free himself from Griffin\u2019s grasp. The victim, Mr. Swanson, arrived and then the police. Defendant admitted giving the police a false name.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">On cross-examination the prosecuting attorney referred to defendant\u2019s testimony that he was walking home because he didn\u2019t have carfare. He asked defendant if defendant robbed Mr. Swanson because he had no money and needed some \u201cto make it through the next couple of days.\u201d Defendant resisted this charge by saying he had been working and was getting paid the next day, but the prosecutor pressed defendant about his lack of funds. We refer to this on our own motion because it is generally improper to use a defendant\u2019s poverty to establish a criminal motive. <em>State v. </em>Mathis, 47 <em>N. J. </em>455, 469-472 (1966); <em>cf. State v. Copeland, </em>94 <em>N. J. Super. </em>196, 201-202 (App. Div. 1967). Moreover, this line of questioning relates to another impropriety to which defendant objected, namely, the prosecutor\u2019s reference to defendant\u2019s recent release from jail, thereby again suggesting that defendant committed the robbery because he was in need of funds or, at least, was a \u201cbad man\u201d with a penchant for crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">The prosecuting attorney went on to cross-examine defendant about a prior conviction and 60-day jail sentence for larceny. This was admitted by .defendant. The prosecutor -then explored the dates when defendant was sent to jail and when he was released. This culminated in a final question by the prosecutor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Q. As a matter of fact, sir, you were only out of jail a few days when you robbed Mr. Swanson. Isn\u2019t that right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-6\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">Defense counsel rose to object. He said: \u201cJudge \u2014 ,\u201d but he was interrupted by the prosecutor\u2019s statement that he had no further questions. Defense counsel persisted, however, and moved for a mistrial based upon this improper use of a prior conviction. He correctly stated that, while prior convictions can be used to affect credibility, they cannot be used to unfairly insinuate that because defendant \u201chad just been released from prison he was going to come out and commit a crime.\u201d The prosecutor replied with the pretense that he wanted to establish that defendant was not in jail when the crime was committed. But defendant made no such contention. Defendant had already testified on direct that he was at the scene on the night in question. <em>Cf. State v. Mathis, supra, </em>47 <em>N. J. </em>at 470-471 where a prosecutor asserted a false basis to justify improper cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">The trial judge denied the mistrial on grounds that the objection was untimely and the material was not that \u201charmful\u201d to defendant, that it was not \u201coverwhelmingly prejudicial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">In this case defendants\u2019 prior convictions could be used only to affect his credibility as a witness. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:81 \u2014 12; <em>State v. Thomas, </em>76 <em>N. J. </em>344, 361 (1978); see <em>State v. Sands, </em>76 <em>N. J. </em>127, 147 (1978), which applies a narrower rule prospectively. The attempt to use a prior conviction to establish the predilection or motive for committing other crimes is strongly condemned. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>65 <em>N. J. </em>388, 391 \u2014 392 (1974), finding prejudice and reversing a conviction in part because a prosecutor harped on defendant\u2019s prior convictions to the point of suggesting that defendant was a hardened criminal and the jury might infer guilt from that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">In <em>State v. Thomas, supra, </em>the Supreme Court suggested that the misuse of a prior conviction might be unduly prejudicial despite a trial judge\u2019s curative charge. 76 <em>N. J. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>at 362-363. Here we note that no curative charge was given by the trial judge, despite defense counsel\u2019s objection and motion for a mistrial. These objections should have alerted the judge to the seriousness of the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct. Rather than dismiss the application on the technical basis that defendant answered \u201cno\u201d before his attorney\u2019s objection was asserted, the trial judge should have forcefully reprimanded the prosecutor for this improper interrogation and should have attempted to cure the wrong by a prompt charge to the jury. <em>State v. Farrell, supra, </em>61 <em>N. J. </em>at 106; see <em>State v. DiPaglia, </em>64 <em>N. J. </em>288, 296 (1974). (We note that the judge\u2019s charge to the jury at the close of the case did include instructions on the limited use to which convictions may be put.) <em>State v. Sands, supra, </em>recognizes potential prejudice in the use of prior convictions. 76 <em>N. J. </em>at 144, 147. See also <em>State v. Manley, </em>54 <em>N. J. </em>259, 269-270 (1969), where the court also spoke of the need to instruct jurors that \u201ctheir consideration of such conviction must be limited entirely to the issue of [defendant\u2019s] credibility * * *.\u201d 54 <em>N. J. </em>at 270; <em>State v. Johson, supra, </em>65 <em>N. J. </em>at 392, 395 .(Pashman, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Defendant also complains of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks in summation. In summation the prosecutor referred to defendant as a \u201cyoung punk.\u201d Defense counsel immediately objected, but was overruled. When he persisted in his objection the trial judge responded: \u201cSit down, Mr. G-. Let the Prosecutor finish.\u201d Despite protestations, the trial judge rebuked defense counsel for refusing to sit down and for talking back, for which defense counsel apologized, but the trial judge failed to take any action to discourage the prosecutor\u2019s improper conduct. See <em>State v. Cappadona, </em>127 <em>N. J. Super. </em>555, 559 (App. Div. 1974), certif. den., 65 <em>N. J. </em>574 (1974), <em>cert. </em>den. 419 <em>U. S. </em>1034, 95 <em>S. Ct. </em>518, 42 <em>L. Ed,. </em>2d 310 (1974), where the trial judge instructed the jury to disregard the prosecutor\u2019s reference to defendants as \u201cbums.\u201d Eor these reasons defendant contends that the trial judge failed to take proper corrective action and dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>played hostility toward defense counsel in the presence of the Why-</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\"> We do not condone defense counsel\u2019s refusal to sit down after his objection was overruled and the trial judge sought to terminate his protests. When an attorney provokes a judge\u2019s rebuke by defying his authority to limit argument, he cannot complain of the judge\u2019s appearance of hostility while trying to control the proceedings. Nevertheless, the prosecutor\u2019s reference to defendant as a \u201cpunk\u201d was improper and the trial judge should have taken corrective action. See <em>State v. Von Atzinger, </em>81 <em>N. J. Super. </em>509, 516 (App. Div. 1963) where references to defendant in the prosecutor\u2019s summation as a \u201cpunk,\u201d \u201chood,\u201d and \u2018Turn\u201d were considered so prejudicial as to constitute plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Possibly encouraged by this success in summation, the prosecutor went on to refer to defendant\u2019s accomplice and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-7\">* * * I\u2019m sorry that we don\u2019t have the other man here. I\u2019m sorry we don\u2019t have the taller guy with the blue jacket. I\u2019d like to see him convicted. * <em>* *</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">No objection was made, but defendant now contends this was an improper injection of the prosecutor\u2019s personal belief in the guilt of defendant and his accomplice. See <em>State v. Farrell, supra, </em>61 <em>N. J. </em>at 106. However, we do not regard this comment as plain error. See <em>State v. Thornton, </em>38 <em>N. J. </em>380, 398 (1964), <em>cert. </em>den. 374 <em>U. S. </em>816, 83 <em>S. Ct. </em>1710, 10 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 1039 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">The prosecutor concluded his remarks with his rather narrow view of the meaning of a fair trial. He said that when a defendant has his \u201cday in court,\u201d can cross-examine witnesses and is judged by a jury, \u201cthat\u2019s what we call a fair trial.\u201d He went on to say that defendant did have a fair trial and that their verdict would be fair because defendant had his day in court, \u201cBut a fair trial does not mean a not guilty verdict.\u201d He told the jurors they had to make defendant pay for his crime, \u201cbecause it\u2019s your sworn moral obligation.\u201d This last comment raised another objection. The colloquy was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>MR. G-: Judge, it\u2019s not the sworn obligation to convict anyone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-5\">THE COURT: To do their duty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-6\">MR. G-: He didn\u2019t say that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-7\">THE COURT: Based on the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-8\">MR. G-: If he said that I would have no objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-9\">THE COURT: All right. Based on the evidence. All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-10\">MR. G-: You don\u2019t have to cover for his errors, judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-11\">THE COURT: Now listen, Mr. G-, I\u2019ll take nothing from you on that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-13\">MR. G-: Judge, that\u2019s exactly\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-14\">THE COURT: Don\u2019t you say I\u2019m covering for his errors. Now, stop talking. I\u2019m going to charge the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-15\">Telling jurors that their sworn obligation is to convict or that they would not have met their \u201cresponsibility\u201d unless they convicted is disapproved. <em>State v. </em>Knight, 63 <em>N. J. </em>187, 193 ,(1973); <em>State v. </em>Johnson, 31 <em>N. J. </em>489, 512-513 (1960). Here, however, the trial judge denigrated defense counsel\u2019s reasonable complaint and glossed over the prosecutor\u2019s statement without any attempt to clarify the point for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-16\">We are satisfied that the prosecutor\u2019s series of improprieties, some of which were given apparent approval by the trial judge, combined to deprive defendant of a fair trial. See <em>State v. Orecchio, </em>16 <em>N. J. </em>125, 129 (1954). We cannot condone these prosecutorial tactics. Unfortunately they were given added support by the trial judge\u2019s failure to sustain appropriate objections, to give prompt curative instructions, and to rule forcefully enough to discourage such conduct. As the court said in <em>State v. </em>Thornton, <em>supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-17\">Supervision and control of all trials are in the hands of the judge. It is essential to the administration of justice that he be acutely responsive to the task. In criminal proceedings particularly, where a person\u2019s life or liberty is at stake, whenever a prosecutor exceeds the bounds of propriety or fair play in his summation, the trial court should intervene decisively whether or not an objection is made by the defendant. [38 <em>N. J. </em>at 400].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-18\">Accordingly, we reverse and set aside the conviction. We remand the case to the trial court for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
