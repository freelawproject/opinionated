Sess. Laws \u201967, p. 787.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">The Supreme Court of Florida en banc has said that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-7\">\u201cThis statute is a part of the public policy of the State of Florida and its purpose is to discourage the contesting of policies in Florida Courts and to reimburse successful plaintiffs reasonably for their outlays for attorney\u2019s fees when a suit is brought against them, or they are compelled to sue, in Florida Courts to enforce their contracts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">Feller v. Equitable Life Assur. Soc., Fla. 1952, 57 So.2d 581, 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">The Florida Statute thus reflects a substantial policy of the state which does not conflict with any federal statute<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or rule of court, and the substance of that statute should therefore be followed in this diversity case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Attorney\u2019s fees allowed under that and similar statutes have been approved by this Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We hold that the appellee is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-16\">The district court in its judgment awarded $5,000.00 as a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee to plaintiff\u2019s attorneys. The appellee has submitted two affidavits, one expressing the opinion that a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee for services rendered by appellee\u2019s attorneys is $7,-500.00, and the other fixing the figure at $8,000.00. The affidavits are somewhat ambiguous as to whether the said figures include the $5,000.00 allowed as attorney\u2019s fee in the trial court. In any event, the opinions expressed in the affidavits are intended merely as an aid to the Court and not to be binding. We do not consider this Court bound by the procedural direction of the Florida Statute, that the appellate court shall adjudge the fee on appeal. However, this Court is probably in better position than the district court to adjudge the amount of such fee. Under all of the facts and circumstances of this case, we think that a reasonable fee to the attorneys for the appellee for their services on appeal would be $3,000.00, so that the total fee allowed attorneys for plaintiff-appellee throughout the course of this litigation would be $8,000.00. It is therefore so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-17\">The mandate heretofore issued is recalled<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the opinion and decision of this Court is modified accordingly.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b633-10\">.
