While there may be merit to these contentions, it is apparent on the face of appellant\u2019s petition that he has failed to exhaust available state remedies. Before he can receive a federal determination on the merits of his petition, he is required by Title 28, U.S.C., Section 2254, to pursue Texas post-conviction remedies. An effective remedy is provided by Article 11.07 of the Vernon\u2019s Ann.Texas Code of Criminal Procedure of 1965, as amended, effective August 28, 1967. Taylor may and should present his contentions at an evidentiary hearing in the state district court in which he was convicted. State of Texas v. Payton, 5 Cir. 1968, 890 F.2d 261; Sheehan v. Beto, 5 Cir. 1967, 387 F.2d 263; Carroll v. Beto, 5 Cir. 1967, 379 F.2d 329; Ex Parte Young, Tex.Cr.App.1967, 418 S.W.2d 824.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-13\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
