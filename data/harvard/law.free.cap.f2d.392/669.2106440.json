Both are in custody for violations of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2314, the interstate transportation of falsely made and forged securities, Tippins for eighteen months and Mullins for five years. The District Court denied relief and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-20\">The maximum sentence that may be imposed under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2314 is ten years. Since each of the Appellants was sentenced to less than the statutory maximum, each falls within the conclusive presumption of our recent decision in Bryans v. Blackwell, 5 Cir., 1967, 387 F.2d 764, that they were given credit for all time spent in jail prior to sentencing. See also Putt v. United States, 5 Cir., 1968, 392 F.2d 64 and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
