It is possible that there was an exploratory search too broad to be properly incident to De-Catur\u2019s arrest. But it would appear that all of the tangible real objects offered in evidence were seized from points immediately adjacent to the spot where De-Catur was arrested. If some item crept into evidence that was illegally seized, no record was made in the trial court and we are not told what it was.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
