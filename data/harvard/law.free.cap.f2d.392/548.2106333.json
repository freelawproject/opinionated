This appeal is from the judgment entered thereon. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>collision occurred on the Baltimore-Washington Expressway when the automobile operated by defendant\u2019s decedent which was proceeding south jumped across the median strip and collided head-on with the car which was proceeding north, in which plaintiff was seated beside the driver.\u2019 According to medical evidence, defendant\u2019s decedent had a fatal, or completely disabling, heart attack just prior to the accident. Numerous errors are assigned on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">The district judge instructed the jury that defendant\u2019s decedent was \u201cpresumed to have exercised ordinary care for his own safety\u201d in the operation of his automobile, but that the jury could consider the evidence of his negligence which had been offered in determining whether he was negligent and whether such negligence was a proximate cause of plaintiff\u2019s injuries. The instruction about the presumption of due care was derived from our decision in State of Maryland for Use of Geils v. Baltimore Transit Company, 329 F.2d 738 (4 Cir. 1964), in which we held such an instruction required for the benefit of a plaintiff\u2019s decedent in a suit for wrongful death and a companion case for medical expenses, funeral expenses, pain and suffering. So long as such a presumption is part of Maryland law and an instruction concerning the presumption proper, we find no reason or authority to say that it must be given in regard to a plaintiff\u2019s decedent and not in regard to a defendant\u2019s decedent, or that it is applicable only to an issue of contributory negligence and not to an issue of primary negligence. We conclude that the instruction was proper, and plaintiff\u2019s contention to the contrary lacking in merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\"> A careful review of the record satisfies us that, under the circumstances reflected therein, there was no error in the denial of certain of plaintiff\u2019s requested instructions, in the district judge\u2019s rulings on objections to plaintiff\u2019s cross-examination of defendant\u2019s expert medical witness, in refusing to permit plaintiff to call as a witness a so-called \u201caccident reconstruction expert, or in the district judge\u2019s other rulings on evidence. We deem the contentions that the district judge engaged in preferential and prejudicial treatment of defendant, the executrix and widow of her decedent, and that the district judge condoned like conduct on the part of her counsel in her direct examination, patently frivolous, totally unwarranted and totally unjustified.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
