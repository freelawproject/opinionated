Harris as claimant was eligible <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for benefits. The appellant as \u201cmost recent employer,\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> having exhausted administrative remedies, unsuccessfully sought review in the District Court, and here contends that summary judgment was erroneously entered for the Board. Basically the appellant argues (1) that there had been no showing of record that Harris was available for work and hence was not eligible to receive benefits; and (2) that the Board\u2019s finding of such eligibility was not \u201csupported by evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-16\">The essentiality of appropriate findings, supported by evidence, cannot be doubted as will be discerned from our opinion in AEM, Inc. v. Ecke, 106 U.S.App.D.C. 240, 271 F.2d 506 (1959). There an unemployed rug seamstress had actively sought employment among the seven or so possible employers in this area, as the record showed in support of the Board\u2019s finding as to the claimant\u2019s eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-17\">Here a very different situation appears. Harris had been employed as a hotel credit manager <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> from October 1, 1963 to September 30, 1964, receiving base period earnings of some $6,330. He entered upon temporary employment with the appellant on November 24,1964, as a salesman at a pay rate of $1.15 per hour. His employment terminated on December 26, 1964.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On February 25, 1965, Harris initiated his claim for un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>employment benefits, and as of March 9, 1965, a claims examiner found Harris eligible and a first payment was released that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">The \u201clast employer\u201d then appealed on the ground that Harris had not been \u201cavailable\u201d within the meaning of the Act. On March 25, 1965, notice was sent to Harris that a hearing date of April 5, 1965, had been set, but Harris did not appear.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The transcript discloses additionally that the Appeals Examiner explained : \u201cHe appeared in this office previous to the hearing and indicated he probably would not appear since he did not intend at that time to continue filing on his claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Thus the claimant did not take the stand and so was not examined as to his physical ability to work, or concerning what, if any, efforts he might have made to obtain employment as a secretary or bookkeeper or otherwise. The Appeals Examiner noted in his Findings: \u201cThe employer contends that claimant is unemployed by choice and, therefore, should not be considered available for benefits.\u201d The issue as thus posed involved the basic standard of eligibility,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ahq\">In this context, the Board argues that the District of Columbia Act does not in so many words require that a claimant \u201cbe actively seeking work\u201d prior to a determination of eligibility for benefits. On brief we are further told that the Board</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-6\">\u201cby administrative policy, assures itself periodically during the course of each claim, that claimants are genuinely attached to the labor market and are making adequate contacts for work as the facts, exigencies, and circumstances in each individual case so warrant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">It may thus seem clear enough that the Board here recognized, as is true in most states, that to be eligible for benefits, a claimant must be available for work. Further, to be deemed available, a claimant must be \u201cgenuinely attached to the labor market\u201d and, all circumstances considered, must be \u201cmaking adequate contacts for work.\u201d The \u201cactive search for work\u201d concept is applied at the outset and thereafter as the Board so \u201cassures itself periodically during the course of each claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-12\">Thus initially a Claims Deputy had made a determination of eligibility for benefits simply upon the applicant\u2019s having filed a claim setting forth information as required on the Board\u2019s Form DUCB 104, a \u201cBenefit Rights Interview Questionnaire.\u201d Even so, as the administrative record shows, Harris had been asked: \u201cHave you made personal contacts in looking for work in the past two weeks?\u201d Harris answered \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-13\">The Claims Deputy having thereupon made his determination accordingly, notice was then given to the claimant and to this appellant as his most recent employer. After the latter appealed, the hearing was required by regulation to be</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-14\">\u201cconducted in such manner as to ascertain the substantial rights of the parties. All issues presented and relevant shall be considered and passed upon. Where a party appears in person, the member of the appeal tribunal or examiner * * * may examine such party and his witnesses, if any. * * *\" <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-16\">The same Regulation further provides that if a party fails to appear at the hearing, the appeals officer may continue the hearing to a later time or proceed on the basis of the record then available. Thereupon, as the Act itself clearly provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-17\">\u201call decisions shall contain a brief summary of the evidence, the <em>findings </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number><em>of fact </em>and conclusions drawn therefrom.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Except for ex parte statements attributed to Harris himself, the record discloses no evidence whatever that he had undertaken an active search for work. Otherwise there was no showing that Harris had established a \u201cgenuine attachment to the labor market\u201d or that Harris had been \u201cmaking adequate contacts for work,\u201d as the Board\u2019s administrative policy contemplated.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> And, of course, there were, and could be on <em>this </em>record, no \u201cfindings,\u201d supported by evidence, to premise the Appeals Examiner\u2019s conclusion of eligibility, despite the clearly and repeatedly stated requirements of the Act.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Rather, the Appeals Examiner in his April 15, 1965, decision noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-6\">\u201cThe record in this case does not disclose any indication that claimant has refused any job offers from the United States Employment Service.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">Again, he set out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-8\">\u201cThere is no indication in this case that claimant has refused any job referrals.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">Such negative assertions may seem lacking in vitality where, for all that appears, what the claimant might least have desired were the \u201cjob offers\u201d or \u201cjob referrals\u201d mentioned by the Appeals Examiner. What the claimant might have offered by way of testimony on any such aspects, we can not know.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-16\">Under such circumstances we perceive from the Appeals Examiner\u2019s Decision that he deemed it controlling that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-17\">\u201c[A]n individual\u2019s certification <em>when applying </em>for benefits will <em>ordinarily </em>be accepted as. sufficient evidence of his availability.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-18\">We may assume as stated, that \u201cordinarily\u201d an applicant\u2019s ex parte certificate may permit an <em>initial </em>determination of eligibility. But when thereafter the carefully prescribed appeals provisions of the Act are invoked and the claim is put in issue, the legislation beyond doubt establishes that the claimant may receive benefits <em>\u201conly </em>if it has been <em>found </em>by the Board\u201d (emphasis added) that he is \u201cavailable for work.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> And no finding is conclusive unless it be \u201csupported by evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-19\">We have no doubt that to support a finding that a claimant is \u201cavailable for work\u201d in the circumstances here discussed, he must adduce evidence that he shall have conducted an active search for work. We are not alone in our view of that basic concept in the determination of availability, and hence of \u201celigibility\u201d as the term is used in our Code.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Moreover, prior decisions of the Board\u2019s Appeals Examiners seem to have reflected correctly what we deem to be the appropriate standard. In Appeals Ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>aminer\u2019s Decision No. 16,599 decided February 24, 1965, we note:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-4\">\u201cIn order to be eligible for unemployment benefits an individual must be available for work. This ordinarily requires <em>cm active search for work </em>each week for which benefits are claimed together with an ability to accept offers of suitable work within a reasonable time. * * * However, in view of the evidence in this case including claimant\u2019s absence of any work search during the three week period involved in this appeal, it must be concluded that she had no meaningful attachment or exposure to the labor market and, therefore, cannot be considered to have been available for work.\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">The record indicates the nature of the confusion of the approach which here seems to have been followed. The Appeals Examiner\u2019s Decision<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> concluded: \u201cThe above determination allowing benefits without disqualification is affirmed.\u201d But the issue did not involve disqualification. The question turned upon \u201celigibility.\u201d We find ourselves far from satisfied that the hearing had been \u201cconducted in such manner as to ascertain the substantial rights of the parties.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">Surely substantial rights were involved, of the employer as well as of the non-appearing claimant. The Board would seem to say that when challenged on the issue of eligibility, the claimant may refuse to appear, or decline to submit to examination, and stand simply on his own ex parte certification. Thereupon, the Board would place upon the appellant the burden of showing that the claimant had not refused \u201cjob offers\u201d or \u201cjob referrals.\u201d We reject that construction of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-11\">The judgment of the District Court is reversed with directions that the case be remanded to the Board. The Board is then to reopen its proceedings and set aside its conclusion that the claimant Harris had been shown by evidence to be eligible for benefits in Board Appeal No. 16,748, UI. The Board\u2019s action thereupon shall be without prejudice to such further proceedings as to the parties may seem advisable.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b556-9\">.
