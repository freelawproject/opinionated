Claimant then brought an action for review by the district court of the Secretary\u2019s decision pursuant to section 205 (g) of the Social Security Act. 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 405(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-23\">Upon review of the record, considered as a whole, the district court found that the decision of the Secretary was supported by substantial evidence and granted the Secretary\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-24\">The medical testimony as to the claimant\u2019s physical condition was conflicting. Her personal physician, who was a general practitioner, expressed his opinion that she was unable to work due to an osteo-arthritic condition, but an objective examination made by an orthopedic surgeon resulted in a diagnosis of mild, generalized, degenerative arthritis with essentially full range of motion in claimant\u2019s cervical spine and full range of motion in all other joints. All of the medical evidence was reviewed by another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>orthopedic surgeon who testified as a medical advisor and he stated his conclusion that claimant had mild, generalized osteo-arthritis and that her condition was usual for a person of her age. Claimant testified in her own behalf as to her asserted physical disabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">The trial examiner concluded that the evidence did not establish that claimant\u2019s impairment was so severe as to disable her from gainful employment, that she should be able to return to her regular job in a textile plant and that she could also do other and lighter work which was readily available. This became the final decision of the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Upon review of the record as a whole, we find substantial evidence to support the determinations of the Secretary and the decision below will be</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
