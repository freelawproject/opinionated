The order appealed from applies \u00a7 5(a) to this case, notwithstanding that appellant successfully contested the criminal action against itself and that appellant entered a consent decree in the government\u2019s civil action against itself and others prior to the determination of that civil action. We are in full accord with Judge Larson\u2019s carefully considered and well expressed opinion in State of Michigan v. Morton Salt Co., D.C.Minn., 1966, 259 F.Supp. 35, 57, 61-64. On the basis of that determination, this case is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
