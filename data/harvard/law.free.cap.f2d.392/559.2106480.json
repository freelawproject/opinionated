Smith and discriminatorily suspended employee Charles Cleveland.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-19\">The Board adopted the trial examiner\u2019s findings. The examiner credited the testimony of Hoke Smith as opposed to contradictory testimony as to whether his employment was more arduous than previous employment and as to whether more difficult employment resulted from Smith\u2019s union activities or his suspected union activities. The examiner found also, after conflicting testimony, that Cleveland\u2019s suspension was pretextual and in reprisal for his adherence to the union. Both Smith and Cleveland had acted as observers for the union at the election held by the Board in the plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-20\">There is considerable testimony in this case, pro and con, on the issue of the alleged unfair labor practices. Though the Board\u2019s evidence is not as strong as in some cases where we have enforced its orders, we are unable to say that the examiner\u2019s findings, adopted by the Board, are not supported by substantial evidence. Cf. Avondale Shipyards, Inc. v. N. L. R. B., 5 Cir., 1968, 391 F.2d 203. Numerous credibility choices were made by the examiner and we are usually bound by such determinations, Nabors v. N. L. R. B., 5 Cir., 1963, 323 F.2d 686; N. L. R. B. v. Waycross Sportswear, Inc., 5 Cir., 1968, 391 F.2d 294, though in a proper case the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>Court may decline to follow the action of an examiner in crediting and discrediting testimony even though the Board has adopted the examiner\u2019s findings. N. L. R. B. v. Elias Brothers Big Boy, Inc., 6 Cir., 1964, 327 F.2d 421, 426. We are not barred from setting aside the Board\u2019s decision if we cannot conscientiously find that the evidence supporting it is substantial, but we are not at liberty to displace the Board\u2019s choice if it is between two fairly conflicting views, even though we would justifiably have made a different choice had the matter been before us de novo. N. L. R. B. v. Certain-Teed Products Corp., 5 Cir., 1968, 387 F.2d 639; N. L. R. B. v. Camco, Inc., 5 Cir., 1966, 369 F.2d 125, 127. Considering the record as a whole, we conclude there is substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s findings of discrimination against Smith and Cleveland in violation of Section 8(a) (3) and (1) of the Act.
