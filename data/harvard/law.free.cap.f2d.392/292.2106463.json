We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-18\">Appellant\u2019s contention that the District Court erred in not requiring McConnell to testify in appellant\u2019s behalf is without merit. McConnell was a co-defendant who was then in the process of appealing his conviction. He did not waive his fifth amendment privilege and could not therefore be made to testify. 8 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 2268 at 410 (McNaughton rev. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-19\">It was not error to admit statements of McConnell made to federal undercover agents during the transaction in question outside the presence of appellant since they were made in furtherance of the conspiracy of which appellant was a member. United States v. Smith, 2 Cir. 1965, 343 F.2d 607; Lott v. United States, 5 Cir. 1956, 230 F.2d 915.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-20\">The nine month delay between the narcotics sale and appellant\u2019s arrest did not deny appellant a speedy trial, especially since no prejudice was shown. United States v. Ewell, 1966, 383 U.S. 116, 86 S.Ct. 773, 15 L.Ed.2d 627; Bruce v. United States, 5 Cir. 1965, 351 F.2d 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-21\">We have examined appellant\u2019s other specifications of error and find them utterly devoid of merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b369-23\">. 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 4704(a), 4705(a), 7237(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
