Appellee had been indicted for a violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 176a, and had pleaded not guilty. Jurisdiction here rests on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1294.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-14\">An appeal from another portion of the district court order was neither waived nor urged by the government, on oral argument. We consider it moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-15\">On the authority of Corngold v. United States, 367 F.2d 1 (9th Cir. 1966), the order of suppression is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1055-16\">BARNES, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A4b\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-17\">I respectfully dissent for the following reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-18\">(a) Those set forth in my dissent in Corngold v. United States, 367 F.2d 1 (9th Cir. 1966);</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-19\">(b) the facts herein show this was not a search by federal officers, but one undertaken and initiated solely by air line employees, in which government agents later participated to a limited, unsubstantial, and minor, degree. I conclude it was in truth a private search, and in no sense a government search;</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-21\">(c) the facts in this case more closely resemble those held controlling in Gold v. United States, 378 F.2d 588 (9th Cir. 1967), than they do those found in Corngold v. United States, supra.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
