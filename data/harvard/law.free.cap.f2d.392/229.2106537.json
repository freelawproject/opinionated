The first contract (hereafter referred to as No. 2787) was awarded on July 1, 1963, and the second (hereafter referred to as No. 3384) on October 1,1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-18\">The raincoats were to be manufactured according to patterns and specifications furnished by the Government. Although similar raincoats had been made by other contractors for the Marine Corps, the patterns and specifications for the instant contract were new as to the sleeve-setting and seaming operations, and it is the new specifications that are involved in the present suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-19\">Plaintiff reached the sleeve-setting operations and the sealing of the armholes under Contract No. 2787 approximately on September 1, 1963, having cut material for about 3,300 raincoats exactly in accordance with the Government-furnished pattern. As sleeves were set and the seams sealed on this first group of coats, plaintiff performed hydrostatic tests in its own laboratory on the semi-finished coats in the same manner and with the same equipment used by the Government. The contract provisions relevant to the sleeve-setting and sealing operations are set out below.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Mr. Dotson, plaintiff\u2019s general manager, testified that from the very beginning plaintiff encountered difficulty with the water resistance of the sleeve-armhole seam. He testified further that when the sleeve-armhole seams were sealed with the four coats of sealant, which was the usual number of coats of sealant used in the art,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> plaintiff encountered 50 percent hydrostatic test failures, i. e., the sleeve-armhole seams were not sufficiently waterproof.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">In searching for the cause of the sealing difficulties, plaintiff first double-checked all its own operations and materials. It made a few minor adjustments, but the difficulties continued unabated. The contractor finally concluded, after consultation with the Government technical adviser specifically assigned to this contract (Mr. Rossi), that the fault was in the Government-supplied patterns and specifications, viz., the seam width at the top of the armhole, required by the pattern to be % inch, had *4 inch surplus material after the seam was raised-stitched or \u201ccorded.\u201d By way of contrast, the specifications required a 3/8 inch seam at the bottom half of the armhole, which left only % inch surplus material after cording. It was discovered that the top half of the armhole seam (% inch surplus) caused sealing difficulties whereas the bottom half with its smaller seam allowance (% inch surplus), did not.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Both Dotson and Rossi concluded that the seam was too wide around the top half and this was the cause of the sealing difficulties. In addition, the sleeve was designed (by the Government) to have a certain fullness, which, in the process of sleevesetting, created ripples, pleats and tubes in which water collected during the hydrostatic tests. This accumulation of water increased the sealing problems caused by the surplus material or \u201cstep.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-11\">As a temporary solution, plaintiff applied additional coats of sealant on the defective seam construction. Many raincoats required four additional coats of sealant and some as many as eight additional coats of sealant. One lot of 1,280 completed coats (hereinafter referred to as Lot 1) was submitted to the Government on September 13, 1963. This lot passed the Government\u2019s hydrostatic tests and was accepted, although it must be remembered that many of these raincoats had eight and twelve coats of sealant on the sleeve-armhole seam. A second lot of 2,000 completed raincoats (hereafter referred to as Lot 2), with the usual number of coats of sealant on the troublesome seam, was then submitted to the Government, but this lot was rejected for failure of the hydrostatic tests again at the sleeve-armhole seam. Plaintiff then subjected this second lot of raincoats to an additional four or eight coats of sealant at the sleeve-armhole seam and re-submitted the coats. This time the lot was accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-12\">During the course of these difficulties with the sleeve-armhole seam, the contractor was in telephonic communication with the contracting officer, Mr. Reeder, and his technical adviser, Mr. Rossi. On September 24, after again discussing this problem, Dotson requested that Rossi come to plaintiff\u2019s plant for further consultation regarding the matter of the troublesome seam. It was agreed by both parties that such a trip would be advisable. In that same telephone conversation, the suggestion was made that plaintiff should experiment in the factory by trimming off the surplus material or \u201cstep\u201d, either in the cutting room or sewing room to determine whether the elimination of the step would solve the problem of hydrostatic test failures. Plaintiff was advised on that occasion to go ahead and experiment to see what it \u201ccould come up with.\u201d Plaintiff subsequently experimented by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>cutting the surplus off 1,500 coats in the cutting room and trimming approximately 2 to 3,000 coats in the sewing room.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">On October 8, 1963 a Government quality control representative, Mr. Cozzi, made a routine and unsolicited visit to plaintiff\u2019s plant and observed the cutting and trimming operations with which plaintiff was experimenting. Cozzi stated that such operations were unauthorized and told plaintiff to stop cutting and trimming. Plaintiff\u2019s president, Mr. Hays, told Cozzi of the seam-sealing problems it was having and that the deviation had been discussed with the contracting officer. The next day Dotson called the contracting officer and his technical adviser to report Cozzi\u2019s visit. Dotson was advised to keep experimenting in the sewing room, but to stop cutting in the cutting room.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">On October 21, Rossi, as previously arranged, visited plaintiff\u2019s plant and observed the contractor\u2019s manufacturing processes, including the armhole-trimming operation. Rossi asked Dotson whether the armhole leakage problem was solved, and was told that additional lots submitted to the Government, where the step (surplus material) had been trimmed off in the sewing room, had passed the Government\u2019s hydrostatic tests. After checking the hydrostatic test results of coats where the step was trimmed off and after consultation with plaintiff\u2019s president, Mr. Hays, Rossi advised the contractor to continue trimming off the steps in the sewing room. Rossi and Dotson also discussed the necessity for a change order and compensation for the additional trimming operation which was the apparent solution to the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">After October 21, 1963, plaintiff at least twice brought up the matter of the promised change order for the trimming operation to the contracting officer, Reeder, who took no action on the requests. The formal request for a change was not made until October of 1964, after both contracts had been completed. It was denied by a different contracting officer, and plaintiff subsequently took an appeal to the ASBCA which also denied the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">The second contract (No. 3384) referred to above, was awarded to plaintiff as of October 31, 1963. It provided for delivery of 102,320 raincoats identical to the ones being manufactured under the first contract. There were minor adjustments in unit price, although plaintiff\u2019s bid did not contain an allowance for the cost of the additional trimming operation. The bids on Contract No. 3384 were required to be in by October 9. Plaintiff\u2019s claim for an equitable change to compensate for the additional operation under this second contract was also denied by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">Plaintiff then brought suit in this court, and averred in its petition that the decisions of the Board (ASBCA) are not supported by substantial evidence. We agree with plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">The Board\u2019s decision regarding Contract No. 2787 held essentially two things:</p>\n<p id=\"b308-11\">First, that the sleeve-setting and seam-sealing operations required by the specifications were not, as a practical matter, impossible of performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-12\">Second, that plaintiff was not ordered by the contracting officer or his representative to perform the extra-contractual trimming operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-13\">We think that the Board was wrong on both counts. This conclusion is made with due regard to the strictures of the Wunderlich Act for review by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b308-15\"> With regard to the first issue, we think the Board took too narrow a view of what constitutes defective specifications. This is not a case of strict impossibility, as the Board assumed. Given the circumstances of this case, the correct standard should have been that if the Government-supplied patterns and specifications are complied with, \u201csatisfactory performance will result.\u201d J. D. Hedin Constr. Co. v. United States, 347 F.2d 235, 241, 171 Ct.Cl. 70, 76 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>(1965), citing, United States v. Spearin, 248 U.S. 132, 39 S.Ct. 59, 63 L.Ed. 166 (1918). This rule applies where, as in the instant case, the Government sees fit to prescribe detailed specifications. Hol-Gar Mfg. Corp. v. United States, 360 F.2d 634, 175 Ct.Cl. 518 (1966); J. D. Hedin Constr. Co., supra; R. M. Hollingshead Corp. v. United States, 111 F.Supp. 285, 124 Ct.Cl. 681 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The contract in the instant case contained patterns and specifications which dictated the exact measurements to be used in constructing the sleeve-armhole seam in dispute. The specifications required that the \u201cwidth of the seam shall be % inch at top side of armhole\u201d and that the \u201craised stitch around top side of armhole shall be % inch from edge.\u201d Given these precise measurements, the constructed seam necessarily had % inch of surplus material, i. e., the raw edges extended % inch from the raised stitching around the top half of the armhole. The pattern also required a certain fullness in the sleeve, which exacerbated the problem caused by the surplus material.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">It should be noted that this is not a case where the contractor <em>unilaterally </em>chooses a method of production which is the cheapest or most efficient method and then is disappointed because the specifications do not allow for the utilization of the best method of operation from the contractor\u2019s viewpoint. As we pointed out in Natus Corp. v. United States, 371 F.2d 450, 458, 178 Ct.Cl. 1, 13, (1967), \u201cthe Government does not guarantee the contractor\u2019s profit.\u201d Here plaintiff was <em>required </em>to construct a raincoat with a defective armhole seam by virtue of Government-supplied patterns and specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-12\">The question, then, is whether compliance with these detailed specifications would result in satisfactory performance. The Board has found that satisfactory performance was possible, in fact, accomplished in light of the fact that plaintiff\u2019s Lot 1 (1,280 raincoats) passed the Government\u2019s hydrostatic tests and was accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-13\">The Board\u2019s finding that satisfactory performance was possible must be rejected as not supported by substantial evidence and resting on a misinterpretation of the contract. To the contrary, the evidence conclusively demonstrates that the patterns and specifications provided by the Government, i. e., requiring a seam with 14 inch of surplus material, would not provide a satisfactory and workmanlike product.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-14\">One of the errors made by the Board in reaching its determination is based on a misinterpretation of the contract. The Board concluded that the contract required an indefinite number of coats of sealant to be applied to the seams, i. e., \u201cas many as necessary\u201d, not considering as relevant whether four, fourteen or forty coats were necessary. The Board\u2019s interpretation is based on a literal reading of the contract.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is obvious, however, that neither party construed the contract to require a limitless number of coats of sealant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The undisputed testimony before the Board by both parties was to the effect that the standard trade practice was to apply approximately four coats of sealant. In other words, previous experience in the industry had defined \u201csufficient number\u201d of coats of sealant as four or thereabouts. Although this fact was emphasized and reiterated during the course of the hearings, de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>fendant did not consistently deny the relevancy of this fact, as it would and should have, if the contract provision was indeed intended to diverge from standard practice, and require as many coats of sealant as necessary to pass the hydrostatic tests. In addition, the Government implicitly conceded this point at oral argument by arguing that four coats of sealant would have been sufficient <em>under these particular specifications; </em>but that the failures were due to contractor\u2019s sloppy workmanship.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">Even more relevant to a proper interpretation of this provision is the fact that neither plaintiff nor defendant considered the application of additional coats as the required answer to plaintiff\u2019s difficulties at the actual time the contract was being performed. If the parties\u2019 interpretation of this provision were the same as the Board\u2019s interpretation, the Government would have simply, and rightfully, directed the contractor to apply as many coats of sealant as necessary to pass the hydrostatic tests. Yet this was not done. Instead, both parties thought it necessary to experiment with the seam width in the cutting and sewing rooms.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Since the parties acted as they did, and since \u201cgreat weight is given to the practical interpretation of a contract by the parties to it before the contract becomes the subject of controversy,\u201d (Maxwell Dynamometer Co. v. United States, Ct.Cl., 386 F.2d 855, decided November 9, 1967) the Board\u2019s interpretation must be rejected as erroneous. Plaintiff had the right to assume that the coats, if made according to the Government-supplied specifications, could be properly sealed according to the standards of practice in the industry, and this means four coats of sealant or thereabouts.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">With this proper interpretation in mind, it is next necessary to analyze the prime consideration which led the Board to conclude that performance was possible, viz., that plaintiff\u2019s Lot 1 passed the Government\u2019s hydrostatic tests and was accepted without the surplus material being trimmmed off.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">The undisputed testimony before the Board was that the coats in Lot 1, when sealed with the usual number of coats of sealant did <em>not </em>pass the contractor\u2019s own hydrostatic tests. It was only <em>after </em>the contractor subjected the coats to sometimes four or as many as eight additional coats that the raincoats were re-submitted and accepted by the Government. As we have stated above, the contractor was not obliged to apply a limitless number of coats or sealant. The Board\u2019s argument that perhaps only one or two additional coats of sealant would have been sufficient in many instances is difficult to accept because the undisputed fact is that some coats required as many as twelve coats of sealant. Since it is impossible to determine visually which of the raincoats needed only a few additional coats and which needed twelve coats of sealant, it was necessary to treat all the coats within the base for the random sample to as many coats as the one tested required. This is exactly the procedure followed by plaintiff, and criticized by the Board. The only other possibility would have been to pre-test every single coat before it was submitted to the Government. This must certainly be considered an unreasonable burden and one which neither party expected.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">Another undisputed fact which tends to demonstrate the lack of substantiality of the. Board\u2019s conclusion is that Lot 2, which was constructed exactly according to the specifications (with the % inch surplus) and treated to the standard four coats of sealant, did <em>not </em>pass the Government\u2019s hydrostatic tests, and consequently was rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">The Board has stated that the reason for the failure of Lot 2 is not because of the surplus material, but because of poor workmanship on the part of plaintiff\u2019s employees. The most that can be said for this finding is that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>are isolated bits of evidence which when viewed in isolation, do seem to support it. But we find that there is not substantial evidence on the whole record to support it, and this is the standard set by the Wunderlich Act, and which we must adhere to.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">There are some statements in the record to the effect that plaintiff\u2019s employees were applying the sealant improperly, not distributing the fullness of the sleeve properly, and not mixing the sealant properly. Admittedly this may have had some effect on plaintiff\u2019s difficulties. However, the evidence indicates conclusively that the surplus material, which resulted from following the Government-supplied patterns and specifications, was the real culprit causing plaintiff\u2019s sealing difficulties.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">The fact that supports our conclusion most forcefully is a simple comparison. The first 3,300 coats were constructed with the surplus material on the sleeve-armhole seam, and plaintiff encountered the difficulties described aboye. By contrast, the remaining 156,000 coats supplied to the Government were constructed with the surplus material trimmed off and every lot save one passed the Government\u2019s hydrostatic tests. This is more than coincidence. The most skeptical empiricist would deduce that there is a causal relationship between the existence of the surplus material and the hydrostatic test failures. Yet there is more evidence, both factual and testimonial, supporting this relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">There was uncontradicted testimony by Mr. Dotson that the leakage occurred at the top half of the armhole, and not the bottom half. It will be remembered that the % inch surplus material or step was only around the top half of the-, armhole, and not the bottom half. Again, the relationship between the surplus material and the leakage is impossible to ignore.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">In addition, Mr. Rossi, in his report written after visiting plaintiff\u2019s plant and studying plaintiff\u2019s hydrostatic test results, concluded that \u201cthe trimming operation is <em>necessary.\u201d </em>[Emphasis supplied.] Mr. Levearl Hayes, the quality control representative permanently based at plaintiff\u2019s plant, also made a written report as a consequence of Mr. Rossi\u2019s visit, and he stated that \u201cthe net results of removing the step [surplus material] has been that the contractor has had no more failures for the hydrostatic test in the Laboratory Division.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">An additional fact which supports this conclusion, although we do not rely on it, is that the Government later changed the specifications on all subsequent contracts regarding this type of raincoat to <em>require </em>the trimming operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b311-12\">The second error by the Board involves its conclusion that the additional operation was not performed by virtue of any Government \u201corder\u201d; consequently plaintiff was acting as a mere volunteer. This conclusion is not based on substantial evidence nor upon a proper interpretation of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-13\">In the first instance, it is well settled that the absence of a written change order does not bar recovery when both the contracting officer and ASBCA considered the merits of the claim. See, Kings Electronics Co. v. United States, 341 F.2d 632, 639, 169 Ct.Cl. 433, 443 (fn. 15) (1965); Fox Valley Engineering, Inc. v. United States, 151 Ct.Cl. 228, 237 (1960). In the instant case, plaintiff\u2019s claim was considered on the merits by the Board, even though the change order was not written, but oral, and so it must be considered here on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-14\">The next question is whether the change order must be given by the contracting officer himself or whether that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>authority can' be delegated. Although it is conceded here that Reeder himself did not order the additional operation, his technical adviser, Charles Rossi, directed the performance of the additional operation by authority of, and with knowledge of the contracting officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\"> The Board has not stated that the contracting officer can never delegate his authority, since it is well known that he can so delegate. See, e. g., <em>Fox Valley Engineering, Inc., </em>supra, at 238-240. Instead, the Board has found that Rossi was a mere \u201ctechnical\u201d representative acting in a \u201cnoncontractual capacity.\u201d This characterization of Rossi\u2019s function is not supported by substantial evidence on the whole record.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The plain undisputed fact is that Rossi was sent to plaintiff\u2019s plant in Alabama by the contracting officer for the sole purpose of settling the problem involving the surplus material and hydrostatic test failures. An integral part of this function is that of giving guidance and any necessary instructions to the contractor. If Rossi were not sent to Alabama for this purpose, then his visit loses all significance. In fact, Rossi was successful, and did find the solution to the problem, and instructed the contractor to adopt the solution. Liability for the actions of a Government agent, who carried out exactly what he was ordered to do, cannot be avoided by pointing to labels. The appellation, \u201ctechnical adviser\u201d, does not detract from Rossi\u2019s <em>actual </em>function. It is to the actuality that we must look.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">It is also incongruous to say that Rossi did not have the authority to direct a change while he was at plaintiff\u2019s plant, yet did have authority when he returned to Philadelphia. Cf., <em>Fox Valley Engineering, Inc., </em>supra, at 240. Yet this is, in effect, the Board\u2019s position. From the testimony before the Board, it is clear that Reeder himself would not make such a decision, but would rely on Rossi, because of the technical nature of the decision. (Transcript at pp. 155-156):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-7\">Q. And you didn\u2019t have any details as to what the nature of the operation [trimming operation] was or the additional costs involved in these conversations ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-10\">A. (Mr. Reeder): I normally don\u2019t dig into that area. I depend on technical advice for this kind of thing * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Avk\">Since Rossi would, in effect, be making the decision as to whether to perform the additional operation, it does not matter whether he made it in Alabama or Philadelphia.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-11\">It is also undisputed that Rossi himself understood the effective division of authority between himself and the contracting officer vis-a-vis technical matters. [Transcript at p. 127] :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-12\">Q. Now, Mr. Rossi, you have been in this business, a long time, have you not, and do you have to be a lawyer to know, if you instructed a contractor to perform additional operation, he would be entitled to additional costs ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-13\">A. (Rossi): <em>This is true, </em>but I didn\u2019t instruct him to perform an additional operation. [Emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-14\">Although Rossi admitted he could instruct a contractor to perform additional operations, he later attempted to negate this testimony by stating that he did not really have authority to instruct contractors or \u201cto give his [contracting officer\u2019s] money away\u201d. [Tr. at p. 127] It is obvious, however, that the qualification Rossi was attempting to articulate was that <em>ultimate </em>authority probably rested in the contracting officer. He was, in effect, saying that Reeder could always overrule his (Rossi\u2019s) judgment. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>this is true, the facts and conclusions in this case remain unchanged since the threshold decision to direct the additional operation was made by Rossi and acquiesced in by Reeder. It is undisputed that the reports of Rossi and Levearl Hayes, both of which refer to the promised change order, were sent to Reeder. <em>He chose not to exercise his ultimate authority, and so ratified Rossi\u2019s decision.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b312-15\">The only real question then is whether Rossi instructed plaintiff to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>perform the additional operation. The Board\u2019s finding in the negative to this question is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The only supportable conclusion that can be drawn from the evidence is that Rossi, on the occasion of his visit to plaintiff\u2019s plant, instructed plaintiff to stop experimenting in other areas, but to continue trimming the \u201cstep\u201d in the sewing room on all future lots of raincoats. The matter of a suitable change order and additional compensation was also discussed at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Although Rossi\u2019s visit to plaintiff\u2019s plant is the critical event in our minds, it should- not be viewed in isolation, but as part of the totality of events and communications between plaintiff and defendant leading up to and including October 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Although there is some conflicting testimony by Rossi as to what transpired during his visit to plaintiff\u2019s plant, the above-recited version is verified by a three-page written report prepared by Rossi himself immediately after his visit, and before the beginning of any litigation. The report, dated November 1, 1963, noted that the step trimming operation was \u201csubstantially in line with the procedure suggested by the writer [Rossi] to the contractor in several telephone conversations previous to the visit to the plant concerning the problem\u201d. The report went on to conclude:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-8\">There was not much that could be added to the <em>instruction </em>that had already been given by the writer to the contractor in previous telephonic conversations. These <em>instructions </em>seem to have born [sic] fruit * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AP5\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-9\"><em>The trimming operation is necessary and contractor will be intitled </em>[sic] <em>to a monetary adjustment if he makes a claim. </em>[Report at pp. 1, 3] [Emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">Mr. Levearl Hayes, the Government quality control representative based at plaintiff\u2019s plant in 1963, accompanied Rossi and Dotson during the former\u2019s visit to plaintiff\u2019s plant. Hayes also wrote a report, dated October 28, which is in substantial compliance with Dotson\u2019s testimony before the Board and Rossi\u2019s contemporaneous written report. Hayes\u2019 report stated <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-12\">1. <em>The Contracting Officer [and] Quality Specialist </em>[Rossi] assigned to this contract <em>requested </em>the contractor to experiment and determine a method to join the armhole that would give the best hydrostatic results. * * * The net results of removing the step has been the contractor has had no more failures for the hydrostatic test in the Lab. Div. In addition the appearance of the sleeve in my opinion has improved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-13\">2. * * * <em>The request </em>to remove the step <em>by the Contracting Officer and Quality Specialist </em>made the applicable Commodity Division aware of the removal of the step. I had no reason to question their doing this for there was reason to remove the step to make the hydrostatic testing better.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-14\">3. * * * The Contractor has now agreed with Q C Specialist Charles Rossi on his visit to the plant to remove the step by adding an operation in the sewing room.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-15\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-16\">6. On 21-22 Oct. 63 this plant was visited by Mr. Charles Rossi, Q C Spec. <em>The removal of the step was settled and a change order will be issued to correct the deviation </em>mentioned in Mr. Cozzi\u2019s report. [Emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-17\">On the basis of the oral testimony and these reports it is conclusively demonstrated that Rossi instructed plaintiff to trim the step on all future lots of raincoats.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-18\">It is also untenable to argue that plaintiff was performing this additional operation for its own benefit, because the contractor was sure, at least in its own mind, that the fault was with the specifications in providing too wide an armhole seam. This view was concurred in by Rossi, in that he, too, thought the seam <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>was too wide, and that the trimming operation was \u201cnecessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">It is not necessary to discuss the Board\u2019s contention that any change order promised by Rossi may well be a \u201cno-cost\u201d change order, since Rossi\u2019s report concluded that the contractor would be entitled to a \u201cmonetary\u201d adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">For these reasons we find as a matter of law that Rossi did instruct plaintiff to perform the additional trimming operation with the acquiescence and ratification of Reeder, the contracting officer. Cf., W. H. Armstrong &amp; Co. v. United States, 98 Ct.Cl. 519 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The only remaining question involves plaintiff\u2019s claim for compensation for the additional trimming operation under the second contract (No. 3384). The Board held with reference to this contract that plaintiff\u2019s claim must be rejected \u201cbecause at the time of appellant\u2019s amended bid, it knew that in the first contract it had under-estimated the cost of the armhole seam sealing process or had to add the cost of the added trimming operation. It was charged with notice of these matters in preparing its bid for Contract No. 3384 * * *, and cannot by this route correct its deficient bid.\u201d (ASBCA Opinion at p. 10).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">This argument, too, must be rejected. Although plaintiff here is attempting to correct a deficient bid, it is not the situation where plaintiff had all the appropriate considerations at its disposal at the time of bidding, as the Board presumed. Closing time for bidding on the second contract was October 9. At this point in time, plaintiff only knew that there were sealing difficulties with the armhole seam; it had no way of knowing what the solution would be. Certainly we cannot charge plaintiff with constructive notice of a fact not yet established. Since plaintiff was not in a position to make a rational adjustment of its bid, it cannot be barred from recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">For all of the above reasons, the court concl\u00fades as a matter of law that plaintiff is entitled to recover for the additional trimming operation the stipulated amounts of $3,644.68 under Contract No. 2787, and $5,690.40 under Contract No. 3384. Judgment is entered to that effect.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b306-11\"> Facts necessary to support the court\u2019s judgment in this case are set forth in the decision.

While it is admitted that under the contract more than four coats of sealant might be appropriate on occasional individual raincoats, this provision did not require, nor was it intended to require, a limitless number of coats of. sealant when the sealing difficulties are caused by defects in <em>other </em>specifications. It was not intended to be a general cure-all for any other problem that might arise. This is especially true here, where more than 50 percent of the raincoats were unacceptable because of the excess material around the top half of the armhole seam.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b310-10\">.

As mentioned earlier, many of the minor defects (relied on by the Board) pointed out to plaintiff by technical adviser Rossi were corrected, and still the sealing difficulties continued unabated. What little relationship there was between the minor defects and the sealing difficulties, if any, cannot be supported by anything more than speculation, especially in view of the evidence showing the causal effect of the surplus material.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b314-10\">SKELTON, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AVe\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">I agree with the results reached in the opinion written by Judge Durfee, but I would arrive at the decision in a somewhat different manner as to some aspects of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-12\">It appears to me to be unnecessary to hold that the decisions of the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (ASBCA or Board) are not supported by substantial evidence. The evidence was disputed, and this puts the court in the position of having to distinguish between what is substantial evidence and what is not. Sometimes this can be a difficult question to determine. I believe we do not have to decide it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-13\">The evidence in this case is of such a nature that as a matter of law the Board could have made only one finding of fact on the controlling issue in the case, namely if the detailed patterns and specifications furnished by the government had been complied with by the contractor, as it reasonably interpreted them and as requiring four coats of sealants on the armhole seams, satisfactory performance would not have been possible. See Maxwell Dynamometer Co. v. United States, Ct.Cl., 386 F.2d 855 decided November 9, 1967. Since this question of fact is to be determined as a matter of law, the court can make this finding without sending the case back to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-14\">The specifications and patterns furnished by the government were defective and if followed by the contractor and with four coats of sealants on the armholes (which was recognized as being the correct number in the trade), the raincoats would not have passed the test. This was true with respect to the coats in Lot 1. It was only after four to eight additional coats of sealant were applied that they passed. The coats in Lot 2 were constructed strictly in accordance with the specifications (with the (4 inch surplus material on the armhole seams) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>and with four coats of sealant failed to pass.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Other circumstances show that the specifications were defective. When the surplus material was trimmed from the armhole seams and four coats of sealant were applied, the coats passed. Also, the Board inferentially recognized that they were defective in rendering its decision on the second contract when it stated that the contractor in making its bid knew that it had underestimated the cost of the armhole seam sealing process <em>\u201cor had to add the cost of the added trimming operation.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.) This shows that the Board thought the specifications in both contracts were defective. Also, while not controlling, it is shown that the government later changed the specifications regarding this type of coat so as to require the surplus material to be trimmed from the armhole seams.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The parties themselves showed by their acts and conduct before any controversy arose that the specifications and patterns were defective. The facts conclusively show that if they were followed, the coats would not pass the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Accordingly, I would hold as a matter of law that the contractor\u2019s interpretation of the contracts and of the trade practice as to sealants was reasonable and binding on defendant, and that the specifications were factually impossible to comply with if the coats were to pass the tests. See Hol-Gar Mfg. Corp. v. United States, 360 F.2d 634, 175 Ct.Cl. 518 (1966); Maxwell Dynamometer Co. v. United States, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">The plaintiff is entitled to- recover the costs incident to its attempts to comply with these defective specifications in the stipulated amounts of $3,644.68 and $5,690.40.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b315-9\">DAVIS, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AyR\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">I see the record quite differently. The vital findings of the ASBCA seem to me well supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole. I select for discussion two dispositive Board conclusions of fact which the court overturns \u2014 improperly, in my view. One is the finding that Rossi, the technical adviser or specialist, never gave an order to the plaintiff to trim the \u201cstep\u201d. The Board declared, and the court does not disagree, that if such an order was given it must have been on Rossi\u2019s visit to the plant on October 21, 1963. The Board then goes on to find that no such order was given. This was, in large part, an issue of conflicting testimony. The company\u2019s witnesses said that they had been so instructed. Rossi denied this on the stand, saying unequivocally (both on direct and on cross-examination) that he never instructed the contractor to remove the \u201cstep\u201d in the sewing room and never told them they would be entitled to additional payment. The Board obviously thought this testimony more credible, for one reason, because \u201cat the time of that visit appellant [plaintiff] had been, performing this operation on its own initiative for about three weeks and had continued to do so, although the Quality Control Representative [Mr. Cozzi] who visited its plant on 8 October 1963, had objected thereto; indeed appellant telephoned the contracting officer at that time to obtain his permission to continue this additional operation.\u201d The reports made after Mr. Rossi\u2019s visit can be read (as the court does) as suggesting, on the other hand, that an order was in fact given, but this reading is disputable and, in any event, it is the Board\u2019s function not the court\u2019s \u2014 especially where there is conflicting testimony \u2014 to evaluate all the factors tending one way or the other. It is a rare case indeed that we could upset an administrative finding based on explicit oral testimony such as Rossi\u2019s. \u201cSubstantial evidence is \u2018enough to justify, if the trial were to a jury, a refusal to direct a verdict when the conclusion sought to be drawn from it is one of fact for the jury.\u2019 National Labor Relations Board v. Columbian Enameling &amp; Stamping Co., 306 U.S. 292, 300, 59 S.Ct. 501, 83 L.Ed. 660 (1939).\u201d Illinois Central R. R. v. Norfolk &amp; Western Ry., 385 U.S. 57, 66, 87 S.Ct. 255, 260, 17 L.Ed.2d 162 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>The other dispositive finding relates to faults in plaintiff\u2019s manufacturing and testing processes which, the Board found, were more probably the cause of the failure of its second lot to pass the hydrostatic tests. The Board noted that (i) Mr. Cozzi, the Government\u2019s quality control representative, observed a failure by the contractor\u2019s workers to distribute the sleeve fullness properly so that the armhole became puckered and twisted; (ii) Mr. Rossi\u2019s testimony and written report noted that some of the differences as to test results may have stemmed from the fact that plaintiff tested uncompleted coats and that the sealant may not have had proper consistency; and (iii) most significantly, the second lot failed the defendant\u2019s tests not only because of leakage at the armhole seam but also at the side seam. Since no \u201cstep\u201d was involved in the side seam, the Board thought that it could only attribute the leak at that point \u201cto insufficient sealing either in material quality or in the care with which the sealant was applied.\u201d The Board added that even after the company \u201cengaged in the described trimming operation, it was still possible to have leakage from unskillful or inadequate application of sealant to the armhole seam, as appellant proved by the failure of the hydrostatic tests of lot 17 under Contract No. 2787.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">The court gives three main grounds for rejecting the Board\u2019s findings: The many coats with the \u201cstep\u201d trimmed off passed the tests (except for the one lot) while the earlier coats bearing the surplus material failed; the leakage occurred at the top half of the armhole (where the \u201cstep\u201d is located), not the bottom half; and statements in the reports of Government representatives to the effect that the trimming operation was \u201cnecessary.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These are certainly reasons which could persuade a fact-finder, but they are not conclusive. After all, one later lot (No. 17) did fail even after the trimming off of the \u201cstep\u201d, and the side-seam leaked even though no \u201cstep\u201d was involved. The Board could find that these failures were caused by faulty workmanship (including insufficient sealing) and that this same neglect, rather than the \u201cstep\u201d, caused the leakage on the early tests.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff\u2019s care would probably be greater after it experienced its troubles, and after the rejection of the second lot, and that is why, the Board could decide, the contractor\u2019s experience was better with the later inspections. The improved results after the removal of the \u201cstep\u201d could, indeed, have been coincidental to that operation; <em>post hoc </em>is not always <em>propter hoc. </em>Reasonable inferences of this type are for the administrative tribunal, not for us, to evaluate and make. Federal Trade Comm\u2019n v. Pacific States Paper Trade Ass\u2019n, 273 U.S. 52, 63, 47 S.Ct. 255, 71 L.Ed. 534 (1927); Illinois Central R. R. v. Norfolk &amp; Western Ry., supra. The \u201cpossibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620, 86 S.Ct. 1018, 1026, 16 L.Ed.2d 131 (1966). In particular, it is not the rule that a board finding can stand only if the court agrees with it or cannot easily make up its mind, or where the evidence is very closely bal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>anced. Just as with jury verdicts, board findings which affirmatively appear to us to be incorrect or questionable are often sustained by \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d on the record as a whole, and must therefore be left undisturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">In this connection it is important to note that the evidence as to trade practice shows, not that four coats was always the rigid upper limit, but that four or five would be usual, and sometimes six. The Board criticized the contractor for jumping (in multiples of four) from four to eight to twelve coats, saying that perhaps only one or two additional coats would have been sufficient. The court, in turn, criticizes the Board because <em>\u201csome </em>coats required as many as twelve coats of sealant\u201d and \u201cit is impossible to determine visually which of the raincoats needed only a few additional coats and which needed twelve coats of sealant\u201d (emphasis added). What the court overlooks is that the Board could reasonably find that in the relatively few instances in which twelve coats were needed (before the item passed the early tests) the extra coats, above 5 or 6, could have been due to plaintiff\u2019s fault in mixing or applying the sealant, not to the existence of the \u201cstep\u201d. If the contractor\u2019s neglect caused that many applications of sealant to be needed in some cases, the defendant cannot be held responsible for plaintiff\u2019s decision to increase the sealant-coats in multiples of four for all the garments.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The sum of it is that, if this were a jury trial, I could not set aside a verdict for the Government on this record. The same test applies here, as the Supreme Court has reiterated. I must therefore accept the Board\u2019s two dispositive findings that no order was given to plaintiff and that its difficulties were caused by its own insufficiencies. Either of these findings is enough to conclude the case against plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">I add that I agree with the court as to the rule for defective Government-supplied specifications, but think that the Board applied the same rule in substance, though it used different words. I agree also with the court (and disagree with the Board) that the contract called upen the contractor to apply only the number of coats of sealant required by the standard trade practice. However, this legal error of the Board in interpreting the agreement was immaterial to its dispositive factual findings which I believe we must accept.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">NICHOLS, Judge, joins in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b316-6\">. In his oral testimony, Rossi testified that the trimming operation may have been necessary to this particular contractor, because of the way it operated, but would not be necessary for others doing the same type of work if they applied the sealant properly. Rossi emphasized that plaintiff was making the top armhole seam too wide, and that this caused the \u201cstep\u201d; in his opinion the \u201cstep\u201d was a necessary result of the contractor\u2019s less-than-adequate manufacturing methods.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b316-15\">. The plurality says, in a footnote, that many of the minor defects in plaintiff\u2019s workmanship were corrected and still the sealing difficulties continued unabated. The Board did not make any such finding that the defects to which it referred were corrected before the second batch of garments was rejected, and the record does not compel that conclusion, and may not even permit it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
