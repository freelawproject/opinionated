Goldblatt, Cotten, Leigh and George Faigen appeal from their convictions for substantively violating 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1952(a) (3) and for conspiring to vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>late the same statute; Wechsler and Seymour Faigen were acquitted on the substantive count and appeal from their convictions on the conspiracy count. The central question presented is whether the offense of using a facility in interstate commerce to promote, manage, establish, or carry on bribery and thereafter performing an act to promote, manage, establish, or carry on bribery is to be equated with, and limited by, the state law of bribery. We think not and affirm the convictions of all appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">In 1960, the developer-defendants were interested in procuring a zoning change from residential to mobile homes for 84.3 acres of land in Fairfax County which they wanted to use as a trailer park. Sufficient evidence was introduced at trial for the jury to find the following facts. On March 9, 1960, George Faigen filed an application for the re-zoning. A year later, but before the Board of Supervisors had acted upon the application, the four defendant-partners placed a check for $5,500 in escrow in the Security Bank of Washington for John C. Somers, an attorney who often handled zoning cases in Fairfax County on a contingent fee basis, conditioned upon favorable action by the Board. Two months later, on July 26, 1961, the Board acted favorably on Faigen\u2019s application on the affirmative votes of Leigh, Cotten, DeBell <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and another. On August 7, the developer-defendants instructed the Security Bank to release the $5,500 check to Somers who deposited it to his own account on August 18, the day on which he was notified by the bank. Somers was instructed by Leigh to run the cheek through his own account and then make out a check for the same amount to Leigh, and did so. Somers had performed no work for developer defendants at any time, and in 1961 he knew none of them except Goldblatt.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Leigh deposited the check to his account on August 19, and on August 22 he wrote a check to DeBell for $1,308.33; on August 23, he wrote a check to himself for $1,333; and on September 9, he wrote a check to Cotten for $1,000. Cotten\u2019s secretary entered the $1,000 cheek as a legal fee in Cotten\u2019s checkbook and receipts book and deposited the check to Cotten\u2019s account on September 15. On September 13, 1961, Congress enacted 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952. Because the state courts of Virginia set aside the original Board action, it was necessary for George Faigen to file a new application on June 20, 1962. This second application was considered by the Board on July 25, 1962, and again it was approved, this time on the affirmative votes of Cotton, Leigh, DeBell, and two others. Three letters, two by Goldblatt and one by George Faigen, connected with the effort to procure the re-zoning were mailed on June 17 and 18 and on July 21, 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">The most serious argument advanced by the appellants, and the one on which most of their other arguments depend, is that their crime was complete before the statute was enacted. We disagree. Their theory is that under Virginia law the crime of bribery is complete upon the giving, offering, or promising of a bribe even though the official act to be done in consideration therefor is to occur in futuro. The fallacy in their argument lies in a too heavy reliance on state law. The state crime serves \u201conly as a background identification of the unlawful activities.\u201d United States v. Wingo (6th Cir. 1967)<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>; United States v. Kubacki, 237 F.Supp. 638, 643 (E.D.Pa.1965). We have no doubt that when the money passed, if not before, the state law of bribery had been violated and that appellants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>could then have been indicted in the state courts; in that sense their crime was <em>complete. </em>But, their crime was not yet completed. Their activities continued beyond that point and indeed, beyond the date on which the statute was enacted. The manifest purpose of the statute is to deny the use of facilities in interstate commerce to those who would effect a wrong on the people by corrupting public officials. The wrong was not done to the people until the re-zoning was accomplished and the accomplishment of that wrong, after the use of a facility in interstate commerce, is one of the activities at which the statute is aimed. Thus, the <em>federal </em>crime continued until the re-zoning was accomplished on July 25, 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The statute was enacted on September 13, 1961; on September 15, Cotten caused the check from Leigh to be deposited in his bank account, and the jury could have found that this check was in payment for Cot-ten\u2019s vote. Depositing that check in a bank for collection was the use of a \u201cfacility in interstate or foreign commerce.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On July 25, 1962, Cotton voted in favor of the re-zoning. Thus, he used a facility in interstate commerce to facilitate the carrying oh of bribery and <em>thereafter </em>performed the carrying on of bribery, squarely within the terms of the statute, after the statute was enacted. As applied to Cotten, then, the statute had no ex post facto effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-13\">By the same token, the conspiracy convictions of each of the appellants must be affirmed. Appellants argue that a new trial is necessitated by the trial judge\u2019s instruction that the jury could convict if one of the conspirators committed any of the several overt acts charged in the indictment, several of which were not acts in furtherance of <em>bribery </em>and occurred, under appellants\u2019 theory, after the conspiracy had ended. But in order to have convicted Cotten of the substantive offense, the jury must have found that he deposited his cheek from Leigh, and this was one of the overt acts to which the trial judge referred. Each member of the conspiracy is chargeable with acts performed by other members in furtherance of the conspiracy. Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U.S. 640, 66 S.Ct. 1180, 90 L.Ed. 1489 (1946).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Further, appellants were not charged with a conspiracy to commit <em>bribery, </em>but with a conspiracy to violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Each of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>overt acts listed in the indictment were acts which would have furthered this conspiracy and each was performed after the statute was enacted and before the conspiracy ended, according to our holding, on July 25, 1962, when the Board acted affirmatively on the re-zoning application.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">On the other hand, rather serious problems are raised in connection with the substantive convictions of each of the appellants other than Cotten. But because we affirm their conspiracy convictions and because the sentences on each count are to run concurrently, a reversal of the substantive convictions would be fruitless. We, thus, find it unnecessary to resolve those problems.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U.S. 81, 85, 63 S.Ct. 1375, 87 L.Ed. 1774 (1943); Gorin v. United States, 312 U.S. 19, 33, 61 S.Ct. 429, 85 L.Ed. 488 (1941); Brooks v. United States, 267 U.S. 432, 441, 45 S.Ct. 345, 69 L.Ed. 699 (1925).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Many of the other arguments advanced by appellants are dependent upon the answer to the problem just discussed and, hence, fall with the statutory construction that we have adopted. However, there remain two arguments that merit brief mention. Appellant Leigh urges that it was error for the trial judge to require the defendants to agree on a trial location within the Eastern District of Virginia as a condition for fixing the place of trial somewhere within the district other than Alexandria under Fed.R.Crim.P. 18. But a motion for change of venue under Fed.R.Crim.P. 21(a) had already been denied; the condition was merely an attempt by the trial court to accommodate the defendants in keeping with the rule\u2019s mandate that the place of trial is to be fixed within the district \u201cwith due regard to the convenience of the defendant and the witnesses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">Second, appellants contend that it was error for the trial judge to limit the testimony of William DeMik, an attorney. DeMik, on direct examination, testified that Wechsler had asked him about Somers, that he had investigated and had reported to Wechsler that Somers was an attorney who was extremely well connected with the Board of Supervisors. He was then asked if he had given Wechsler any advice; at that point the trial judge interrupted and <em>sua sponte </em>interposed an objection. The offer of proof was that DeMik would testify that he had advised Wechsler to settle with Somers thus supporting defendants\u2019 theory that the $5,500 had been put in escrow as settlement of a legal fee due to Somers. We find it unnecessary to decide if exclusion of this testimony was error, for we find no effect on the substantial rights of the parties within the meaning of 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2111. Dobrow, the fifth partner, testified that Somers had been employed as an attorney to assist in the zoning, that a fee of $15,500 had been discussed, that Wechsler had been delegated by the partners to annul <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>the preliminary arrangements after Gibson, another attorney retained to work on the same matter, had refused to work with Somers, and that a $5,500 settlement had been arranged with Somers. Further, another witness testified that he had told Weschler, after investigating, that Somers was a person not without influence and that he was reasonably certain that Somers \u201ccould be somewhat harmful.\u201d There is, then, very little that DeMik\u2019s testimony could have added to the jury\u2019s knowledge. Moreover, ' the contentions of the defendants were carefully spelled out in the charge to the jury. In these circumstances, we can find no prejudice justifying a new trial. See, Harper v. United States, 143 F.2d 795, 806 (8th Cir. 1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">We have carefully considered the other numerous arguments advanced on behalf of all appellants and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b422-5\">. Acquitted below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b422-6\">. Somers also testified that he had not reported the check as income on his 1961 tax return and that he had invoked the Fifth Amendment six times before the Grand Jury after which he had been given immunity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b422-10\"> On December 8, 1967, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit entered an order in Wingo withdrawing the opinion and vacating the order affirming the judgment, and restoring the case on the docket as a pending appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b423-7\">. When one deposits a check, there would seem to be little doubt that he is using a facility in interstate commerce. Banks have often been held to be involved in interstate commerce for other purposes. E. g., N.L.R.B. v. Bank of America, 130 F.2d 624 (9th Cir. 1942) (National Labor Relations Act); Lorenzetti v. American Trust Co., 45 F.Supp. 128 (N.D.Cal.1942) (Fair Labor Standards Act). Moreover, Government Exhibit No. 12, the check from Leigh to Cotten, shows that the check was drawn on a Virginia bank and bears the endorsement of a Washington, D. C. bank. Nor do we doubt that the evidence was sufficient for the jury to find the requisite statutory intent. See, United States v. Wingo (6th Cir. 1967). To paraphrase our holding in an analogous situation, there must be some connection between the unlawful activity and the use of a facility in interstate commerce, but \u201cwe think it sufficient under section 1952 that the defendant knowingly caused to be transmitted interstate * * * proceeds of a [bribery] which was unlawful under the [Virginia] statute.\u201d United States v. Hawthorne, 356 F.2d 740, 742 (4th Cir. 1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b423-15\">. Since Seymour Paigen has been acquitted of the substantive count and since the punishment of the other appellants would not be affected, we decline to consider whether Cotten\u2019s commission of the substantive offense was in furtherance of the conspiracy so as to make all conspirators equally liable for the substantive offense as well as the conspiracy. See, Pinkerton v. United States, id., 328 U.S. at 647, 66 S.Ct. 1180; United States v. McGuire, 249 F.Supp. 43, 48 (S.D.N.Y. 1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b423-16\">. Appellants seriously urge that at the outset the trial judge construed Count I of the indictment to mean that they were charged with a conspiracy to commit bribery, and that later the theory was switched to read Count I as charging them with a conspiracy to procure a rezoning by means of bribery. Since the indictment quite clearly charges a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>spiracy to violate \u00a7 1952, such a switch, if indeed it occurred, would have entitled appellants to no more than a continuance on the grounds of surprise. No such motion was made.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b424-7\">. While we do not decide the question, we note that there is a serious question as to whether any of the appellants, other than Cotten, used a facility in interstate commerce and <em>thereafter </em>performed an act prohibited by the statute. Sigmund Goldblatt and George Faigen both wrote and mailed letters after the date of the statute, but it is seriously urged that the only act that they can be said to have performed <em>thereafter </em>is the appearance of Lytton Gibson, an attorney, before the Board of Supervisors on behalf of the partnership. Although traditional agency concepts might support the theory that Gibson\u2019s act was the act of each of the partners, ordinarily such an appearance is precisely the kind of activity in which, as the trial judge charged, any citizen has the right to engage; there is serious doubt that this act was shown to be one which was done to promote bribery. Conversely, Claiborne Leigh was shown to have performed an act after the statute was enacted (i.e., his vote), but it is doubtful that he was shown to have made use of a facility in interstate commerce before that act and after the effective date of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b425-7\">WINTER, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AKK\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">I agree wholeheartedly that one of the general purposes of Congress in the enactment of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1952 was \u201cto deny the use of facilities in interstate commerce to those who would effect a wrong on the people by corrupting public officials.\u201d But in seeking to punish this class of wrongdoers, the government must be held to the exact class of transgressors whose activities Congress outlawed. To my mind, these defendants do not fall into this group.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-16\">The facts need not be extensively restated ; only certain dates should be pointed up. The $5,500 bribe to accomplish favorable rezoning of the tract in question was removed from escrow and deposited to Somers\u2019 bank account on August 18, 1961. The next day it went into Leigh\u2019s bank account. From there, shares were disbursed to the three public officials who accomplished the rezoning. Specifically, one of them, Bell (who was acquitted at the trial) received a check in payment on August 22, 1961; Leigh, one of the others, made disbursement to himself on August 23, 1961; and the final payment was made to a third, Cotten, by check dated September 9, 1961. Cotten\u2019s bookkeeper did not deposit Cotten\u2019s check until September 15, 1961. Meanwhile, \u00a7 1952 became effective September 13, 1961. Because the initial rezoning was set aside by the courts\u2019 repetition of the rezoning, <em>but without the payment of any additional bribe, </em>took place in June and July, 1962. In connection with the second rezoning, the United States mails were used on June 17 and 18 and on July 21, 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-17\">The statute, which was the basis of the substantive count of the indictment and the violation of which was the object of the alleged conspiracy in the conspiracy count of the indictment, is set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> So far as pertinent here, the statute makes unlawful the conduct of one who uses any facility in interstate or foreign commerce, including the mail, <em>with intent to promote, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate the promotion, management, establishment or carrying on of <em>bribery in violation of the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia </em>and thereafter performs or attempts to perform the crime of bribery in violation of those laws. The Virginia statutes defining the criminal conduct constituting bribery are likewise set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is clear under Virginia law, as the majority tacitly concedes, that the latest point in time at which the crime of bribery is complete is <em>not </em>when the public official commits the act for which he is bribed, but when the bribe is given and the official accepts the bribe payment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">The essential difference between me and the majority is that I think that the statute means what it says when it requires that the use of interstate facilities be accompanied by an intent to violate state law. Both United States v. Wingo (6 Cir. 1967), and United States v. Kubacki, 237 F.Supp. 638 (E.D.Pa. 1965), support this position.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But in contravention of these authorities \u2014 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>the plain language of \u00a7 1952 \u2014 the majority apparently deems that use of interstate facilities in the loose context of some past violation of state law is sufficient, if subsequent conduct of the defendants can be said to violate the general purpose of \u00a7 1952 to protect the people from corruption of public officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">The error of the majority is one of statutory interpretation, but as such it reaches constitutional magnitude. Under the operative facts as stated by the majority and repeated here, there can be no question (putting aside for the moment the check given to Cotten) but that the Virginia crimes of bribery and acceptance of a bribe were \u201ccomplete and completed\u201d prior to September 13, 1961\u2014 the effective date of \u00a7 1952. As will be later shown, the check given to Cotten requires no different conclusion. If the government had sought a conviction on the basis of the use of interstate facilities prior to September 13, 1961, so as to prove such use accompanied by the intent which \u00a7 1952 specifically requires, clearly the government would be seeking to give \u00a7 1952 retroactive application.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This the government could not do. U.S. Constitution, Art. I, \u00a7 9; Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U.S. 347, 84 S.Ct. 1697, 12 L.Ed.2d 894 (1964). In allowing the government to circumvent this problem by reliance on uses of interstate facilities occurring after September 13, 1961, the majority has denied due process of law, because it has created by judicial fiat a federal crime not brought into existence by \u00a7 1952 itself, \u201cthe use of interstate facilities with intent to pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>mote an illegal zoning.\u201d Such judicial enlargement of a penal statute, if applied retroactively, has the same effect as legislative enactment of an <em>ex post facto </em>law, which is constitutionally prohibited both to the states and to Congress (U.S. Constitution, Art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 10), and has been held to violate the due process amendments. Bouie v. City of Columbia, supra. Because any use of interstate facilities to promote an illegal zoning was federally innocent \u2014 even if it occurred after September 13, 1961 \u2014 before the majority\u2019s decision in this case, the violation of due process follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Any doubt about the construction to be afforded \u00a7 1952 is allayed by reference to Kann v. United States, 323 U.S. 88, 65 S.Ct. 148, 89 L.Ed. 88 (1944), and Parr v. United States, 363 U.S. 370, 80 S.Ct. 1171, 4 L.Ed.2d 1277 (1960), both of which arose under the mail fraud statute. In <em>Kann </em>the defendants perpetrated a fraudulent scheme, pursuant to which they obtained checks payable to them, which they cashed or deposited at a bank. The use of the mails charged as a violation of the federal statute was the mailing of the checks for collection by the banks which cashed them to the banks on which they were drawn. Prior to that mailing, the defendants had obtained effective control over the money which they sought and, as far as they were concerned, their fraudulent plan had reached its fruition and come to a complete rest. The mailing was done by the banks, which had no connection whatsoever with the fraud. The checks were mailed for the bank\u2019s own purposes. On these facts it was held that the defendants could not be convicted for violation of the mail fraud statute, because the mailing did not occur with the requisite intent to defraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">In <em>Parr </em>the defendants obtained gasoline and other products and services for themselves by the use of a credit card of a School District which had authorized the defendants to use the card for the District\u2019s purposes only. The mailings complained of were two invoices sent by the oil company to the District, and the District\u2019s check mailed back in payment. Again, it was found that the mailings by the outsiders were not an integral part of the scheme as planned and executed by the defendants, and that, as a matter of fact, it was completely immaterial to them what the oil company did about collecting its bill. As in <em>Kann, </em>the conclusion reached was that the mailing was without the requisite intent to further the scheme to defraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">Both <em>Kann </em>and <em>Parr </em>clearly stand for the proposition that the mere concurrence of a violation of the general purpose which the relevant federal statute is designed to serve and a use of interstate facilities does not make an act, even though morally reprehensible and violative of state law, a federal crime. That Congress may have prohibited the use of interstate facilities to persons who use those facilities for the purpose of perpetrating frauds does not mean that Congress intends to outlaw that activity under federal law wherever the use of interstate facilities grants to the federal courts a jurisdictional basis to do so. Cf. Carroll v. United States, 326 F.2d 72, 85-86 (9 Cir. 1963). In this regard the following statement in <em>Kann </em>is quite pertinent: \u201cThe federal mail fraud statute does not purport to reach all frauds, but only those limited instances in which the use of the mails is a part of the execution of the fraud, leaving all other cases to be dealt with by appropriate state law.\u201d 323 U.S., at 94-95, 65 S.Ct. at 151.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">Similarly, as shown by the clear statutory language, Congress did not intend in \u00a7 1952 to reach all wrongs \u201con the people [effected] by corrupting public officials,\u201d but only those wrongs which are violative of specified state laws. The scope of Congressional power and whether it is sufficiently broad to make unlawful the use of interstate facilities for the purpose of corrupting state officials, is not the question. I do not doubt that the power of Congress is this broad, just as I do not doubt that Congress can reach all fraudulent schemes which employ interstate facilities regardless of intent. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>But our Inquiry here must be whether this power was so exercised. The plain wording of \u00a7 1952 demonstrates that it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">The check sent to Cotten merits special scrutiny. If the bribery of Cotten was complete on September 9, the date on which he received the check, it is obvious that under my interpretation of the statute, the clearing of the check through interstate facilities after September 13 could not constitute a violation of \u00a7 1952, because (1) this use of interstate facilities could not be made with the requisite intent to violate state law, and (2) no act in performance or attempted performance of the Virginia crime of bribery could be made <em>after </em>the use of interstate facilities, as required by \u00a7 1952. This, I think, is dispositive of the case. In the absence of evidence that Cotten knew that the check was worthless at the time he received it and delayed in making his deposit until he was informed that the check would not \u201cbounce\u201d (a position suggested, but not pressed by the government) there seems to be no reason to find as a matter of state law that the bribe was not completed on the date of receipt.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It would be unrealistic to infer repudiation of the check from mere delay in depositing it when the check was received pursuant to a prior agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Assuming, however, that the bribe was not completed at the time of receipt, it seems abundantly clear that it was completed at the time of deposit. By placing the money in his own account, Cotten evidenced an unequivocal intent to \u201caccept\u201d the illicit benefit, the gravamen of the offense under Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 18.1-279. Surely, a public official could be convicted of bribery if he accepted counterfeit money, believing it to be genuine. Similarly, even if a check which he accepted turned out to be worthless, he would still have accepted a bribe. Thus, collection of the check from the drawee bank occurred <em>after </em>the bribe had been completed \u2014 even if the bribe was not accepted until the time of deposit \u2014 and, accordingly, any use of interstate facilities after that time, specifically bank clearing operations, could not constitute a violation of \u00a7 1952 for the same reasons which apply if the bribe is deemed to have been completed on September 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">But even if it is further assumed that as a matter of state law the bribe was not completed until the check had cleared, the same result should obtain, because as a matter of federal law the bank clearing operations do not constitute a use of interstate facilities as contemplated by \u00a7 1952. The specific teaching of Kann v. United States, supra, is that if the interstate mailing is merely collateral to the perpetration of a fraudulent scheme, such mailing is not sufficient to establish a violation of the mail fraud statute. Of course, subsequent decisions, e. g., United States v. Sampson, 371 U.S. 75, 83 S.Ct. 173, 9 L.Ed.2d 136 (1962), and Pereira v. United States, 347 U.S. 1, 74 S.Ct. 358, 98 L.Ed. 435 (1954), recognize that, under the mail fraud statute, use of the mails even after the victim\u2019s money has been obtained can be for the purpose of executing the scheme, and thus subject to prosecution, if it is \u201cincidental to an essential part\u201d of the scheme. But on whatever side of the rather vague line drawn by <em>Kann </em>and its progeny the bank clearing in the instant case might fall, an important difference in the mail fraud statute and \u00a7 1952 supplies a dispositive answer. The mail fraud statute proscribes conduct where one \u201cknowingly causes\u201d the mail to be used for the purpose of executing the fraud, as well as use of the mail for that purpose. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1341. It was on the ground that each of the defendants \u201ccaused\u201d the mail to be used that convictions were upheld in Pereira v. United States, supra, where the basis for prosecution was the deposit of checks. By contrast, \u00a7 1952 is limited to \u201cuses [of] any facility in interstate or foreign commerce, includ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>ing the mail.\u201d Therefore, the reasoning used in <em>Pereira </em>to limit the <em>Kann </em>holding is not applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">In the expression of my views, little more need be stated. If I am correct in my interpretation of \u00a7 1952, the convictions on the substantive counts clearly cannot be supported. And if I am correct in my treatment of the substantive offenses, the conspiracy convictions, under the familiar principle that a conspiracy terminates upon the accomplishment of its unlawful objective, stand on no surer footing.

United States, 353 U.S. 391, 77 S.Ct. 963, 1 L.Ed.2d 931 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">I would reverse the judgments and direct the entry of judgments of acquittal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b425-9\">. 18 U.S.C.A.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-10\">\u201c\u00a7 1952.

Of course, the Virginia statute also permits a prosecution based on events which occur earlier than the completed transaction, i. e., the offer to give a bribe, and the agreement to accept one. Ford v. Commonwealth, 177 Va. 889, 15 S.E.2d 50 (1940). For present purposes, however, my concern is properly directed only to the latest point in a complete transaction that criminality attaches.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b426-12\">. The \u201cbackground identification\u201d language in <em>Kubaclci, </em>quoted in the majority opinion, must be placed in its proper context. It was not held in <em>Kubaclci, </em>as the majority holds here, that it is unnecessary in determining whether \u00a7 1952 has been violated to examine the specific scope of the state law which the defendant is charged with having the intent to violate when using facilities of interstate commerce. To the contrary, an essential element of the holding in <em>Kubaclci </em>is that under Pennsylvania law the crime of extortion is not completed until the actual payment is made, and that this payment was made after September 13, 1961. See 237 F.Supp. at 643 n. 7. The reasoning of the court was that although the public wrong effected by the extortion \u2014 the award of a parking meter contract \u2014 occurred before the effective date of \u00a7 1952, the illicit course of conduct under state law was not completed until the actual payment was made, and that, therefore, the use of facilities of interstate commerce after September 13 was made with the requisite intent <em>to violate state law. </em>Thus, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-13\">\u201cUpon the adoption of \u00a7, 1952 on September 13, 1961, the plan, contemplat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>ing as it did use of interstate facilities and interstate travel, became an unlawful conspiracy under federal law. Membership of the defendants in the theretofore federally innocent plan was then converted to membership in an unlawful conspiracy. <em>That conspiracy continued until the accomplishment of the last of its objects, delivery of the money and the clock. </em>Id., 237 F.Supp. at 643. (emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">The italicized language makes it clear that after the state crime of extortion had been completed by the making of the actual payment, the conspiracy to violate \u00a7 1952 must also necessarily terminate. Similarly, United States v. Wingo, (6 Cir. 1967), provides no support for the majority\u2019s approach of defining \u201cunlawful activities\u201d as used in \u00a7 1952 in federal terms, rather than according to state law. Indeed, in that case, which involved \u201ctravel in interstate commerce\u201d to distribute the proceeds of prostitution, the Court explicitly recognized that \u201cwe are concerned by the terms of the statute [\u00a7 1952] with an enterprise <em>unlawful under the laios of Tennessee.\" </em>Id. And although the Court paraphrased the \u201cbackground identification\u201d language used in <em>Kubacki, </em>the context in which these words are used indicates that the Court meant something far different from what the majority suggests.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-8\">\u201cAt this point it becomes necessary to determine what the Travel Act requires in the form of intent. Under \u00a7 1952, travel, with a requisite intent plus a subsequent act in furtherance of that intent, would be all that is required to make out a violation. United States v. Bergland, 318 F.2d 159 (7 Cir. 1963) cert. den., Cantrell, et al v. United States, 375 U.S. 861, 84 S.Ct. 129, 11 L.Ed.2d 88 (1963). The state crimes serve only as a background identification of the unlawful activities <em>in aid of which the proscribed travel loas undertaken. </em>United States v. Kubacki, 237 F.Supp. 639 (E.D.Pa., 1965). The words \u2018with intent\u2019 obviously refer to the words immediately following, namely \u2018to * * * distribute the proceeds of any unlawful activity.\u2019 \u201d (emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-13\">The difference in the \u201cintent\u201d required in <em>Wingo </em>and that required here is explained simply by the fact that the indictments in <em>Wingo </em>were brought under \u00a7 1952(a) (1), while the indictments in the instant case were brought under \u00a7 1952 (a) (3). For present purposes, the critical aspect of the language in <em>Wingo </em>is that the Court considered that state law provides \u201cbackground identification\u201d to \u00a7 1952(a) (1) only in the sense that the gravamen of the federal offense is the use of interstate facilities with the intent to distribute the proceeds of an unlawful activity, <em>defined by state laio.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b427-14\"><em>. </em>As particularized, the indictment charges that the use of interstate facilities by use of the United States mails between the Commonwealth of Virginia and Washington, D.
