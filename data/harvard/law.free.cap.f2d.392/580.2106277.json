The Trial Judge dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. F.R.Civ.P. 12(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-13\">Testing the allegations in the complaint under the rule of Conley v. Gibson, 1957, 355 U.S. 41, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d <em>80;</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Barber v. Motor Vessel \u201cBlue Cat,\u201d 5 Cir., 1967, 372 F.2d 626; and Bobby Jones Garden Apartments, Inc. v. Suleski, 5 Cir., 1968, 391 F.2d 172, we hold that the dismissal cannot be sustained. Thus it becomes unnecessary to discuss further either the claims (1961, 1966 or any or all of either or both) or the validity of myriad defenses raised by the defendants, such as res judicata and collateral estoppel. As to none of these do we suggest even the slightest whisper of a possible opinion or a prejudgment. These matters are for the initial consideration of the Trial Judge. See Shelkofsky v. Broughton, 5 Cir., 1968, 388 F.2d 977 and the numerous cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-14\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b657-11\">. See Mizell v. North Broward Hosp. Dist., Fla.Ct.App., 1965, 175 So.2d 583; North Broward Hosp. Dist. v.
