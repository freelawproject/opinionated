Seaboard insured Gibbs against liability arising out of use of his own pickup truck (not here involved) and some, but not all, non-owned automobiles. Seaboard refused to defend Brisbane\u2019s suit against Gibbs, and, invoking the diversity jurisdiction of the district court, brought this action for a declaratory judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b870-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-12\">On the threshold question, we agree with the district judge that the truck driven by Gibbs met the policy definition of an automobile \u2014 \u201c * * * a four wheel land motor vehicle designed for use principally upon public roads * * *.\u201d Seaboard recognizes that the definition of an automobile includes a truck. This concession is inescapable because the policy was written to cover Gibbs\u2019 pickup truck. Gibbs\u2019 employer\u2019s truck is not within the definition, Seaboard claims, because it had six wheels\u2014 two on the front axle and four on the rear axle \u2014 instead of four wheels as specified in the policy definition. The literalness of this contention is attractive, but it is not in accord with well settled principles of South Carolina law. The terms of an insurance policy must be construed liberally in favor of the insured, and where the words of the policy are capable of two reasonable interpretations, the construction more favorable to the insured should be adopted. See Myers v. Calvert Fire Ins. Co., 246 S.C. 46, 142 S.E.2d 704, 705 (1965). The policy\u2019s definition of an automobile is designed to exclude vehicles such as motorcycles, golf carts, and heavy equipment with treads.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cFour wheels\u201d is simply a generic term. The truck Gibbs drove could have been used with four wheels. The evidence discloses no significant change in function by the optional use of dual wheels on the rear axle.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-18\">Seaboard insured Gibbs when he was using a non-owned automobile within the scope of permission granted by its owners. The policy defines a non-owned automobile as \u201c * * * an \u2018automobile not owned by or furnished or available for the regular use of * * * the named insured * * * \u2019.\u201d When the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>accident occurred, Gibbs, acting within the scope of the permission granted to him, was driving his employer\u2019s truck. The principal issue is whether the truck was \u201cfurnished or available for the regular use of\u201d Gibbs. The district judge accurately summarized the evidence in his opinion, Seaboard Fire &amp;Marine Ins. Co. v. Gibbs, 265 F.Supp. 623, 626 (D.S.C.1967):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-4\">\u201cThe named insured Daniel Gibbs was a forty-eight year old resident of Wadmalaw Island who worked for Messrs. A. W. Leland and K. W. Leland as a farmhand on their farm. He had worked for them for more than fifteen years, and he was in their employ at the time of the accident. For the last seven or eight years Gibbs had been driving trucks for the Le-lands in connection with their agricultural operations. Gibbs was the only hand on the Leland farm that was qualified to drive the truck, and it was one of his duties to take the truck home at night and to return with it in the morning and to transport other farmhands to and from the Leland farms. The evidence shows that this involved no deviation from Gibbs\u2019 route to and from his place of employment. On some occasions Gibbs was driven home by his employers, and on those occasions the truck was not left with him. On occasions Gibbs was allowed to keep the truck at his home over the weekend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-5\">\u201cOf the three trucks operated by the Lelands, Gibbs was authorized from time to time to drive them all, but he regularly drove the Chevrolet which was involved in the accident. That truck was a two axle truck with tandem rear wheels. It could be operated with four wheels, but in the normal course of operation, and without exception so far as the record shows, it was operated with six wheels.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-6\">\u201cThe Leland farms employed only some five regular hands but at times\u2014 such as setting crops or gathering crops \u2014 other workers would be hired. It was customary for those workers who wanted the additional jobs at setting time or harvest time to wait on the road in the early morning for Gibbs to come by on his way to the farm. Gibbs would pick them up as a matter of course and take them with him to the Leland farm where they would be hired if needed by the Le-lands. Gibbs worked regularly, and he was paid weekly for the days he had worked. If he worked less than a week, he was paid for only the number of days that he actually worked. The additional laborers employed at times were, presumably, employed by the day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-8\">\u201cDuring this cabbage setting season the Lelands employed a work force of approximately twenty-five to thirty workers. Only a portion of these would wait for the coming of the truck on the road for transportation to the farms. Whether all of these workers were employed every time they reported is not apparent from the record. Some regular workers were transported to work on the truck, depending on the fields to be worked that day, but the Lelands maintained that they did not consider anyone on the job until they had reported for work and had received assignments. The transportation of the laborers was admittedly to the benefit of the Le-lands. The Lelands considered that the bringing of the farmhands to work was on their business. According to Aaron W. Leland the truck was not assigned to Gibbs. The principal duty of Gibbs, as his employer considered it, was to drive tractors for production and not, simply, to transport the workers. The transportation duties were on occasion taken by Mr. Aaron Leland himself.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">The clause, \u201cfurnished for regular use,\u201d has been interpreted by the Supreme Court of South Carolina in two recent cases. Grantham v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., 245 S.C. 144, 139 S.E.2d 744 (1964), denied coverage to a deputy sheriff who used an automobile furnished by Beaufort County on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>full time basis in the performance of his duties and for personal purposes in the county. At the time of the accident, the officer had obtained special permission to drive the automobile on a personal trip outside the county. The court said (139 S.E.2d at 746):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-4\">\u201cInsofar as it affects this case, the policy in question extends coverage to the insured if the injury is sustained while occupying an automobile other than the one defined in the policy, if the other automobile is not \u2018furnished for the regular use\u2019 of the insured or her husband. The purpose of such policy provisions is to afford coverage for the infrequent and casual use of vehicles other than the one described in the policy, but not to cover the insured with respect to his use of another vehicle which he frequently uses or has the opportunity to use. The intent is clear to protect the insurer from a situation whereby an insured could purchase a policy covering one automobile and be covered without qualification as to all automobiles available for his use.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AoZ\">With immaterial interruptions, Gibbs used his employer\u2019s truck daily for seven years. Under the principles expressed in <em>Grantham, </em>his frequent use of the truck precludes coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">The other recent South Carolina case is Glisson v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 246 S.C. 76, 142 S.E.2d 447 (1965), where the Supreme Court held that a jeep used by a person on temporary duty as officer of the day for the state National Guard was not furnished for regular use. The court pointed out (142 S.E.2d at 451):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-6\">\u201cAt the time of injury, Cheezem was temporarily engaged in the duty of Officer of the Day, thus performing a different duty than that normally required of him. The \u2018jeep\u2019 was not furnished for his regular use but, rather, was assigned to him for use in performing the duty of Officer of the Day. There is no evidence in the record as to how frequently Cheezem used this \u2018jeep\u2019; however, his use thereof was necessarily limited as he could only use this vehicle if it was properly dispatched to him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b872-9\">The circumstances the court found lacking in <em>Glisson </em>are present in the case before us. Gibbs was performing the duty that was normally required of him, the truck was furnished for his regular use in performing the duty, and there is evidence in the record that he used the truck almost daily over a number of years.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-10\">The defendants rely in part upon State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Smith, 206 Va. 280, 142 S.E.2d 562 (1965), in which the owner, before going to sea with the navy, left his automobile with his wife and gave his sister-in-law permission to drive it when needed. The court held the sister-in-law was afforded liability coverage under her own policy as the driver of a non-owned automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-11\">For two reasons we believe <em>State Farm </em>is not applicable. The Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia said (142 S.E.2d at 567):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-12\">\u201cWe interpret the language \u2018furnished to the named insured for regular use\u2019 as referring to the furnishing for the insured\u2019s own purposes, and not the furnishing for the owner\u2019s or his family\u2019s purposes, with incidental permission for use by the insured for her purposes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b872-13\">We believe the Supreme Court of South Carolina would not place this construction upon the policy issued to Gibbs. Neither <em>Grantham, </em>which held a similar clause unambiguous, nor <em>Glisson </em>turns upon such a limited interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-14\">Secondly, the Virginia court was impressed by the fact that the owner ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>parently did not give his sister-in-law blanket permission to use the car. The sister-in-law interpreted the terms of the permission as requiring further permission from the owner\u2019s wife each time she wanted to drive. Gibbs, however, was under no similar restriction. While he was employed, the truck was available for his regular use in the performance of his normal duties. His employer\u2019s unexercised right to withdraw permission did not make his regular use of the truck casual.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-4\">We conclude that the truck was furnished or available for Gibbs\u2019 regular use; it did not meet the policy definition of a non-owned automobile; consequently, Seaboard did not afford Gibbs coverage for the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the employer\u2019s truck meets the definition of a non-owned automobile, we believe coverage is excluded because of the work Gibbs was performing at the time of the accident. The policy contained these exclusions :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-7\">\n<em>\u201cThis policy does not apply:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-9\">\u201c(a) to any automobile while used as a public or livery conveyance * * *;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-10\">\u201c(b) to any automobile while used in the automobile business * * *;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-11\">\u201c(c) to a non-owned automobile while used in any other business or occupation except a private passenger automobile <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> operated or occupied by the named insured or his private chauffeur or domestic servant, or a utility trailer used therewith or with an owned automobile;\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b873-12\">If Gibbs was engaged in his business or occupation as a farm hand, the exclusion applies. The defendants urge that Gibbs simply was driving from his home to his place of employment when the accident occurred, and that neither he nor the men in the truck could be considered employed until they actually checked in at the farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-16\">In Glisson v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 246 S.C. 76, 142 S.E.2d 447, 449 (1965), the Supreme Court of South Carolina held that the synonyms <em>business </em>and <em>occupation </em>are comprehensive terms that have very broad meaning and may be used in many different connotations. The court cited with approval definitions from Webster\u2019s International Dictionary (2d ed.):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-17\"><em>business: </em>\u201cConstant employment; regular occupation; * * * any particular occupation or employment habitually engaged in, especially for livelihood or gain.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APCf\"><em>occupation: </em>\u201cThat which occupies, or engages, the time and attention; the principal business of one\u2019s life; vocation ; business.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b873-20\">Application of these definitions makes clear that Gibbs was engaged in his business or occupation as a farm hand. When the accident occurred, Gibbs was transporting laborers for the benefit of his employer. This was part of his job.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-21\">Generally, with respect to workmen\u2019s compensation, an employee going to his place of work is not engaged in performing any service growing out of and incidental to his employment. South Carolina recognizes two exceptions, Gallman v. Springs Mills, 201 S.C. 257, 22 S.E.2d 715, 718 (1942):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-22\">\u201c(1) Where in going to and returning from work the means of transportation is provided by the employer * * *<em>;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>\u201c(2) Where the employee, on his way to or from his work, is still charged with some duty or task in connection with his employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">The analogy to the workmen\u2019s compensation law is not controlling, but it is instructive. Gibbs\u2019 transportation of the laborers in his employer\u2019s truck places him within both exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">We conclude that even if the truck was a non-owned automobile within the policy definition, Gibbs\u2019 work at the time of the accident excluded coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">The judgment of the district court is vacated and this case is remanded for the entry of judgment for Seaboard Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Company against the defendants and each of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b870-14\">.

The policy was written specifically to cover a pickup truck. It would be a rather strained construction to hold that the placing of double, rather than single, wheels on the rear of two axles would take the coverage altogether away from the vehicle. Courts throughout the country, in interpreting automobile insurance policies, have construed the term \u201cautomobile\u201d as broadly inclusive. In Continental Cas. Co. v. Buckeye Union Cas. Co., 143 N.E.2d 169, 75 Ohio Law Abst. 79, (Ohio C.P., Franklin County 1957), a rented U-Drive-It truck was held to be an automobile. In Washington Nat\u2019l Ins. Co. v. Burke, 258 S.W.2d 709, 38 A.L.R.2d 861, (Ky.Ct.App. 1953), it was stated the term \u201cautomobile\u201d covers practically all kinds of self-propelled vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-10\">However, I cannot agree with the conclusions reached by the majority on the other two issues. The principal issue is whether the truck was \u201cfurnished for the regular use of\u201d Gibbs. I concede the closeness of this question, but a careful analysis of the facts in the light of previous decisions convinces me that the conclusions reached by the trial court are correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-12\">I do not interpret the principles announced in Grantham v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., 245 S.C. 144, 139 S.E.2d 744 (1964), as being applicable to this case. In the <em>Grantham </em>case the car involved was furnished by the county to the deputy sheriff on a full-time basis, not only for his official use, but also for his personal use. He was in complete control of the car at all times. Clearly it was furnished for his regular use.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-13\">In the case at bar Gibbs was employed by the Lelands, who operated two farms on which were grown different kinds of produce, including cabbage. One of the farms was located on John\u2019s Island, the other on Wadmalaw Island. Ordinarily the Lelands would keep four or five hands, but during the planting and harvesting seasons they would frequently use twenty-five or thirty.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-14\">Gibbs was employed as a general farm helper. His principal duties were to drive tractors and trucks, but he did other work as well. R. 68A. It was necessary to transport the employees to work. The Lelands owned a pickup truck and two larger trucks. I quote from Mr. Leland\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-15\">Q. But he\u2019s principally a truck driver and tractor driver?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-16\">A. Yes, sir. Tractor driver and truck driver. These trucks are very seldom that we, other than getting to and from work, we\u2019re not using them continuously through the day. That\u2019s why I can\u2019t say he was principally a truck driver because he certainly drove a tractor and other farm work during the day. [R. 69A.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b874-17\">The employees and Gibbs lived not very far from one of the farms. The Le-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>lands would designate one of the trucks for Gibbs to use in transporting himself and other employees to and from their homes, which did not require Gibbs to go off the main road to his own home. The men would walk to the main road where they would be picked up. When more men were needed additional workers would come to the roadside and be picked up along the way. This was not done every day. The Lelands lived near one of the farms, and at times they would transport the workers and Gibbs to their homes. On such days Gibbs would not be assigned any truck. R. 66A. When Gibbs used a truck, he was permitted to keep it overnight which was more convenient. Gibbs reported each morning to the Leland\u2019s home place to get his instructions. R. 66A. Asked whether the truck was assigned to Gibbs, Leland replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-4\">No, sir. * * * None of my trucks are assigned to Dan [Gibbs]. He drives a truck that I designate for him to drive on any particular day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-5\">Q. And on this particular date this truck was designated, you had designated * * *?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-6\">A. Yes, sir. [R. 69A.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">Different trucks were designated on different days. Usually the pickup truck was designated when only the four or five men were working, but in times when a greater number of workers were needed a larger truck was designated for Gibbs. And sometimes another truck would be used by one of the Lelands to haul some of the workers when a large number of workers were needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">Gibbs worked for the Lelands many years, but was paid always at the end of each week for the number of days he had worked that particular week.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-9\">Nearly everything grown on a produce farm is perishable. The product must be gathered or harvested when it is ready. In the modem, practical world men do not walk distances to work. It was necessary to transport them several miles in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-10\">It was most natural that the Lelands should permit Gibbs to keep one of the trucks overnight. Otherwise it would have been necessary for Gibbs to drive the men to their homes, then take the truck back to the Lelands\u2019 home, and then have the Lelands drive Gibbs to his home. This simply would not make sense. Permitting Gibbs to keep the truck overnight was a convenience to the Lelands and saved gasoline and time as well.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-11\">Q. [to Leland] Now, why did you let Daniel Gibbs have the truck over night?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-12\">A. Well because it was convenient. It saved me having to carry these people home, and gas, which it saved gas. [R. 64A.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b875-13\">Clearly the facts do not fall within the ambit of the <em>Grantham </em>opinion. Certainly there was substantial evidence to support the trial court\u2019s findings of fact from which we quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-14\">* * * The transportation of the laborers was admittedly to the benefit of the Lelands. The Lelands considered that the bringing of the farmhands .to work was on their business. According to Aaron W. Leland the truck was not assigned to Gibbs. The principal duty of Gibbs, as his employer considered it, was to drive tractors for production and not, simply, to transport the workers. The transportation duties were on occasion taken by Mr. Aaron Leland himself. [R. 8A.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b875-15\">It also justifies the trial court\u2019s conclusions, from which we quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-16\">Although Gibbs' use of the truck may have occurred frequently in this instance the conclusion must be that the Lelands did not furnish or make available to the insured the truck for his regular use. To the contrary, the evidence leads to the conclusion that the Lelands directed the use of the truck on a day to day basis for Gibbs\u2019 transportation to work and for their business purposes only. Nowhere does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>the record reflect that Gibbs ever had general and regular use of the truck. The same limitations on Gibbs\u2019 use of the truck obtained from day to day so long as the conditions of his employment remained the same. That this situation was a lasting one and that Gibbs frequently used the truck does not alter the arrangement between Gibbs and Leland. The use was casual from day to day and it was not for the regular use of Gibbs. Gibbs was not excluded by the \u201cregular use\u201d provision of the policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-4\">* * * The truck was within the definition of a nonowned automobile: it was not available for Gibbs\u2019 \u201cregular use.\u201d It was therefore covered if it was not excluded. [R. 12A.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">The prevailing rule that a trial court\u2019s factfindings must be affirmed if there is substantial evidence to support them is based on reason and human experience. The trial judge sees the witnesses face to face and is more familiar with all the surrounding circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-13\">It is generally recognized in contract cases that any ambiguity or provision of doubtful meaning is construed against the party who wrote the contract.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b876-14\">This frequently arises in insurance policies, which have been the basis of a great deal of litigation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Insurance policies cover a wide field, including almost every form of individual and business activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-15\">In this particular case there are several exclusionary clauses that carry more than one exception to the paragraph which provides the exclusion. Some of these are rather difficult to interpret.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They were evidently written by a very clever lawyer, one who was at least not unfriendly to the Seaboard Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co.
