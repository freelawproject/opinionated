The contention that section 2074 of the Code of Civil Procedure and section 150.0 of the Civil Code provide the method of procedure in such case is without merit. The former section does not prescribe the mode of tender, but rather a method of extinguishing an obligation when that object is sought; the latter section relates to an offer <em>in writing </em>to pay, and is a mere rule of evidence.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b602-7\">APPEAL from an order of the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco refusing a new trial.

One of the defendants whom they met stated to them that his firm claimed a lien on the property, not only for the storage charges, but also for goods <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>sold to de Bretteville, and stated that he desired to submit the matter to his attorney and would give an answer later. Subsequently plaintiff\u2019s attorney was advised by an agent of the defendants that he was instructed by defendants to inform plaintiff that they refused to deliver up the machinery under the proposal made by plaintiff and had decided to hold it for the full amount of their claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Plaintiff in offering to pay the storage charges made no actual production in money of the amount due and it is mainly for this reason that the sufficiency of the tender is questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">It appears, however, from the evidence that the offer was not accepted by defendants and no objection was made by him at the time that there was no actual production of the amount due as storage charges, nor does it appear that any demand was made that the money be produced. In the absence of such objection the tender was a valid one. (Civ. Code secs. 1496, 1501; <em>Latimer </em>v. <em>Capay Valley Land Co., </em>137 Cal. 286, [70 Pac. 82].)</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">The further contention of defendants that section 2074 of the Code of Civil Procedure and section 1500 of the Civil Code provide the method of procedure to be followed in such a case is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Section 1500 of the Civil Code reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-8\">\u201cAn obligation for the payment of money is extinguished by a due offer of payment, if the amount is immediately deposited in the name of the creditor, with some bank of deposit within this state, of good repute, and notice thereof is given to the creditor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">This section does not prescribe the mode of tender, but rather a method of extinguishing an obligation when that object is sought. <em>(Sayward </em>v. <em>Houghton, </em>119 Cal. 545, [51 Pac. 853, 52 Pac. 44].) Section 2074 of the Code of Civil Procedure relates to an offer <em>in ivriting </em>to pay, and is a mere rule of evidence. <em>(Colton </em>v. <em>Oakland Bank of Savings, </em>137 Cal. 376, 383, [70 Pac. 225].)</p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">Por the reasons given the order denying plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial is reversed, and a new trial is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-11\">Lennon, P. J., and Kerrigan, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
