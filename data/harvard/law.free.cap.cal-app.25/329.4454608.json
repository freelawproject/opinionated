Osaki, conducted a small restaurant in the city of Stockton. On December 27, 1913, Brooks went into said restaurant, between 8 and 9 o\u2019clock, to get something to drink\u2014\u201csome ginger and hot water\u2014 maybe a little whiskey.\u201d As he started to go the defendant caught him by the coat in the door and \u201che says \u2018you can\u2019t go out until you pay for it\u2019; I says \u2018I am just going to step to the door here, coming right back,\u2019 so I went back and paid it, then went out and got my drink and came back and my coffee I thought was not quite hot enough for me\u201d; then, after a dispute as to whether a nickel was due from Brooks, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>he laid it on the counter and said: \u201cThere is your nickel\u201d and started to go out when appellant\u2019s codefendant threw a sugar bowl at Brooks, and, obviously, referring to appellant himself, the witness proceeded: \u201cand that one there, whatever his name is, came running around the counter and jumped onto me on this side and both of them bent me over this way and went through my pockets; one of them went in here and tore a button off my vest here, went in my shirt pocket there and got a roll of bills,\u201d and furthermore, \u201cthey took three dollars in -silver out of my pants pocket there, my knife out of this one and I had a key and a small silver watch chain out of the hip pocket here.\u201d The jury undoubtedly believed the witness and the only conclusion, therefore, possible was a verdict of guilty. We cannot say .that credit should not have been given to the testimony and we are therefore bound by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">The other point is worthy of no more extended consideration. It relates to an objection to the following question asked of Brooks: \u201cAfter you came in from getting your drink of ginger, what if anything was done with regard to this pack of bills by you ? \u2019 \u2019 The point of the objection was that it was not 'shown that the defendant was present at the time. As to this, while the witness at that particular moment did not see defendant the latter was undoubtedly near and it was for the jury to say whether he saw what was done with the bills. Aside from that, it was a material circumstance in the case tending to show that the witness had the bills on his person; and it may be said, also, that if the evidence was erroneously admitted it could not possibly have affected the result in view of the statements of the witness as to the actual commission of the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">There is no reason for interfering with the verdict, and the judgment and the order denying the motion for a new trial are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">Chipman, P. J., and Hart, J'., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
