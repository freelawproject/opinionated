An order of the trial court denying defendant\u2019s motion to recall and quash an execution; and, 2.

No attempt, apparently, was made to follow the provisions of the statute in having the record so authenticated.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">So far as shown by the record, no evidence was offered or received in support of the motions on which the orders of denial were made, and the purported record is not authenticated in the manner required by law, without which this court cannot consider the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The motion to dismiss the appeal is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Conrey, P.
