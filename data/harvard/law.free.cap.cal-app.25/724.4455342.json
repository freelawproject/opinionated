In our judgment, the title of the act indicates with sufficient detail the entire subject matter of the act; and we are satisfied that there is not in the body of the statute in question anything which is in conflict with its title or not included within the scope thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-11\">We are also satisfied, from a reading of the entire evidence in the case, that it is sufficient to sustain the verdict and the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-12\">For these reasons the judgment and order appealed from are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
