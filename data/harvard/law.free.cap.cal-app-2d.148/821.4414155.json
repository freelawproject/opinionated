Boyd deceased on December 23, 1950 at the age of 83. Her holographic will dated September 4, 1948, was duly admitted to probate. Martha B. White, her daughter, was appointed administratrix with will annexed and appropriate letters were issued to her. The estate was appraised at a sum in excess of $62,000. The decedent also had a son, James F. Boyd, who predeceased his mother, but left two surviving daughters, Margaret Allison Howard, and Jane Boyd Mudd, appellant herein. By reason of the fact that Margaret had not had any share of decedent\u2019s estate and was not mentioned in the will, she was awarded one fourth of the residue as a pretermitted heir. (Prob. Code, \u00a7 90.) But it was otherwise with Jane Boyd. She was mentioned in the will of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>grandmother; was awarded property to a limited extent, and because she was dissatisfied, she filed her response to the petition to determine heirship and claimed to be entitled to the specific bequests made by the will \u201ctogether with one-fourth of the residue together with the life estate set forth in the remaining one-half of the residue of said estate as set forth in paragraph five of said will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">After trial, findings and conclusions were waived and the court adjudged that under the terms of the will<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> of decedent, (1) the diamond ring mentioned in paragraph 1 will pass to Morna Knipe; (2) the diamond referred to in paragraph 2 to pass to Helen Boyd; (3) all the furniture in decedent\u2019s home at her death, except the love seat and two roseback chairs to be distributed to Jane Boyd Mudd; (4) the remains of decedent\u2019s silver including her mother\u2019s silver tea pot set and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>the silver forks marked \u201cM.M. 1894\u201d to be distributed to decedent\u2019s great granddaughter, Mary Ann Mudd; (5) any proceeds of testatrix\u2019 insurance policy referred to in paragraph four of the will to be distributed to Brian David Mudd and Mary Ann Mudd, share and share alike, by depositing same in their savings accounts; (6) decedent\u2019s traveling case, mentioned in paragraph five to be distributed to Dove Allen; (7) all the family furniture and antiques of decedent at her death, except that distributed under paragraph three of the will, but including the love seat and two rosebaek chairs, the furniture, pictures, rocking chair and table which were in the guest room of Martha B. White at decedent\u2019s death and the tiptop table in Martha\u2019s dining room at decedent\u2019s death, mentioned in paragraph five of the will to be distributed to Martha B. White for life, with remainder to Jane Boyd Mudd; (8) Margaret Allison to get one-fourth of the entire estate; (9) three-fourths of the residue to be distributed to Martha B. White.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">Appellant is displeased with such judgment and seeks a reversal on the grounds that the court erred in admitting testimony in that it added to the terms of the will. She contends that while paragraph 5 provides that certain furniture and heirlooms \u2018\u2018are to be held thru said Martha White\u2019s lifetime and at her death to be given to Jane Boyd Mudd, believing she will appreciate them and keep them in the family thru her children,\u201d yet there are no words in the last-quoted sentence of the will designating to whom the property is to be given. This, despite appellant\u2019s immediate observation that the sam\u00e9 paragraph provides that \u2018\u2018these antiques\u201d are to be given to Martha White for her lifetime with remainder to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">It must be remembered that the instrument in question is a holographic will, authored by a testatrix of 81 years, without an excess of education. It is not required that in writing her own will she must be held to the strict use of technical terms and if she had used them her use would not be binding. <em>(Estate of Olsen, </em>9 Cal.App.2d 374, 378 [50 P.2d 70].) But in such cases, the court may investigate her intention by hearing pertinent testimony. <em>(Estate of Pierce, </em>32 Cal.2d 265, 274 [196 P.2d 1].)  When an uncertainty appears on the face of the will, it is fundamental that the testator\u2019s intent be derived not only from the will itself but also from the circumstances under which it was executed. (Prob. Code, \u00a7 105; <em>Estate of Pierce, supra, </em>268); that is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>say, the court should admit evidence of circumstances preceding the execution of the document. <em>(Ibid., </em>p. 274.) In <em>Estate of MonticelU, </em>107 Cal.App.2d 90 [236 P.2d 661], the court admitted testimony to prove that the testator wrote the word \u201cmother\u201d under the devisee\u2019s maiden name, then received evidence that testator had written the same name on a bank signature card as his mother\u2019s maiden name. This was followed by documentary proof that a woman of the same name as the devisee had taken the testator when 11 days old from a foundling home and reared him. The judgment for the devisee was affirmed. In <em>Estate of Hotaling, </em>72 Cal.App.2d 848, 857 [165 P.2d 681], the testator bequeathed his St. George Hotel. The court allowed extrinsic evidence as to testator\u2019s meaning and intent in order to identify the property specified in the will. The judgment was affirmed. But in <em>Estate of Nunes, </em>123 Cal.App.2d 150 [266 P.2d 574], where the will left a bequest to \u201cJoe E. Nunes, a nephew of mine,\u201d one Joe E. Nunes lived on the testator\u2019s ranch and was not sanguineously related to the testator. He attempted to prove that testator referred to him as his nephew in conversation with the attorney who drafted the will and that he was the party intended by the clause that bequeathed the property. The rejection of his proof required a reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">Inasmuch as the instant will referred sparingly to her daughter Martha White but repeatedly to \u201cher,\u201d it was legal and sound judgment to admit testimony to explain the use of that pronoun as referring to respondent. When Mrs. Boyd and her husband came to Los Angeles, they bought the property known as 7164 Clinton Street, gave it to respondent and had its title put in respondent\u2019s name. Proof of that detail explained the first sentence of page 2 of the will, whereby she bequeathed \u201cthe remains of my possessions, including the house in which I live and already given to <em>her </em>as <em>her </em>own.\u201d (Italics added.) Proof that the title to 7164 Clinton Street stands in respondent\u2019s name leaves no doubt that \u201cher\u201d in page 2 referred to respondent. Also, the testimony of respondent, and Moma Knipe is conclusive that the family furniture includes \u201call the furniture pictures rocking chair and table in the guest room\u201d of respondent\u2019s home. Also, in testatrix\u2019 home \u201cthe love seat and two rose back chairs in my living room and the tip top table in <em>her </em>dining room\u201d are to be \u201cheld thru said Martha Whites life time and at her death to be given to Jane Boyd Mudd.\u201d Moreover, the testimony of Martha and Morna established that the family furni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>ture of testatrix, some at 7164 Clinton Street, and some at 7160 in Martha\u2019s guest room, was the same furniture and pictures mentioned by the same witnesses in their testimony quoted above. It follows that the pronoun \u201cher\u201d in the phrase \u201cher guest room\u201d could refer to no one other than Martha White and that by testatrix\u2019 use of \u201cher\u201d she meant Martha White.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">There was no contradiction of the testimony of the two witnesses that the love seat and the two rose back chairs were in testatrix\u2019 living room and that the tip-top table was in Martha\u2019s dining room. It follows that when testatrix in referring to such items said \u201cand the tip top table in her dining room,\u201d she definitely referred to Martha White. She had held the furniture for a long time; had collected it from the \u201cBoyd and Meek families through many years\u201d and evidently cherished the items as favored heirlooms. While by her residuary clause she meant to leave to Martha \u201cthe house in which I live and already given to her as her own\u201d and the diamond ring held by Helen Boyd as permanent gifts, the testatrix had a different plan about the \u201cfamily furniture,\u201d the pictures, rocking chair and table in Martha\u2019s guest room, the tip-top table in Martha\u2019s dining room, the love seat, two rose back chairs in testatrix\u2019 living room. These items testatrix clearly intended for Martha to hold and to use during her lifetime but at the latter\u2019s death they are to pass to Jane Boyd Mudd as her own property.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">The foregoing disposes of the issue at bar by resorting to extrinsic evidence. The trial court\u2019s interpretation therefore will not be disturbed unless it is unsupported. <em>(Estate of Hotaling, </em>72 Cal.App.2d 848, 853 [165 P.2d 681]; <em>Estate of Lewis, </em>91 Cal.Ajpp.2d 322, 325 [204 P.2d 898].) But a favorable construction of the document based solely upon its contents may also be derived.  It is fundamental that a will must be construed as intended by its author. (Prob. Code, \u00a7 101; <em>Estate of Rowley, </em>126 Cal.App.2d 571, 575 [272 P.2d 911] ; <em>Estate of Reith, </em>144 Cal. 314, 316 [77 P. 942].) Neither a lack of rhetorical flourish nor the failure to observe grammatical rules will govern its interpretation. <em>(Estate of Lewis, </em>91 Cal.App.2d 322, 325 [204 P.2d 898].)  The fact that the testatrix made specific gifts and devised \u201call the remains of my possessions\u201d indicates an intention to dispose of all her property. Also, the very fact of a will raises the presumption that she intended to make a complete disposition of her possessions.  Inasmuch as the document <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>contained a residuary clause, a court must so construe it as to avoid partial intestacy. <em>(Estate of Lefranc, </em>38 Cal.2d 289, 295 [239 P.2d 617]; <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>147 Cal. 148, 153 [81 P. 406]; <em>Estate of Ottoveggio, </em>64 Cal.App.2d 388, 392 [148 P.2d 878].) Partial intestacy is not favored. <em>(Estate of Northcutt, </em>16 Cal.2d 683, 690 [107 P.2d 607].)</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">Now, in the matter at bar, if a construction of the will be rendered holding that \u201cher\u201d did not refer to Martha White as the residuary legatee of all the \u201cremains\u201d of testatrix\u2019 possessions, that would result in a partial intestacy. Appellant contends that the residuary clause does not designate a legatee. No such conclusion can result when the entire document is read as a unit and all parts are so construed as to form a consistent whole. (Prob. Code, \u00a7 103.)  To make a consistent whole, terms may be interpolated or transferred. <em>(Estate of Blalock, </em>95 Cal.App.2d 463, 470 [213 P.2d 100].) That decision is especially pertinent for the reason that the residuary legatee was not mentioned on the same paragraph or page as that which expressed the residuary bequest. Merely by writing a will, the testatrix undertook to dispose of her property and thus must have intended to give her possessions to one or more beneficiaries. If such devisees can be reasonably ascertained from the will, the assets of the estate should be distributed to them as directed by the testatrix. <em>(Ibid. </em>p. 469.)  The language of the last testamentary disposition made by the testatrix in pertinent terms by considering the relationship of the parties and the proximity of their homes to each other sufficiently describes the residuary legatee. She should not be deprived of her inheritance merely because the testatrix did not possess the powers of a philosopher and linguist accurately to inscribe her wishes. From her words, her intention can be ascertained. When decedent\u2019s will is thus interpreted by reasonably construing the language of the instrument so as to make a disposition of her estate by devising it to specific legatees, her will is a success. <em>(Estate of Blalock, supra, </em>p. 470.)</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">Moreover, the words of a will are to receive an interpretation which will give to every phrase some effect, not one which will render its expressions inoperative. (Prob. Code, \u00a7 102.) Surely, it will not be contended that it is necessary to hold that the expressions of the testatrix in devising her residuum are wholly inoperative. The thesis of respondent is that she carries out not only the intention of the testatrix, but gives effect to each and every expression <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>of the will. <em>(Estate of Northcutt, </em>16 Cal.2d 683, 688 [107 P.2d 607].)</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">Appellant relies upon a number of decisions which are readily distinguishable. <em>(Estate of Kelleher, </em>202 Cal. 124 [259 P. 437, 54 A.L.R. 913] ; <em>Estate of Tompkins, </em>132 Cal. 173 [64 P. 268] ; <em>Estate of Zilke, </em>115 Cal.App. 63, 66 [1 P.2d 475] ; <em>Estate of Wattson, </em>66 Cal.App.2d 743, 745 [153 P.2d 87] ; <em>Estate of De Moulin, </em>101 Cal.App.2d 221 [225 P.2d 303]; <em>Estate of Lyons, </em>36 Cal.App.2d 92, 95 [96 P.2d 1018].) In Kelleher, the letter declared on was not a testamentary disposition. Its meaning was unintelligible even when supplemented with extrinsic proof. The Tompkins Estate discloses an attempt to give the words of the will a contrary meaning by use of a letter written six years prior to the date of the will, not for the purpose of explaining an ambiguity in the will. It was a contradiction of the will <em>offered for probate.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">In <em>Estate of Zilke, supra, </em>the court determined that it was not possible to ascertain the testator\u2019s intention from the will itself and that the decree of the trial court was based upon speculation as to the testator\u2019s intention. Also, no extrinsic evidence was offered to explain the ambiguity. The terms of the will alone did not disclose the testator\u2019s intention. The <em>Estate of De Moulin, supra, </em>is not pertinent. In the instant will, there is not a total failure to name a beneficiary. Six are named: Moma Knipe, Jane Boyd Mudd, Mary Ann Mudd, Brian David Mudd, Dove Allen, Martha White.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">Fox, J., and Ashburn, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied April 25, 1957.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b841-7\">\u201cI Maliala M.
