J. Orchard, suggested by plaintiff\u2019s brother and unknown to the appellant architect.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">It appears that owner Paneoast who had had surveying and engineering experience, was frequently on the building site inspecting the work as it progressed, and made many complaints both to the contractor and to Architect Russell. These complaints related to the manner of pouring concrete, installation of heating duets, carpenter work, etc. The appellant\u2019s statement that Dr. Paneoast objected strenuously to about \u201ceverything that was done or was not done\u201d does not seem too much of an exaggeration.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">By late September, 1951, relations between the parties had deteriorated badly, whereupon appellant summoned members of the Ethics Committee of the Los Angeles Chapter of the American Institute of Architects to consider respondent\u2019s objections. After visiting the premises, certain remedial measures were suggested. The heating ducts, subject of one of respondent\u2019s serious objections, could not be examined because of the floor slab. Thereafter, the contractor abandoned the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">On November 10, 1951, as said in appellant\u2019s brief, \u201cplaintiff stated that he would refuse any remedy except complete demolition of the building as constructed and complete reconstruction. \u2019 \u2019 Dr. Paneoast thereafter filed complaints with the Ethics Committee of the American Institute of Architects, and likewise with the State Board of Architectural Examiners seeking to have appellant\u2019s license revoked. These complaints were dismissed. Thereafter, respondent ceased to confer with appellant, demolished the structure and relet the construction contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-8\">In February or March of 1952, the dispute between respondent and the contractor was submitted to arbitration with the result that the sum of $2,500 was deducted from the sum found to be due the contractor, leaving a balance due of $11,988.14. The appellant architect was not a party to this arbitration. A judgment confirming the arbitration award was affirmed on appeal. <em>(Orchard </em>v. <em>Pancoast, </em>133 Cal.App.2d 52 [283 P.2d 309].)</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>Respondent Pancoast\u2019s original complaint against Architect Russell sets out the contract, charges fraud and deceit on the part of Russell and alleges the giving of a certificate entitling the contractor to receive an initial payment for construction. The complaint further charges that \u201cdefendant, over the protests of plaintiff, permitted substitutions of lumber and material, . . . and approved workmanship . . . of such inferior quality as to greatly weaken said structure,\u201d etc. and that the \u201cLos Angeles Building Department condemned a large portion of the foundations.\u201d' There was a cross-complaint by defendant Russell seeking to recover a balance due of $1,764.25.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">A first amended complaint charges the defendant architect with \u201chabitual neglect in the performance of his duties as such architect,\u201d particularly with respect to inspection and approval of the contractor\u2019s work. A second count alleges breach of the written contract \u201cby failing to provide proper general supervision and by abandoning said project on November 7, 1951, without plaintiff\u2019s knowledge or consent and has never returned to complete the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">The trial court found that \u201cdefendant was guilty of neglect in the performance of his duties as such architect\u201d; that the defendant \u201ccarelessly and negligently disregarded\u201d plaintiff\u2019s protests and \u201cfailed to provide proper general supervision of the work.\u201d It was found that Dr. Pancoast, the respondent, had been damaged by the defendant\u2019s conduct in the sum of $6,000, and that defendant should take nothing by way of the cross-complaint. Judgment was entered accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-8\">It is the appellant\u2019s contention that the findings do not support the judgment and are not supported by the evidence ; that the trial court should not have found the defendant negligent in supervision and inspection, or that plaintiff was required to raze a portion of the building or remove part of the slab floor. It is also argued that the plaintiff waived any negligence on the part of the defendant by making payment to the contractor with knowledge of alleged defects. The point is also made that \u201cthere is no evidence to support the finding that the plaintiff was damaged in the amount of $6,000.00.\u201d It is also contended that \u201cThe arbitration award rendered as to the dispute between plaintiff and contractor rendered the judgment of the trial court erroneous in law\u201d; that the cause of action for any negligence was barred by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>statute of limitations; and that the trial court erred in denying relief on defendant\u2019s cross-complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">A careful survey of record and transcript indicates that all of the appellant\u2019s assignments of error are without foundation. Much of appellant\u2019s brief is concerned with the proposition that judgment and findings are contrary to appellant\u2019s interpretation of the evidence, and that the trial court should have arrived at a contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">As pointed out in respondent\u2019s brief, it is the rule that findings are to be liberally construed in support of the judgment. Whatever may be the technical defects in the present findings, they are not fundamental in nature, and when construed as an entirety, furnish adequate support for the judgment rendered. Moreover, as said in <em>Martinez </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>41 Cal.2d 704 [263 P.2d 617], <em>any </em>\u201cinconsistency is immaterial since there is sufficient evidence to support a judgment for plaintiff on either theory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b930-7\">Another fundamental principle brought into play in the instant case is that where findings and judgment are supported by substantial evidence the reviewing court will not attempt to evaluate weight and credibility of the evidence received. Conflicts in the evidence must in such a ease be resolved in favor of the judgment rendered. That the record herein does disclose substantial evidence in support of findings and judgment cannot be doubted. While it is true that there is also evidence tending to support a part of appellant\u2019s contentions, the existence of such evidence in no manner affects the application of the above rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-8\">The matter of adequate inspection and supervision on the part of the architect and the interrelated problem of - the owner\u2019s damages alleged to have resulted therefrom, were disputed questions of fact which the trial .court was called upon to solve. Since there is substantial evidence in support of the conclusion that appellant did not properly supervise the work, the appellate court cannot enter upon a retrial of the factual issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-9\">While it is true that the original complaint stresses the fraud theory, it also alleges that the appellant \u201cpermitted substitutions of lumber and material . . . and approved workmanship ... of (such) inferior quality,\u201d etc. Paragraph V of the original complaint charges that the defendant \u201cwilfully, <em>carelessly </em>and fraudulently certified to the completion\u201d of a portion of the construction. (Italics added.) In the amended complaint plaintiff omits the fraud charge and relies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>upon the architect\u2019s dereliction in inspection and supervision. Under the liberal theory of pleading followed in this statb, the allegations of the amended complaint cannot be deemed a fatal departure from those in the original.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">The rule laid down in <em>Wennerholm </em>v. <em>Stanford University School of Medicine, </em>20 Cal.2d 713, 717 [128 P.2d 522, 141 A.L.R. 1358], is applicable to the present situation. The Supreme Court there said: \u201cThis contention is based upon the theory that the fifth amended complaint charging fraud states a new and different cause of action from that for negligence stated in the original complaint, . . . The modern rule, where amendment is sought after the statute of limitation has run, is that the amended complaint will be deemed filed as of the date of the original complaint so long as recovery is sought upon the same general set of facts. ... A mere change in legal theory will not subject the amended complaint to the bar of the statute of limitations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">There can be no serious contention that the architect\u2019s undertaking was that of an absolute guaranty that satisfactory results would ensue. On the other hand, the term \u201cgeneral supervision,\u201d as used in the instant agreement, must mean something other than mere superficial supervision. Obviously, there can be no real value in supervision unless the same be directed towards securing a workmanlike adherence to specifications and adequate performance on the part of the contractor. As hereinbefore stated, whether appellant rendered such a service to the owner was one of the primary factual issues in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">Defective performance and violations of plans and specifications were repeatedly pointed out to the appellant and, as found by the trial court, there is evidence indicating that \u201cdefendant carelessly and negligently disregarded the protests and objection of plaintiff,\u201d and that respondent suffered damage as a result of such conduct. The amount of such damage found by the trial court to be $6,000 was, again, a question of fact. As pointed out in the respondent\u2019s brief, other methods of computation might have resulted in a far larger judgment. Appellant\u2019s contentions in reference to the amount awarded are untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-9\">What has heretofore been said in reference to substantial evidence sustaining the trial court\u2019s findings, is likewise applicable to appellant\u2019s contention that the court was not justified in finding that respondent was \u201crequired to remove the slab <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>floors and heating ducts, \u2019 \u2019 etc., and to install new work. According to one architect witness, encasement was so poor that the witness could reach in and touch the galvanized iron duct between the spaces left between the pours of cement. Another expert witness testified that the only way to remedy the condition was to \u201cpull up the floor or go overhead.\u201d The contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">The argument to the effect that respondent\u2019s payment to the contractor with knowledge of defective conditions, constitutes a waiver of appellant\u2019s alleged negligence, cannot be sustained. What apparently happened was that respondent made a payment to the contractor predicated upon the appellant\u2019s certification, with the understanding that certain defects were to be corrected, and that subsequent work should be performed in a proper manner. It is to be noted that this payment was brought about, not by respondent\u2019s volition but by the act of the appellant whose duty it was to serve respondent\u2019s interest by giving adequate supervision. In all this there is nothing in the nature of a waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">Nor is there any merit in appellant\u2019s insistence that \u201cThe arbitration award rendered as to the dispute between plaintiff and contractor rendered the judgment of the trial court erroneous in law\u201d; that such award was res judicata; and that the present judgment allows respondent to \u201crecover double compensation.\u201d The present architect-defendant was not a party to the arbitration proceedings between plaintiff and the contractor. As stated in the respondent\u2019s brief, \u201cthe liability of the Defendant is not derived from the liability of the contractor Orchard. . . . They have no relationship such as master and servant, principal and agent,\u201d etc., but were \u201cseparate and independent parties in their relationship with plaintiff. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">The issues decided in the plaintiff-contractor arbitration were not identical with those presented in the present action between plaintiff and architect. In <em>Bernhard </em>v. <em>Bank of America, </em>19 Cal.2d 807 [122 P.2d 892], cited by appellant, this identity of issues is mentioned as a vital element of the doctrine of res judicata. As said in <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Hammarberg, </em>103 Cal.App.2d 872, 882 [230 P.2d 399], \u201cthe issues . . . are not identical. . . . The Rahlves case was for damages for breach of a builder\u2019s contract, while the instant case is for negligence of the architect in supervising the work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b932-8\">The findings and judgment of the trial court are adequate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>and in accordance with both law and evidence. No reversible error has been shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">White, P. J., and Fourt, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">A petition for a rehearing was denied March 28, 1957, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied May 1, 1957.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
