This antique question has been before the courts apparently since the dawn of jurisprudence. It likewise engrosses our attention in the instant matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>In the current phase of this judicial odyssey, which has meandered through the appellate courts with rhythmic regularity,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> plaintiff wife originally appealed from five separate orders of the trial court denying her an attorney\u2019s fee in proceedings subsequent to the entry of an interlocutory decree of divorce. Upon reevaluation of her situation, and conditioned in part by the implications of our opinion in <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>141 Cal.App.2d 233 [296 P.2d 592] (with special reference to the footnote at page 243), plaintiff has elected to abandon four of her five appeals. Accordingly, the appeals numbered 19734,19758,19776 and 19827 are dismissed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The remaining appeal, Number 19774, in its pristine form, constituted an attack on three orders of the court made on October 31, 1952. Plaintiff has likewise abandoned her appeal from two of these orders. There remains for consideration only an appeal from one of the orders made on October 31, 1952, which will be more fully set out after a chronological r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of those elements of the former proceedings here germane.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Proceedings for a divorce, and for the settlement of rights arising from the marriage, were instituted by the parties in 1951. Thereafter, plaintiff moved for the allowance of attorney\u2019s fees pendente lite. In June, 1951, the court made an order under which plaintiff was awarded an attorney\u2019s fee in the sum of $12,000 on account of services to be rendered in the pending litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">An interlocutory judgment granting plaintiff a divorce was entered on June 9, 1952. This decree, signed by Judge Mosk, contained a provision awarding plaintiff an additional attorney\u2019s fee of $15,690. Both plaintiff and defendant appealed from certain portions of the judgment, defendant posting a bond to effect a stay of execution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>Lacking resources to prosecute her own appeal or to resist the appeal taken by defendant, plaintiff made a motion for an order for an attorney\u2019s fee and costs to meet the expenses of appellate proceedings. On September 23, 1952, Judge Mosk ordered defendant to pay a $10,000 attorney\u2019s fee and $1,200 costs for services necessitated by the appeals from the judgment. Defendant also appealed from this order and again stayed execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">Plaintiff next moved for an order requiring defendant to pay plaintiff a reasonable sum as attorney\u2019s fees and court costs to enable her to resist defendant\u2019s appeal from the order last mentioned.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The motion was supported by affidavits of plaintiff and her counsel from which it appeared that plaintiff had no independent income from which to pay fees for her attorney, that defendant had the ability to pay for such services, and that her resistance of defendant\u2019s appeal was taken in good faith. Defendant\u2019s attorney filed a counter-affidavit which did not directly controvert these facts, but alleged in substance that the previous award of counsel fees made any additional award unnecessary.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">On October 31, 1952, Judge Mosk heard argument on the motion. At this hearing, plaintiff\u2019s counsel referred the court to the case of <em>Kyne </em>v. <em>Kyne, </em>74 Cal.App.2d 563 [169 P.2d 272], as indicative of its power to grant additional attorney\u2019s fees to resist an appeal from a prior order awarding attorney\u2019s fees. Defendant\u2019s counsel argued that the award of attorney\u2019s fees theretofore made was adequate to cover such services and another allowance was unwarranted. At the conclusion of the argument, the court made its order denying plaintiff attorney\u2019s fees with which to resist defendant\u2019s appeal from the order of September 23, 1952, awarding an attorney\u2019s fee of $10,000 for services in connection with the previous appeals from the interlocutory judgment. The court did not assign any ground for denial of the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">It is plaintiff\u2019s position that because of her showing of good faith and lack of resources coupled with defendant\u2019s ability to pay, she was entitled as of right to an attorney\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>fee to resist defendant\u2019s appeal and, in any event, she insists the court abused its discretion in denying her an award. Placing principal reliance on <em>Kyne </em>v. <em>Kyne, supra, </em>she contends \u201cthat the able trial judge was under the erroneous impression that once he had awarded an attorney\u2019s fee to plaintiff\u2019s counsel, it was not within his power to grant an additional fee for the protection of the original fee which he had awarded, in spite of the defendant\u2019s appeal from the original award.\u201d However, nowhere does the record reveal, affirmatively or by implication, that the trial court harbored such a misconception. On the contrary, in his argument below, plaintiff\u2019s counsel cited the Kyne case, which stands for the proposition that in a domestic relations proceeding, upon proper showing, an attorney\u2019s fee should be awarded to permit the prosecution of an appeal from a prior order disallowing attorney\u2019s fees upon appeal. Furthermore, despite Judge Mosk\u2019s statement that he was familiar with that case, counsel quoted extensively from that authority in support of the proposition that an attorney\u2019s fee could and should be allowed in the premises. It is therefore difficult, even if it were fair, to ascribe the trial court\u2019s denial of an attorney\u2019s fee to his unfamiliarity with the case authority which permits such an award upon a proper showing. In support of the court\u2019s order, it is proper to assume it was based on other pertinent legal principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Thus, it is more logical to infer that in denying plaintiff\u2019s current application, Judge Mosk, in the exercise of the discretion vested in him, took into consideration the fact that some five weeks earlier he had awarded plaintiff $10,000 as an attorney\u2019s fee in connection with the appeals from the interlocutory judgment; that among the questions presented by those appeals was whether it was an abuse of discretion to award plaintiff $15,690 as an attorney\u2019s fee for services at the trial; that this identical issue, except as it related to legal services incident to an appeal, was the only one presented upon defendant\u2019s appeal from the award of $10,000, and that in view of the substantial award already made for services on a pending appeal involving a similar legal point, an additional award was not necessary.  It is fundamental that the matter of awarding an attorney\u2019s fee in a divorce action is left to the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>(Kellett </em>v. <em>Kellett, </em>2 Cal.2d 45, 49-50 [39 P.2d 203].)  Also, it is elemental that a husband having the means <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>is required to underwrite the good faith appeal of a necessitous wife. However, the question whether a particular fee applied for should be granted is not, as plaintiff appears to suggest, a matter of absolute right unrelated to the factor of antecedent allowances which have been granted for attorney\u2019s fees.  The law is established that in fixing the amount of an attorney\u2019s fee for services on appeal, or in determining whether such an award is required at all, the trial judge may take into account the orders for fees which have been previously made in the litigation. <em>(Berry </em>v. <em>Berry, </em>140 Cal.App.2d 63, 64 [294 P.2d 766]; <em>Harrold </em>v. <em>Harrold, </em>117 Cal.App.2d 664, 666 [256 P.2d 626]; <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>60 Cal.App.2d 291, 297 [140 P.2d 693]; <em>Frazier </em>v. <em>Frazier, </em>115 Cal.App.2d 560, 562 [252 P.2d 698]. See <em>Leupe </em>v. <em>Leupe, </em>21 Cal.2d 145, 153 [130 P.2d 697].)</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\"><em>Berry </em>v. <em>Berry, supra, </em>succinctly expresses the controlling law. There plaintiff husband and defendant wife had each taken appeals from a judgment and orders made in connection with their divorce litigation. Defendant wife applied for attorney\u2019s fees for the purpose of prosecuting her appeals and defending against plaintiff\u2019s cross-appeal. The trial court made its order denying the application. In reviewing the facts on appeal from this order, the appellate court noted that defendant wife had been previously awarded $6,000 as attorney\u2019s fees for trial of the action and for an accounting proceeding, as well as an additional $3,000 in prosecuting a prior appeal. In affirming the order of denial, the court stated: \u201cPrevious allowances of attorney\u2019s fees may afford support for a trial court\u2019s conclusion that no need exists for any additional allowance. [Citations.] The rejection of an application on that ground lies within the sound discretion of the trial court, and in order to set aside its order refusing the application a very strong case must be made in favor of the applicant. [Citations.]\u201d We do not perceive any arbitrary exercise of the court\u2019s discretion in the disallowance of the fee requested.  Taking cognizance that a fee of $10,000 had recently been awarded in connection with the appeals from the interlocutory judgment, and that the question of the reasonableness of attorney\u2019s fees was an issue in those appeals, and the only issue in the appeal from the award of $10,000, thus permitting the research of the law on that question to be used in both appeals (see <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Barker, </em>139 Cal.App.2d 206, 218 [293 P.2d 85], we cannot say, as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>matter of law, that an additional fee should have been allowed and that the court abused its discretion in refusing the allowance applied for.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">The order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">Moore, P.
