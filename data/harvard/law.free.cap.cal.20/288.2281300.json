Petitioner farther shows, that in August, 1850, one H. C. Smith was by the Probate Court of Santa Clara county duly appointed administrator of the estate of said deceased, and undertook to administer said estate; that while he, said Smith, was so duly in the administration of said estate, your petitioner commenced a suit against him as such administrator in the District Court for the county of Santa Clara, in the State of California, on a claim your petitioner then held against said estate, and did, on the nineteenth day of July, 1853, obtain judgment in said Court against the said H. C. Smith, administrator of said estate, for the sum of $8,104.85, with interest at the rate of ten per cent, per annum, as appears of record in said Court, and to which your petitioner refers. On which judgment the said Smith, administrator as aforesaid, at different times has paid your petitioner the sum of $3,500, which is the only payment that has been made on said claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-5\">\u201c Petitioner further shows, that on the twenty-fifth of January, 1854, the said Smith was cited to render a final account of his administration of said estate before the said Probate Court of Santa Clara county, and such proceedings were then and there had as appears of record ; that the said Smith was adjudged to have sufficient funds in his hands belonging to said estate to pay all the debts due from said estate, and ordered said Smith to pay said debts, which he refused to do. Your petitioner further shows, that subsequently thereto he commenced a suit against said Smith and the sureties on his administration bond, in the Superior Court of the city of San Francisco, and recovered a judgment against them for the sum of $4,644.93 damages, besides costs; that he caused executions to be issued to the comities of Santa Clara and Alameda in order to collect the amount of his said judgment; that the said execution so issued to the county of Alameda, where said Smith resides, has been returned <em>\u201c nulla bona </em>\u201d wholly unsatisfied; and that your petitioner has as yet been unable to collect anything on the said execu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>tion so issued to the county of Santa Clara; and your petitioner believes, and so charges the fact, that the said Smith and his said sureties are all insolvent; all of which your petitioner is able to prove as he believes. Your petitioner further shows, that the administration of the said estate by the said Smith has fully ceased and determined; that your petitioner has never received in payment of his said claim against said estate more than said $3,500. Your petitioner further shows, that there was due him on his said claim against said estate, in judgment as aforesaid, on the sixteenth day of March, 1854, the sum of $4,644.93, which bears an interest of ten per cent, per annum, which is wholly unpaid; that there is real estate in the city of San Erancisco belonging to the estate of said Harlan, deceased, of the value of $15,000 or $20,000, which has never been administered, applied or sold for the payment of the debt of your petitioner, and which your petitioner avers ought to be sold by an order of this Court, and the proceeds of such sale be applied to the satisfaction and payment of his said claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-4\">\u201c Wherefore, your petitioner respectfully prays that he may be appointed administrator of the unadministered part of the estate of said George Harlan, deceased, in the capacity of administrator \u2018 <em>de bonis non,\u2019 </em>in order that any part of said estate yet remaining unsold may, by an order of this Court, in due and proper form obtained, be sold to pay the debt of your petitioner, and any other just debts against the said estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-5\">The petition was duly verified.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-6\">(Signed.) \u201c <em>Benj. </em>Asphtwah.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-7\">On the fifteenth day of June thereafter, the Court made the following order, appointing Aspinwall administrator:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-8\">\u201cAnd now again comes Benjamin Aspinwall, by his attorney, L. Archer, and the matter of the application for letters of administration to issue to said Aspinwall as administrator \u2018 <em>de bonis non </em>\u2019 having been taken under advisement, the Court now finds, after hearing the proofs and allegations, that Henry C. Smith had been appointed by this Court administrator of said estate in the year 1850, but that said Smith has not fully administered upon the same; that there are debts still outstanding against said estate, and that there is a large amount of properly belonging to said estate, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>said estate has never been fully administered upon and divided among the heirs. The Court, therefore, grants the prayer of the petitioner.

That said estate has heretofore been partially administered by Henry Smith, whose time of administration has whofiy ceased. That no personal estate has come to the hands of your petitioner; nor is there any personal property, to the best knowledge of your petitioner; the said Smith, as such former administrator, having disposed of the whole of the same. Your petitioner further shows that the foEowing described real estate, lying and being in the city of San Francisco, belongs to and is the property of said estate, viz: \u201c That certain one hundred vara lot, numbered on the official map of the said city ten, and located on the south side of Mission street, between Second and Third streets, of the value of about eight thousand doEars.

That said Smith, as administrator of said estate, has made two separate payments to your petitioner on said judgments, amounting to about the sum of $3,500. Petitioner avers that there was due to him from said estate, on said judgment claim, the sum of five thousand three hundred and five dollars and fifty-seven cents, on the nineteenth day of January, A. D. 1855, and that he is entitled to interest thereon from that date at the rate of ten per cent, per annum. That he has made every effort in his power to collect and recover said amount from the said Smith, as administrator, from said estate, and from the sureties on the administration bond of said Smith, but without avail or success. Petitioner further saith, that he is informed that one Joel Harlan, one of the heirs of the said deceased, has a claim against said estate; but of the amount or truth thereof your petitioner is not advised, and refers to the records of the said Probate Court, and to the proofs henceforth to be introduced, in respect to the same, if necessary. That there are no other claims or demands against said estate, to the knowledge of your petitioner. And further shows, that the following persons are the only heirs and next of kin of said deceased, to the knowledge of petitioner, namely : Mary Smith, daughter of the said deceased, wife of Henry Smith, of Alameda county; Joel Harlan, (son) of Alameda county; Haney Huff, (daughter) wife of Lucius Huff, of Alameda county; Jerome Van Gorden and George Van Gorden, children under the age of twenty-one years, of Rebecca, daughter of said deceased, and wife of Ira Van Gorden\u2014said Rebecca being dead\u2014of Los Angeles county; George Harlan, Elisha Harlan and Sarah Ann Harlan, minors under the age of twenty-one years, sons and daughter &lt;ff the said deceased; said Elisha residing' in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>Alameda county, said George and Sarah in Napa Valley.

And it is further ordered by the Court that said administrator, before proceeding to sell the said property in accordance with this order, do give due and lawful notice of the time, place and terms of said sale, and also a description of the property to be sold, by publishing the same for at least six weeks next-preceding the day set for the sale, in the \u201c San Francisco Daily Herald,\u201d a newspaper published daily in the said city, of San Francisco, and also by posting notices thereof in three of the most public places in the county of San Francisco; said notices to describe the property to be sold with common certainty.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-5\">' At the conclusion of the trial, the defendant\u2019s counsel asked the Court to give to the jury the following instructions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-6\">1st. At the time of the appointment of Aspinwall, by the Probate Court of Santa Clara county, as the administrator of the estate of Harlan, and at the time of the sale of the one hundred vara lot number ten, by Aspinwall, as the administrator of the estate of Harlan, Henry E. Smith was the legally appointed and qualified administrator of that estate. The Probate Court of Santa Clara county, therefore, had no jurisdiction in respect to the appointment of a second administrator, and could confer upon Aspinwall no power to sell. The appointment of Aspinwall was absolutely void; the sale made by him was a nullity; and the deed made by him, as administrator, conveyed no title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>2d. Though Smith may have presented to the Probate Court his resignation as administrator of the estate of Harlan, yet if the same was not accepted by the Probate Court, nor acted upon, but on the contrary the said Smith continued to act as administrator, and the Court continued to deal with him as such, such resignation was ineffectual to divest Smith of his trust, and he continued to be the legal administrator of the estate; and so long as he continued to be such administrator, the Probate Court had no jurisdiction or power to appoint a second administrator. Such appointment was void, and all acts done by the appointee were nullities.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-5\">3d. After a sale has been made, under the authority of the Probate Court, of sufficient real property to pay all the debts of the estate, and all expenses of administration and charges against the estate, and the money has come into the hands of the administrator, the creditors of the estate must look alone to the funds in the administrator\u2019s hands for the payment of them claims. So far as the hems of the intestate are concerned, the sale and the receipt of the money by the administrator are a satisfaction of the debts, and the Probate Court is without jurisdiction to order any further sale of property of the estate.

At the time of appointment of AspinwaE as administrator of Harlan, Smith was the legally appointed and qualified administrator of Harlan\u2019s estate. The Prohate Court had no jurisdiction to appoint another administrator, the office being fiEed. The appointment of Harlan was void, and aE acts pretended to be done by him as administrator were nuEities. (Act to Regulate Estates of Deceased Persons, secs. 100, 70, 81, 86, 98, 112,146, 230, 249, 283, 82, 83, 281, 233, 237; <em>Flinn </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>4 Denio, 85; <em>Beckett et als. </em>v. <em>Selover, </em>7 Cal. <em>215; </em>4 Phil.

Even if the appointment had been vaEd, the Court had no jurisdiction to order a second sale of the property of the estate to pay the claim of AspinwaE; sufficient money to pay the same having been realized by a former sale made for the purpose. The first sale satisfied the debt, so far as the estate and those interested in it were concerned.

In other words, that Court has not the function to revive its power on this subject after it has once been exercised and its ends obtained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-7\">This proposition is derived from a consideration of the constitution of the Court as one of limited jurisdiction in this particular: from the implications of the statute, and from the analogies of the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-8\">I. From the consideration of the Court as one of limited special jurisdiction, where its powers are evoked to dispose of the property of an estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-9\">Whatever doubts may exist with regard to the powers of the Probate Court, or what credit is to be given to its judgments or acts on other subjects, yet as to those which that Court derives under particular statutes, and which would not in the absence of the statute pertain to it as a Court of Probate, it is universally conceded it must, in common with all other Courts, be deemed a Court of limited jurisdiction. (29 Ala. 525; 1 Hill, 139; 3 Barb. 343.) And these cases, and all others on the subject, hold that the power to dispose of the property of estates is derived wholly from the statutes. How, the statute authorizes the Probate Court to order the sale of the property of an estate, but defines the circumstances and conditions under which it may alone be done, and the manner and mode of doing it. The circumstances and conditions are, when there are not sufficient assets in the hands of the administrator to pay the debts and expenses of the estate: in that case, so much as is necessary for these ends may be sold, and no more, with the exception of the provision contained in section one hundred and sixty-one of the act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-10\">In this case such an order had been made, and so much of the property of the estate as was necessary to pay the debts of the estate and the expenses of administration had been sold, and the money paid into the hands of the administrator. The Probate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>Court can do no more. It possesses only a limited power, and has exhausted the power given by statute. Nowhere in the statutes can there be found any authorization to the Probate Judge to order the sale of property by an administrator to supply the losses by embezzlement or misconduct of the administrator himself. Counsel will have to go out of the statute for such authority, and that very necessity establishes the fact that it does not exist.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b302-4\">II. This view is sustained by all the just implications of the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b302-5\">By the provisions of that statute, in order to obtain the sale of real property, it is necessary that it shall appear that there is not sufficient personal property to pay the debts, etc., of the estate, what that personal property is, the amount of debts outstanding, etc. These requisites indicate that it is only after a general and particular acquaintance is obtained by the Probate Judge of the condition and circumstances of the estate, and the absolute necessity of the sale of the realty is made apparent, that the Court can be authorized to sell at all. When this knowledge is obtained, by a full review of the whole matter, the Court then orders a sale of the lands of the estate, or so much thereof as may be necessary to pay the claims against the estate, etc. When that order is made, by no express provision of the statute does it appear that the Probate Court can revise, renew or remodel it, or make further order concerning the subject. The powers of the Court, as touching this matter, have become exhausted by their exercise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b302-6\">m. This view is also supported by the analogies of the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b302-7\">The objections urged against the views of the appellant are based mainly, if not entirely, upon what is claimed to be the conclusiveness of the judgments, orders or decrees of Courts of Justice. The argument is, that inasmuch as the Probate Court has the power to sell the property of an estate under some circumstances, and in the exercise of that power has ordered a sale, the purchaser under such sale is protected in his purchase by the conclusiveness of the order, and the full faith and credit which is given to the acts of judicial tribunals. This is generally true with regard to Courts of general jurisdiction, and is received with still greater moderation relative to the exercise of powers by Courts of limited jurisdiction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>But with regard to a purchase made under the judgments of Courts of general jurisdiction, though as a general rule the purchaser is not required to look to anything besides the judgment and execution, yet these, when entirely regular, are not always sufficient to protect the purchaser. The purchaser is bound to see that the defendant has been summoned, or in some other mode has been allowed his day in Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-5\">It is likewise the case, that a purchaser under a judgment which has been paid obtains no title to the property. (2 Hill, 567; 8 Wend. 681.) And the reason is, that a purchaser under a power purchases at his peril. The judgment and execution constitute the power of attorney which authorizes the officer to sell. If the judgment is paid, the power is gone. If there is no subsisting authority to sell, no title is acquired. In such case, the purchaser must take the risk that some act, either of record or <em>in pais, </em>has not occurred to extinguish the authority through which he derives title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-6\">If such is the rule of law with regard to acts done in pursuance of judgments of Courts of general jurisdiction, are they not applicable with equal or greater force to acts done in pursuance of orders made by a Court of professedly limited powers, in ordering the sale of property of others ? If payment to a Sheriff, who is proceeding to sell the property of a judgment debtor under a judgment and execution, is a satisfaction of the judgment, and a sale under such judgment will give no title to the purchaser, why should it appear strange that payment to an administrator of moneys by sale of portions of the estate, sufficient to pay all demands against the estate, is a satisfaction of those claims as regards the heirs of the estate ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-7\">When this illustration was mentioned on the argument, it was urged that there was no analogy between the case at bar and the one propounded, because, it is said, a Sheriff is the agent of the plaintiff, and an administrator is the representative of the estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-8\">To call a Sheriff' an agent of a party in Court, is an entire misnomer. In no case do his relations to parties or his actions bear any resemblance to the character of an agent, or acts of agency. He is an officer of the Court and of the law, and in no just sense can he be called an agent, nor can his acts be construed by rules of agency, any more than can the acts of a Judge or a Governor. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>So likewise an administrator is an officer of the Court and of the law. (1 William\u2019s Executors, 330, 389; 32 Ala. 682.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-4\">But however this may be, or in what relation a Sheriff stands to a judgment creditor, it is not claimed that he is the agent of the purchaser. The relation in which the Sheriff or administrator stands to the creditors cannot affect the rights of the purchaser, and it is his interests we are now considering; and the purchaser in the supposed case takes no title, because there is no authority (which was the judgment) for the sale, the judgment having been paid. It is not disputed that an administrator is the representative of the estate, though the expression is destitute of all logical precision in the connection with the case at bar in which it is used. The administrator may be the representative of the estate, but he is not a representative of the heirs. And this is a controversy between heirs and those who claim under them, and a purchaser under a creditor. An administrator never represents the heirs in any way in disposing of the estate. When he applies to sell property, he is representing the creditors, and them solely; for if the administrator fails to apply, the creditors may under the statute. On such occasions he acts \u201c contradictorily\u201d to the heir. The heirs must be cited, and an opportunity allowed them to contest the application. The administrator is plaintiff, the hems defendants. It is his business to urge, theirs to oppose. It is then property which is proposed to be sold, and not the administrator\u2019s\u2014they are adversaries. He in so doing is acting on behalf, and therefore as the representative of creditors. When the sale takes place, the money goes into the hands of the creditors\u2019 representative and the heirs\u2019 adversary. The act by which their property is taken from the heirs is wholly compulsory on the part of the heirs, and is solicited and invited on the part of the creditors and their representative. The administrator in all these proceedings is the agent of the interests of the creditors, and is the opponent of the interests of the heirs. When the proceeds of the sale of their estate is placed in the hands of the administrator, who in this proceeding is acting for and on behalf of creditors, and therefore as their representative, is it not sufficient to absolve the heirs and their property from all further liability to creditors ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b305-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>If the administrator squanders or misapplies the money, should not the loss fall upon those at whose instance, or by whose act, or for whose benefit, the property was sold, and money came into the hands of the delinquent ? Neither the administrator nor the Court has the power to sell the land of an estate, except at the instance of the creditors or for their benefit. When it is thus sold for their benefit and <em>in invitmn </em>on the part of the hems, should not the loss fall upon those upon whom the benefit would have been conferred ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b305-4\">In case a judgment is paid to a Sheriff under an execution, the judgment is satisfied. The judgment creditor can get out no new proceedings against the debtor, and must look to the Sheriff for payment. The defendant is wholly absolved. Nor can a purchaser obtain a good title from a sale under a judgment so satisfied. In a proceeding to seE the property of an estate, the creditors are the actors. Through the instrumentality of the officer of the law and of the Court\u2014the administrator\u2014the property of the heir is sold and the proceeds go into the hands of an officer of the Court and the law. Precisely as in the case of an execution it goes into the hands of the Sheriff, who is Ekewise an officer of the Court and the law. Is there then any just reason why the property of the heir should not be absolved from aE farther responsibiEty ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b305-5\">When a claim against an estate is aEowed by an administrator and approved by the Judge, it is as a judgment against the estate, which judgment is to be enforced against the property of the estate by the instrumentaEty of the administrator or the creditors, with the concurrence of the Court. <em>(Deck\u2019s Estate </em>v. <em>Gerke, 5 </em>Cal. 666.) Such a judgment was obtained in this case. Such proceedings were had as amounted to an execution, to wit: an authority for the administrator to seE the property. He did seE sufficient to pay the judgments, and the amount came into his hands. If he had done the same thing as Sheriff, the remaining property of the debtor would have been discharged from all EabiEty for the debt. Acting as administrator, the reason appears to be stronger why the estate should be absolved from aE further responsibiEty than in cases where the Sheriff misappEes the money coEected on execution; for the reason, that in cases of an execution the plaintiffs and defendants are parties of matee age, qualified to watch over and guard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>diligently their own interests; but in proceedings before a Probate Court, in a large majority of instances, the parties whose rights are affected are minors\u2014infants without capacity in presumption of law, and in fact, to give that attention and to take those steps which may be necessary to guard themselves against the negligence or dishonest conduct of those whom the law has forced upon them as the guardians and administrators of their interests. By the provisions of the statute, if any just suspicion is excited by the acts of the administrator, as touching the fidelity of his administration, or his solvency becomes questionable, or that of his sureties, provision is made by which creditors can remove him from his office of trust or obtain full and satisfactory security. But no such privilege is given to the heir; and if it were, in the vast number of cases in which the heirs are of tender years, how totally ineffectual would the right be to them. Yet in this case it is contended that the law gives a greater protection to those who are capable of attending to their own affairs and neglect to do it, than to those who are unable to attend to their own interests and are peculiarly <em>the wards of the law.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b306-4\">In examining this point, but one case has been found in point\u2014 that in 2 Carter\u2019s Ind. R. 446. But as the decision in that case seems to have been rendered without argument, and as no reason was given by the Court for its determination, it possesses none of the qualities of authority or of persuasiveness. Not <em>how </em>it has been, but <em>why </em>it has been so decided, is the essential element of all authoritative or respected precedents. Some further reason than the precedent of the Indiana case must be furnished, to satisfy an intelligent Court and bar of the justice of a decision which shall conform to it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b306-5\"><em>D.

Both parties deraign title from the same source\u2014from one George Harlan, who died in the county of Santa Clara in July, 1850. It is admitted that Harlan was possessed of a good title to the premises at the time of his death. The plaintiff claims by a conveyance from Aspinwall, who is alleged to have been at the time administrator of Harlan\u2019s estate, executed upon a sale ordered by the Probate Court in November, 1855 ; the defendant claims by a previous conveyance from Harlan\u2019s heirs, executed in April, 1854.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">Soon after the death of Harlan, one Henry C. Smith was appointed administrator of the estate, and immediately qualified and entered upon the discharge of his duties. Whilst he was acting as administrator, real property belonging to the estate was sold by order of the Probate Court, upon his petition, to pay the debts of the estate and the expenses of the administration. Funds were thus received by him sufficient, with other funds previously in his hands, to pay all the debts and expenses, and leave a balance of nearly $2,000. Among the debts was one to Aspinwall, and upon it the latter instituted suit, and in July, 1853, recovered judgment for upwards of $8,000. Upon this judgment only the sum of $3,500 was ever received from the administrator. On the thirty-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>first of December following, Smith filed a paper, in which he declared that he resigned his appointment as administrator, and requested that the resignation be received. The Court thereupon ordered him to turn over the papers and effects of the estate in his hands to the Public Administrator of Santa Clara county, and to make with him a full settlement before the first day of the following term; declaring that when he had made such settlement, he and his sureties should be released from further liability; and (Erecting that the estate be placed in the hands of the Public Administrator for the purposes of general administration. At the next term\u2014in January, 1854\u2014Smith presented an exhibit purporting to be a final report of the condition of the estate, and of his proceedings therein, and showing a balance of funds in his hands more than sufficient to pay all outstanding claims. The Court approved of his accounts in part, and ordered him to pay immediately all the debts of the estate, and to make a final settlement at the next term; and revoked the order of December 31st, by which he was directed to turn over the estate to the Public Administrator, and the latter was authorized to take charge of it for general administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">In May, 1855, not having obtained payment of the balance of his judgment, Aspinwall apphed to be appointed administrator of what was alleged in his petition to be the unadministered part of the estate, and' in June following the appointment was made, and he gave the usual bond and qualified. In November, 1855, he obtained from the Court an order directing him to sell two parcels of land situated in the city of San Francisco. At the sale which followed, the plaintiff became the purchaser of the premises described in the complaint. The sale was duly reported and confirmed, and a conveyance by Aspinwall, as administrator, executed. It is under this conveyance that the plaintiff claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">The questions presented for consideration relate to the vahdity of the appointment of Aspinwall as administrator, and to the jurisdiction of the Court to order the sale which was made by him. To the appointment of Aspimvall it is objected that Smith, the original administrator, was still in office\u2014his resignation not having been accepted, nor his letters revoked. To the jurisdiction of the Court, it is objected that there were sufficient funds in the hands of Smith, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>the original administrator, to pay ail the debts and charges against the estate; and that the petition of Aspinwall for the sale was fatally defective in its averments.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">Upon the first question presented, we are concluded by the previous decision of this Court when the case was here at the July term, 1858, (10 Cal. 110). It was then held upon substantially the same evidence, that the resignation of the first administrator, Smith, was accepted by the Probate Court; that the acceptance of the resignation, before Smith had settled his accounts, was only an irregularity\u2014or, as the Court termed it, an error \u201c merely voidable \u201d\u2014one, in other words, which might have been corrected by appeal, or direct proceedings for its correction, but which could not be set up collaterally in impeachment of the action of the Probate Court. We confess that we are by no means satisfied with the conclusions at which the Court arrived in this respect. We do not perceive in the act of Smith, the former administrator, anything more than an offer to resign. A resignation is not a matter absolutely in the power of an administrator, to he made at any time he may choose. The statute only confers upon him a conditional right to resign. Its language is that he may resign, <em>\u201cprovided </em>he shall first settle his accounts and deliver up all the estate to such person as may be appointed by the Court.\u201d Smith never complied with this condition, and it nowhere appears that the Court ever dispensed with it. The Court did, it is true, on the thirty-first of December, 1853, order him to turn over the estate to the Public Administrator of Santa Clara county; but in the following month it vacated the order, and directed him to apply the moneys in his hands to the payment of the outstanding claims. And the subsequent proceedings show a recognition by the Court of his continued existence as administrator of the estate. Admitting, as contended, that the Court, having the power to remove an administrator for failure to account, could accept of his resignation without such account being rendered, it does not appear that any such course was ever pursued. The appointment, therefore, of Aspinwall\u2014a new administrator\u2014the former administrator not having been removed, nor his resignation accepted, was a proceeding which the Court had no jurisdiction to take. The appointment of a new administrator can no more be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>made whilst a former administrator is in office, than an appointment can he made in the first instance until the death of an intestate. The allegation of the death of a person in a petition for letters would not confer any jurisdiction, if such person were still living. The assumption of the fact of the party\u2019s death, however regular the proceedings in other respects, would not support the issuance of letters against the proof of such party being still alive. So, too, the allegation by Aspinwall in the petition for his appointment, that the \u201c administration of Smith had fully ceased and determined,\u201d is without force against the record evidence to the contrary. Nor can it be said that there was a removal of Smith by force of the subsequent appointment of Aspinwall. There is no such thing as a removal of an existing administrator simply by force of the appointment of another person. The office must first become vacant before a scond appointment can be made. A vacancy may arise by operation of law upon the happening of certain events, as by lunacy of the administrator established by judicial decree, or by his conviction of an infamous crime. (Secs. 95, 96 and 101.) In such case, the event, when established or brought to the notice of the Probate Court, is equivalent to an order of the Court revoking the letters. But where the law does not declare the vacancy as a consequence flowing from a particular event, a revocation of the letters of the first administrator, he being still living, is as essential to the appointment of another person to succeed him, as was the death of the intestate to the original appointment; and the only competent proof of a revocation of letters in such case is an order of the Court directing it. But upon the question of the acceptance of the resignation of Smith, and the validity, so far as any collateral attack is concerned, of the appointment of Aspinwall, we are concluded, as we have stated, by the previous decision of this Court. That decision constitutes the law of the case, and controls upon the present appeal. <em>(Davidson </em>v. Dallas, 15 Cal. 75; <em>Phelan </em>v. <em>San Francisco, </em>20 Id. 39.) We have expressed our views upon the question in order to obviate the idea of an implied approval of the decision, and to leave us unembarrassed by it if similar questions are presented in other cases for consideration. It may be observed here, that the decision which appears in the report in 10 Cal. 120, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>remanding the cause, with directions to the Court below to enter judgment for the plaintiff, was subsequently modified on petition for rehearing by directions for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The present appeal must, therefore, be determined upon the questions presented as to the jurisdiction of the Court to order the sale made by Aspinwall.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">The authority of the Probate Court to order a sale of real property of an intestate is derived entirely from the statute. It is a limited, and not a general authority. It may be exercised in certain specially designated cases; it can be exercised in no other. <em>(People </em>v. Corlies, 1 Sandf. 247; <em>Corwin </em>v. <em>Merritt, </em>3 Barb. 343; <em>Bloom </em>v. <em>Burdick, </em>1 Hill, 139; <em>Currie </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>27 Miss. 55; <em>Laughman </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>6 Smedes &amp; Mar. 259; <em>Wiley </em>v. <em>White, </em>3 Stew. 355; <em>Townsend </em>v. <em>Cordon, </em>19 Cal. 189.) When, therefore, an order of sale is relied upon, the question is, was the order made in a case provided by the statute ? To determine this, we must, in the first instance, look to the petition for the sale, which is the foundation of the order; assuming, of course, that the Court acquired jurisdiction originally to grant administration upon the estate. The proceeding for the sale, though made in the general course of administration, is a distinct and independent proceeding, in the nature of an action, of which the petition is the commencement, and the order of sale is the judgment. <em>(Estate of Spriggs, </em>20 Cal. 121.) We must, then, examine the petition, to ascertain whether a case is presented by its averments, within the statute, upon which the Court can act. And the petition must show on its face two things: first, the insufficiency of the personal property to pay the debts and charges against the estate; and second, the necessity of the sale of the real property, or some portion thereof, for that purpose. Both must appear before the Court can take jurisdiction of the proceeding. The truth of the averments\u2014their sufficiency appearing\u2014is a matter which must be determined at the hearing of the petition, and the judgment of the Court thereon, if rendered upon legal notice, cannot be questioned collaterally. It may be reviewed, and if erroneous, corrected by appeal, but not otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">The statute prescribes with particularity what facts must be stated in the petition. After declaring that the personal estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>shall be first liable for the debts and expenses, and if this is insufficient to pay the same, and the allowance to the family, that the real estate may be sold for that purpose (sec. 115) ; and that the executor or administrator may in such case make the sale upon the order of the Probate Judge, (sec. 154) it provides as follows: \u201c To obtain such order, he shall present a petition to the Probate Court, setting forth the amount of personal estate that has come to his hands, and how much thereof, if any, remains undisposed <em>of; </em>the debts outstanding against the deceased, as far as the same can be ascertained ; a description of all the real estate of which the testator or intestate died seized, and the condition and value of the respective portions and lots; the names and ages of the devisees, if any, and of the heirs of the deceased, which petition shall be verified by the oath of the party presenting the same.\u201d (Sec. 155.) <em>\u201c </em>If it shall appear by such petition,\u201d continues the' statute, \u201c that there is not sufficient personal estate in the hands of the executor or administrator to pay the allowance to the family, the debts outstanding against the deceased, and the expenses of administrar tion, and that it is necessary to sell the whole or some portion of the real estate for the payment of such debts,\u201d the Probate Judge shall make an order directing all persons interested to appear before him, at a specified time and place, \u201c to show cause why an order should not be granted to the executor or administrator to sell so much of the real estate of the deceased as shall be necessary to pay such debts.\u201d (Sec. 156.) As will be seen from the provisions to which we have thus referred, a sale of the real property cannot bo made so long as there is a sufficiency of personal property in the hands of the administrator to pay the outstanding debts and charges against the estate. There must be an insufficiency of such property for that purpose, before the Court has jurisdiction to act upon the petition. And this insufficiency must appear, not by mere averment, but by the statement as to the personal property and the outstanding debts and charges which the statute provides. But this is not all: it must also appear by the petition \u201c that it is necessary to sell the whole, or some portion of the real estate,\u201d for the payment of the debts and charges. (Sec. 155.) Such necessity does not follow as a matter of course <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>from the insufficiency of the personal property. The real estate may be yielding an income sufficient to pay the outstanding debts and charges, for the payment of which the sale is asked, before such sale could be made and confirmed, or if resisted, could be the subject of review on appeal. In such case, there would be no necessity for any sale. And the income, though not sufficient for the payment of the entire amount of these debts and charges, may be sufficient to pay the greater portion of them. In this case, the necessity for the sale would be limited to such portions\u2014supposing there were more than one parcel\u2014as would make up the deficiency. The necessity must appear, before the Court can take any jurisdiction and act upon the petition. And this necessity must appear, not by mere averment, but by an exhibition of the real property of the deceased. The necessity is a conclusion which the Court must draw for itself from the facts stated. It is not a matter for the executor or administrator to determine; it is a matter for the Court, and the petition must, therefore, furnish the materials for its judgment. These consist in the description which the statute provides the petition shall set forth, \u201c of all the real estate of which the testator or intestate died seized, and the condition and value of the respective portions and lots.\u201d (Sec. 155.) A compliance with the statute in this particular is, then, essential to the jurisdiction of the \u25a0Court, as without it the Court cannot judge of the necessity of the \u25a0sale asked; and in this view, we do not perceive how it can be dispensed with from the petition, any more than the statement as to the personal property and the outstanding debts. <em>(Bloom </em>v. <em>Burdick, </em>1 Hill, 130; <em>Corwin </em>v. <em>Merritt, </em>3 Barb. 343; <em>Townsend </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>19 Cal. 188; <em>Gregory </em>v. <em>Taber, </em>Id. 397.)</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Proceeding now to the examination of the petition of Aspinwall in the light of the views we have expressed, we find it fatally defective in several essential particulars. It sets forth that no personal estate has come to his hands, and that there is none to his knowledge, Smith, the former administrator, having disposed of the whole of it; and that two parcels of land situated in the city of San Francisco belong to the estate, giving the description and value of such parcels. It does not state the amount of the personal property which had come to the hands of the former administrator,, or what disposition had been had of it, or that any effort had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>made to ascertain the disposition of it, or of its proceeds, or to compel the former administrator to account. It simply avers that the petitioner (Aspinwall) had made every effort in his power to collect from the former administrator and his sureties the amount due to him upon a judgment recovered against the estate, but without success. Uor does it state the extent, condition or value of the real estate of which the intestate died seized, nor the condition of the parcels described.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">If we look outside of the petition to other records of the Court respecting the estate, we find, as we have stated, that for the payment of the debts and the expenses of administration real property had already been sold, and proceeds received more than sufficient for that purpose. Even the application of Aspinwall for letters avers that on the twenty-fifth of January, 1854, Smith was adjudged by the Corot to have sufficient funds in his hands to pay all the debts against the estate, and was ordered to pay them. We refer to the possession of funds by the former administrator, not that it can have any effect in determining the sufficiency of the averments in the petition of Aspinwall. If those averments are in themselves sufficient, the jurisdiction of the Corot attached without regard to the funds previously received. A petition may set forth inaccurately the amount of the personal property which has come to the hands of an administrator; it may even omit valuable portions thereof; yet if it purport on its face to set forth the whole of such property, and how much of it, if any, remains undisposed of, the order for the sale which may follow cannot be attacked by reason of the inaccuracies or omissions. The truth of the averments respecting the personal property, so far as they affect the validity of the order, is to be determined at the hearing of the petition. We refer to the possession of funds by the former administrator, to show the necessity of a strict compliance with the statute in the statements of the petition. The statute requires that the petition shall set forth the amount of the personal property which \u201c <em>has </em>come to the hands of the executor or administratorthat is, the amount which has been received since the administration of the estate commenced. It also requires that the petition shall set forth the amount of such property, if any, remaining undisposed of. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>statement of these particulars will direct the attention of the Court, on the hearing, to the property which has been disposed of, and lead to inquiries as to the manner of its disposition, and the use made of any proceeds received. A question might then arise whether, if funds had been received by the executor or administrator sufficient to pay the outstanding debts and expenses, a sale of the real estate for such payment could be ordered, even if the funds received had been squandered or illegally disposed of; whether, in other words, if funds properly applicable to the payment of outstanding debts and expenses, and ample for that purpose, have been lost by a fraudulent or an illegal use of them by the executor or administrator, the loss is to fall upon the creditor or the heir. This latter question has been discussed in the present case; but we do not think it properly arises. There is no evidence that the funds received by the former administrator have been squandered, or ever used at all, or that upon proper proceedings before the Probate Court\u2014and none appear to have been taken\u2014 their transfer to the new administrator might not be obtained. The inability of Aspinwall to collect the balance due upon his judgment from the former administrator personally, or the sureties on Ms official bond, establishes nothing as to the loss of any funds belonging to the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">The administrator, Aspinwall, was not relieved from a compliance, to the extent of his ability, with the statute, as to the statement of the personal property in his petition, from the fact that there had been a previous administrator of the estate. He is designated, it is true, in the order of appointment, <em>\u201c </em>as administrator <em>de bonis non.\u201d </em>But there is no such officer known to our law. By our law there are only two classes of administrators; special and general. Special administrators are those appointed to take temporary charge of the estate until general letters are issued, or during the suspension of a general administrator, and in like cases. General administrators are those appointed to admimster generally upon the entire estate. Where the authority of a general administrator has terminated by death, the revocation of Ms letters, or otherwise, . and a new administrator is appointed, the latter takes the place of the former. He succeeds to the office, clothed with the same powers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>and subject to the same restrictions; and when he invokes the action of the Court, he must institute the same proceedings, and make, to the extent of his ability, a similar showing. He must set forth, not merely the personal property which has come into his own possession since his appointment, but, so far as he is able, that which has come into the hands of the administrator of the estate\u2014for such is the plain meaning of the statute\u2014whether that administrator was himself or his predecessor. He may not be able to set forth the entire amount, but he must endeavor to do so. The records of the Court, especially the inventory filed, will aid him in this respect, if the previous administrator, he being still alive, or his papers, if dead, do not furnish the requisite information. He can at least state to the Court the imperfection of his knowledge, and thus direct the attention of the Court to the necessity of particular inquiries on the subject at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">In the petition of Aspinwall there is no attempt to comply with the statute in respect to the personal property. The averment that, no personal estate has ever come to his hands, and that there is none, the former administrator having disposed of the whole of it, leaves the Court in entire ignorance as to the condition of the estate with respect to such property, information in respect to which is essential to the jurisdiction of the Court. And in respect to the real property, the petition is still more glaringly defective. It simply states that two parcels of land, giving them description and value, situated in the city of San Francisco, belong to the estate. It says nothing of the condition of those parcels\u2014whether they were improved or waste lands; whether they were yielding income or burdening the estate with expenses\u2014from which the Court could determine as to the necessity of their sale. \u00a1Nor does it purport to give a description of all the real estate of which the intestate died seized. So far as appears, several other parcels may also have belonged to the estate, which it would have been more advantageous to the heirs to have sold than the parcels described.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">It follows that the petition is fatally defective, and its averments . gave no jurisdiction to the Court. The subsequent action of the Court, therefore, in ordering a sale, and the proceedings based thereon, partake of the original defect, and are void.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">Judgment reversed, and cause remanded for new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
