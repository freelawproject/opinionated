that the business so conducted and transacted by them was multifarious, and consisted in farming and gardening, selling produce, raising stock, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>buying and selling goods, and trading in other property, manufacturing and vending lumber, &amp;c.; that said plaintiff and said David Howard represented themselves as partners in their said business, and transacted business upon the faith of such representar tions, and by the notoriety of their several acts, gave persons dealing with them to understand and know that they were partners as aforesaid; that they so dealt with these defendants in the accounts and transactions hereinafter mentioned; that said plaintiff and his said brother were in fact partners as aforesaid, and trans-' acted business and kept accounts in the name and style of\u00a3 Howard &amp; Brother.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-5\">\u201cAnd said defendants allege, that heretofore, to wit: at the county aforesaid, from long prior to the year 1856 until the present time, these defendants and Edmond Beau were partners in the business and operations of a grist mill and saw mill, under the name and style of 1 Shores &amp; Co.,\u2019 and admit that these defendants in respect to the same business were during that time as between themselves partners, under the style of <em>\u2018 </em>Shores &amp; Brother.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-6\">\u201c Said defendants aver, that said firm of \u00a3 Shores &amp; Co.,\u2019 at sundry times between the month of October, 1857, and the month of May, 1861, at the special instance and request of said plaintiff and said David Howard, partners as aforesaid, performed labor for, and sold and delivered personal property to said firm of 1 Howard &amp; Brother,\u2019 to the amount and value of eight hundred and thirty-two dollars and eighty-four cents, as follows: Lumber, of the value of two hundred and eighty-four dollars and sixty-nine cents ; grinding l,803|r bushels of wheat, of the value of five hundred and thirty-five dollars and fifteen cents; forty-eight flour sacks, eight dollars; cleaning wheat, five dollars\u2014all the items and particulars of which are fully set out in \u2018 Exhibit A,\u2019 hereto annexed and made a part of this answer; that heretofore, and prior to the commencement of this action, said firm of \u00a3 Shores &amp; Co.\u2019 assigned and transferred said account to these defendants, on a settlement between said firm and the said firm of <em>\u2018 </em>Shores &amp; Brother; \u2019 that these defendants are now the owners and holders thereof, and the same has been incorporated in the demand of these defendants against said firm of \u00a3 Howard &amp; Brother,\u201d as set forth in said exhibits.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>\u201cAnd for further defense, said defendants allege, that between the first day of January, 1858, and the twenty-first day of August, 1861, there was and is a mutual open and current account between these defendants and said firm of \u2018 Howard &amp; Brother,\u2019 which is correctly stated in \u2018 Exhibit B,\u2019 hereto annexed and made a part of this answer; that during that period, these defendants, at the instance and request of said \u2018 Howard &amp; Brother,\u2019 sold and delivered to them articles of property of the value of thirty-three dollars and thirty-five cents, paid to them two hundred and sixty-five dollars in cash, and at their request and for then\u2019 use two hundred and seven dollars, as more fully appears in said \u2018 Exhibit B; \u2019 that there is a balance due from said plaintiff and said David Howard to these defendants upon said two accounts, stated in said <em>\u2018 </em>Exhibits,\u2019 of five hundred and ninety-three dollars and sixty-eight cents, applicable to the payment and extinguishment of said promissory note, and these defendants pray the Court by its judgment to allow and apply the credits of said accounts at the various dates thereof to the payment of said plaintiff\u2019s demand; and to equate the interest thereon; and said defendants urge the said demands, stated in said exhibits, as a set-off and counter claim to said plaintiff\u2019s demand, in case the Court does not allow the same as payments.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-4\">\u201cAnd said defendants aver that said plaintiff has been at all times fully cognizant of the said demands of these defendants against him and his said partner, and as these defendants believe, has held his said demand, until recently, subject to a just settlement of said claim against them; and said defendants aver that said plaintiff\u2019s demand being a promissory note for three hundred and thirty-six dollars, was executed in final satisfaction of another antecedent note of these defendants, which had been purchased, as these defendants believe, with the joint means of said \u2018 Howard &amp; Bro.,\u2019 and was held by said plaintiff for the use of the said firm; and these defendants further allege, on their information and belief, that said firm of\u00a3 Howard <em>&amp; </em>Bro.\u2019 are indebted to a considerable amount, and that their property is incumbered by judgments, mortgages and attachments to a large amount; that said plaintiff, contriving and intending to hinder and defraud the creditors of said firm of \u2018 Howard &amp; Bro.,\u2019 claims to be the sole owner of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>considerable portion of their common property, and now denies their said long acknowledged and notorious partnership; and that these defendants will be without any effectual remedy for their said demand, if the same is not allowed in defense to this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-5\">\u201c Wherefore they ask the equitable interposition of this Court to that end, and that justice may be done.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-6\">An exhibit of the indebtedness from Howard &amp; Brother to defendants is attached to the answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-7\">Plaintiff demurred to the answer, on the ground that it contained no defense. The demurrer was sustained, and defendants declining to amend, plaintiff had judgment for the amount of note and interest, from which judgment the appeal is taken.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b280-8\"><em>H. O. </em>&amp; <em>W. H. </em>Beatty, for Appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-9\">I. Defendants owed Asa Howard on the note, in round numbers, eight hundred dollars, and Asa Howard and his partner owed defendants five hundred and ninety-three dollars and sixty-eight cents, which was past due. Every partner is severally liable for the debts of the partnership of which he is a member. The firm of which Asa Howard was a member having failed to pay their debt at maturity to defendants, Asa Howard became,- was, and is severally liable in point of law, and in <em>foro consientice, </em>for the debt. He was and is just as much bound to pay that debt as if it had been originally his individual debt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-10\">The reason, then, why such a debt might not be set off against the individual demand of Asa Howard arises, not from any want of natural justice in such a course, nor because Asa Howard was not individually bound, but solely from the complexity of affairs produced by such sehoff, which Courts ordinarily endeavor to avoid. But when a failure to allow such set-off will endanger defendant\u2019s claim, or otherwise subject him to great inconvenience, the Courts of Equity overcome their repugnance to such a course, and allow the set-off. <em>(Sampson Simeon </em>v. <em>Joel Hart, </em>14 Johns. 63; Bull <em>N. </em>P. 336-2; H. Bl. 587; 4 Tenn. Rep. 123.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-11\">H. The answer shows, in the first place, the insolvency, or probable insolvency, of the firm ; and Asa Howard being in that case individually hable for all the debts of the firm, it would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>been setting off a debt due from him against one due to him, and not a joint against a several debt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-4\">In the next place, if it was true that the note was purchased with the joint funds of Asa and David Howard, and held for the use of the firm, it was really the joint property of the firm, and a debt due from the firm to defendants might be set off against it, whether the firm was insolvent or not. And this is more especially true if the defendants had been led by the plaintiff to believe, as seems to be charged in the answer, that the note was held subject to a joint settlement of accounts.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b281-5\"><em>Hereford &amp; </em>Williams, for Respondent,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3\">cited Practice Act, sec. 47; 7 Barb. Rep. 104; 23 Wend. 528.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b281-7\">Cope, J. delivered the opinion of the Court\u2014Field, C. J. and Norton, J. concurring.</author>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">The suit is upon a promissory note, and the answer sets up an indebtedness against the plaintiff and his brother as a set-off. On demurrer, the Court held that the indebtedness could not be pleaded as a set-off against the note, and entered judgment for the plaintiff. The defendants appeal, and contend that the decision of the Court upon the demurrer was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">The law of set-offs is a matter of statutory regulation, and the correctness of the decision depends upon the construction to be given to the statute. The forty-seventh section of the Practice Act provides that the claim to be set off shall be a demand \u201c existing in favor of the defendant or plaintiff, and against a plaintiff or defendant, between whom a several judgment might be had in the action.\u201d In other words, that the claim shall be such that the party pleading it might obtain a several judgment against his adversary upon it; and this undoubtedly excludes a joint debt as a set-off against a separate debt. In this case, the defendants seek to set off a debt of the plaintiff and his brother against a debt due to the plaintiff alone, and it is clear that the statute gives them no right to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">The facts stated are not sufficient to justify the allowance of the set-off upon equitable grounds. It is alleged that the parties are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>indebted to a considerable amount, and that their property is incumbered by judgments, mortgages and attachments; but this does not show that they are insolvent, or that the defendants are in any danger of losing their demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
