After the going down of the remittitur, and on the twentieth of September, 1860, an order was made that the defendants should answer within ten days. It does not appear that any personal notice of this order was given to the defendants therein, of whom this plaintiff was one; and at the expiration of the ten days, certain of the defendants having answered, and others, including plaintiff, not having answered, a default was entered against those not answering, and, October 12th, 1860, judgment rendered against them for the amount of the claim of the plaintiff therein ($5,686). No motion was made in the District Court to set aside this judgment. On the twenty-seventh day of October, 1860, and after the adjournment for the term, the complaint in this action was filed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-10\">Its substantial averments are: a statement of the history of the original action to the time of entry of judgment; that this plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>has a meritorious defense to that action, and the facts constituting that defense; that J. D. Turner, an attorney at law residing in Siskiyou county, was employed by him to defend the original action, in 1859, and did attend to the same until the recovery of judgment by him and the other defendants on demurrer; that he, plaintiff, is a German, and understands little of the English language, and nothing of the forms of law; that his said attorney told him in 1859 that all had been done that was necessary in the defense of the case; that he, plaintiff, supposed this to be true, and that the former judgment in the District Court was an end of the case; that he knew nothing of the subsequent appeal to the Supreme Court, or of the reversal of the former judgment, or the order giving ten days to answer; that he first knew of additional steps being taken in the ease from a telegraphic dispatch, received October 17th, 1860, informing him of the judgment by default, and that execution was levied upon his property; that said Turner left Siskiyou county in April, 1860, and has not since been a resident of this State, and plaintiff has not- himself been a resident of Siskiyou county since March, 1859; that he employed said Turner to conduct said case as his attorney, and relied upon him to do it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-4\">Plaintiff prays that the judgment by default be set aside as to him, and that he be allowed to defend on the merits, and that proceedings under execution be stayed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-5\">The answer denies the ignorance of plaintiff as to the proceedings of the case, and avers that he had full notice of all of them, and had an attorney in fact in Siskiyou county with full power to attend to this ease.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-6\">Upon the trial, the evidence showed that the Yreka Water Company, being heavily indebted, in 1855 executed a mortgage to certain of its creditors to secure $24,000 already due, and $40,000 to be subsequently advanced, the $24,000 being due severally to various individuals; that plaintiff Bibend was a creditor to the amount of two hundred and eleven dollars, and was secured in this amount by the mortgage, and named as one of the mortgagees; that defendant Kreutz held a note against the Yreka Water Company for $1,000, with interest at four per cent, per month, and was intended by all parties to be secured in this amount by the mortgage, but was not named as mortgagee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>In April, 1857, the Shasta River Canal Company was incorporated, the corporators being mostly members of or creditors of the Yreka Water Company, the object of the incorporation being to purchase the property and carry on the business of the Yreka Water Company under a new organization.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-4\">Soon after, an arrangement was made between the two companies and certain of the creditors, that the various creditors of the Yreka Water Company secured by the mortgage might exchange their demands against that company for stock in the Shasta River Canal Company on a fixed basis of value, and that when nine-tenths in amount of the creditors should make this exchange the mortgage should be canceled, and the property, free of the incumbrance, belong to the Shasta River Canal Company. Kreutz was no party to this arrangement, and has never received any stock or released his debt. Bibend, the plaintiff, received stock to the amount of his debt, and a number of the other creditors did the same, and subsequently voted upon the stock in the company meetings. None of the evidences of debt against the Yreka Water Company have been surrendered, nor has the mortgage been canceled, but still remains in force; but each creditor receiving stock executed a conditional assignment, to take effect when nine-tenths in amount of the creditors should come into the arrangement. Neither the plaintiff nor any other of the mortgagees have ever received any money or stock in consideration of the debt due to Kreutz.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-5\">The Court below found as a fact that there was no <em>laches </em>on the part of plaintiff in making his defense to the other action, and that he might have been taken by surprise; but rendered judgment for defendants on the ground that the facts showed the original judgment to be just, and failed to show that plaintiff had any good defense to the action on the merits.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-6\">Plaintiff moved for a new trial, which was refused, and from this order and from the judgment the appeal is taken.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b112-7\"><em>Heydenfeldt, </em>for Appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-8\">A bill will be maintained to set aside the judgment and for a new trial.

J. concurring.</author>\n<p id=\"b113-14\">TMs is an action to set aside a judgment by default, on the ground of surprise. The judgment was rendered in an action for money <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>had and received, and the facts disclosed by the record show conclusively that no cause of action existed. It is admitted that the suit was improperly brought, but it is contended that the judgment is strictly just, and ought to be allowed to stand. This view, though acted upon by the Court below, is manifestly erroneous, and we find in the facts of the case nothing to justify or support it. The Yreka Water Company executed to several parties, among whom was the plaintiff, a mortgage in trust to secure the payment of certain indebtedness, a portion of which was owing to defendant Kreutz, whose name, however, does not appear in the mortgage. The complaint in the original suit charged an assignment and surrender of this mortgage, and a receipt by the persons to whom it was executed of the amount secured by it. This was sufficient <em>prima facie to </em>recover upon; but <em>the facts </em>now before us present the case in a very different light, and it is evident that gross injustice has been done. The mortgage has neither been assigned nor surrendered, but is still in the hands of the trustees, and may at any time be enforced for the payment of the debts. The evidence on this point is clear and explicit, and in determining the case the Court below was misled by certain transactions with a corporation known as the Shasta River Water Company. This corporation was organized to take the place of the Yreka Water Company, and an agreement was entered into entitling the holders of the indebtedness secured by the mortgage to exchange it for stock of the corporation. A portion of the indebtedness was exchanged in pursuance of this agreement, and the Court appears to have regardgd the agreement itself as superseding the mortgage. It is clear, however, that nothing of the kind was intended, and that Kreutz, whose debt has not been exchanged, is entirely unaffected by the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">Objection is taken to the mode in which the plaintiff seeks redress, but we are of opinion that the remedy in equity was properly resorted to. The statutory remedy by motion, except in cases where there has been no service of summons, is only available during the term at which the judgment is rendered, and in many cases a denial of the most obvious justice would result from holding this remedy exclusive. The assistance of equity cannot be invoked so long as the remedy by motion exists; but when the time within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>which a motion may be made has expired, and no <em>laches </em>or want of diligence is imputable to the party asking relief, there is nothing in reason or propriety preventing the interference of equity. \u201c In general,\u201d says Story, \u201cit may be stated, that in all cases where by accident, or mistake, or fraud, or otherwise, a party has an unfair advantage in proceedings in a Court of Law, which must necessarily make that Court an instrument of injustice, and it is therefore against conscience that he should use that advantage, a Court of Equity will interfere and restrain him from using the advantage which he has thus improperly gained.\u201d (Story\u2019s Eq. sec. 885.) In the present case, there is no doubt that an unconscientious advantage has been obtained of the plaintiff, and the findings of the Court expressly negative any inference of a want of diligence on his part. Under these circumstances, and in view of the positive injustice which must result from a refusal to interfere, we do not see upon what principle relief can be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">The point as to the necessity of an averment in the complaint, showing that the plaintiff could not obtain relief on motion, is untenable. It is unnecessary to determine whether the complaint was or was not demurrable on that ground; no demurrer having been filed, and the parties having answered to the merits, the objection comes too late. So far as the fact is concerned, the record shows that the suit was commenced after the expiration of the term.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded for new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
