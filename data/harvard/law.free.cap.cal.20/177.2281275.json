D. 1861, at the township of State range, in the county of Tuba, in the State of California, and within five hundred yards of the line of the county of Nevada, feloniously did steal, take and carry away, one silver watch of the value of thirty dollars, twenty-five pieces of money of the denomination twenty dollars, in gold coin of the United States of America, in all of the value of five hundred and fifty dollars, of the goods, chattels and property of James Nelson, John Nelson and C. McDonald, contrary to the forms of the statute in such case made and provided.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-6\">The first instruction given by the Court is as follows: \u201c When goods, shown to have been feloniously taken from the owner, are, immediately after such felonious taking, found in the possession of a party, the burthen of proof is thrown upon tMt party of explaining such possession, and the manner in which he acquired such goods.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-8\">The following is the third instruction asked by defendant and refused by the Court: \u201c If the jury believe, from the evidence, that all the facts testified to by witnesses in this case were obtained from defendant, by hanging him up by the neck to a limb of a tree, and by threats and menaces used towards defendant by those who had him in custody, before any statement or confession made by defendant, they 'will acquit the prisoner.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b178-9\"><em>Thomas P. </em>Hawley, for Appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-10\">I. The demurrer interposed by defendant to the indictment should have been sustained. The description of property stolen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>was insufficient, and the facts are not concisely stated. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Peterson, </em>9 Cal. 315; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lloyd, </em>9 Id. 55; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ball, </em>14 Id. 101.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-4\">II. The Court erred in its instructions, given to the jury, as to the presumptions arising from the recent possession of stolen property. The instruction is in direct opposition to recent decisions of this Court. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Chambers, </em>18 Cal. 383; <em>People </em>v. <em>Levison, </em>16 Id. 99; 3 Green on Ev. sec. 31; Best on Presumptions, secs. 224, 226.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-5\">III. The Court also erred in refusing the third instruction asked by defendant\u2019s counsel. The principle \u201c that all confessions forced from the mind by the flattery of hope, or torture of fear,\u201d cannot be given in evidence in a Court of justice, is well settled. <em>(Rex </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>cited in 3 Philips on Ev. 424.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b179-6\"><em>Attorney General, </em>for Respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b179-7\">Norton, J. delivered the opinion of the Court\u2014Cope, J. concurring.</author>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">The demurrer to the indictment was properly overruled. The offense is alleged to have been committed within five hundred yards of the line of the county of Nevada, which shows the ease to be within the provisions of section eighty-eight of the Criminal Practice Act, and the description of the stolen property is precise and accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">There was no error in refusing the third instruction requested by the defendant. That instruction would have precluded the jury from considering the effect of the defendant having conducted the witnesses to the place where the stolen property was concealed. Although that act was a confession of his knowledge where the property was concealed, and was induced by threats, yet the truth of this confession being established by the finding of the properly at the place indicated, precluded the possibility that the confession was false\u2014which is the ground of the rule excluding confessions thus obtained. (1 Greenleaf\u2019s Ev. secs. 231-2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">But the first instruction given to the jury was erroneous under the ruling in the case of <em>The People </em>v. <em>Chambers </em>(18 Cal. 283). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>In that case it was decided that the possession of the fruits of a crime is a circumstance to be considered in determining the guilt of the possessor, but that this circumstance is not of itself sufficient to authorize a conviction. In the case before us the Court did not instruct the jury in direct terms that the possession of the stolen goods, unexplained, would alone authorize a conviction; but that the possession of the stolen property throws the burthen of proof explaining such possession upon the accused. If this charge could be understood as only stating that the accused was bound to explain the possession, in order to remove the effect of the possession as a circumstance to be considered m connection with other suspicious facts, it would not be <em>erroneous; </em>but we cannot assume that the jury understood it in such a limited sense. Unqualified, the direct effect of the charge was to convey to the jury the idea that the possession of the stolen goods, unexplained, was of itself sufficient to authorize a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">For the error in the first instruction given, the judgment must be reversed and a new trial ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
