L. c. 231, \u00a7 113, and Common Law Rule 51 of the Superior Court (1923). These requirements are that \u201c exceptions shall be reduced to writing . . . and filed with the clerk, and notice thereof shall be given to the adverse party . . . .\u201d These words plainly mean that the filing must occur first and that the notice must follow to report and give information of a past event. The words employed and the frame of the sentence forbid the construction that they may be satisfied by an anticipatory advice or warning of an event expected to come to pass. Provision is made by Common Law Rule 27 of the Superior Court (1923) for service of such notice but it has no relevancy to the issues here presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">It is recited in the exceptions that unsigned bills of exceptions were mailed in behalf of the defendant to the clerk on April 26, 1930, and that on April 28 a letter dated April 26, 1930, was mailed to the attorney for the plaintiff stating that the exceptions were' \u201c filed this day.\u201d The unsigned bills of exceptions were returned without being accepted or filed by the clerk to counsel for the defendant, were by him signed and mailed again to the office of the clerk, reaching there on April 30, 1930, when they were filed. On April 29, 1930, by letter of that date counsel for the defendant delivered to counsel for the plaintiff another notice, stating: \u201c This is to notify you that in the cases \u201d Walsh against Feinstein, <em>\u201c </em>we have filed \u201d defendant\u2019s bills of exceptions. After hearing, the trial judge made a finding to the effect that the bills of exceptions were filed in the office of the clerk of courts on April 30, 1930, that no notice in writing was given to counsel for .the plaintiff on that day or since, and that such notices of filing as were given to counsel for the plaintiff were given and received prior to the filing of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>bills of exceptions. These findings are abundantly warranted by the evidence and must stand as final.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Whether the notices were given was a pure question of fact. <em>Chertok </em>v. <em>Dix, </em>222 Mass. 226. <em>Day </em>v. <em>McClellan, </em>236 Mass. 330, 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">It is plain that the exceptions were not filed, until April 30, 1930. The presentation of unsigned papers in form fit to be exceptions when signed was of no effect. <em>Gorski\u2019s Case, </em>227 Mass. 456, 460. <em>Thorndike, petitioner, </em>244 Mass. 429, 431. <em>Thorndike, petitioner, </em>252 Mass. 154, 157, and cases cited. <em>O\u2019Neil </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>257 Mass. 414. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Checker Taxi Co. </em>263 Mass. 425.
