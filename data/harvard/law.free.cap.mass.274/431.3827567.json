The plaintiff at the trial abandoned all claims except for the death of the decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The finding of the judge that the decedent was struck by the defendants\u2019 truck on the sidewalk and not on the defendants\u2019 land was warranted by the evidence, notwithstanding the evidence tending to show that when the truck came to a stop the body of the decedent was six or eight feet inside the property line of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">The decedent was old enough to exercise some care. Plainly there was evidence to sustain the finding of the judge that the burden resting on the defendants of proving contributory negligence on his part had not been sustained. <em>Eshenwald </em>v. <em>Suffolk Brewing Co. </em>241 Mass. 166. <em>Forzley </em>v. <em>Bianchi, </em>240 Mass. 36. <em>Mercier </em>v. <em>Union Street Railway, </em>230 Mass. 397, 403. He was walking on a sidewalk where he had a right to be, and he justly might rely to a considerable extent on the expectation that no one would drive a motor vehicle across that sidewalk, even at a private driveway, without giving seasonable warning and stopping if necessary in order to avoid a collision. Moreover, the decedent was in the care of his elder sister who might be found to be a competent custodian and to have acted throughout with due care. <em>Direnski </em>v. <em>Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway, </em>244 Mass. 313, 316. <em>McDonough </em>v. <em>Vozzela, </em>247 Mass. 552, 556. The case at bar is quite distinguishable on this point from the numerous cases on which the defendants rely, but it is not necessary to review them one by one for the purpose of distinguishing them.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Plainly it might have been found to be negligence on the part of the defendants to drive upon the sidewalk without observing the children and acting with due care in view of their presence. The children and the sidewalk were in plain view of the defendants. There appears to have been nothing to obstruct their view. <em>Cairney </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>266 Mass. 279, 282, 283. <em>King </em>v. <em>Weitzman, </em>267 Mass. 447. Whatever may have been the significance of the circumstance that the sister, asked on the witness stand whether her brother \u201c walked right into the truck,\u2019\u2019 bowed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>her head, the plaintiff was not bound by that testimony, and the judge was not required to find that it counteracted all the other evidence in the case warranting the finding. <em>Haun </em>v. <em>LeGrand, </em>268 Mass. 582, 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">It is manifest that the trial of the case proceeded on the assumption that the plaintiff prior to the issuance of the writ was appointed administrator of the estate of the decedent and that, whatever may have been the imperfections in his declaration, he was seeking to recover only for the death of his intestate. If the defendants desired to rely on the narrow and technical but sound defence that the plaintiff was not administrator of the estate of the decedent at the time the writ was sued out, <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Northern Street Railway, </em>211 Mass. 277, they ought to have done something more than hide the point under a general prayer.. Representative capacity of this nature is admitted unless there is special demand for proof. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 30. The rule stated in <em>Proctor </em>v. <em>Dillon, </em>235 Mass. 538, 540, does not aid the defendants in these circumstances. Doubtless a demurrer to the declaration might have been sustained, but the defendants did not' demur. They proceeded to trial. The plaintiff waived all rights except the right to recover damages for the death of his intestate. - There ought to have been an allegation in the declaration to the effect that the deceased left next of kin. <em>Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. of New York </em>v. <em>Huse &amp; Carleton, Inc. </em>272 Mass. 448, 453, 454. The evidence, however, was abundant to prove that the decedent actually left next of kin. The plaintiff is given leave to amend his declaration in the Superior Court adding an averment to that effect. The circumstance that in the single count in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration were joined a cause of action resting on the death statute and a cause of action for conscious suffering is of no consequence at this stage of the proceedings since at the trial the plaintiff waived all claim for conscious suffering. In view of the way in which the case appears to have been presented to the trial judge, there is no reversible error in the denial of any of the requests for rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>The defendants\u2019 present argument, that there was no evidence that the accident occurred upon a highway, cannot be supported. Their fifth request for ruling assumed that the street and sidewalk constituted a highway. The seventh request also assumed that, unless the evidence showed that the decedent was upon the land of the defendants, they would be liable upon proof of negligence, and the bill of exceptions refers to Mystic Avenue and its adjacent sidewalk as \u201cthe highway.\u201d It is manifest, therefore, that the trial of the case proceeded on the theory that the sidewalk was a part of the highway. There is nothing open to the defendants on this point. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mara, </em>257 Mass. 198, 209. <em>Denham </em>v. <em>County Commissioners, </em>108 Mass. 202, 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">Every contention put forward in behalf of the defendants has been considered, but need not be discussed more at length.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
