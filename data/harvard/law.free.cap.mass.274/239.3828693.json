There was a verdict for the plaintiff. A written instrument, dated November 5, 1929, was put in evidence purporting to be signed in behalf of the defendant by one Blanch C. Tanner, whereby the defendant ordered a piano and agreed to pay therefor \u201cthe sum of $3775.00 as follows \u2014 $500.00 December 23rd, 1929 and $500.00 each month until paid,\u201d with interest at one half of one per cent per month, title to remain in the plaintiff until the purchase price was paid in full. The piano was delivered at the. defendant\u2019s house on November 20, 1929. The only matter in controversy is the power of Blanch C. Tanner to bind the defendant by such an agreement. The defendant excepted to the denial of her. motion for a directed verdict, and to the exclusion of evidence offered by her and the admission of evidence offered by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">1. The motion for a directed verdict was denied rightly. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>A salesman for the plaintiff testified that he called at the defendant\u2019s summer home in Windsor on November 4, 1929, told her that he was \u201c representing \u201d the plaintiff and said, \u201c I came to see you in regard to the electric duo-art piqno that I talked with Mrs. Tanner about for your house,\u201d and the defendant replied, \u201c Oh, yes. I would like Mrs. Tanner to make the arrangements for that piano, but she is in Pittsfield this morning. If you will wait a while she will be back and you can see her personally,\u201d and that, thereafter, he saw Mrs. Tanner and obtained the order for the piano. On further examination the salesman testified that the defendant said, \u201c I would like Mrs. Tanner to make the arrangements for the piano. She knows what we want.\u201d The defendant testified that the salesman replied in the negative to her inquiry whether he had \u201ccome to tune the pianos,\u201d but her account of the conversation with the salesman differed materially from his account.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">The evidence warranted a finding that the defendant represented to the plaintiff\u2019s salesman that Blanch C. Tanner was authorized in her behalf to \u201cmake ... arrangements \u201d with him for a piano for the defendant\u2019s house and the inference therefrom that Mrs. Tanner had actual, or at least apparent, authority to \u201c make \u201d such \u201c arrangements \u201d in behalf of the defendant. Even if Mrs. Tanner\u2019s authority was apparent only, the defendant would be bound by the \u201c arrangements \u201d made by her. <em>Taft </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>100 Mass. 68, 74. <em>Malaguti </em>v. <em>Rosen, </em>262 Mass. 555, 563. The jury could have found that in the circumstances disclosed by the. evidence authority to \u201c make \u201d such \u201c arrangements \u201d with a piano salesman included authority to purchase a piano, using the \u201c usual and appropriate means to accomplish that result.\u201d <em>Sears </em>v. <em>Corr Manuf. Co. </em>242 Mass. 395, 400. See <em>Sprague </em>v. <em>Gillett, </em>9 Met. 91, 92. They could have found, also, that a- contract for the purchase of. a piano on the credit of the defendant was a \u201c usual and appropriate means \u201d of making such purchase, even though in this case, unlike <em>Sprague </em>v. <em>Gillett, supra </em>(see also <em>Taft </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>100 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>68, 75), there was no evidence that the principal did not furnish the agent with funds with which to make the purchase for cash. See <em>Taber </em>v. <em>Cannon, </em>8 Met. 456, 458; <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>Sargent, </em>9 Met. 172; <em>Temple </em>v. <em>Pomroy, </em>4 Gray, 128, 132. Nor were the provisions for instalment payments and retention of title as security necessarily unusual or inappropriate. Authority in an agent to bind the principal to pay for goods purchased may be more readily implied than authority to borrow money on his credit or give negotiable paper in his name. See <em>Temple </em>v. <em>Pomroy, </em>4 Gray, 128; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Dugan, </em>217 Mass. 526.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-3\">2. The plaintiff\u2019s salesman, testifying as a witness for the plaintiff, subject to the defendant\u2019s exception, was asked, \u201c Were you relying upon the credit of Mrs. Miller or Mrs. Tanner in selling this piano? \u201d and answered, \u201c Mrs. Miller.\u201d This testimony was admitted rightly. It was material on the question whether Mrs. Tanner had apparent authority to act for the defendant. If the jury found that Mrs. Tanner had no authority in fact, the defendant would be bound by her representation that Mrs. Tanner had authority only if this representation was relied on by the plaintiff. <em>Bickford </em>v. <em>Menier, </em>107 N. Y. 490. Mechem on Agency, (2d ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 722-724. Testimony as to such reliance, though an undisclosed mental state, was admissible. <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>168 Mass. 446, 449. <em>Blaney </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>174 Mass. 277. <em>Anastas </em>v. <em>Koliopoulos, </em>222 Mass. 267, 270. <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>Meltzer, </em>245 Mass. 41, is distinguishable since the reliance there sought to be proved was not material on any issue in the case. ' The fact that here reliance could have been inferred from the conduct of the parties does not make direct evidence thereof inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">3. The defendant offered to prove that a witness called by her would testify that later in the day on which the plaintiff\u2019s salesman talked with the defendant the witness heard a conversation, - between the defendant and Mrs. Tanner \u2014 the salesman not being present \u2014 in which the defendant said, \u201cYou can\u2019t buy any piano and bring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>it up here. We haven\u2019t any power to run it. We have got two pianos. We don\u2019t want any more pianos up here.\u201d This offer of proof was excluded, subject to the defendant\u2019s exception. The exclusion was error. The evidence offered bore upon the issue of actual agency as it tended to show that, in fact, Mrs. Tanner had no authority to purchase a piano for the defendant, though it would not touch the matter of Mrs. Tanner\u2019s apparent authority. See <em>Taft </em>v. <em>Baker, supra. </em>According to the offer of proof this conversation took place before the contract sued on was entered into, so that it could have affected the right of Mrs. Tanner to act for the defendant. In this respect the case differs from <em>Wilcox </em>v. <em>Waterman, </em>113 Mass. 296. We cannot say that the jury did not find for the plaintiff on the ground that Mrs. Tanner had actual authority to act for the defendant. Indeed the judge\u2019s charge indicates that the case was submitted to them on that issue. The exclusion, therefore, may have been harmful. It follows that the first and second exceptions herein considered must be overruled and 'the third exception sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
