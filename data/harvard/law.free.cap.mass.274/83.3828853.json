The declaration was in two counts, the first alleging ordinary negligence and the second gross negligence on the part of the defendant: At the close of the trial the defendant made a motion for a directed verdict in his favor on both counts. The judge directed a verdict\" as requested on the first count, but refused to direct a verdict on the second count, and the defendant duly excepted. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff. The bill of exceptions contains all the evidence which is material to the defendant\u2019s exception taken to the refusal to grant his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">The evidence warranted the finding of the following facts: Sometime in the early morning of May 14, 1927, the plaintiff went to the lunch room of the defendant on Bridge Street, in Lowell. After his lunch and time spent in talking with different persons, the plaintiff at about three-thirty put on his hat and coat. The defendant and one Finnegan were just starting out from the room and \u201c they said, \u2018 are you going home? \u2019 \u201d The plaintiff replied \u201cyes\u201d and they said, \u201cwe will drive you down,\u201d and to this the plaintiff said \u201c all right.\u201d The car they rode in was a two-door sedan with a front seat that tipped forward. The plaintiff got in first by pushing the front seat down, that is, the seat next to the driver\u2019s seat, and climbed through to the back seat, the front seats being separate and the back seat a full bench; then the defendant took the driver\u2019s seat and Finnegan sat at his right. As the car proceeded they soon came upon \u201cone Toohey who had left the lunch room shortly before they had. The defendant \u201c picked him up to .take, him to. his. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>home which was three or four streets away.\u201d He sat in the front seat at the right of Finnegan, and of the defendant who was driving. The defendant stopped the car at the plaintiff\u2019s house and the plaintiff started to get out. After a short talk the defendant told the plaintiff that he had notice from Lakeview that Finnegan\u2019s machine would not start, and he wanted to know what the plaintiff could do. The defendant said, \u201c you [the plaintiff] know the feel of it, you probably can do just something to it to start it up.\u201d The plaintiff refused to go at first because it was late then, it was foggy, and he had to go to Boston in the morning. The defendant said, \u201c there is no need of any fear on your part because I will bring you out and I will bring you back, everything will be all right.\u201d The plaintiff finally consented to go. As the car started from the house of the plaintiff they went a short distance before they turned onto Jewett Street. As they turned the corner the car skidded, almost made a complete \u201c half circle \u201d and \u201c went right around.\u201d Toohey said, \u201c be careful, Leo, it is a bad turn.\u201d The defendant righted the car and went up Jewett Street onto Coburn Street, then he had \u201c another bad swerve \u201d and the plaintiff and Toohey said \u201c take it easy.\u201d When the car reached the corner of Coburn Street and Lakeview Avenue it skidded again and Toohey told the defendant \u201c to take it easy \u201d and the defendant replied, \u201c Don\u2019t be a boy scout, come along.\u201d Lakeview Avenue is a straight way for cars at that point and the defendant <em>\u201c </em>speeded up quite fast \u201d as far as Aiken Street against the protest of the plaintiff. At this point Toohey was so scared that when the car slowed down he \u201c opened the door and jumped out, landed on . . . [his] hands and knees.\u201d Up to that time the plaintiff had pleaded with the defendant <em>\u201c </em>to let him out.\u201d They left Aiken Street, the defendant \u201c still speeding up \u201d and the plaintiff saying \u201c Leo, please let me out of this car, we can do the same work this afternoon, we are doing now and you can take . . . [Finnegan] to work.\u201d The defendant and Finnegan replied \u201c sit down, don\u2019t be a boy scout, we will take, care of you, everything <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>will be all right, you will get home O. K.\u201d Finally, as the ear kept speeding the plaintiff said \u201c come on Leo, let\u2019s call this off, we will do this thing this afternoon.\u201d Just prior to the accident, about four hundred feet from the scene of the accident, as the car \u201c was going awfully fast, terribly fast,\u201d the plaintiff said, \u201c Listen, let me out at this corner, anyway I will get some kind of a car home, or I will get a hitch-hike, or something.\u201d The defendant \u201c did not slacken up, but stepped right on the gas.\u201d As the car approached Nashua Road at the corner with Lake-view Avenue, it ran between forty-five and forty-eight miles an hour, skidded right across the road and crashed into a tree with \u201cgreat force.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-3\">The evidence warranted the finding that the brakes on the car were not good and that the car would skid when the brakes were applied. There was further evidence that warranted the finding that the defendant knew that the brakes were defective, knew that the brakes had to be relined, and knew that the day before the accident the car when driven about the streets by Finnegan skidded over to the left side when the brakes were applied. There was further evidence that the roads were wet and slippery, that the defendant was familiar with the curve at the place of the accident, and that when the plaintiff stood up in the back of the car to get out at Aiken Street the defendant and Finnegan \u201c pushed him back into the seat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">The contention of the defendant that the skidding of the car which preceded the collision with the tree was no.t of itself evidence of negligence, much less of gross negligence, in the circumstances here disclosed is obviously unsound. At least one of the reasons for the skidding was defective brakes which had caused the car on the day before the accident to skid to the left when the brakes were applied; this defective condition of the brakes was known to the defendant and could have been remedied before the proposed trip to Lakeview was begun. It is manifest the jury on the facts here disclosed would be justified in finding that the defendant was indifferent to the point of criminality to every legal obligation which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>he owed to the plaintiff. <em>Altman </em>v. <em>Aronson, </em>231 Mass. 588. <em>Learned </em>v. <em>Hawthorne, </em>269 Mass. 554. It follows that the case was properly submitted to the jury and the exceptions must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-3\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
