There was evidence tending to support the allegations of the declaration as to the cause of injury. The defendant was not a subscriber under the workmen\u2019s compensation act and hence cannot show in defence that the plaintiff was negligent or that his. injury was caused by the negligence of a fellow employee. The evidence need not be narrated. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>There was evidence tending to show that the injury was received through the negligence of a fellow employee acting within the scope of his employment. Apparently the cause of the injury was that two employees instead of <em>four were </em>undertaking to move a piece of iron too heavy for their strength. No discussion is needed to demonstrate that the case at bar is governed in principle by <em>Bernabeo </em>v. <em>Kaulback, </em>226 Mass. 128, and is distinguishable from <em>Ashton </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine </em>Railroad, 222 Mass. 65. There are no facts on the present record which require a finding of contractual assumption of risk on the part of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">\n<em>Order dismissing report affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
