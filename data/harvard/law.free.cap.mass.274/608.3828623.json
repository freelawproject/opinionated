The count in contract was waived and trial was had upon the count in tort. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>A verdict for the defendant was directed and the plaintiff excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-3\">The verdict was directed rightly.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">There was evidence that, in 1927, the defendant was developing a chain system of \u201c grocery and creamery stores,\u201d and evidence of negotiations, beginning in June or July, between the plaintiff and the defendant by Sidney Rabinowitz, its treasurer, general manager, and \u201c the person in charge of renting new stores,\u201d in regard to a lease from the plaintiff to the defendant of a store at 128 Harold Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts, in a block of stores owned by the plaintiff. The plaintiff testified that, in October, 1927, he had a talk with Rabinowitz as follows : <em>\u201c </em>Mr. Sidney Rabinowitz said to me that die handles the leases and locations, and . . . He wants to come into the store now, after he couldn\u2019t agree with the landlord of the original- store ... he said . . . \u2018 You have six vacant stores. I am going into your block of \"stores. It will cost us about $2,000 to fix up the store. It is a gamble of course, but when I go into your block of stores it is made. I have had that experience before. As soon as the chain stores move in the block, even if it isn\u2019t vacant, it helps it, especially when you have six vacant stores . . .; I want you to do this: I want six months\u2019 free rent and then a lease, $45 I believe, a monthly rental for a year\u2019s lease.\u2019 \u201d As a result of this conversation a written agreement, dated October 18, 1927, was executed by the plaintiff and defendant, whereby the plaintiff agreed \u201c to allow the , . . [defendant] to occupy \u201d the premises in question \u201c for a term of six months, beginning November 1, 1927, as tenants at will \u201d with \u201c the option of a lease for a term of one year \u201d at $45 a month, and the right in the lessee to extend the term of the lease for one year periods \u201c for four successive yearly extensions \u201d at $50 a month, and <em>\u201c </em>that the rental for the six months beginning November 1st, 1927 shall be considered \u2018 paid \u2019 \u201d by the defendant to the plaintiff. The plaintiff testified \u2014 and his testimony was corroborated by Rabinowitz \u2014 that a few days afterward the defendant placed two signs in the window of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>the store, \u201c announcing the opening of the store by the defendant, and painted the inside of the store white; but no merchandise was ever placed in the store \u201d and that he (the plaintiff) first received notice from the defendant that it would not occupy the store on January 3, 1928.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-3\">The plaintiff\u2019s case rests upon the conversation in October, 1927, testified to by the plaintiff, especially the statement of Eabinowitz: \u201cI am going into your block of stores.\u201d The plaintiff contends that this was a representation by the defendant of present intention to .occupy one of the plaintiff\u2019s stores which was material, false, and intended by the defendant to deceive the plaintiff and that the plaintiff relied thereon to his damage. See <em>Feldman </em>v. <em>Witmark, </em>254 Mass. 480; <em>Levey </em>v. <em>Higginson, </em>266 Mass. 381.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">Even if the evidence warranted a finding that Eabinowitz, acting for the defendant, made a representation of present intention to occupy the plaintiff\u2019s store, it did-not warrant a finding that this representation was false. The only direct evidence of the defendant\u2019s intention was the testimony of Eabinowitz. He testified, among other things, that when he signed the agreement he had \u201c an affirmative intention of opening up this store\u201d and that he \u201c first decided that . . . [he] had no intention of going into the store \u201d \u201c Sometime after November 21,\u201d 1927. This testimony might have been disbelieved but, of course, \u201c mere disbelief of testimony as to facts is not affirmative proof of contrary facts.\u201d <em>Martell </em>v. <em>Dorey, </em>235 Mass. 35, 41. <em>Fitch </em>v. <em>Ingalls, </em>271 Mass. 121, 127.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">The plaintiff, however, contends that it could be inferred from all the circumstances taken together that the representation was false. The evidence in its aspect most favorable to the plaintiff tended to show that in the preceding July Eabinowitz told the plaintiff that he was not interested in the plaintiff\u2019s store, and about \u201c the latter \u25a0 part of September, 1927,\u201d said to the plaintiff, \u201c Well, you couldn\u2019t get me in there with a ten-foot pole,\u201d that at about the time the defendant was negotiating for the plaintiff\u2019s store it was negotiating also for another store at 154 Harold Street, and that on November 21, 1927, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>took a lease of those premises from the owner. The plaintiff argues from this evidence, and from the fact that the defendant did not \u201c open up the store in the plaintiff\u2019s block \u201d between October 18 and November 21, or at any time thereafter, and from the improbability, as he asserts, that the defendant would occupy two stores so near together, that the defendant\u2019s intention in July and September not to occupy the plaintiff\u2019s store remained unchanged and that the defendant\u2019s dominating purpose in making the agreement of October 18 was to obtain more favorable terms from the owner of the other store.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-3\">The evidence of the defendant\u2019s intention in July and September did not prove that it remained unchanged in October. Rabinowitz testified, in substance, that the two stores would carry the same kind of merchandise but were \u201cin different neighborhoods, although they do have some relation to each other.\u201d There was, however, no evidence that it was improbable that the defendant would occupy two stores so near together, and ordinary experience would not warrant such a conclusion without proof. The evidence that the defendant was negotiating for another store, therefore, did not tend to show that it had no intention of occupying the plaintiff\u2019s store. The agreement of October 18 did not contemplate occupancy of the plaintiff\u2019s store by the defendant before November 1, 1927. Consequently, the defendant\u2019s failure to occupy immediately after the execution of the agreement did not show that in October it had no intention of occupying the store later. Nor was the defendant\u2019s failure to open up the store after November 1 proof of the existence of a contrary intention in October. The circumstances disclosed by the evidence, taken together, may give rise to a suspicion that the intention of the defendant was misrepresented by Rabinowitz in his statement to the plaintiff, but they do not go far enough to warrant a finding to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">Since proof of the falsity of the alleged representation failed, it is unnecessary to determine whether the plaintiff\u2019s proof failed in other particulars.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
