We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-27\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-28\">In May of 1998, Barnett filed a form 1040 income tax return with the IRS for the 1997 tax year. On her return, Barnett reported zero earned income and zero taxable income, when in fact she earned a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1244\">*1244</page-number>combined total of $26,761.00 from her employment with the State of Florida and the federal government\u2019s Office of Personnel Management. Rl-37 at 2. The IRS assessed a $500 penalty against Barnett for filing a frivolous return, pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6702(a). Simultaneously, the IRS also sent Barnett a notice of demand for payment. Rl-1 at Ex. D. This was followed by two notices of intent to levy to collect the penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-4\">In response to her assessed penalty, Barnett requested a \u201cCollection Due Process\u201d (\u201cCDP\u201d) hearing. At the CDP hearing, the IRS determined that Barnett\u2019s 1997 tax return was frivolous and that the $500 penalty was properly assessed. Barnett disagreed and filed a complaint in the Middle District of Florida requesting that the IRS\u2019 determination be invalidated. The Government filed a motion to dismiss, which was denied, and then filed a motion for summary judgment. The district court granted the Government\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and Barnett appeals that ruling to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-6\">On appeal, Barnett does not dispute the district court\u2019s finding that her 1997 tax return was frivolous under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6702(a) or that the $500 penalty was properly assessed under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6671(a). Instead, Barnett argues that the IRS\u2019 notice and demand for payment was invalid because it did not conform to the requirements of Treasury Decision 1995 \u2014 dated 12 June 1914 \u2014 which required that a \u201cForm 17\u201d be used for notice and demand letters. She maintains that because her letter was not sent on Form 17, the notice must be legally invalid. Barnett\u2019s argument is incorrect. We discuss her argument after stating the proper standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-7\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1286-8\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s order granting motion for summary judgment and construe \u2018all reasonable doubts about the facts in favor of the non-mov-ant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wright v. Dougherty County, </em>358 F.3d 1352, 1354 (11th Cir.2004) (per curiam) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-9\">B. <em>Barnett\u2019s Notice of Demand Letter</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1286-10\">Barnett\u2019s reliance on Treasury Decision 1995 is misplaced because 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6303(a), which was enacted in 1986, currently governs the requirements for notice and demand letters. While \u00a7 6303(a) requires that the IRS provide Barnett with \u201cnotice ... stating the amount and demanding payment thereof,\u201d it does not state that the notice must be sent on Form 17. Although we have not yet addressed the proper procedure for giving notice and demand under \u00a7 6303(a), we agree with two of our sister circuits that have concluded that \u00a7 6303(a) does not require any particular form of notice. <em>Schiff v. United States, </em>919 F.2d 830, 833 (2d Cir.1990) (per curiam) (concluding that \u00a7 6303(a) does not require that notice of demand letters be sent on Form 17); <em>Planned Invs., Inc. v. United States, </em>881 F.2d 340, 344 (6th Cir.1989) (concluding that \u00a7 6303(a) requires no particular form of notice). Because the notice sent by the IRS to Barnett conforms to the requirements of \u00a7 6303(a) \u2014 it afforded Barnett notice of the assessment, stated its amount, and demanded payment \u2014 the district court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment in favor of the Government is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-11\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-12\">In this appeal, Barnett argued that the IRS\u2019 notice and demand for payment of its $500 penalty assessed as a result of Barnett\u2019s frivolous 1997 income tax return was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1245\">*1245</page-number>not valid because it was not sent on a \u201cForm 17,\u201d as required by a 1914 Treasury Decision. Section 6303(a), which was enacted in 1986, does not require that notice and demand be sent on any particular form. Therefore, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"ACi\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
