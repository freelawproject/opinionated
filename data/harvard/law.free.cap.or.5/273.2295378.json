In the Circuit Court, counsel for the city moved to dismiss said writ of review for the reason that \u201csaid plaintiff William Sellers had a plain, speedy and adequate remedy by appeal for all the irregularities complained of in said proceeding before the recorder.\u201d The Circuit Court overruled said motion, and afterwards rendered a judgment reversing the judgment of the Recorder\u2019s Court and adjudging the costs.in the proceeding, by writ of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>review, against the city of Corvallis, from which judgment and rulings the city appeals to this Court, assigning numerous errors, but relying on none, upon the argument here, except the'fourth, which reads: \u201cThe respondent\u2019s remedy for the matters complained of, was by appeal from the sentence and judgment of the recorder, and not by writ of review.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b274-5\"><em>B.

J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b274-12\">It is claimed by counsel for respondent that there is no express authority anywhere given to appeal from the judgments of the recorder of the city of Corvallis, and that <em>\u00a7 8 </em>of the charter of said city does not confer the right, and, therefore, the only remedy is by writ of review. If counsel for respondent is correct in this position, then the writ was properly granted in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-13\">But we think this position of counsel is untenable. It is declared in \u00a7 8 of the charter of the city of Corvallis, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>that \u201cthe recorder shall have jurisdiction over all violations of city ordinances, and may hold to bail, fine, or commit persons found guilty thereof; and within the city shall have jurisdiction and powers like a justice of the peace, and the law governing justices of the peace shall apply as far as practicable to all his proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Chapter XI of the General Laws of Oregon, page 477, provides for appeals from justices of the peace in criminal cases, and is a part of the laws referred to in \u00a7 8 of said city charter, by which the city recorder is to be governed in his proceedings. .The right of appeal is an important and valuable right, and we cannot think that the Legislature ever contemplated withholding it from the judgments-of the recorder of the city of Corvallis.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">The only other question presented in this case is whether the court below had authority to grant the writ of review at the time when it was ordered. The recorder rendered his judgment against Sellers on the 27th day of August, 1873, and three days thereafter the writ of review was issued. Sellers might have appealed from the judgment rendered against him within thirty days from the date of its rendition. This Court held, in <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Christian </em>(4 Or. 375), that the writ of review would not lie in a cause so long as the right of appeal existed, and overruled the <em>dictum </em>in <em>Schirott &amp; Groner </em>v. <em>Phillippi &amp; Coleman </em>(3 Or. 484), that appeal and review were concurrent remedies. We think that the decision of this Court in <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Christian </em>was correct, and that it is decisive of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
