The question of paternity should be established by strict and plenary proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-13\">The petitioner comes here claiming a share as heir at law. To entitle her claim to the consideration and confidence of the court she must have proved that she was the illegitimate child of the deceased testator, Domingo Ghirardelli, and Carmen, legitimized by subsequent matrimony, and pretermitted in his will.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-14\">There is no doubt, as petitioner admits, that Domingo Ghirardelli and Carmen entered into the marriage relation in Peru, and the preponderance of evidence is that the mother of the applicant, Carmen Alvarado, was married to a man named Martin, a physician, prior to meeting Ghirardelli, and that she did not meet him until the child Dominga, the applicant here, was seven or eight months old.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-15\">It was incumbent upon the petitioner to establish her claim as child to a reasonable and moral certainty\u2014a certainty that convinces and directs the understanding and satisfies the reason and judgment of those who are bound to act conscientiously upon it. This is declared judicially to be proof beyond a reasonable doubt, such as the counsel for claimant, Mr. Turn Suden, insisted, in another case, must exist in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-16\">Specious as is the same gentleman\u2019s argument in this case, it is unsupported by the warp and woof of the evidence\u2014 here and there a slender and brittle thread of testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>suggestive of the fondness of a father and of affectionate treatment by him and of resentment at her ingratitude and lack of filial regard for her mother, but absolutely no particle of proof of paternity. Her own testimony is enough to show that she did not realize any such natural relation, and even if her position made a draft upon sympathy, in view of all the facts and circumstances, it is clear that she received from him throughout life and in his testamentary provision indulgent treatment. The evidence in this case shows that Domingo Ghirardelli was a man of kind heart and honorable impulse, and that when he espoused the mother of this petitioner there was no stain upon the character of either, and that he treated his wife and her child with respect and affection.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-3\">Notwithstanding the terms of endearment used in his correspondence with his stepchild and her husband\u2014terms natural enough and not necessarily compromising between him and one whom he had virtually but not legally adopted, and whom he had treated with the tenderness of a parent\u2014there is nowhere any evidence arising to the dignity of proof that he either was or acknowledged himself to be her actual father. On the contrary, there is positive and unimpugnable proof that such was not the case. One important item, outside of the will, is of immense importance by way of illustration: Ghirardelli\u2019s olographic memorandum of the births of his children, giving the year, day, date and hour of birth, even the very minute, but omitting Dominga, the petitioner. Is it probable or possible that if she were his daughter he would have omitted her, his eldest born? It is, to say the least, intensely improbable. It is not to be accepted- as a basis upon which to rest a conclusion to the contrary. I have suggested that she was virtually adopted by him when he intermarried with her mother, and that this was her own notion is shown by her letter in evidence dated Oakland, July 19, 1894, asking \u201cfor an adopted daughter\u2019s share\u201d of the estate. This very intelligent lady could not have written that letter of imploration if she knew or believed she had the right to an equal share under the law. If she were a legally adopted daughter she had the same right as the common lawful offspring of Domingo and Carmen; if she were the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>illegitimate child she had, by subsequent matrimony, an equal right; but she was neither, and she knew it. Aggrieved and disappointed at the testamentary discrimination, in view of the virtual adoption, she may have been; but she had been denied no legal right and had no legal claim, and her own voluntary communication establishes her knowledge and belief. The astuteness of the claim that she was named Dominga after the deceased Domingo is suggestive of the cleverness that is proverbial of her race; but the fact is that she was named, according to the custom of her country, after the saint upon whose feast day she was born, St. Dominie, August 4th\u2014-a common custom in Catholic countries.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-4\">Quantitatively and qualitatively, in number and quality, the case of paternity is against the petitioner; her birth was honorable, but her father was not Domingo Ghirardelli, actual or adopted. But even if it were not so clearly shown by a remarkable series of witnesses and an extraordinary exhibition of evidence\u2014a unanimity of a most remarkable and respectable array of witnesses as to the declarations of the deceased Domingo\u2014the identity of the petitioner, Dominga Barbagelata, with the person described in article or clause sixth of the will, hereinabove quoted: \u201cDominga or Domenica Martin, wife of Francesco Barbagelata, domiciled in said San Francisco,\u201d is incontestable, and makes unnecessary the other issue, except, perhaps, for the vindication of the family honor and the exoneration of the name of the mother of these children, the virtuous mother of the petitioner and of the others named as his children by her in the last will and testament of Domingo Ghirardelli, senior.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-5\">The legacy in article sixth of that will must refer to petitioner, and cannot possibly indicate any other person. There is not and there never was anyone else who answered to that particular and specific description; even if it were a misdescription, so long as the object be identifiable, it may not be avoided, but it is not a misdescription; the identity of the person in the mind of the testator is certain, clear, definite and specific; it is impossible of misapprehension in the light of the evidence in this ease; the applicant here, and she alone, responds to the terms of this most explicit provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Counsel for applicant argued orally that the cardinal rule of construction is that the will must show affirmatively that testator had his child or children in mind; it must show on the face of the will that he intended to omit provision for the child. If the testator thought she was not his child, how could he have her in mind as his child? If he mentally doubted, disputed or denied his paternity as to her, then he could not have formed an intention to disinherit, because according to his belief she had not inheritable quality; assume, says Mr. Turn Suden, that he knew her to be his child, then it might be different; but that is not this case, counsel insists, for his declaration that he had but six children excluded her. Counsel\u2019s argument is creditable to his fertile fancy, but the cardinal canon of construction and the facts against his contention and his client are to\u00f3 strong to be successfully assailed. His claim is not only not affirmatively established, it is overthrown by a mass of direct and positive proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-3\">Application denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
