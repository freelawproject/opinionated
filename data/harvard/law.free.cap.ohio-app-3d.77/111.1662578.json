In a second indictment he was charged with sexual battery and forcible rape of Dawn\u2019s six-year-old friend, Tasha Cornwell. The cases were consolidated for trial. Appellant conducted his own defense at trial, and was convicted by a jury on all charges. Pursuant to R.C. 2907.02(B), which provides for life imprisonment when a rape was perpetrated by force or threat of force, the trial court sentenced appellant to two consecutive terms of life imprisonment on the forcible rape convictions, two definite terms of two years\u2019 imprisonment on the sexual battery counts, and an indefinite term of ten to twenty-five years\u2019 incarceration on the count of gross sexual imposition. All sentences were ordered to be served consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-14\">The charges against appellant arose out of an investigation by the Children Services Division of the Auglaize County Department of Human Services, based on a report concerning possible neglect of Tasha Cornwell. When the caseworker interviewed the child, she learned of the possible sexual abuse of Tasha and her friend Dawn Overholt by Dawn\u2019s father, the appellant herein. The girls were interviewed by social service and medical personnel, and both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>received physical examinations. Appellant\u2019s three children were subsequently removed from their home and placed into foster care.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Appellant first hired an attorney for his defense, who at the pretrial and arraignment informed the court that appellant was willing to enter a plea to one count of attempted rape. The court at that time reminded appellant of the nature and seriousness of the charges he faced, and potential punishments.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">After a lengthy discussion with the judge, appellant decided he would rather go to trial, and pled not guilty. He then requested to dismiss his attorney. After some inquiry into the attorney-client relationship, and a brief assessment of appellant\u2019s knowledge and educational level, the judge appointed the same attorney to represent appellant at trial. The attorney then made a motion to withdraw as counsel, citing appellant\u2019s pending grievance against him with the Disciplinary Counsel, and incompatibility. Appellant told the court that he could procure another attorney to assist him. At a subsequent pretrial hearing, appellant requested to represent himself. After questioning him about his waiver of counsel, the court determined that appellant could represent himself, and appointed another attorney to act as standby counsel. The court then ordered a competency evaluation to be performed by the Dayton Area Forensic Center. Although found competent to stand trial, appellant, at the subsequent competency hearing, asked the court to appoint counsel on his behalf. The court appointed William Zimmerman, the previously appointed standby counsel, to represent him. However, at the final pretrial hearing, Zimmerman informed the court that appellant had fired him, and that he had plans to retain counsel with the help of his family. The trial court then acquiesced to appellant\u2019s latest request, but informed him that no further delays or continuances would be allowed, and that the trial would commence as rescheduled.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">Appellant appeared for trial without counsel, and again informed the court that he wished to conduct his own defense. The court admonished him concerning his waiver of the right to counsel, and determined that the waiver was voluntary. Zimmerman was again appointed to act as standby counsel. Voir dire commenced shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">During voir dire and throughout the trial, appellant was repeatedly cautioned by the court against testifying and discussing matters not in evidence. He was also advised to freely utilize standby counsel as a resource. Before the prosecution rested its case, Zimmerman stated for the record that appellant had made serious errors in his cross-examinations, had refused another offer for plea negotiation, and had refused to consult with standby counsel. Appellant reiterated his preference for self-representation. Near the close of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>the defense, appellant requested to \u201cfire himself\u201d and have his standby counsel take over for the remainder of the trial and for closing argument. The trial judge, considering appellant\u2019s performance throughout the proceedings, and the \u201clateness\u201d of the event, denied appellant\u2019s \u201cmotion.\u201d The judge again reminded appellant that he was at liberty to consult with Zimmerman for the completion of the trial. Appellant then proceeded to make his closing remarks to the jury. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">Appellant also elected to represent himself at the sentencing hearing. After sentencing, he was advised of his right to appointed counsel for purposes of appeal. Appellant chose to accept assistance of counsel, and notice was timely filed. He has asserted five assignments of error for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">First Assignment of Error</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-6\">\u201cThe trial court failed to obtain a written waiver of appellant\u2019s right to counsel, as required by Rule 44(C) of the Ohio Rules of Criminal Procedure, resulting in a denial of appellant\u2019s rights pursuant to the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Crim.R. 44(C) provides: \u201cWaiver of counsel shall be in open court and the advice and waiver shall be recorded as provided in Rule 22. In addition, in serious offense cases the waiver shall be in writing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">We have frequently held in past cases that, when non-compliance with a procedural rule is complained of, strict compliance with <em>form </em>is not required as long as there has been compliance with the substance and the spirit of the rule. Although we would not downplay the importance of the constitutional right to counsel, we conclude that the right is not compromised when its supporting procedural rule is substantially complied with. The record in this case reflects substantial compliance with the writing requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">Pursuant to the first sentence of Crim.R. 44(C), waiver of counsel must be made in open court and recorded. Appellant has not complained that this requirement was violated, and the record contains evidence that the condition was satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">Crim.R. 44(C) also requires that, in serious cases, the right to counsel must be waived in writing. During the June 27, 1990 pre-trial hearing, the judge ordered appellant\u2019s handwritten \u201crequest to represent myself and defend myself\u201d included in the record, after discussion \u201cin open court\u201d of the right to counsel. We find that the recorded writing constitutes sufficient written waiver of counsel, and overrule appellant\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>Second Assignment of Error</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-4\">\u201cAppellant did not knowingly or intelligently waive his right to counsel, resulting in a denial of appellant\u2019s right pursuant to the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-5\">\u201cA. The colloquy conducted by the trial court pursuant to <em>Faretta v. California </em>(1985), [sic] 422 U.S. 806 [95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562], was inadequate to ascertain whether appellant understood the full significance of his waiver of counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-6\">\u201cB. It was obvious throughout the trial that appellant did not understand that by waiving his right to counsel, appellant would be required to undertake the full range of activities normally undertaken by an attorney in a criminal trial, or that he would be required to comply with the rules governing criminal procedure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-7\">\u201cC. It was further obvious from his behavior both before and during trial that appellant lacked the capacity to enter a knowing, intelligent waiver of counsel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">We find these contentions to be not well taken. The record adequately supports the trial judge\u2019s decision to accept appellant\u2019s waiver of the right to counsel. The United States Supreme Court held, in <em>Faretta v. California </em>(1975), 422 U.S. 806, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562, that the federal Constitution grants to a defendant in a state criminal trial the right to voluntarily and intelligently waive representation by counsel, and to \u201cpersonally manage and conduct his own defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 817-818, 95 S.Ct. at 2532, 45 L.Ed.2d at 571-572. The court asserted in <em>Faretta </em>that a defendant\u2019s right to autonomy in choosing the means and extent of his defense must be respected, even to the extent that such a right \u201cseems to cut against the grain\u201d of the court\u2019s decisions which have required that an accused must be accorded the right to assistance of counsel before he may be convicted or imprisoned. See <em>id. </em>at 832-834, 95 S.Ct. at 2538-2541, 45 L.Ed.2d at 579-581. See, also, <em>Illinois v. Allen </em>(1970), 397 U.S. 337, 350-351, 90 S.Ct. 1057, 1063-1064, 25 L.Ed.2d 353, 362-363; <em>Gideon v. Wainwright </em>(1963), 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799; <em>Powell v. Alabama </em>(1932), 287 U.S. 45, 53 S.Ct. 55, 77 L.Ed. 158. The <em>Faretta </em>decision requires that since a defendant managing his own defense relinquishes the benefits associated with assistance of counsel, he must \u201cknowingly and intelligently\u201d elect to abandon the right to those benefits. See <em>Faretta, </em>422 U.S. at 835, 95 S.Ct. at 2541, 45 L.Ed.2d at 581. The Ohio Supreme Court, following <em>Faretta, </em>has held that, to establish effective waiver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>of assistance of counsel, \u201cthe trial court must make sufficient inquiry to determine whether defendant fully understands and relinquishes that right.\u201d <em>State v. Gibson </em>(1976) 45 Ohio St.2d 366, 74 O.O.2d 525, 345 N.E.2d 399, paragraph two of the syllabus. The <em>Gibson </em>court set forth the elements of a \u201csufficient inquiry\u201d in a trial court\u2019s determination that there was \u201can intelligent and competent waiver by the accused.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 376, 74 O.O.2d at 531, 345 N.E.2d at 406 (citing <em>Von Moltke v. Gillies </em>[1948], 332 U.S. 708, 723, 68 S.Ct. 316, 323, 92 L.Ed. 309, 321). The trial judge\u2019s responsibility in accepting a defendant\u2019s waiver of counsel includes the determination that the waiver was made \u201cwith an apprehension of the nature of the charges, the statutory offenses included within them, the range of allowable punishments thereunder, possible defenses to the charges and circumstances in mitigation thereof, and all other facts essential to a broad understanding of the whole matter.\u201d <em>Von Moltke, </em>332 U.S. at 724, 68 S.Ct. at 323, 92 L.Ed. at 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The record herein contains sufficient evidence to satisfy this court that appellant did make an intelligent and competent waiver of his constitutional right to assistance of counsel at trial. The thousand-page record of appellant\u2019s trial and pretrial hearings, submitted for purposes of appeal, is replete with the judge\u2019s explanations and warnings to appellant of the dangers of acting in his own defense. The judge repeatedly gave appellant the opportunity, and in fact pleaded with him, to accept counsel for his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The court determined early in the proceedings that appellant was aware of the charges against him and the \u201callowable penalties\u201d that awaited him if convicted. The trial judge took further measures to assure himself of appellant\u2019s competency by ordering a professional evaluation prior to trial. That evaluation, conducted by a forensic psychologist, verified that appellant was competent to stand trial, that he was of average or above-average intelligence, that he was capable of understanding the purposes and adversarial nature of the trial process, and that he had begun planning his defense strategy. Even if the court failed to precisely evaluate appellant\u2019s familiarity with the proper rules of evidence and procedure, or his knowledge of the criminal justice system, this omission was palliated by the appointment of standby counsel to assist appellant during all stages of the trial. The trial judge advised appellant countless times throughout the trial that counsel was available to him for consultation on any matters, substantive or procedural. As this court has previously recognized, the easy availability of counsel to the defendant \u201cserved to preserve for the appellant the traditional benefits associated with the right to counsel while still permitting appellant to present his own defense.\u201d <em>State v. Allen </em>(Mar. 1, 1988), Allen App. No. 1-86-11, unreported, at 6, 1988 WL 29241. That appellant stubbornly refused to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>cooperate with or consult with the appointed standby counsel (who repeatedly assured appellant and the court that he was completely available) may not now be capitalized on by him in a complaint that he was denied a competent defense. See <em>Faretta, supra, </em>422 U.S. 806, 835, 95 S.Ct. at 2541, 45 L.Ed.2d at 581, fn. 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">We believe that the requirements of <em>Faretta, </em>expressed in <em>State v. Gibson, supra, </em>have been met, and that appellant\u2019s waiver was adequately determined by the trial court to be knowing and intelligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">For his second and third contentions, appellant asserts that, because of his obviously deficient performance at trial, he should now be permitted to cry \u201cfoul\u201d and start anew. Appellant complains that, in retrospect, his understanding of the full range of activities undertaken by an attorney in a criminal trial was minimal, at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">This court will not review <em>de novo </em>the trial judge\u2019s determination that appellant was competent, albeit with the assistance of standby counsel, to conduct his own defense. The United States Supreme Court stated in <em>Faretta, </em>422 U.S. at 836, 95 S.Ct. at 2541, 45 L.Ed.2d at 582, that \u201c[the defendant\u2019s] legal knowledge, as such, was not relevant to an assessment of his knowing exercise of the right to defend himself.\u201d By appointing willing and able standby counsel to assist at every stage of the trial, the trial judge in this case preserved for appellant the traditional benefits associated with the right to counsel. In addition, the record demonstrates that appellant was informed of the standards he would be expected to comply with in conducting his defense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-8\">\u201c[I]n representing yourself, you or anyone else must do so in accordance with the Rules of Criminal Procedure and the Rules of Practice. You may not make a request other than through motion. You may not correspond through letter to the court but instead must follow the procedures which are required of anyone, which include proof of service and include filing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">At the cited hearing, standby counsel was appointed to assist appellant with procedural and other issues that would arise prior to and during trial. Frequently throughout the actual trial, appellant was reminded to conduct examination of witnesses and make motions and objections according to required procedure, and that counsel was available to assist him. A quote from <em>Faretta, supra, </em>illustrates our position on appellant\u2019s second and third contentions:</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">\u201cIt is undeniable that in most criminal prosecutions defendants could better defend with counsel\u2019s guidance than by their own unskilled efforts. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>where the defendant will not voluntarily accept representation by counsel, the potential advantage of a lawyer\u2019s training and experience can be realized, if at all, only imperfectly. To force a lawyer on a defendant can only lead him to believe that the law contrives against him. * * * And although he may conduct his own defense ultimately to his own detriment, his choice must be honored out of \u2018that respect for the individual which is the lifeblood of the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Faretta, </em>422 U.S. at 834, 95 S.Ct. at 2540-2541, 45 L.Ed.2d at 581 (quoting <em>Illinois v. Allen </em>[1970], 397 U.S. 337, 350-351, 90 S.Ct. at 1064-1065, 25 L.Ed.2d at 361-363). Therefore, the second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Third Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">\u201cThe trial court committed plain error in failing to <em>sua sponte </em>declare a mistrial or in the alternative to revoke its consent for the appellant to proceed without counsel where appellant clearly failed to comprehend either correct criminal procedure or the role of defense counsel in a criminal prosecution, and where appellant either failed or refused to consult with standby counsel, in violation pursuant to <em>\\sic </em>] both the United States and Ohio Constitutions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">The Ohio Supreme Court has indicated the general standard of review to be followed by appellate courts examining lower court judgments: \u201c[A]n appellate court should not consider questions which have not been properly raised in the trial court and upon which the trial court has had no opportunity to pass.\u201d <em>State v. Long </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 95, 7 O.O.3d 178, 180, 372 N.E.2d 804, 807. Although an appellate court may, <em>sua sponte, </em>review an error not raised in the trial court, there must be a strong showing that \u201cbut for the error, the outcome of the trial clearly would have been otherwise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus. The <em>Long </em>court went on to state that \u201cthe plain error rule should be applied with caution and should be invoked only to avoid a clear miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 95-96, 7 O.O.3d at 180, 372 N.E.2d at 807.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">Since substantial evidence was presented at trial to support appellant\u2019s jury conviction of the charged offenses, it is far from clear that appellant\u2019s conviction would not have occurred but for his representation of himself. Thus, in light of our discussion of appellant\u2019s second assignment of error, <em>supra, </em>which encompasses the issues presented here, we overrule the third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">Fourth Assignment of Error</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-10\">\u201cWhere appellant initially opted to proceed without counsel, the trial court abused its discretion in refusing appellant\u2019s request to appoint counsel after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>the trial was under way and it became apparent that appellant was incapable of effectively representing himself, in violation of his rights pursuant to the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Again, appellant urges us to consider his inept management of his defense at trial to support a reversal of his conviction. As stated above, a retrospective analysis is not required when a trial court makes a legally sufficient determination that a defendant is competent to waive his right to counsel. Although appellant cites some support for the proposition that the trial judge had the authority to rescind the consent to self-representation, the case relied on clearly states that defendants have no statutory or constitutional right to \u201chybrid representation,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>\u201cactive participation by appointed counsel in their defense in addition to self-representation.\u201d See <em>State v. Carter </em>(1977), 53 Ohio App.2d 125, 127-128, 7 O.O.3d 90, 92, 372 N.E.2d 622, 625. Federal courts following <em>Faretta </em>have also held that, although an accused may elect to be defended by himself or by counsel, he has no right to \u201chybrid representation.\u201d See, <em>e.g., United States v. Mosely </em>(C.A.6, 1987), 810 F.2d 93; <em>United States v. Hill </em>(C.A.10, 1975), 526 F.2d 1019; <em>United States v. Wolfish </em>(C.A.2, 1975), 525 F.2d 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The record reflects that in this case, although the trial judge repeatedly recommended against appellant\u2019s assumption of his own defense, and urged him to rely on standby counsel during the trial, appellant reiterated his desire to conduct his own defense on all occasions. Only near the close of the trial, when the state had rested, and the defense had only one more witness to examine, did appellant assert his right to counsel. The court, noting the advanced stage of the trial, refused to allow standby counsel to \u201ctake over,\u201d but again exhorted appellant to utilize counsel in the preparation of his closing argument. We find no error in the trial court\u2019s actions. However, considering the advanced stage of the trial, the flagrant mistakes appellant made in conducting his own defense, and appellant\u2019s refusal to utilize the resources made available to him, any error the court may have made at that point would only be considered \u201charmless.\u201d Therefore, we overrule the fourth assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Fifth Assignment of Error</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-8\">\u201cThe trial court committed plain error in ordering appellant as part of his sentence to pay the cost of psychological counseling for the two alleged victims through the age of eighteen.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">Although the legislature has provided for award of restitution to victims of crime, the Supreme Court has not, to date, interpreted such statutes to grant reimbursement for mere speculative injury, or psychological harm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>indirectly or directly resulting from criminal activity. While we do not believe that the award is inappropriate, the law of restitution in Ohio has not been extended to cover the situation before us. We do not apply the \u201cplain error\u201d rule, as urged by appellant, but we do suggest that such an award has, to date, little or no foundation, and thus constitutes an abuse of discretion by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The issue has, however, been addressed in a few of the intermediate appeals courts. <em>E.g., State v. Wohlgemuth </em>(1990), 66 Ohio App.3d 195, 583 N.E.2d 1076; <em>State v. Williams </em>(1986), 34 Ohio App.3d 33, 516 N.E.2d 1270. In <em>Williams, </em>the defendant was ordered to make restitution to the family of the victim of defendant\u2019s \u201caggravated vehicular homicide.\u201d The court pointed out that, under R.C. 2929.11(E), restitution may be required from a felon for \u201call or part of the property damage that is caused by his offense,\u201d and that the actual damage or loss caused must be \u201cestablished to a reasonable degree of certainty before restitution can be ordered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 34, 516 N.E.2d at 1271. As stated by the appellant herein, the statutory definition of \u201cproperty\u201d does not include medical or psychiatric expenses. The appellant\u2019s fifth assignment of error is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Having found no error prejudicial to appellant in the first four assignments of error argued and briefed, the judgement of the trial court as to appellant\u2019s convictions and penal sentences is affirmed, and, as the order for restitution was improper, the trial court\u2019s judgment for restitution against appellant is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b151-8\">Hadley and Shaw, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
