Although each defendant has.appealed his or her conviction to this court, the present appeal concerns only the conviction of Shannon Blankenship,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> who assigns the following errors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-8\">\u201c1. The verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-9\"><em>\u201c2. </em>Defendants were deprived of their right to due process of law in violation of the United States constitution and their statutory and procedural rights when the trial court denied a motion for mistrial, after a crucial witness\u2019 prior statements were not timely produced by the prosecution after direct examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-10\">\u201c3. When a witness cannot comprehend the questions being asked of him because of his lack of knowledge of the English language, prejudicial error occurs when an interpreter is not used to assist the trial court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-11\"><em>\u201c4. </em>When a trial court is unaware of bias or prejudice demonstrated by a civil suit filed after the criminal trial, appellants are denied a fair trial in that it is reasonable to conclude the verdict would have been different if the trial court had been aware of said civil suit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-12\">\u201c5. Where the evidence construed in the light most favorable to the state shows that appellants could not have formed the specific intent nec\u00e9ssary for felonious assault, the verdicts must be reversed and remanded for a new trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>In his first assignment of error, defendant contends that the verdict of the trial court is against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Preliminarily, we note the test for determining the sufficiency and weight of the evidence:</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">\u201c * * * [I]s whether any reasonable trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. In other words, an appellate court\u2019s function when reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction is to examine the evidence admitted at trial to determine whether such evidence, if believed, would convince the average mind of the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. [Citation omitted.] Thus, in reviewing both weight and sufficiency of the evidence, the same test is applied. The verdict will not be disturbed unless the appellate court finds that reasonable minds could not reach the conclusion reached by the trier of facts. * * *\u201d <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 273, 574 N.E.2d 492, 503.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">In each instance, the weight given to the evidence in determinations as to credibility of witnesses are matters primarily for the trier of fact. <em>State v. DeHass </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 39 O.O.2d 366, 227 N.E.2d 212, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">R.C. 2903.11 defines \u201cfelonious assault\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-9\">\u201c(A) No person shall knowingly:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-10\">\u201c(1) Cause serious physical harm to another;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-11\">\u201c(2) Cause or attempt to cause physical harm to another by means of a deadly weapon or dangerous ordnance * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-12\">Applying those parameters herein, we note that Gordie\u2019s testimony, if believed, supports defendant\u2019s conviction for felonious assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-13\">According to Gordie, in the afternoon of March 27, 1990, he and two of his employees, Joe McDonald and James Cannaday, were returning to Gordie\u2019s restaurant at 1011 West Broad Street, having wound up business for the day. The three men were traveling in a van driven by Gordie, pulling a trailer carrying three concession carts used in Gordie\u2019s business. As they proceeded north on Dakota Avenue, the van encountered a car double-parked on the roadway, blocking their path. Seeing no one in the vehicle, Gordie honked his horn and waited for a brief period for the operator to return. Gordie then called to a woman standing in the doorway of a nearby home and asked if the car belonged to her. Kay Blankenship responded that she was the owner of the vehicle; and Gordie asked her to \u201cplease move it.\u201d Kay Blankenship refused profanely.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-14\">Gordie instructed McDonald to call the police. In leaving the van, McDonald immediately was confronted by Kay Blankenship; angry words were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>exchanged. Pickelsimer, Kay Blankenship\u2019s brother, arrived and began swinging an object in front of McDonald in a karate-style fashion. Gordie then noticed defendant had become involved in the argument and called him over to the van to \u201ctry to reason with him.\u201d During Gordie\u2019s conversation with defendant, Kay Blankenship entered the van through the side door and exchanged words with Gordie. The two began struggling for possession of a food cooler inside the van, during which Kay Blankenship punched Gordie in the face and scratched him. Kay exited the van with the cooler, and Gordie followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">As Kay Blankenship emptied the contents of the cooler onto the street and the two struggled for possession of the empty cooler, Kay Blankenship hit Gordie in the face and kicked the cooler across the street. By that time, Gordie noticed that a large crowd had gathered. When the crowd began moving towards him in a menacing fashion, he retreated to his van. After several rocks were thrown at the van, Gordie, fearing for his safety, picked up a steel ramp used to load and unload the concession carts, and held it up for protection. When he picked up the ramp, the crowd, lead by defendant and Pickelsimer, withdrew to the other side of the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">When Gordie went out into the street to retrieve his cooler, he observed defendant approaching him brandishing a steel pipe. Gordie immediately dropped the ramp and cried \u201cno fight, no fight.\u201d Defendant threw several stones or bricks at him and struck him three times with a steel pipe on the left side of his body. Another man Gordie could not identify swung a two-by-four at him and wrestled him to the ground. Two other men then joined the fracas, and grabbed him under both arms; as he was being held upright, Pickelsimer delivered a blow to his forehead with a tire jack. Defendant then hit Gordie three or four more times with a steel pipe while Pickelsimer screamed \u201clet\u2019s kill him. Let\u2019s kill him.\u201d Gordie managed to break free just before another unidentified man approached him with a shovel.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Covered with blood, Gordie staggered back to his van and collapsed. Not until another unidentified man came to Gordie\u2019s aid did the attack cease.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">Defendant disputed much of Gordie\u2019s testimony; and defendant\u2019s testimony that an unidentified young black male had been involved in the fracas and had actually caused the serious harm Gordie suffered was partially corroborated by other defense witnesses. However, as we pointed out in <em>State v. Pickel-simer </em>(Aug. 8, 1991), Franklin App. No. 91AP-221, unreported, 1991 WL 150931, the credibility of these witnesses is open to serious question based upon their relationship to the defendants. As we noted therein, \u201cthe trial court could have reasonably determined that the neighbors of South Dakota Avenue where this altercation took place, many of whom were friends who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>had grown up together and others who were close associates, had gotten together to attempt to pin the blame on an unidentified black man rather than a friend and neighbor.\u201d By resolving the conflicting testimony in favor of a finding of guilt, the court chose to believe Gordie and his employee rather than defendant\u2019s evidence. <em>DeHass, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">A conviction supported by sufficient credible evidence will not be overturned as against the manifest weight of the evidence. See <em>State v. Davis </em>(1980), 70 Ohio App.2d 48, 24 O.O.3d 42, 434 N.E.2d 285. Since Gordie\u2019s testimony supports each element of the crime of felonious assault, defendant\u2019s conviction for felonious assault is not against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">As part of defendant\u2019s first assignment of error, defendant also contends that the trial court applied an incorrect legal standard to defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense when it held that defendant had a duty to retreat.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\"><em>State v. Williford </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 247, 551 N.E.2d 1279, defines \u201cself-defense\u201d as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">\u201c * * * [S]elf-defense is an affirmative defense. * * * To establish self-defense, the defendant must show \u2018***(1)*** [he] was not at fault in creating the situation giving rise to the affray; (2) * * * [he] has <em>[sic </em>] a bona fide belief that he was in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm and that his only means of escape from such danger was in the use of * * * force; and (3) * * * [he] must not have violated any duty to retreat or avoid the danger. * * * \u2019 <em>State v. Robbins </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 74, 12 O.O.3d 84, 388 N.E.2d 755.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 249, 551 N.E.2d at 1281.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">The court further stated that:</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">\u201c * * * \u2018If the defendant fails to prove <em>any one </em>of these elements by a preponderance of the evidence he has failed to demonstrate that he acted in self-defense.\u2019 (Emphasis <em>sic.)\u201d Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">The trial judge, acting as a trier of fact, specifically found that \u201cdefendants were the aggressors and continued their attack at Gordie until he was beaten to a bloody pulp, and no effort was made to retreat or avoid a fight.\u201d Hence, defendant has failed to establish that he was not at fault in creating the situation giving rise to the affray; and he thus cannot establish one of the necessary elements of self-defense, regardless of whether he had a duty to retreat.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">Defendant further contends that the trial court erred by finding defendant guilty of felonious assault where sufficient evidence of serious provocation was presented. We disagree. Under R.C. 2903.12, to be serious, provocation must be reasonably sufficient to bring on extreme stress; and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>provocation must be sufficient to incite or to arouse the defendant into using deadly force. See <em>State v. Deem </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 205, 533 N.E.2d 294. The argument immediately proceeding the assault is insufficient as a matter of law to constitute provocation for the serious physical assault upon Gordie described in the state\u2019s evidence. Cf. <em>State v. Locklear </em>(Oct. 21, 1986), Franklin App. No. 86AP-235, unreported, 1986 WL 12906.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Defendant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">In his second assignment of error, defendant contends that he was deprived of due process of law by the trial court\u2019s failure to declare a mistrial after learning that prior witness statements had been withheld from defense counsel. Specifically, defendant contends that the state failed to provide prior statements Gordie made to detectives Phillip Ruiz and Sharon Ceckitti.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">Following Gordie\u2019s direct examination, defense counsel requested that the prosecution turn over any prior statements made by the witness. The prosecution stated that no prior signed statements existed. However, after Ruiz took the stand defendant learned that Ruiz had spoken to Gordie in the hospital immediately after the incident and had completed a police report. Defense counsel immediately moved for a mistrial. The trial court reviewed the report, denied the motion for mistrial and handed the report to defense counsel. The report is part of the record as state Exhibit \u201cA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(g) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-9\">\u201cUpon completion of a witness\u2019 direct examination at trial, the court on motion of the defendant shall conduct an in camera inspection of the witness\u2019 written or recorded statement with the defense attorney and the prosecuting attorney present and participating, to determine the existence of inconsistencies, if any, between the testimony of such witness and the prior statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-10\">\u201cIf the court determines that inconsistencies exist, the statement shall be given to the defense attorney for use in cross-examination of the witness as to the inconsistencies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-11\">\u201cIf the court determines that inconsistencies do not exist the statement shall not be given to the defense attorney and he shall not be permitted to cross-examine or comment thereon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-12\">A \u201cstatement\u201d as is used in Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(g) has been defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-13\"><em>u&lt;* * </em>* Before a writing or recording can be considered a \u201cstatement\u201d of the witness * * * it must be shown that either the witness prepared, signed or adopted the statement, or that it minimally is a continuous, narrative statement made by the witness and recorded verbatim, or nearly so.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Henry </em>(1987), 37 Ohio App.3d 3, 8, 523 N.E.2d 877, 883.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>The state attempts to justify its failure to timely disclose the report by arguing that the report does not constitute a \u201cstatement\u201d since it lacks Gordie\u2019s signature. Although the trial court reviewed the report prior to denying defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial, the record contains no indication whether the court considered the report to be a statement. While the absence of Gordie\u2019s signature does not preclude a conclusion that the report contains Gordie\u2019s statement, see <em>State v. Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 164, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264, even if the report includes a \u201cstatement,\u201d defendant was not prejudiced by the belated disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Specifically, even after the report was turned over to defense counsel, defendant made no attempt to recall Gordie for further cross-examination. Moreover, defendant points to no material inconsistencies between the report and Gordie\u2019s trial testimony. Consequently, any error resulting from the belated disclosure of the report was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Defendant also contends that his constitutional rights were violated by the state\u2019s failure to disclose witness statements generated by Ceckitti\u2019s investigation. Although Gordie stated that Ceckitti spoke to him on five or six occasions after the incident, the record contains no indication that any of these conversations were either recorded or reduced to writing in a form falling within the parameters of Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(g). Since Ceckitti was not called as a witness at trial, this court has no way of knowing whether Ceckitti\u2019s conversations with the victim generated any \u201cstatements\u201d within the meaning of Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(g). See <em>Henry, supra. </em>Accordingly, defendant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">In his third assignment of error, defendant contends that the trial court erred in failing to utilize the services of an interpreter during the cross-examination of Gordie. Defendant submits that Gordie\u2019s inability to comprehend English unfairly prevented effective cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">Initially, we note that at no time during either direct examination or cross-examination of Gordie did any party request the aid of an interpreter. Moreover, a review of Gordie\u2019s testimony in its entirety reveals that Gordie communicated effectively and responded to counsel\u2019s queries. While Gordie did express some reservations about his own ability to speak and comprehend English, his answers remained responsive. In short, absent some action at trial bringing any language problem to the attention of the trial court, we are unable to find reversible error with respect to the lack of an interpreter at trial. Accordingly, defendant\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">In his fourth assignment of error, defendant contends that the outcome of the trial would have been different had the trial court known that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>state\u2019s chief witness was biased against defendant. Specifically, defendant contends that, subsequent to defendant\u2019s conviction, Gordie filed a civil damages action against defendant and thus had a financial stake in the criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">By judgment entry dated June 5,1991, this court denied defendant\u2019s motion to supplement the record with a copy of Gordie\u2019s civil complaint, stating that the record contains no indication that the trial court considered the complaint. Consequently, the record provides no basis to support the claimed error. More significantly, however, even if the civil complaint was part of the record, we would find no reversible error, as defendant never raised at trial the issue of Gordie\u2019s potential bias. As the Supreme Court noted in <em>State v. Ferguson </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 160, 5 OBR 380, 450 N.E.2d 265, the fact that the civil suit had not yet been filed does not preclude counsel from inquiring into such potential bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">\u201cAn accused is permitted to cross-examine the prosecuting witness as to the witness\u2019 pending or <em>contemplated civil action </em>against the accused, in order to demonstrate any possible bias or prejudice arising out of the witness\u2019 financial interest in the outcome of the prosecution.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at paragraph three of syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Defendant cannot now complain that the court was unaware of the potential bias when he failed to bring that potential bias to the court\u2019s attention. Defendant\u2019s fourth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">In his fifth assignment of error defendant contends that he lacked the specific intent necessary to sustain his conviction for felonious assault. Defendant submits that, since he did not become involved in the altercation with the specific intention of inflicting serious harm upon the victim, he cannot be found guilty of felonious assault. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">R.C. 2903.11 is violated by \u201cknowingly\u201d causing serious physical harm to another or \u201cknowingly\u201d causing or attempting to cause physical harm to another by means of a deadly weapon or dangerous ordnance. The term \u201cknowingly\u201d as used in R.C. 2903.11 is defined in R.C. 2901.22(B) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-10\">\u201cA person acts knowingly, regardless of his purpose, when he is aware that his conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when he is aware that such circumstances probably exist.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">The testimony in the record supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that defendant knew his actions would probably result in serious physical harm to Gordie. Defendant admitted hurling large rocks at Gordie and other witnesses testified that defendant struck Gordie with a lead pipe several times. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>Defendant\u2019s specific intentions at the time he arrived on the scene of the altercation are of no consequence. Accordingly, defendant\u2019s fifth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Having overruled each of defendant\u2019s five assignments of error, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b363-7\">McCormac and Petree, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b356-13\">.
