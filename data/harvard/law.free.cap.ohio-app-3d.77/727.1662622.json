The auction was organized and conducted by appellee Charleston Auctioneers, with appellee ERA Cagnet Will Sell, Inc. (\u201cERA Cagnet\u201d) serving as the real estate broker for the sale. Appellant became aware of the property\u2019s availability when he received a three-page flier describing the location, features, and condition of the property. The flier also announced the location and date of the auction, the terms of sale, and other \u201cimportant information,\u201d including a disclaimer of liability for incorrect information or unknown defects, and extended an invitation to inspect and pre-view the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">The auction, without reserve, was held as scheduled on December 14, 1989. Appellant was the high bidder at the auction; his bid was accepted by Charleston Auctioneers, agent for Ley Industries. The parties then, with the assistance of an agent of ERA Cagnet, completed the seller\u2019s standard form \u201cAgreement to Purchase Real Estate.\u201d Presumably, this form was completed in order to satisfy the terms of sale presented in the auction advertisement, which read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-9\">\u201cThe high bidder, with the assistance of Charleston Auctioneers, will submit a written offer in a form acceptable to the seller.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-10\">During the preparation of the form \u201cAgreement,\u201d appellant requested inclusion of the following condition: \u201cSold as is except for E.P.A. inspection.\u201d There was no accompanying discussion as to the implications of that statement, and no agreement as to the effects of an unfavorable report. Appellant deposited $36,250 with Charleston Auctioneers as a down payment on the property, as required by the advertisement\u2019s \u201cterms of sale.\u201d Although the pre-printed sales form, filled out by the seller\u2019s agent at the conclusion of the auction, proclaims that the five percent earnest money deposit is intended to be forfeited upon default of the buyer, the auction advertisement was silent as to any forfeit or refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>Appellant refused to close on the scheduled date, explaining that the inspection report he had received cited three potential environmental problems with the property. Appellant did not request any extension of time to further investigate the inspector\u2019s recommendations, but simply claimed that the contract was voidable because of the \u201cfailed\u201d condition. Both Ley Industries and appellant made demands on the auctioneer for surrender of the $36,250 deposit. Charleston Auctioneers, unsure as to the rights of the parties involved, retained possession of the earnest money deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">This action was initiated when Ley Industries filed a complaint against Charleston Auctioneers and ERA Cagnet demanding the deposit money, and a motion requesting that the court take control of the money at issue pending determination of the parties\u2019 rights. Meanwhile, Bowers filed a motion to intervene in the lawsuit, along with an \u201canswer,\u201d maintaining that his right to the deposit money was superior to that of any other claimants. The court eventually denied appellant\u2019s motion to intervene. However, in the interim, Charleston Auctioneers had filed a counterclaim against Ley Industries and cross-claim against Bowers, claiming it was owed a portion of the deposit money, for services rendered. The interpled defendant, Bowers, then filed an answer to the cross-claim, and filed his own cross-claim against Charleston Auctioneers and ERA Cagnet, and a counterclaim against plaintiff, Ley Industries. After the parties had all filed the appropriate answers and replies to the relevant claims, Ley Industries, the original plaintiff in the action, filed an amended complaint against Charleston Auctioneers and ERA Cagnet for interest and expenses, and a motion for summary judgment against Bowers, opposing his counterclaim. Following Bowers\u2019 response to plaintiff\u2019s motion, the remaining two parties in the action, Charleston Auctioneers and ERA Cagnet, joined in filing a motion for summary judgment supporting Ley Industries\u2019 motion and argument against Bowers.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">On September 19, 1990, the court rendered its decision granting all the pending motions for summary judgment against Bowers. The court at the same time dismissed Bowers\u2019 cross-claims and counterclaim against the other three parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">On October 5, 1990, Ley Industries filed for summary judgment against Charleston Auctioneers and ERA Cagnet. Ten days later, Bowers appealed the September 19 decision to this court. While that appeal was pending, Charleston Auctioneers and ERA Cagnet moved the court for summary judgment against Ley Industries. On December 4, 1990, this court dismissed Bowers\u2019 appeal for want of a final appealable order, since the trial court\u2019s judgment entry failed to conform with the requirements of Civ.R. 54(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>On February 8, 1991, the trial court issued its final order in this case, granting Charleston Auctioneers\u2019 and ERA Cagnet\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denying Ley Industries\u2019 motion requesting interest and expenses. The order also specified the proper distribution of the earnest money deposit between the three parties. Bowers, who failed to participate in either of the final summary judgment arguments, was ordered to pay costs. On February 19, 1991, Bowers again appealed the judgment of September 19, 1990, which became final with the issuance of the February 8,1991 judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">Appellant has advanced only one assignment of error for his appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-5\">\u201cThe trial court committed error prejudicial to the appellant in determining there were no material facts in dispute as between the parties and proceeding to rule on the law in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">All parties to this action asserted some claim to the earnest money appellant deposited with the auctioneer. However, the only issue properly before us is whether or not Bowers has a right to recover any part of the money he deposited with Charleston Auctioneers. Appellant contends throughout his appeal that because of the \u201ccontingency\u201d he himself inserted into the \u201cagreement,\u201d he retained a right to void the contract, and is entitled to the return of the earnest money.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">Although the trial court made a valiant effort to ascertain the parties\u2019 intent as to certain provisions in the real estate \u201cagreement,\u201d we conclude that those terms need not be considered when determining the rights of the parties herein. In an auction sale of real estate, the general rules of auction sales apply. The \u201coffer\u201d and \u201cacceptance\u201d that constitute essential elements of a valid contract are represented by the auction buyer\u2019s bid, and the auctioneer\u2019s \u201cfall of the hammer.\u201d The terms of the contract are understood to be those presented in the solicitations for bids published in the relevant advertisement or legal notice prior to the auction, or as modified by the auctioneer before bids are submitted. Thus, appellant, the bidder in this case, made his offer to contract on the terms that were set forth in the advertisement he received. Restatement of the Law 2d, Contracts (1981), Section 28(2). When the auctioneer accepts a bid as an agent of the seller, the contract is at that time formed. See <em>Hadley v. Clinton Cty. Importing Co. </em>(1862), 13 Ohio St. 502, 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">In an auction sale of real estate the contract must comport with the Statute of Frauds. Accordingly, the legal notice or advertisement, containing the description of the property and the other relevant terms of sale, along with the buyer\u2019s bid presented in written form, would constitute the parties\u2019 contract. Neither buyer nor seller has authority to unilaterally introduce new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>terms or conditions into the agreement after the contract is established, absent new or additional consideration for such modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">Since we deem ineffectual the \u201ccontingency\u201d concerning EPA inspection inserted into the \u201creal estate agreement\u201d between Ley Industries and appellant, we find appellant\u2019s argument for the ambiguity of the statement immaterial to a resolution of the issue to be decided herein. There are no material issues of fact to be determined. There does exist a valid contract between appellant and Ley Industries, effected at the auction sale, subject to the terms of sale of the advertisement admittedly relied on by appellant. The terms stipulate that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-5\">\u201cThe real estate will be sold \u2018as is, where is,\u2019 based entirely on the personal inspection and/or opinion of the purchaser and without any warranty or guaranty of any kind.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">The Ohio Supreme Court, in <em>Clinton, supra, </em>stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">\u201cIt would be difficult to maintain that a purchaser at a public sale, who so far complies with its terms as to take the property and pay for it, asking no express warranty, could be permitted to show that he did not inform himself of what were the actual terms of the sale, and derive advantage from the want of full and accurate information.\u201d <em>Id., </em>13 Ohio St. at 505-506.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">In light of the foregoing discussion, we conclude that appellant was or should have been aware of the terms he embraced in making his \u201coffer\u201d to contract, and that he had ample opportunity to inspect and evaluate the sale property prior to the auction. Appellant\u2019s excuse for his failure to perform the contract, \u201cfailure of condition,\u201d is invalid, since the condition pertaining to an EPA inspection never became part of the contract, due to lack of consideration for such modification. Appellant\u2019s own breach of the contract, along with his failure to present a valid defense for his repudiation, warrants his forfeiture of the earnest money deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">We agree with the trial court\u2019s ruling that the moving parties, Ley Industries, Charleston Auctioneers and ERA Cagnet, are entitled to judgment as a matter of law against appellant upon the cross-claims and counterclaims presented. The assignment of error is overruled. Therefore, having found no error prejudicial to the appellant herein in any of the particulars assigned and argued, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b762-11\">Thomas F.
