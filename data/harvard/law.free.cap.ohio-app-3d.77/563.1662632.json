The facts are essentially not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-15\">On March 26, 1990, appellee, Douglas R. Fouts, filed a complaint against appellant, alleging that appellant owed appellee for legal services rendered. The complaint, properly served, prayed for $8,606 plus interest and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-16\">The complaint was never answered and \u00e1 default judgment was taken against appellant on June 5, 1990. Thereafter, appellant was ordered to appear July 27, 1990 for a debtor\u2019s examination hearing. Appellant did not appear, and the debtor\u2019s examination was continued and rescheduled for August 31, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-17\">On August 29,1990, appellant filed a Civ.R. 60(B) motion, asserting that her failure to file an answer was the result of \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d Civ.R. 60(B)(1). Attached to the motion was appellant\u2019s affidavit, stating in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>\u201c4. Her [appellant\u2019s] physical and mental health have been so adversely affected that she is currently on medical leave from her employment due to the stress she has suffered because of the pending divorce action and she continues to see a psychiatrist on a weekly basis. Due to her mental and physical state she has been incapacitated from taking appropriate legal action to defend herself in the suit filed against her * * * in that she failed to inform her current attorney * * * of the action until the judgment had been entered against her. She is entitled to relief from judgment entered against her by this court due to excusable neglect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-5\"><em>It </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-6\">\u201c8. She [appellant] has a meritorious defense to present in that she denies that the amount of fees charged by plaintiff [appellee] reflect the reasonable value of his legal services in representing her in the divorce action * * *. Therefore, there is a failure of consideration.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">The trial court overruled appellant\u2019s motion on August 30, 1990, after which appellant timely filed a notice of appeal raising the following assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-8\">\u201c1. The trial court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion for relief from judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-9\"><em>\u201c2. </em>The trial court committed prejudicial error in not granting an evidentia-ry hearing where the defendant-appellant has met the requirements under Civ.R. 60(B) for relief from judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">Under Civ.R. 60(B), the moving party must show that the party has a meritorious defense, that the party is entitled to relief under one of the grounds stated in Civ.R. 60(B), and that the motion is made within a reasonable time. <em>GTE Automatic Elec., Inc. v. ARC Industries, Inc. </em>(1976), 47 Ohio St.2d 146, 1 O.O.3d 86, 351 N.E.2d 113, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-11\">With respect to the claimed meritorious defense, the movant is <em>not </em>required to prove that she will ultimately prevail if relief is granted. Rather, the burden on the moving party is only to <em>allege </em>operative facts which would constitute a meritorious defense if found to be true. <em>Colley v. Bazell </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 243, 247, 18 O.O.3d 442, 444, 416 N.E.2d 605, 608, at fn. 3; <em>Moore v. Emmanuel Family Training Ctr., Inc. </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 64, 67, 18 OBR 96, 99, 479 N.E.2d 879, 882.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-12\">In the instant case, appellant\u2019s allegation that fees charged by appellee did not reflect the reasonable value of his legal services, if found to be true, would constitute a meritorious defense to the <em>amount </em>of the default judgment entered in favor of appellee. Accordingly, the first prong of <em>GTE, supra, </em>has been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Under the second prong of the <em>GTE </em>test, appellant asserts that she is entitled to relief under one of the grounds specified in Civ.R. 60(B)(1) through (5) in that her failure to file an answer was the product of \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d Civ.R. 60(B)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Although appellant\u2019s affidavit indicates that she has been emotionally distraught over her pending divorce, causing her to take medical leave and seek psychiatric counseling, we have no operative facts as to the severity of her mental condition or whether her condition would have rendered her <em>incompetent </em>for purposes of receiving service or comprehending her legal obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">The case <em>sub judice </em>is clearly distinguishable from other Ohio cases where the movant\u2019s severe mental illness constituted excusable neglect. See <em>Brenner v. Shore </em>(1973), 34 Ohio App.2d 209, 211, 63 O.O.2d 373, 374, 297 N.E.2d 550, 551 (severe emotional strain resulted in hospitalization for \u201ccomplete physical and mental collapse\u201d); see, also, <em>Farrell v. Gray </em>(Mar. 27, 1990), Franklin App. No. 89AP-1062, unreported, 1990 WL 33556 (appellant\u2019s physician provided evidence that physical illness caused bizarre behavior, hallucinations, illogical thought processes, and impaired concentration).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Appellant having failed to allege operative facts demonstrating excusable neglect, the trial court did not err in overruling appellant\u2019s Civ.R. 60(B) motion without hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">This court parenthetically notes that appellant failed to demonstrate that her Civ.R. 60(B) motion was filed within.a \u201creasonable time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">Civ.R. 60(B) specifies that motions filed pursuant to Civ.R. 60(B)(1) through (3) must be made \u201cnot more than one year after the judgment, order or proceeding was entered or taken.\u201d Significantly, however, the rule also orders that the motion must be made \u201cwithin a reasonable time.\u201d Thus, \u201c[wjhile a party may have a possible right to file a motion to vacate a judgment up to one year after the entry of judgment, the motion is also subject to the \u2018reasonable time\u2019 provision.\u201d <em>Adomeit v. Baltimore </em>(1974), 39 Ohio App.2d 97, 106, 68 O.O.2d 251, 256, 316 N.E.2d 469, 476.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">In this regard, the movant has the burden of proof, and \u201cmust submit factual material which on its face demonstrates the timeliness of the motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 103, 68 O.O.2d at 254, 316 N.E.2d at 475. To sustain this burden, \u201cgood legal practice dictates that the movant * * * present allegations of operative facts to demonstrate that [s]he is filing [her] motion within a reasonable period of time.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>In <em>Mount Olive Baptist Church v. Pipkins Paints &amp; Home Improvement Ctr., Inc. </em>(1979), 64 Ohio App.2d 285, 18 O.O.3d 319, 413 N.E.2d 850, at paragraph two of the syllabus, the court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">\u201cA motion to vacate a default judgment which is filed nearly seven months after actual notice of the action and more than four months after default judgment was entered is not, on its face, a reasonable time within which to file the motion pursuant to Civ.R. 60(B)(5). <em>In the absence of any evidence explaining the delay, the movant has failed to demonstrate the timeliness of the motion.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Since appellant failed to present any explanation within her motion for the twelve-week delay in filing her motion to vacate the default judgment, she failed to demonstrate the timeliness of the motion. Cf. <em>Security Fed. S. &amp; L. Assn, of Cleveland v. Keyes </em>(June 29, 1990), Geauga App. No. 89-G-1524, unreported, 1990 WL 93135 (trial court\u2019s granting of a Civ.R. 60[B] motion held to be an abuse of discretion where appellee failed to offer any explanation for an eighteen-week delay in filing his motion to vacate the default judgment rendered against him); see, also, 2 Baldwin\u2019s Ohio Civil Practice (1988), Text 53.05(F) (\u201cAn unexplained or unjustified delay in making the motion after discovering a ground for relief may put the motion beyond the pale of a reasonable time.\u201d [Footnote omitted.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">Having determined that appellant\u2019s motion and affidavit did not contain allegations of operative facts which would warrant relief under Civ.R. 60(B), the trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling appellant\u2019s motion without first holding an evidentiary hearing. <em>Hornyak v. Brooks </em>(1984), 16 Ohio App.3d 105, 16 OBR 111, 474 N.E.2d 676. Therefore, appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is equally without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">Based upon the foregoing, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b597-11\">Christley and Basinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b597-12\">Randall L.
