Appellant had filed a complaint alleging that Jerry Patton, the Health Care Administrator at Hocking Correctional Institution, and Assistant Attorney General Frederick C. Schoch, improperly invaded his privacy. Appellant maintained that his hospital records were illegally used as part of a summary judgment motion filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-16\">Schoch, in an affidavit, stated that he was attorney of record in this case. He stated that in order to analyze the validity of appellant\u2019s claim, it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>necessary to request a summary of his medical records which were relevant and material to his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">Appellant alleges in his complaint that Jerry Patton, an employee of appellee, after being, induced by Schoch, invaded his privacy by submitting information from his medical records to Schoch while appellant was incarcerated at the Hocking Correctional Institution, without authority or waiver of the patient-physician privilege. Moreover, appellant maintains that Jerry Patton and Schoch acted outside the scope of their employment, in bad faith, and with malicious purposes in their actions herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Appellee filed a motion for leave to file a motion for summary judgment along with a motion for summary judgment. Appellant responded in a memorandum contra. The Court of Claims sustained appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Appellant advances one assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">\u201cGrant of summary judgment by the defendant was plain error and a denial of due process of law and equal protection of the laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">A court shall not sustain a motion for summary judgment unless, when the evidence is construed most strongly against the moving party, \u201c * * * reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made * * *.\u201d Civ.R. 56(C). Thus, if a trial court determines that there is a genuine issue of material fact, it will not sustain a summary judgment motion. <em>Rayburn v. J.C. Penney Outlet Store </em>(1982), 3 Ohio App.3d 463, 464, 3 OBR 544, 544, 445 N.E.2d 1167, 1168; <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett </em>(1986), 477 U.S. 317, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">The burden of establishing that there is no genuine issue of fact is upon the party moving for summary judgment. <em>Temple v. Wean United, Inc. </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 317, 4 O.O.3d 466, 364 N.E.2d 267; <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 8 O.O.3d 73, 375 N.E.2d 46. Civ.R. 56(E), however, requires that a party opposing the motion for summary judgment set forth specific facts showing that there exists a genuine issue of fact for trial. <em>Van Fossen v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co. </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 100, 117, 522 N.E.2d 489, 504; <em>Campco Distributors, Inc. v. Fries </em>(1987), 42 Ohio App.3d 200, 202, 537 N.E.2d 661, 663.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">Appellant does not demonstrate that genuine issues of fact for trial exist. Appellant contends that since there was not a court order requiring disclosure of his medical records, and no appropriate authorization, the disclosure was a wrongful invasion of his privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>Appellant is correct in his assumption that a prison inmate\u2019s personal medical records are to some extent protected, and are not public <em>per se. </em>Ohio Adm.Code 5120-9-49(B)(2) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-4\">\u201c(B) The following documents shall not be deemed public records:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-5\"><em>U </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-6\">\u201c(2) Medical records that pertain to the medical history, diagnosis, prognosis, or medical condition of an inmate patient and that are generated and maintained in the process of medical treatment. \u2018Medical record\u2019 does not include any document relating to births, deaths, and the fact of admission to or discharge from a hospital.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">Hence, a prison inmate\u2019s medical records are generally not public records. Nevertheless, the right of privacy is not absolute. Ohio Adm.Code 5120-9-49(F) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-8\">\u201cNon-public records of the department may, in the sole discretion of the director, or designee, be made available to * * * other persons with a need for access to such documents * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-9\">Jerry Patton\u2019s affidavit shows that he had a valid reason to believe that the assistant attorney general had a need to know about appellant\u2019s medical records. This was because Assistant Attorney General Schoch needed a summary of appellant\u2019s medical records to evaluate the validity of appellant\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-10\">Appellant also maintains that Jerry Patton acted outside the scope of his authority. In any event, Ohio Adm.Code 5120-9-49(F) also allows that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-11\">\u201cNon-public records of the department may, in the sole discretion of the director, or designee, be made available to * * * other persons with a need for access to such documents, subject to other restrictions on such access as may be provided by law or these rules.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-12\">Jerry Patton, as Health Care Administrator, was responsible for maintaining and handling inmate medical records. Since this was definitely his responsibility, he did not need special authorization to release appellant\u2019s records in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-13\">Appellee has demonstrated that there was no genuine issue of material fact in this case. Hence, it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The Court of Claims correctly applied Civ.R. 56(C). Thus, appellant\u2019s assignment of error is not well taken, and is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-14\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-15\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b838-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>Bowman, P.J., and Peggy Bryant, J., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b838-5\">Archer E.
