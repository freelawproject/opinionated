Sumrall, appellant, filed a complaint for declaratory judgment in which he sought the following relief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">It is prayed this Honorable Court <em>ORDER </em>the Central Collections Unit for the State of Maryland to <em>CEASE AND DESIST </em>any and all attempts to collect the Criminal Restitution in Criminal case Sumrall v[.] State of Maryland CT 2394 as being unconstitutional. To Restore petitioners tax returns, and to completely leave petitioner alone in this matter, in the future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-7\">And or any other relief this Honorable Court may deem appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">On March 6, 2002, the Honorable Daniel M. Long filed an Order that stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-9\">Upon consideration of Defendant\u2019s Answer to Complaint for Declaratory Judgment, any response thereto, and upon finding that plaintiff is not entitled to the relief requested in his Complaint for Declaratory Judgment, and that the referral of plaintiffs indebtedness under the December 7, 1981 order of the Circuit Court for Allegany County was proper, it is this <em>6th </em>day of <em>March, </em>2002 by the Circuit Court for Somerset County, Declared, Determined, and ORDERED that the relief requested in plaintiffs Complaint for Declaratory Judgment is denied and this case is dismissed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-11\">Appellant presented one question for our review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which we have divided and rephrased as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>I.

DID THE CIRCUIT COURT ERR WHEN IT DETERMINED APPELLANT\u2019S RESTITUTION OBLIGATIONS WERE PROPERLY REFERRED TO MARYLAND\u2019S CENTRAL COLLECTION UNIT FOR COLLECTION, AFTER APPELLANT STOPPED MAKING PAYMENTS TO THE DIVISION OF PAROLE AND PROBATION?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">For the reasons that follow, we shall answer \u201cno\u201d to each question above and affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">On September 10, 1981, appellant entered pleas of guilty to two counts of assault with intent to murder. On December 7, 1981, he was sentenced to the custody of the Commissioner of Corrections.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As part of appellant\u2019s sentence, he was required to pay a total of $110,854.67 in restitution to his victims. The judgment provided that, upon his release from confinement, appellant was obligated to make the restitution through the Division of Parole and Probation (\u201cDivision\u201d). When appellant was paroled, he began to make payments in conformity with the judgment of the sentencing court.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">On July 15, 1997, however, appellant\u2019s parole was revoked. Shortly thereafter, appellant stopped making restitution payments to the Division. On July 23,1998, the Division referred the balance of appellant\u2019s restitution obligation to the CCU. On August 29, 2000, the CCU sent a letter to appellant stating that his outstanding balance of restitution owed by him was $97,343.39, that a 17% collection fee (amounting to $16,548.37) was added to the original amount, and that the total amount of his restitution obligation was $113,891.76.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">A declaratory judgment is one that declares the rights of the parties and does not necessarily involve executory process or coercive relief. <em>Davis v. State, </em>183 Md. 385, 389, 37 A.2d 880 (1944). The declaration of judgment in such a manner is within the sound discretion of the court. <em>Brohawn v. Transamerica Ins. Co., </em>276 Md. 396, 406, 347 A.2d 842 (1975); <em>see also Chaghervand v. CareFirst, </em>909 F.Supp. 304, 313 (D.Md.1995). The court is not required to enter a declaratory judgment in every case. <em>Society of Am. Foresters v. Renewable Natural Resources Found., </em>114 Md.App. 224, 238, 689 A.2d 662, (1997); <em>Marriott Corp. v. Village Realty &amp; Inv. Corp., </em>58 Md.App. 145, 153, 472 A.2d 510, <em>cert. denied, </em>300 Md. 316, 477 A.2d 1195 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Md. Const, art. 27 (\u201cArticle 27\u201d) provides \u201c[t]hat no conviction shall work corruption of blood or forfeiture of estate.\u201d According to appellant, this provision prohibits the CCU from attempting to collect his remaining restitution obligations. Although neither the Court of Appeals nor this Court has interpreted this provision, we have the benefit of case law from other jurisdictions that have an identical or a very similar provision in their constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">In <em>Wellner v. Eckstein, </em>105 Minn. 444, 117 N.W. 830 (1908), the Supreme Court of Minnesota considered the question of whether the children of a man who was murdered by his wife could claim an interest in real property owned by their father at the time of his death and thereafter sold by the widow-murderess following probate of the deceased\u2019s estate. The Minnesota Constitution included a provision that \u201cno conviction shall work corruption of blood or forfeiture of estate,\u201d and that provision was invoked in support of the proposition that the sale was valid. Without relying upon \u2014 or interpreting\u2014 that provision, a majority of the court held that the District Court for Nicollet County had ruled correctly in sustaining the purchaser\u2019s demurrer to the children\u2019s complaint. Justice Elliot, however, filed a dissenting opinion that included the following analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqq\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>The invocation on [the widow-murderess-seller\u2019s] behalf of the constitutional provision that no conviction shall work corruption of blood or forfeiture of estate rests upon a misapprehension of the scope and purpose of that provision. It found its way into the federal constitution in connection with the punishment for treason. It was adopted in the constitutional convention with little discussion as a precautionary measure suggested by the history of the English law of treason. An early act of congress (section 24, c. 9, Acts 1790, 1 St. 117) made the prohibition general by providing that \u201cno conviction or judgment for any of the offenses aforesaid, shall work corruption of blood, or any forfeiture of estate.\u201d Similar provisions are found in the constitution of several states. Stimson, Federal &amp; State Constitutions, p. 182, note 6. By the common law a person convicted of a felony was by operation of law placed in a state of attainder, which resulted in forfeiture of estate, corruption of blood, and civil death. This result followed, not from the commission of the crime, but as a result of the conviction thereof. The attainted person was not divested of his land until after [the person was convicted]. So, in the, case of goods and chattels, forfeiture had relation only to the time of conviction, and after the commission of a felony' and before conviction the guilty party could make a valid sale or assignment of his personal property. These provisions abolish the common-law rule by which corruption of blood and forfeiture of estate resulted from the conviction of a felony. Corruption of blood rendered the felon incapable of inheriting or of transmitting property by inheritance. Forfeiture of estate transferred his property to the state. The heirs were thus deprived of their inheritance and the treasury enriched, and it was to prevent the manifest wrong and injustice to innocent persons which resulted from this doctrine that these constitutional provisions were adopted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">117 N.W. at 840 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Seventy two years later, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>Article III, \u00a7 3, c. 2 of the Constitution[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] was supplemented by the first congress, which enacted 1 Stat. 112, 117 (1790), presently codified as 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3563. Currently, that sections reads: \u201cNo conviction or judgment shall work corruption of blood or \u00e1ny forfeiture of estate.\u201d ... Under early English law, the complete forfeiture of all real and personal property followed as a consequence of conviction of a felony or treason. In fact, the term \u201cfelony\u201d was defined under English law as \u201can offense which occasions a total forfeiture of either lands or goods or both.\u201d In addition, when convicted of treason or a felony, the defendant\u2019s \u201cblood was corrupted\u201d so that nothing could pass by inheritance through his line. This sweeping imposition of forfeiture, which disinherited men because they were kindred to felons, may not have been wholly irrational in a feudal society in which land and property were ultimately held through the crown, and the commission of a felony (particularly treason) constituted a serious breach of the original bond of allegiance to the king, the offender\u2019s feudal lord, and to society. As English society changed, however, the broad forfeitures imposed at common law were modified by statute. At the time of the adoption of the Constitution, it appears that forfeiture of estate and corruption of blood were still imposed in England for some of the more serious felonies and for treason. In 1814, the English Parliament abolished corruption of blood as a punishment for all felonies except murder (although forfeiture of estate for serious felonies seems to have survived for some time thereafter), and a statute limiting forfeiture for treason to the life of the offender was enacted in the early nineteenth century. Forfeiture of estate found little favor in the American Colonies. Although forfeiture practices varied substantially from colony to colony, they were never as severe as those prevalent in England during the American colonial period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>In 1787, the imposition of forfeiture of estate and corruption of blood for treason was banned by the Constitution. Three years later, the first congress abolished that penalty for all \u25a0 convictions and judgments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-4\">The legal significance of this historical background is that nothing contained therein suggests that either article III or the 1790 statute was intended to prohibit anything other than corruption of blood or forfeiture of estate as imposed at common law. To the contrary, it is clear that both article III and the subsequent statute contemplated broad forfeitures incident to attainder as a traitor or felon, i.e., total disinheritance of one\u2019s heirs or those who would be one\u2019s heirs and forfeiture or all of one\u2019s property and estate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AI7\"><em>United States v. Grande, </em>620 F.2d 1026, 1037-39 (4th Cir. 1980). (citations omitted)(footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">In <em>State v. Young, </em>63 Wash.App. 324, 818 P.2d 1375 (1991), the defendant was convicted of two counts of vehicular homicide. <em>Id. </em>at 325, 818 P.2d 1375. He was sentenced to serve twelve-months for each count in a work release program, and to pay restitution in the amount of $250 per month. <em>Id. </em>The defendant argued that this restitution obligation was unconstitutional under Article 1, section 15 of the Washington Constitution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals of Washington held that this argument had no merit, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-6\">When the United States Constitution was being drafted, its framers wanted to limit the perpetual aspect of forfeitures for treason.... The framers\u2019 intent was manifested in U.S. Const, art. 3, \u00a7 3, cl. 2. It provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-7\">The congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason, but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood, or forfeiture except during the life of the person attained....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-8\">Article 1, section 15 of the Washington Constitution is related to U.S. Const, art. 3, \u00a7 3, in that both deal with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>forfeitures. Const, art. 1, \u00a7 15, however, prohibits more than just the perpetual aspect of forfeitures. It provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-4\">No conviction shall work corruption of blood, nor forfeiture of estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-5\">Still, when construed in light of its common law history, Const, art. 1, \u00a7 15 only prohibits forfeiture of a convict\u2019s estate on the ground that he or she is incapacitated from owning property due to conviction. It does not prohibit forfeiture for a variety of other rational and legitimate purposes, such as punishing the defendant to a degree commensurate with the crime (fines); rehabilitating the defendant by requiring restitution or other monetary payments, or depriving the defendant of the fruits or instrumentalities of the crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-6\"><em>Young, </em>63 Wash.App. at 328-329, 818 P.2d 1375 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">We agree with the above quoted analyses. We therefore hold that, while Article 27 of Maryland\u2019s Declaration of Rights prohibits forfeiture of a defendant\u2019s property on the ground that he or she is incapacitated from owning property due to his or her conviction, that provision does not mean that it is unconstitutional for a court to issue an order compelling a defendant to pay restitution to his or her victim(s).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">In the case at bar, the circuit court\u2019s order of restitution was not premised on the notion that appellant was prohibited from owning property due to his conviction, but instead worked to achieve the fundamental goal for ordering restitution which is, \u201crehabilitating the defendant and affording the aggrieved victim recompense for monetary loss.\u201d <em>Anne Arundel County v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co., </em>329 Md. 677, 685, 621 A.2d 427 (1993)(quoting <em>Lee v. State, </em>307 Md. 74, 78, 512 A.2d 372 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">We must also determine whether the restitution order at issue was actually part of appellant\u2019s sentence or merely a condition of his probation. Appellant remains obli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>gated to pay the outstanding balance of restitution.only if that obligation was part of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">It is now quite clear that a trial judge may order restitution either as a condition of probation, <em>see </em>Md.Code Ann. art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 640(c) and 641A(a); <em>Coles v. State, </em>290 Md. 296, 305, 429 A.2d 1029 (1981), or as a part of a sentence. <em>See Smitley v. State, </em>61 Md.App. 477, 482, 487 A.2d 315 (1985). It is also quite clear, as we painstakingly and clearly explained in <em>Smitley, </em>that there is \u201ca significant distinction between the two methods.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 483, 487 A.2d 315. One distinction relates to the method of enforcement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-5\">If the order is made \u201cas a sentence,\u201d it may, if the State shows an ability on 'the part of the defendant- to comply with the order, be enforced through contempt proceedings. If, on the other hand, the order is not stated \u201cas a sentence\u201d but rather as a condition of probation or parole, it may be enforced through the power to revoke the probation or parole, (footnote omitted)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-6\"><em>Id. </em>The more significant distinction, however, relates to \u201cthe inability of the court to increase or enhance a sentence that has once and validly been imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-7\">When restitution is ordered \u201cas a sentence,\u201d enforcement through contempt proceedings serves merely to implement the sentence, not to enhance it. It is an additional remedy to that provided in [art. 27,] section 637. Similarly, when restitution is attached as a condition to probation and, upon non-compliance, the court revokes the probation and directs execution of all or any part of the suspended sentence, the initial sentence has merely been implemented, not enhanced. It may even be possible, pursuant to section 642 of art. 27, for the court to direct execution of the suspended sentence, suspend anew part of that sentence, place the defendant on further probation, and continue an order of restitution as a condition of the new probation. What the court may <em>not do, </em>however, when the restitution is not \u201cas a sentence\u201d but only a condition of probation, is to direct execution of the <em>full </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number><em>term </em>of the suspended sentence <em>and </em>continue the restitution order, either \u201cas a sentence\u201d or as a condition to some further probation. That is equivalent to <em>increasing, </em>not merely <em>implementing, </em>the suspended sentence, (emphasis in the original, footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">61 Md.App. at 484, 487 A.2d 315.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-5\">It is, therefore, critically important that we resolve as a threshold matter whether ... the restitution was ordered only as a condition of probation, or, ... as a part of the sentence, or whether it was ordered both as a condition of probation and as a part of the sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-6\"><em>Jackson v. State, </em>68 Md.App. 679, 684-86, 515 A.2d 768 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">In the case at bar, the judgment as reflected by the docket entries was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-8\">Upon being release [sic] defendant make restitution in the amount of 50% of his net earnings for a total of $110,854.67. Sentence accounting from February 22,1981.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">The relevant language persuades us that restitution was part of the original sentence and not merely a condition of parole or probation. We therefore hold that appellant\u2019s restitution obligation was not wiped out by his parole revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">Appellant argues that the circuit court erred when it found that the outstanding balance of his restitution obligation was properly transferred from the Department to the CCU for collection. There is no merit in that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-12\">Maryland\u2019s mechanism for collecting criminal restitution is provided by Md.Code (2001), \u00a7 11-616 of the Criminal Procedure Article (\u201cC.P.\u201d). This section, in pertinent part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-13\">(a) Referral of overdue accounts. \u2014 The Division or the Department of Juvenile Justice:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-14\">(1) in addition to other actions authorized under Part I of this subtitle, may refer an overdue restitution ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>count for collection to the Central Collection Unit; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-4\">(2) if probation or other supervision is terminated and restitution is still owed, shall refer the overdue restitution account for collection to the Central Collection Unit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-5\">(b) Central Collection Unit. \u2014 Subject to subsection (c) of this section, the Central Collection Unit may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-6\">(1) collect overdue restitution in accordance with Title 3, Subtitle 3 of the State Finance and Procurement Article;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">Appellant argues that his obligation to pay restitution falls within the exceptions outlined under section 3-302(b), of the State Finance and Procurement Article (\u201cS.F.\u201d), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-9\">(a) General responsibility. \u2014 (1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) of this section or in other law, the Central Collection Unit is responsible for the collection of each delinquent account or other debt that is owed to the State or any of its officials or units.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-10\">(2) An official or unit of the State government shall refer to the Central Collection Unit each debt for which the Central Collection Unit has collection responsibility under this subsection and may not settle the debt</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-11\">(b) Exceptions. \u2014 Unless, with the approval of the Secretary [of Budget and- Management], a unit of the State government assigns the claim to the Central Collection Unit, the Central Collection Unit is not responsible for and may not collect:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-12\">(1) any taxes;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-13\">(2) any child support payment that is owed under Article 88A, \u00a7 48 of the Code:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>(3) any unemployment insurance contribution or overpayment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-4\">(4) any fine;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-5\">(5) any court costs;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-6\">(6) any forfeiture on bond;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-7\">(7) any money that is owed as a result of a default on a loan that the Department of Business and Economic Development has made or insured; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-8\">(8) any money that is owed under Title 9, Subtitles 2, 3, and 4 and Title 20 of the Insurance article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">\u201cThe cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the legislature.\u201d <em>Oaks v. Connors, </em>339 Md. 24, 35, 660 A.2d 423, 429 (1995). Legislative intent must be sought in the first instance in the actual language of the statute. <em>Marriott Employees Fed. Credit Union v.

Tracey, </em>328 Md. 380, 387, 614 A.2d 590, 594 (1992), while construing an alimony statute, the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-7\">While the language of the statute is the primary source for determining legislative intention, the plain meaning rule of construction is not absolute; rather, the statute must be construed reasonably with reference to the purpose, aim, or policy of the enacting body. The Court will look at the larger context, including the legislative purpose, within which statutory language appears. Construction of a statute which is unreasonable, illogical, unjust, or inconsistent with common sense should be avoided. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">A look at the larger context persuades us that our interpretation is correct. Assuming, arguendo, that appellant\u2019s restitution obligations fall within the enumerated exceptions under \u00a7 3-302(b), the Secretary of Budget and Management, in a letter dated November 15, 1999, approved the collection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b326-9\">. During the period of time that a defendant is being supervised by the Division, the Division is responsible for collecting any fines, court costs and restitution. If the defendant's probation expires, is revoked or is otherwise terminated, the CCU is responsible for collecting those funds. Our research has revealed that, under the current procedures authorized by the Secretary of Budget and Management, the CCU will also assume responsibility for collecting fines .and court costs. We therefore recommend that the judge who terminates the defendant\u2019s probation (1) determine the amount of fines, costs, and restitution that have not been paid, (2) make sure that the .defendant\u2019s restitution obligation has been referred to the CCU, and (3) unless the judge determines that any or all of the uncollected fines and court costs should be deemed uncollectible, make sure that the defendant\u2019s obligation to pay the unpaid fines and costs is also referred to the CCU.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
