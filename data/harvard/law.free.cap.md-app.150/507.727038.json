EYLER, KRAUSER, JJ.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b532-7\">KRAUSER, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">Appellant, Alexandra Angelakis, and her husband, Dimitrios Angelakis, brought a medical malpractice action against appellees, Bahman Teimourian, M.D., and Suburban Hospital, Inc. The Angelakises claimed that the \u201cultrasound-assisted liposuction\u201d performed by Dr. Teimourian on Mrs. Angelakis\u2019s abdomen and thighs at Suburban Hospital had left her scarred and disfigured, as a result of appellees\u2019 negligence. A Montgomery County jury disagreed. Finding neither the negligence nor the lack of informed consent alleged by the Angelakises, the jury returned a verdict in favor of appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">Mrs. Angelakis then noted this appeal,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> contending that the circuit court erred in excluding, as a subsequent remedial measure, a post-operative letter written by Dr. Teimourian to a peer review journal. In that letter, which included a photograph of appellant\u2019s thighs and abdomen, Teimourian warned of the risks involved in performing ultrasound-assisted liposuction too aggressively on the inner thighs and abdomen. The letter, appellant claims, should not have been excluded by the circuit court as a remedial measure but admitted as either an admission or as impeachment evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">The circuit court\u2019s ruling, however, was a little more nuanced than that. In what appears to have been a carefully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>calculated attempt to balance competing interests of public policy and private need, the court excluded the letter itself, as appellant contends, but permitted her to introduce the photograph, published with the letter, of her post-operative abdomen and thighs and to use the letter, without referring specifically to it, to cross-examine Dr. Teimourian.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">The court\u2019s decision to exclude the letter, as a subsequent remedial measure, was initially correct. But, as the trial progressed, the propriety of that exclusion evaporated: Once Dr. Teimourian gave testimony that flatly contradicted material representations that he made in the letter, the letter was admissible as impeachment evidence. The court\u2019s failure, at that point, to permit what it had prohibited was error. But it was harmless error, since the substance of the letter was made known to the jury through Dr. Teimourian\u2019s testimony, and the photograph, which accompanied it, was introduced into evidence. That made the admission of the missive de minimis.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">The Surgery</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">In November 1996, appellant was informed by her gynecologist, Dr. Edward Cunningham, that she had cervical cancer. To remove the cancer, she underwent a procedure called \u201cconization\u201d \u2014 so named because it involves the excision of a cone of tissue. Following that operation, Dr. Cunningham recommended that she also undergo a \u201cradical hysterectomy\u201d to eliminate any remaining cancer cells.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">She agreed to the procedure but then asked if he would also perform, at that time, a \u201ctummy tuck,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as the incision for the hysterectomy could also be used for that purpose. As he was not a plastic surgeon, Dr. Cunningham referred her to a doctor who was \u2014 Dr. Teimourian. Appellant met with Teimourian, and he agreed to perform, after the hysterectomy, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>liposuction on her abdomen and inner thighs, as well as plastic surgery on her face, arms, and buttocks.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">On February 11,1997, after Dr. Cunningham completed the hysterectomy, Dr. Teimourian performed a series of surgical procedures on appellant,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which included traditional and ultrasound-assisted liposuction (\u201cUAL\u201d) on her abdomen and inner thighs. Traditional liposuction begins with the introduction of a blunt flexible tube, known as a \u201ccannula,\u201d into the fatty layer of the body through an incision. The sharp edges of the cannula\u2019s opening are then used to sheer off fatty tissue, as the cannula is passed back and forth over the area to be reduced. Because the cannula is attached to a suction device, it draws in the loose tissue as it moves back and forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">UAL reduces fatty tissue in a different way. Instead of cutting, it emits ultrasonic sound waves to rupture cells and, in essence, melts the fat away. Unlike traditional liposuction, it generates heat and therefore has the potential to bum whatever it comes in contact with, including skin, unless used property-</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">At the conclusion of the surgery, Dr. Teimourian closed the abdominal incision only to reopen it when he found the blood supply to that area was inadequate or, as he put it, \u201cthe capillary refill was not there.\u201d He left the incision open, with the intention of closing it in stages to avoid skin loss. In the meantime, the incision was covered by sterile dressings and \u201csome local antibiotic\u201d was applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">On February 15, 1997, appellant was discharged from the hospital. During subsequent appointments with Dr. Teimourian, fluid was drained, and dead or \u201cnecrotic\u201d tissue was cut away from her groin and abdomen. On February 19, 1997, cultures were taken from the incision areas, which later showed evidence of a staph infection.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>On February 28, 1997, running a temperature of over 103 degrees, appellant went to see Dr. Teimourian. A few days later, she returned, complaining of pain in her upper thighs, groin, and abdomen. After observing \u201careas of necrosis and infection of the abdomen and the medial thighs,\u201d Dr. Chester Haverback, an associate of Teimourian\u2019s, admitted her to Holy Cross Hospital. There, she was diagnosed with having \u201cpostoperative infections with severe cellulitis and loss of skin and subcutaneous tissue of the abdomen and both thighs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">The Letter</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">After appellant\u2019s surgery, Dr. Teimourian submitted a letter, with a post-operative photograph of appellant\u2019s abdomen and thighs, to a peer review journal, <em>Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery. </em>In that letter, he warned against using ultrasound-assisted liposuction or \u201cUAL\u201d as aggressively as traditional liposuction and suggested that it should not be used on the abdomen and inner thighs. The photograph of appellant that accompanied the letter showed \u201cskin loss\u201d presumably resulting from the misuse of UAL.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The letter and photograph appeared in the November 1997 issue of <em>Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Teimourian\u2019s letter began by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-8\">Ultrasound-assisted liposuction has become popular in this country within the past year. This popularity has evolved, especially, as a result of the enthusiasm on the part of the manufacturers to sell expensive equipment, and, to a certain extent, because of the endorsement of our plastic surgery society. Having used ultrasound-assisted liposuction in 150 cases, I would like to convey my observations on the use of this machine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>It then named the medical problems associated with an aggressive use of UAL, mentioning skin loss, among other problems:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-5\">In addition to the extra expense and machine dependency associated with the use of ultrasound-assisted liposuction, there are medical problems that may occur, including seroma (Fig.l), surface irregularity (Fig.2), and skin loss (Fig.3) when the procedure is done as aggressively as in traditional liposuction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">(emphasis added). \u201cFig. 3\u201d was a photograph of appellant\u2019s abdomen, groin, and upper thigh area captioned, \u201cSkin loss as evidenced by skin ulcer in both inner thighs and lower abdomen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">And then it specified the areas of the body suitable for UAL and those that were not, notably, the abdomen and inner thighs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-8\">There are some areas where I find that ultrasound-assisted liposuction is user-friendly and enhances the results of the procedure. These areas include the flank, chest roll, gynecomastia, and possibly in the treatment of obese individuals. However, use of the machine, as we know it today, for treatment of the abdomen is controversial, and in my opinion it should not be used in the neck area, inner thighs, knee, or ankles. Ultrasound-assisted liposuction does not give any superior aesthetic result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">His letter ended with the following request:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-10\">I hope the task force will set forth a recommendation with regard to the judicial [sic] use of ultrasound-assisted liposuction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-11\">The Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b536-12\">At trial, the Angelakises sought to show that the injuries to appellant\u2019s abdomen and inner thighs were caused by the negligent manner in which Dr. Teimourian performed UAL. Their medical expert, Craig Dufresne, M.D., testified that, as a result of Teimourian\u2019s negligence in performing UAL, appellant sustained burns to her abdomen and thighs. Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>these burns caused tissue death, they were, according to Dr. Dufresne, \u201ca major contributing factor\u201d to appellant\u2019s infections and resulted in significant skin loss to her right groin, abdomen, and thighs.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">Disagreeing, Dr. Teimourian testified that he did not burn appellant and did not see any indication of burns after her surgery. He insisted that her \u201cabdominal wound\u201d infection was unrelated to the liposuction. He further testified that, while smoking did not cause appellant\u2019s \u201cwounds to originate,\u201d it interfered with the \u201chealing process.\u201d And he opined that \u201cthe thigh breakdown was a result of infection and gravity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">When asked on cross-examination whether UAL entails risks that traditional liposuction does not, Dr. Teimourian responded that, in his experience, he \u201cdid not see any difference as far as the danger of the ultrasound versus the traditional suction lipectomy.\u201d In his opinion, UAL and traditional liposuction are \u201cinterchangeable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Later, when asked whether \u201cthe proper precaution [is] not to do UAL on the abdomen or the thigh at all,\u201d he responded that he did not see \u201cany advantage\u201d in using it on the inner and outer thighs. Pressed further, he added, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s improper. There are many people who do it. In my experience, I don\u2019t like to do it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">When subsequently asked if he \u201cincorrectly performed [the] UAL procedure on Mrs. Angelakis by doing it too aggressively,\u201d Teimourian replied, \u201cNo.\u201d It was at this point that appellant\u2019s counsel first sought to introduce Teimourian\u2019s letter, specifically because of two statements in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">The first statement, appellant argued, was an admission by Dr. Teimourian. It stated: \u201cIn addition to the extra expense and machine dependency associated with the use of ultrasound-assisted liposuction, there are medical problems that may occur, including ... skin loss (Fig.3) when the procedure is done as aggressively as in traditional liposuction.\u201d Figure three, as noted earlier, was a photograph of appellant, captioned as \u201c[s]kin loss as evidenced by skin ulcer in both inner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>thighs and lower abdomen\u201d; the photograph, unlike the letter, had already, been admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The second statement was, according to appellant, not only admissible as an admission, but as impeachment evidence. It stated: \u201c[U]se of the [UAL] machine, as we know it today, for treatment of the abdomen is controversial, and in.my opinion it should not be used in the neck area, inner thighs, knee, or ankles.\u201d Appellant claimed that this statement contradicted Dr. Teimourian\u2019s trial testimony that UAL and traditional liposuction are the same and that he did not like to perform UAL on the inner thighs.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">The circuit court reserved ruling on the admissibility of the letter and allowed appellant\u2019s counsel to continue cross-examining Dr. Teimourian without directly referring to the letter. In so doing, the circuit court noted that counsel had merely asked Dr. Teimourian about \u201cover aggressive use\u201d of UAL and suggested that counsel ask Dr. Teimourian \u201cif in his opinion the result that occurred in this case was the result of using the UAL as aggressively as one would use [traditional liposuction].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">Appellant\u2019s counsel then asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFa\">Q Dr. Teimourian, would you be able to very carefully listen to this next question and give me your answer? Do you agree that there are medical problems that may occur, including skin loss, when UAL is done as aggressively as in traditional liposuction? Yes or no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-9\">A Yeah, I agree with that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-10\">Q You do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-11\">A Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-12\">Q And in fact, you have' acknowledged that to your peers, have you not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-13\">A Yes. I wrote a letter\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AM3\">After questioning Dr. Teimourian about consequences of aggressively using UAL, appellant\u2019s counsel turned to the issue of performing UAL on the inner thighs.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>Q And earlier today, you testified that you still, although you don\u2019t like to do it, you still do UAL in the abdomen and in the thighs, the inner thighs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-5\">A Outer thighs I said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-6\">Q All right. Do you not do it\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-7\">A I do not like to do inner thighs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-8\">Q But you do it occasionally anyway, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-9\">A I don\u2019t like to do the inner thighs. I use it on outer thighs mostly now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-10\">Q All right. Sometimes you do it on the inner thighs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-11\">A I might have done it. I don\u2019t remember the last\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-12\">Q So do you therefore take the position that UAL treatment of the abdomen is controversial, and that in your opinion it should not be used in the inner thighs at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-13\">A This was a\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-14\">Q Is that your position, yes or no?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-15\">A That was my position then. This is the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-16\">Q When?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-17\">A When I wrote that article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-18\">Dr. Teimourian then stated that he had written the letter at issue in 1997, which prompted appellant\u2019s counsel to ask:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-19\">Q In March of 1997, when you stated \u2014 without reference to any article \u2014 when you stated that medical problems may occur including skin loss when UAL is done as aggressively as in traditional liposuction, when you said that in March, did you use as an example the picture that we have been showing of Mrs. Angelakis? Yes or no.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-20\">At this point, Dr. Teimourian\u2019s counsel objected to what he believed were references to Teimourian\u2019s letter. The court cautioned appellant\u2019s counsel but permitted him to resume questioning.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-21\">Q Do you agree that medical problems that occurred with respect to skin loss in this case shown in that picture occurred because the procedure that you did on Mrs. Angelakis was done as aggressively as in traditional liposuction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>A This is her picture. That is my\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-5\">Q Yes or no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-6\">A I agree with that writing, there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-7\">Q Do you agree \u2014 I am not talking about the writing. I am agree [sic] if it is your opinion, your conclusion that what is shown in that picture involving Mrs. Angelakis, the skin loss that is shown there on both the thighs and the abdomen happened because you did this procedure on her as aggressively as is done with traditional liposuction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-8\">You did this UAL procedure on her as aggressively as is done with traditional liposuction. Yes or no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-9\">A That\u2019s yes, with qualification there are no bums. There is not a single word that burn [sic] in that article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">Appellant\u2019s counsel again sought to introduce the letter but was again rebuffed by the circuit court. The court pointed out to counsel that Dr. Teimourian \u201chas essentially answered all of your questions to say what he said in the article without the necessity of getting into an article that was written, and therefore getting into a good question of public policy.\u201d The court concluded, \u201cTo now let you go on to refer to some article is unnecessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">During subsequent cross-examination, Dr. Teimourian restated his position that there was no skin loss:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-12\">Q All right. Now, Dr. Teimourian, before you had indicated that \u2014 actually, well before lunch, you said she had no skin loss in the abdomen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-13\">A I still say that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-14\">Q And yet a little later before lunch, you said that the skin loss that she sustained in the abdomen and both thighs, from the UAL procedure, was caused by your doing the UAL as aggressively as one would do it with standard liposuction, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-15\">A The thigh \u2014 no, I didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-16\">Q All right\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-17\">A I said the abdominal area was left open on purpose. Whenever you do the UAL and the suction lipectomy, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>was done in combination on Mrs. Angelakis, or if you do the suction lipectomy alone, without UAL, if the skin of the umbilicus doesn\u2019t reach the pubic area, you leave it open.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-4\">A Abdominal incision was left open on purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">In light of that testimony, appellant once again moved for the admission of the letter, and the court once again denied that request. Later Dr. Teimourian again testified on cross-examination that there was no skin loss to appellant\u2019s abdomen, whereupon appellant\u2019s counsel again sought to impeach Dr. Teimourian with the letter\u2019s assertion that skin loss can result from using UAL as aggressively as traditional liposuction, as that assertion was referring to a photograph of appellant\u2019s thighs and abdomen. Declining again to admit the letter, the circuit court stated in part: \u201cI\u2019m convinced ... you\u2019ve gotten just about everything that was said in that letter through the mouth of the witness, and you\u2019ve got it in writing. Now, if he says some different things when his lawyer\u2019s talking to him, fine. You can use all of the inconsistencies in your final argument that you can find.\u201d The court further noted that \u201cto put that letter in, which is \u2014 was clearly intended as, you know, advice to other folks, possibly even a change in his own practice based on what he saw ... and I\u2019m going to so rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erred by excluding the letter as a subsequent remedial measure. The letter, appellant maintains, was not a remedial measure, and was admissible as an admission. Moreover, even if it was a remedial measure, appellant argues, the circuit court should have admitted it as impeachment evidence, once Teimourian gave contrary testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">To determine the law of the letter, we begin with the letter of the law. Maryland Rule 5-407 governs the admissibility of subsequent remedial measures. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>(a) In general. When, after an event, measures are taken which, if in effect at the time of the event, would have mad\u00e9 the event less likely to occur, evidence of the subsequent measures is not admissible to prove negligence or culpable conduct in connection with the event,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-5\">(b) Admissibility for the other purposes. This Rule does not require the exclusion of evidence of subsequent measures when offered for another purpose, such as proving ownership, control, or feasibility of precautionary measures, if controverted, or impeachment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Its template is Federal Rule of Evidence 407.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In drafting that rule, the Federal Advisory Committee on Rules of Evidence \u201coffered two justifications,\u201d according to the Court of Appeals: \u201cfirst, that the subsequent conduct \u2018is not in fact an admission, since the conduct is equally consistent with injury by mere accident or through contributory negligence,\u2019 and second, the \u2018social policy of encouraging people to take, or at least not discouraging them from taking, steps in furtherance of added safety.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tuer v. McDonald, </em>347 Md. 507, 522, 701 A.2d 1101 (1997)(quoting <em>Rules of Evidence for the United States Courts and Magistrates, </em>56 F.R.D. 183, 225-26 (1973)).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Although neither accident nor contributory negligence has been raised as a defense by appellees, the epistolary statements at issue here are not admissions of neglect. They simply reflect what Dr. Teimourian learned as a result of performing the procedure in question. In that light, Teimourian\u2019s letter satisfies the first justification for excluding it as a subsequent remedial measure: it is not necessarily an acknowledgment of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>More important, however, is the second justification: \u201cthe social policy of encouraging people to take ... steps in furtherance of added safety.\u201d There are, to be sure, few areas in which such a policy is more pressing than in the practice of medicine. The dissemination of information regarding the success or failure of new procedures or techniques is vital to protect the health and safety of those who may undergo the same or a similar procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Nonetheless, appellant urges us to treat Teimourian\u2019s letter to <em>Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery </em>as an admission of negligence and not as a subsequent remedial measure, citing <em>Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric Co. v. Flippo, </em>112 Md.App. 75, 684 A.2d 456 (1996), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>348 Md. 680, 705 A.2d 1144 (1998), to bolster her claim. In <em>Flippo, </em>the minor plaintiff was injured when he attempted to grab an overhanging power line of the defendant BG &amp; E to keep from falling out of a tree in his neighbor\u2019s yard. <em>Id. </em>at 81, 684 A.2d 456. At a town meeting two weeks after the accident, a BG &amp; E supervisor stated that BG &amp; E would work with residents to remove \u201cclimbable trees\u201d in their yards that were near overhead electric lines and that because \u201cwhite pine trees,\u201d like the one the minor plaintiff was climbing, \u201chave a ladder-like effect that makes them easy to climb ... BGE needs to take care of this by trimming.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 101-02, 684 A.2d 456. Nine months after that, BG <em>&amp; </em>E published guidelines containing \u201cpreaccident practices and post-accident change of policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 102, 684 A.2d 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The supervisor\u2019s remarks were subsequently admitted at trial over BG &amp; E\u2019s objection that they should be excluded as a subsequent remedial measure. Pointing out that the guidelines were published many months after the supervisor\u2019s remarks, the circuit court found that \u201cthe post-accident policy changes had not been formulated as of the date of the town meeting.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 100, 102, 684 A.2d 456. It therefore concluded that the supervisor\u2019s remarks \u201cdid not concern remedial measures taken or policies adopted after and because of\u2019 the child\u2019s accident. <em>Id. </em>at 101, 684 A.2d 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>Since that factual conclusion was not clearly erroneous, we upheld the decision of the circuit court as to the admissibility of the supervisor\u2019s remarks. <em>Id. </em>at 102, 684 A.2d 456. But, as <em>Flippo </em>addressed only the admissibility of informal statements of existing policies, we can draw no lessons from it here. Teimourian\u2019s letter articulated a change in procedure, not a rehash, as in <em>Flippo, </em>of current practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Another feature which distinguishes this case from <em>Flippo </em>or, for that matter, every Maryland case that has heretofore addressed this question, is that the letter at issue does not implement a change in policy, but merely reflects one. Unlike the belated guidelines in <em>Flippo, </em>or the change of hospital protocol in <em>Tuer, </em>of which we shall say more later, the letter does not assist the issuer in effecting any change in policy, practice, or procedure. In that respect, its ambitions are rather modest. But, in another respect, its purpose is grander as it seeks to affect the practices of others, who may be unaware of the risks involved in aggressively applying this procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">The letter, to be sure, does reflect a change in Teimourian\u2019s procedures \u2014 and probably on that basis alone could be deemed a \u201csubsequent remedial measure.\u201d But there was no reason to publish it, except to alert others to the dangers of using ultrasound-assisted liposuction too aggressively on certain parts of the body. We do not think that' fact precludes the letter from being a subsequent remedial measure. In fact, precisely because it serves that purpose, it falls within the ambit of Maryland Rule 5-407. To rule otherwise would halt the flow of admonitory publications, transmitting important and even vital information, when lawsuits are looming. That would place the public in needless peril for the sake of bestowing an evidential advantage on isolated claimants \u2014 and a short-lived advantage at that. For the publication of such corrective information will no doubt end as its usefulness to potential plaintiffs becomes known to vulnerable authors.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">Appellant next contends that even if the letter was a remedial measure, it was admissible to impeach Dr. Teimouri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>an under Maryland Eule 5-407(b) once he gave testimony at trial which contradicted statements in the letter. In rejecting that contention, the circuit court relied on <em>Tuer v. McDonald, </em>347 Md. 507, 701 A.2d 1101 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">In that case Tuer, a patient awaiting coronary bypass surgery, began to suffer chest pains. His surgery was rescheduled and he was given Heparin, \u201can anti-coagulant, to help stablize the angina.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 509, 701 A.2d 1101. On the day of the operation, the Heparin was discontinued a few hours before the surgery was to begin, in accordance with hospital protocol and at his surgeon\u2019s direction, \u201cto allow the drug to metabolize so that Mr. Tuer would not have an anticoagulant in his blood when the surgery commenced.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 510, 701 A.2d 1101.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Unfortunately, Tuer\u2019s surgery was then delayed another three to four hours. During that delay, Tuer developed arrhythmia and shortness of breath and then went into cardiac arrest. Despite efforts to save him, Tuer died the next day. <em>Id. </em>Following his death, the hospital \u201cchanged the protocol with respect to discontinuing Heparin for patients with unstable angina.\u201d Instead of discontinuing Heparin several hours before surgery, the new protocol required that Heparin be given such patients until they are taken into the operating room. <em>Id. </em>at 510-11, 701 A.2d 1101.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">In the medical malpractice action that followed, Tuer\u2019s surgeon testified that he considered restarting the Heparin after surgery was postponed, but then rejected the idea as too dangerous. To impeach that testimony, the plaintiffs, Tuer\u2019s family, sought to introduce evidence of the change in the protocol to show that it was both feasible and safe to restart the Heparin once the surgery was delayed. Denying their request, the circuit court excluded the evidence as a subsequent remedial measure. <em>Id. </em>at 513-14, 701 A.2d 1101. On appeal, there was no dispute as to whether the protocol change was a subsequent remedial measure. <em>Id. </em>at 511, 701 A.2d 1101. The parties disagreed as to whether it was admissible for impeachment purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>Affirming the circuit court\u2019s ruling, the Court of Appeals held that the change in protocol was not-admissible to impeach the doctor\u2019s testimony as to the safety of restarting Heparin. <em>Id. </em>at 531, 701 A.2d 1101. The Court explained that the doctor \u201cwas not asserting ... in any absolute sense, that restarting the Heparin would have been unsafe but only that, given the complications that could have arisen ... there was a relative safety risk that, at the time, he and the hospital believed was not was worth taking.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 529, 701 A.2d 1101. The change in protocol, the Court stated, only suggested that the doctor \u201cand his colleagues reevaluated the relative risks in light of what happened to Mr. Tuer and decided that the safer course was to continue Heparin.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 532, 701 A.2d 1101. \u201cThat kind of reevaluation,\u201d the Court asserted, \u201cis precisely what the exclusionary provision of the Rule was designed to encourage.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The Court of Appeals concluded in <em>Tuer </em>that the nature of the purported contradiction did not warrant impeachment by introducing evidence of the defendants\u2019 remedial measure. We reach the same conclusion here, at least as to Dr. Teimourian\u2019s testimony that he does not like to do UAL on the inner thighs and that UAL and traditional liposuction are interchangeable. Those statements, contrary- to appellant\u2019s argument, do not justify the introduction of his statement in the letter that UAL should not be done on the inner thighs, particularly as he later explained: \u201cThat was my position then.... When I wrote that article.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">But we reach a different result as to his testimonial insistence that no skin loss occurred. That statement was flatly contradicted by the statement under one of the photographs which accompanied the -letter. The photograph showed appellant\u2019s ulcerated inner thighs and lower abdomen. Underneath that photograph were the expository words: \u201cSkin loss as evidenced by skin ulcer in both inner thighs arid lower abdomen.\u201d Moreover, referring to that photograph, which is designated \u201cFig. 3,\u201d the letter states, \u201cthere are medical problems that may occur, including ... skin, loss (Fig. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>3) when the procedure is done as aggressively as in traditional liposuction.\u201d In other words, the photograph of appellant\u2019s inner thighs and lower abdomen illustrated the loss of skin that results from the aggressive application of ultrasound-assisted liposuction.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">In light of this, Teimourian\u2019s subsequent testimony that appellant had not suffered skin loss strains credulity and the letter, with its conflicting admission, should have been available for impeachment purposes. Nonetheless, we conclude that the circuit court\u2019s failure to allow the letter to be used as impeachment evidence was harmless error, because Dr. Teimourian testified to the substance of the letter and the photograph, graphically depicting appellant\u2019s skin loss, was admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">We reach that conclusion guided by the following principles. First, Maryland Rule 5-103(a) provides that \u201c[e]rror may not be predicated upon a ruling that admits or excludes evidence unless the party is prejudiced by the ruling.\u201d Second, \u201c \u2018[T]he admission or exclusion of evidence is a function of the trial court which, on appeal, is traditionally viewed with great latitude.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commercial Union Insurance Co. v. Porter Hayden Co., </em>116 Md.App. 605, 641, 698 A.2d 1167 (1997)(quoting <em>Swann v. Prudential Ins. Co., </em>95 Md.App. 365, 374, 620 A.2d 989 (1993)). And third, \u201c \u2018[A]n appellate court will only reverse upon finding that the trial judge\u2019s determination was both manifestly wrong and substantially injurious.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Swann, </em>95 Md.App. at 375, 620 A.2d 989).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">Appellant has not shown that she was prejudiced by the exclusion of Teimourian\u2019s letter. As noted earlier, appellant sought to admit two assertions of the letter: one stating that medical problems such as skin loss may occur when UAL is \u201cdone as aggressively as in traditional liposuction,\u201d and the other stating that, in Teimourian\u2019s opinion, UAL \u201cshould not be used in the neck area, inner thighs, knee, or ankles.\u201d But, as the circuit court correctly observed, Dr. Teimourian testified as to the substance of those statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>At trial, plainly referring to statements made in the letter at issue, appellant\u2019s counsel asked Dr. Teimourian whether he agreed that \u201cthere are medical problems that may occur, including skin loss, when UAL is done as aggressively as in traditional liposuction.\u201d In response, Dr. Teimourian stated, \u201cYeah, I agree with that.\u201d He than added that he \u201cwrote a letter,\u201d acknowledging that to his peers. Later, during cross-examination, Dr. Teimourian admitted that he had performed UAL on appellant \u201cas aggressively as is done with traditional liposuction.\u201d That admission occurred in the context of the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-5\">Q Do you agree that medical problems that occurred with respect to skin loss in this case shown in that picture occurred because the procedure that you did on Mrs. Angelakis was done as aggressively as in traditional liposuction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-6\">A This is her picture. That is my\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-7\">Q Yes or no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-8\">A I agree with that writing, there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-9\">Q Do you agree \u2014 I am not talking about the writing. I am agree [sic] if it is your opinion, your conclusion that what is shown in that picture involving Mrs. Angelakis, the skin loss that is shown there on both the thighs and the abdomen happened because you- did this procedure on her as aggressively as is done with traditional liposuction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-10\">You did this UAL procedure on her as aggressively as is done with traditional liposuction. Yes or no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-11\">A That\u2019s yes, with qualification there are no bums. There is not a single word that burn [sic] in that article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-12\">Appellant contends, however, that here Dr. Teimourian was testifying merely that he performed the UAL as aggressively as would have been done with traditional liposuction, and not that skin loss resulted from doing so. Even if that is so, the link between aggressive application of UAL and skin loss was established by Teimourian when he testified that he wrote \u201ca letter\u201d that \u201cthere are medical problems that may occur, including skin loss, when UAL is done as aggressively as in traditional liposuction.\u201d In addition to these statements, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>jury had before it the photograph from the letter depicting skin loss. Thus, in light of his testimony and the physical evidence introduced, the letter at issue was reduced to cumulative evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Appellant also contends that the exclusion of the letter prejudiced the effectiveness of her counsel\u2019s closing argument. Specifically, she argues that in closing argument, her counsel avoided reference to conflicting statements about skin loss, because the circuit court warned that \u201cwith regard to skin loss, there may not be an evidentiary basis to argue that conflicting statements were made by Appellee.\u201d Even if this is true, any error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Clearly referring to her skin loss, her counsel told the jury that \u201cgiven the admission by Dr. Teimourian that what is shown in those pictures happened as a result of his using the UAL as aggressively as he would traditional liposuction, ... we ask only that you make that finding based upon the fact that the evidence is not only tipped slightly in her favor, but is overwhelmingly in her favor that what happened to her happened as a result of the surgery that the doctor performed.\u201d \u201c[According to Dr. Teimourian,\u201d counsel continued, \u201cwhat is shown in those pictures happened, out of his own mouth, as a result of using that UAL as aggressively as he would have used standard liposuction.\u201d He later added, \u201cI don\u2019t choose to call Dr. Teimourian a liar. In fact, I choose to call him a truth-teller when he says that the reason that this happened was because he used the UAL as aggressively as he would have used [traditional liposuction].\u201d Thus, the exclusion of the letter did not appear to have much impact on closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.
