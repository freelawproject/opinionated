The case centers on the \u201cunderinsurance\u201d provision of the Boones\u2019 automobile insurance policy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>Although the Boones obtained a monetary settlement from Sites\u2019s insurer for the maximum amount available under Sites\u2019s liability policy, they were of the view that their damages exceeded the amount of that settlement.' Accordingly, they filed suit against their own insurer, American Manufacturers Mutual Insurance Company (\u201cAmerican\u201d or the \u201cInsurer\u201d), appellee, to recover underinsured motorist benefits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Following a two-day trial in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, appellants counsel asked the jury to award the Boones damages of $150,000, while the Insurer\u2019s attorney requested an award of damages in the range of $12,000 to $25,000. The jury heeded American\u2019s request and awarded Ms. Boone $10,864.48 for medical expenses and $5,000 for past and future pain and suffering. No damages were awarded with respect to appellants\u2019 consortium claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Unhappy with the verdict, which appellants characterize as \u201cshockingly low,\u201d the Boones unsuccessfully filed various post trial motions. Thereafter, they noted this appeal, in which they present the following six issues for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-5\">I. Whether the Court erred in failing to give Plaintiffs proposed instruction that Plaintiffs prior recovery against the driver would be deducted from the jury\u2019s verdict and that the jury should therefore render a verdict for the full amount deemed fair and just, and not just an addition to whatever amount plaintiff had already recovered?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-6\">II. Whether the Court erred in failing to give Plaintiffs proposed pattern standard jury instructions on- susceptibility to injury and aggravation of a pre-existing condition, where these issues were central to the trial, the examination of witnesses, and the final argument; and whether the Court was wrong to agree with Defendant\u2019s objection, based on an answer to interrogatory, where the pre-existing condition issue was explored in depositions, included in documen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>tary production, was the subject of documentary stipulations on authenticity, and fully explored at trial without objection, until the argument on instructions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-4\">III. Whether the Court, in the same vein, wrongfully excluded the York Memorial Hospital records of the earlier accident in 1996?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-5\">IV. Whether the Court wrongfully excluded Plaintiffs offer of Dr. Shepherd\u2019s [sic] medical records as business records, where there was an agreement of authenticity, and where defense counsel had selectively questioned Dr. Shepherd [sic] about them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-6\">V. Whether the Court wrongfully excluded the medical record of October 14, 1998, where questions asked by Defendants counsel on mobility on that visit opened up the subject and made it a fair subject of inquiry on redirect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-7\">VI. Whether the court\u2019s illustration, by way of example in connection with its instruction on \u201cmitigation\u201d was prejudicially unfair?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">For the reasons that follow, we shall vacate the judgment and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">FACTUAL SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">On October 9,1998, Norma Boone was a passenger in a pick up truck driven by her husband, Earl Boone. The Boones were traveling on York Road in northern Baltimore County when their vehicle was rear-ended by a vehicle operated by Donald Sites. The impact caused the Boones\u2019 truck to cross the center line and collide with an oncoming car. In addition, Ms. Boone was struck by a gun rack located behind her seat. Ms. Boone, who was 62 years of age at that time, was transported from the scene to York Memorial Hospital in York, Pennsylvania. She subsequently underwent a course of treatment for various injuries and eventually had shoulder surgery in June 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-11\">As noted, Sites\u2019s liability insurer settled with appellants for the maximum amount available under his policy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>the Insurer, the Boones had uninsured/underinsured coverage of $100,000. Accordingly, they made a claim under their own policy to recover additional damages. Dissatisfied with American\u2019s position, the Boones filed suit against the Insurer on October 16, 2000, claiming breach of contract and loss of consortium.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">On or about January 5, 2001, American propounded a First Request for Production of Documents to appellants. According to appellee, appellants produced documents responsive to the discovery request in \u201cdrips and drabs,\u201d as late as August 7, 2001, which was just prior to the trial that began on August 14, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">In January 2001, appellee also propounded interrogatories to appellants. Interrogatory No. 6, directed to both plaintiffs, was the subject of much controversy at trial. It asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAN\">If you contend that you suffered injuries and/or damages as a result of the occurrence alleged in the complaint, state with precision the nature of those injuries and/or damages and the nature of any' present complaints, whether you contend the injuries are permanent, whether you had at any time either prior to or subsequent to the alleged incident ever injured those areas of your body (and, if so, under what circumstances) and whether you contend any previous injury or condition was aggravated by the occurrence alleged in the Complaint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Approximately one month before trial, on or about July 12, 2001, appellants responded to the Interrogatories. In response to Interrogatory 6, appellants said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-7\">1983 auto accident \u2014 knee and head, neck</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-8\">1996 auto accident \u2014 left shoulder, soft tissue injury causing</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-9\">no bony abnormality</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-10\">1998 auto accident \u2014 neck and left shoulder</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">Appellee\u2019s Interrogatory 11 was also at issue at trial. It asked appellants whether they contended \u201cthat a previous injury or condition was aggravated by the occurrence for which this suit had been brought.\u201d In answer to Interrogate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>ry 11, appellants expressly answered: \u201cNo such contention.\u201d Moreover, appellants never supplemented any of their answers to interrogatories.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">During <em>voir dire, </em>the court introduced appellee by name and set out to explain the concept of underinsurance coverage, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-5\">I\u2019ll explain that there is a concept in coverage, insurance coverage \u2014 some of you may be familiar with it \u2014 called under insurance so that when a claim is made under certain circumstances it does permit this case to proceed in the form that it is. And that\u2019s what the defendant company is in this case for, what we call under insurance, but it\u2019s not something that should be of great interest to you except unless you\u2019ve had some experience with what we call under insurance in the past. Has anyone had any such experience and, of course, has anyone had any contact for any reason with American Manufacturers Mutual Insurance Company? Ok. Now, I want to say at this point, I don\u2019t want to cause you to lose focus when I talk about insurance and all that business. Your focus is solely upon what happened on that day, October 9, 1998, whose fault was it if anyone\u2019s? Was there injury to the Boones? If so, what it was and what the compensation should be? And that\u2019s all you have to be concerned about and that\u2019s all I ask you to be concerned about in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">After the jury was selected, the trial court gave a preliminary outline to the jurors with respect to how the trial would proceed. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-7\">[YJou\u2019re looking to see if there was reasonable conduct in the operation of a motor vehicle [by Mr. Sites].... Was there fault, was there injury occasioned by that fault and what are the damages, if any, that you award for that fault or negligence as we sometimes call it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">In his opening argument, appellants\u2019 attorney said, without objection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-9\">Mr. Sites\u2019 insurance which was paid is insufficient in our view to fully compensating [sic] her for this injury and she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>has a paid American Mutual Manufacturers Liability insurance policy with an under insurance clause so she has the right to bring a suit which, technically, is a breach of contract. We say that American Mutual Liability isn\u2019t paying what it should because we\u2019ve got damages more than Mr. Sites\u2019 policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">In her opening statement, appellee\u2019s counsel expressly conceded that there was \u201cabsolutely no question that Donald Sites was at fault for that accident.\u201d Therefore, she admonished the jurors not to \u201cconcern yourselves\u201d with the issue of fault. Defense counsel also acknowledged that the accident was \u201cpretty bad,\u201d and conceded that Ms. Boone injured her left shoulder. But, appellee\u2019s attorney explained that the disagreement was with regard to the amount of compensation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYR\">They are absolutely entitled to insurance coverage. They have purchased what\u2019s called under insured motorist protection. That means, if they are in an accident where it is not their fault, where they are hit by someone else and they are not properly compensated, they are not sufficiently compensated, they have a right as [appellant\u2019s counsel] told you, they have a right to bring a law suit and seek money damages from their own insurance carrier, even though the accident was not my client\u2019s fault, certainly, even though my client has absolutely no affiliation with Mr. Sites at all. I\u2019ve never even met the man. Doesn\u2019t matter. If they were not fairly compensated, they have a right to come to my company, my client, and ask for additional compensation. That\u2019s what underinsured motorist protection is all about. Now, you don\u2019t need to concern yourselves with how much money they\u2019ve already received. That\u2019s irrelevant for your purposes. What you have to do today and perhaps tomorrow, you have to decide the case before you fairly, impartially. You have to decide what you think Ms. Boone\u2019s and perhaps Mr. Boone\u2019s, because I know they\u2019re making a claim for loss of consortium, what would fairly compensate them. Whatever that number is, my client is prepared to live with.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Auc\">At trial, the parties hotly disputed the extent of injuries that Ms. Boone suffered as' a result of the accident in issue. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>court restricted appellants to the precise information contained in their answers to interrogatories.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">Appellants called Dr. Douglas Shepard, an orthopedic surgeon, as their first witness and their only expert. A graduate of Johns Hopkins University and Baylor College of Medicine, Dr. Shepard is a Board-certified orthopedic surgeon. He began to treat Ms. Boone for her injuries on November 20, 1998, upon referral by Dr. Eric Fisher, an internist. Dr. Fisher, who initially treated Ms. Boone after the accident, practiced in the same office as Dr. Shepard.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Dr. Shepard recounted Ms. Boone\u2019s history and course of treatment, noting that she was first seen by Dr. Fisher on October 14, 1998. Dr. Shepard explained from the medical notes that Dr. Fisher requested an orthopedic consult because \u201csome of her pain, like in her lower back, got better but her shoulder [pain] persisted.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">According to Dr. Shepard, Ms. Boone\u2019s \u201cchief complaint\u201d when he first saw her was pain in the side of her neck, radiating to the left \u201cshoulder blade in the back and pain in these muscles ... between your shoulder blade and neck and that pain radiated down to ... the mid-part of the arm, and she had occasional numbness and tingling in the fingers.\u201d Initially, he arrived at three \u201cimpressions\u201d: \u201cwhip lash\u201d; an inflammation of the trapezium muscle; and \u201csubacromial impingement syndrome\u201d or \u201cpinching\u201d of the \u201cmuscles that go from her shoulder blade to ... the rotator cuff....\u201d Further diagnostic testing showed an inflamation and \u201cpartial fraying or tear\u201d of the rotator cuff (i.e., muscle and tendon), and a torn glenoid labrum (cartilage).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Because Ms. Boone\u2019s shoulder problem did not resolve, Dr. Shepard performed arthroscopic shoulder surgery, or \u201cshoulder shaving,\u201d on Ms. Boone on June 25, 2001. The doctor opined that Ms. Boone was still impaired, post-operatively. Further, he opined that, as a result of the accident of October 9, 1998, Ms. Boone suffered a 25% permanent disability to her \u201cnormal neck function,\u201d and a 30-35% permanent disability of the shoulder. The doctor testified on direct, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Doctor, do you have an opinion within a reasonable degree of medical probability as to whether the conditions for which you operated on Ms. Boone in June of 2001 were causally related to the accident of October 9,1998?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-4\">[DR. SHEPARD]: Yes I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-5\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: And what is your opinion please?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-6\">[DR. SHEPARD]: My opinion is that her shoulder injury was related to the car accident \u2014 I mean, the motor vehicle accident and her neck problem was made worse by the car accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-7\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: When you say made worse, what was it in the neck that was worse as a result of the injury she received in the motor vehicle accident?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-8\">[DR. SHEPARD]: Well, she had some arthritis demonstrated on her X-rays and she didn\u2019t have perfect neck function. It was only functional but the accident made her stiffness and loss of motion, pain and spasm in this area significantly worse and more constant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-9\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Do you have an opinion, in other words, did that arthritis flared [sic] up and became aggravated as a result of the injury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-10\">[DR. SHEPARD]: That\u2019s my opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-11\">According to Dr. Shepard, on November 12, 1999, appellant completed a form for a medical visit with him, in which she was asked if she had ever had a prior injury to her body. The doctor testified that appellant wrote that in \u201cApril, 1996 she jammed her left shoulder by catching a dash board with hands when we were hit at a stop light.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-12\">At the conclusion of Dr. Shepard\u2019s direct testimony, appellants\u2019 counsel offered into evidence Dr. Shepard\u2019s medical records, reports, and notes pertaining to Ms. Boone, asserting that defense counsel had stipulated to their authenticity. The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Just very quickly, Plaintiffs 6 are all the bills, 5A is the York Hospital, 5B is the complete chart including Dr. Shepard\u2019s notes, 5C is the physical therapy chart and 5D is the MRI and 5E is a follow up report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-4\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I said I would stipulate to the bills. I didn\u2019t say 1 was going to let all this stuff come in.... I stipulated that it was genuine and that it was authentic and 1 specifically said in my letter that I reserve all rights with respect to admissibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-5\">[THE COURT]: The point is, you cannot use substantive medical reports and put them into evidence. You know that, because he\u2019s testified to it....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-6\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Well, his whole office char[t] is a record made and kept in the regular course of his profession. It\u2019s admissible under the business records statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">Further, appellants\u2019 attorney indicated that he had \u201ccut\u201d the doctors examination \u201cshort,\u201d which he would not have done if he had known that he would not be allowed to introduce the various medical records and reports. The trial judge inquired: \u201cWhat have you not asked him about?\u201d Appellants\u2019 lawyer responded: \u201cWell ... I didn\u2019t get all the complaints.... \u201d The trial judge said that he would allow appellants\u2019 counsel to reopen the examination of Dr. Shepard in order to elicit additional testimony that appellants felt was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">After a lengthy exchange with the court about the admissibility of certain medical records, appellants\u2019 counsel said that \u201cthere\u2019s another doctor in the office by the name of Fisher. I would like Fisher\u2019s notes in.\u201d The court refused to admit Dr. Fisher\u2019s notes, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s going from bad to worse.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>court quipped: How about a doctor in Canada that we haven\u2019t heard of? Why don\u2019t we get those in too?<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">Shortly thereafter, the forelady of the jury posed a question to the court. The following colloquy is noteworthy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-5\">[FORELADY]: We were wondering how long the couple had been insured with this insurance company for the under insurance policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-6\">[THE COURT]: Well, we don\u2019t know the answer and I don\u2019t think we are going to know it in this case because it really is not an issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-7\">[FORELADY]: Ok.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-8\">[THE COURT]: I have to add. Were going to focus just on whether or not there\u2019s been injury to the person and caused by the negligence of someone else and if so, what damages if any? They\u2019re the only the [sic] question and I thank you very much for your good intentions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>On cross-examination, the doctor was questioned about Ms. Boone\u2019s prior injuries to her neck and shoulder. Dr. Shepard opined that the injury to Ms. Boone\u2019s rotator cuff was \u201cclearly a result of the 1998 accident.\u201d Although the doctor could not rule out a tear to the glenoid labrum in 1996, when Ms. Boone was involved in another accident, he noted that Ms. Boone had not sought \u201cmedical attention\u201d for it and it was \u201cnot symptomatic ... for two years.\u201d Therefore, he reasoned that any earlier problem was \u201ceither ... [a] minimal problem or not symptomatic.\u201d The doctor explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-4\">[T]he 1998 accident made it painful enough that then she sought medical attention. A lot of people have arthritis in their neck and back. They will take an Advil and they do fine. They then get an injury and whatever was there preexistent flares. Then they seek medical attention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Although Dr. Shepard acknowledged that he had no idea whether Ms. Boone had sought any medical attention after the 1996 car accident, he maintained that the 1996 accident was \u201cirrelevant\u201d to \u201cthis patient\u2019s injury in this case.\u201d He said: \u201cThe findings at surgery are all relevant to this accident ... not the fact she hit a dash board two years ago to brace herself in a[n] accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Defense counsel also discussed Ms. Boone\u2019s pre-existing condition by reference to portions of Dr. Shepard\u2019s records. For example, defense counsel asked about a letter of September 8, 1999, from Neil Novin, M.D. to Dr. Shepard, which mentioned a prior accident in which plaintiffs neck was injured, and sought an opinion as to whether there were \u201cobjective changes\u201d due to an accident in 1998. Dr. Shepard agreed that, in his ratings of Ms. Boone\u2019s disabilities, he did not \u201ctake into account at all any prior injuries\u201d to Ms. Boone\u2019s neck or shoulder. The following colloquy is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-7\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: You specifically asked Ms. Boone if she had any prior injuries, didn\u2019t you Dr. Shepard? [DR. SHEPARD]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-8\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: And you asked her that when you saw her on November 20,1998, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>[DR. SHEPARD]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-4\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: And you specifically asked her about injuries to her neck or to her shoulder?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-5\">[DR. SHEPARD]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-6\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: And she told you that she hadn\u2019t had any, didn\u2019t [she] Doctor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-7\">[DR. SHEPARD]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-8\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Now since then you found out that that\u2019s not true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-9\">[DR. SHEPARD]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-10\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: She has had prior injuries hasn\u2019t she Doctor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-11\">[DR. SHEPARD]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-12\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: And she has, in fact, had prior injuries to her neck and to her left shoulder. Isn\u2019t that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-13\">[DR. SHEPARD]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-14\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: And, in fact, those are the same areas of her body about which she makes complaint in this law suit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-15\">[DR. SHEPARD]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-16\">During the re-direct examination of Dr. Shepard, appellants unsuccessfully attempted to introduce into evidence Ms. Boone\u2019s medical records from York Memorial Hospital relating to treatment she received in connection with the 1996 accident. The court responded: \u201cYou want to try that case, too.\u201d Appellants\u2019 counsel explained: \u201c[T]he point is, [defense counsel] .., is trying to lay some of the blame for [the current injuries] on the 1996 injury----\u201d Appellants\u2019 counsel argued that the 1996 hospital record showed only a \u201cslight\u201d injury and a \u201csuperficial examination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-19\">In her testimony, Ms. Boone attempted to discuss a hand injury that she allegedly suffered in the accident. The court sustained appellee\u2019s objection, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-20\">[Appellants\u2019 counsel] submitted for the first time in this case a hand injury as opposed to shoulder and arm and I have a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>rule that it is too late. It was not referenced in the interrogatory answers. No. 6 (indiscernible), and therefore, it is simply too late as being the day of trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">Appellants\u2019 attorney later asked the court to \u201crevisit\u201d it\u2019s decision as to the hand injury, claiming the matter had been disclosed at Ms. Boone\u2019s deposition on August 2, 2001. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-5\">Well, the issue is whether or not you were telling the Defense in discovery that you are claiming something that triggers the defense. If you say you\u2019re claiming a hand deficit it causes the defense to become defensive, so to speak, and to perhaps look to that in greater depth in deposition. To look for medical substantiation. To contact an expert, perhaps, to question the medical experts about it, and all those things are tripped into action by the interrogatory answer which is very important in my view, because they are what you intend. So, putting it in reverse, silence on an issue; what you are claiming, right ear, left ear, left eye and no mention of the right eye. And then here you say, oh, also the right eye. I think it\u2019s fair for a reasonable defense attorney to assume your silence means you are not claiming something. You said nothing about the right knee caps either, right?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Ms. Boone also attempted to testify about a back injury she sustained in the accident involving Mr. Sites. During her direct examination, in response to an inquiry regarding physical therapy, Ms. Boone stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-7\">The first visit was an examination and just sort of a rub down and stretching. When he had pulled on my head and neck in that it took the weight off of my back. It just felt like my head was too heavy for the rest of me. When he pulled on me it eased the pain in my back and my neck so he decided on the second visit, besides the moist heat that they use, the heating pads, they would add traction to it to help straighten out the pain in my back because I was bruised and my entire back was swelled from where I had hit the seat.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Defense counsel immediately asked to approach the bench. In response to the court\u2019s inquiry as to the \u201cproblem,\u201d defense counsel said: \u201cYour Honor, answer to interrogatory no. 6 is my problem. The woman claimed injury to her neck and her shoulder.\u201d The court then took a recess.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">The next day, during direct examination of Ms. Boone, her lawyer showed her a heating pad and asked if it was \u201cthe heating pad that [she] used.\u201d Ms. Boone responded that it was the heating pad \u201cfor the back,\u201d adding that she had another heating pad for her neck. At that point, defense counsel asserted: \u201cYour honor, the only damage that\u2019s being claimed in this case are to the neck and shoulder.\u201d Appellant\u2019s attorney objected to defense counsel\u2019s assertion in the jury\u2019s presence, which was sustained. Nevertheless, the following discussion ensued in the jury\u2019s presence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-5\">[COURT]: ... I think it\u2019s fair to tell the jury that the damages claimed here are limited to the neck and the shoulder and somewhat in the back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-6\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Well, there were injuries to the back recorded at York Hospital about that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-7\">[COURT]: The same problem. It\u2019s neck and shoulder according to the interrogatory, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-8\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-9\">[APPELLANTS\u2019COUNSEL]: That\u2019s always the\u2014 '</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-10\">[COURT]: When I spoke about the back,- I only refer to where the shoulder forms a part of the back. That\u2019s all I met [sic]. But it\u2019s shoulder and neck ladies and gentlemen, and that\u2019s because that\u2019s the standard of this trial. And there is no other injury to be considered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">On direct examination, Ms. Boone denied any use of a neck pad in regard to a prior accident that occurred in April 1996. She also claimed \u201cthere were no treatments\u201d with respect to the 1996 accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-12\">The following colloquy from cross-examination is also relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: And your biggest complaint when you saw Dr. Fisher was a pain in your left shoulder, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-4\">[MS. BOONE]: I think it was more than that. I wasn\u2019t walking upright at the time. I couldn\u2019t straighten up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AeQ\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Well, if Dr. Fishers note says you were walking fine, would you have a quarrel with that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ\">[MS. BOONE]: Yes, I think I would.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">During the redirect examination of Ms. Boone, appellee\u2019s counsel again objected to appellants\u2019 attempt to show that Ms. Boone sustained an injury to her back as a result of the accident in issue, because it had not been disclosed in Ms. Boone\u2019s answers to interrogatories. The following colloquy is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-6\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Your Honor, may I please object? The injuries in this case, the injuries claimed are to the neck and the shoulder. [Appellants\u2019 counsel] repeated [sic] brings up other injuries, other accidents, and it\u2019s just not fair [Y]our Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-7\">[THE COURT]: Yeah, there are no other injuries that\u2019s [sic] before this jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">Appellants\u2019 attorney insisted that \u201cthe first question that [defense] Counsel asked had to do with the mobility of [appellant\u2019s] back and the fact that she could walk well according to Dr. Fisher\u2019s note.\u201d Appellants\u2019 counsel then referred to \u201cDr. Fisher\u2019s note\u201d of October 14, 1998, which he claimed was contrary to defense counsel\u2019s representation. Appellee\u2019s counsel objected to the admission of the note, and the following discussion transpired at the bench:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-9\">[THE COURT]: The question is what is this piece of paper?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aik\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: This is the record of Dr. Fisher to which Counsel referred on cross-examination [of Ms. Boone] on the first consultation. And [the defense attorney] said; you were moving your back well, you were walking well or something like that. And it\u2019s completely contrary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>[THE COURT]: So he did refer to it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-4\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Your Honor, he\u2019s not suppose [sic] to be talking about any injuries to the back.... There is no injury to the back. She can not make any complaints about injury to the back from this accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-5\">[THE COURT]: Is this all about the back?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-6\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Exactly. It\u2019s all about the back, and her question was about the back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-7\">[THE COURT]: Well its too bad she didn\u2019t tell us about the back injury. Maybe the next case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">Appellants also introduced testimony of Officer Donovan, who investigated the 1998 accident. Prior to closing, plaintiffs counsel again sought to introduce the \u201cactual hospital records\u201d of Ms. Boone from \u201cthe various health care facilities.\u201d The judge excluded them, on the basis that \u201cthe jury has heard testimony live from a doctor and from Ms! Boone as to her treatment.... \u201d Appellee did not present any witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">At the end of trial, appellants requested the following jury instructions, among others:</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">MPJI 10:3</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">SUSCEPTIBILITY TO INJURY</p>\n<p id=\"b240-12\">The effect that an injury might have upon a particular person depends upon the susceptibility to injury of the plaintiff. In other words, the fact that the injury would have been less serious if inflicted upon another person should not affect the amount of damages to which the plaintiff may be entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-13\">MPJI 10:4</p>\n<p id=\"b240-14\">AGGRAVATION OF PREVIOUS CONDITION</p>\n<p id=\"b240-15\">A person who had a particular condition before the accident may be awarded damages for the aggravation or worsening of that condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-16\">The following discussion ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>[COURT]: What\u2019s the susceptibility to injury? Your [instructions] 9 and 10, aggravation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-4\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Well, it\u2019s obvious that she had trouble to her neck which she admits ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-5\">[COURT]: You don\u2019t have any medical [evidence] here to support that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-6\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: That\u2019s exactly what Dr. Shepard said from the stand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-7\">[COURT]: Right. That it was \u2014 he did say that as to the neck, did he not?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">At that point, defense counsel asserted that although the doctor had so stated, appellants did not claim any aggravation in their answers to appellee\u2019s interrogatories. Counsel for appellants then responded that appellee\u2019s lawyer \u201cshould have objected. It\u2019s too late.\u201d Later, appellants\u2019 lawyer reiterated that \u201cthe evidence [of aggravation] went in without objection.\u201d Appellants\u2019 attorney added: \u201cWell, then you should have objected. It\u2019s too late. We\u2019ve been beaten about the head with that interrogatory [answer] and that interrogatory referred only to permanent injury____\u201d Nevertheless, the judge agreed with the defense and declined to give the instructions requested by appellants concerning aggravation of a pre-existing condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">The Boones also requested that the court give their proposed jury instruction 7B, concerning underinsurance. The instruction stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-11\">Members of the jury in finding a verdict for Mrs. Boone in this case, you are instructed that the amount which Mrs. Boone received from the underinsured driver, Mr. Sites, will be subtracted from the total amount of money which you award Mrs. Bone. In other words, there will be no double recovery by Mrs. Boone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-12\">Appellants\u2019 counsel argued strenuously that the proposed underinsurance instruction was needed to avoid a misperception by the jury that appellants would obtain a \u201cdouble recovery\u201d or otherwise benefit from double-dipping. Citing <em>Farley v. Allstate Insurance Co., </em>355 Md. 34, 733 A.2d 1014 (1999), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>appellants claimed the case did not bar the court \u201cfrom straightening the jury out.\u201d In urging the court to instruct the jury about underinsurance, appellants\u2019 counsel said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AN\">Judge, I can practically tell you right now that there are going to be people on that jury who think that my client is double dipping and she\u2019s1 getting a double recovery and there\u2019s nothing' in <em>Farley </em>that forbids you from straightening the jury out. What is the fact and the truth ought to be put before this jury because otherwise this verdict is going to be cut and they\u2019re going to guess that we\u2019ve recovered a certain amount and when I ask the jury for X dollars, they\u2019re going to cut it in half, all kinds of distortion. Everything that Judge Chasnow complained about [in <em>Farley v. Allstate </em>]. Judge Chasnow only said, you can\u2019t talk about the amount they got in settlement and you can\u2019t talk about the limits that the Defendant has or that the carrier has, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t barr [sic] the jury from speculating about double dipping and double recovery and the fact that we\u2019re trying to.get money from Sites and then stack what we get from this company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-5\">The trial judge responded:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-6\">No one\u2019s disputing its a risk. It\u2019s the nature of the case ... [W]hat always troubled me about these cases is to say nothing about.what this is all about. What this is all about is underinsurance. They know that but they don\u2019t know what it means.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">Appellee\u2019s attorney argued that the jury merely had to \u201cdetermine what the value is of the case and they do understand that. What is the value of the case? ... Beyond that, sort of, the law takes over.\u201d She added: \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for this jury to know anything more than that.\u201d \u2022</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-8\">Appellants\u2019 counsel countered:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-9\">Uninformed juries always lead \u2014 uninformed juries lead to unjust verdicts because obviously they\u2019re going to wonder why she\u2019s getting more? Why \u2014 whether the amount that Plaintiffs [sic] counsel is asking for is on top of what she got from cites [sic] and she\u2019s getting double recovery. I feel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>very strongly and don\u2019t think there [sic] \u2014 I think that the logic is unsalable [sic] and I don\u2019t know why the Court of Special Appeals and Court of Appeals didn\u2019t straighten it out. But it happens in every underinsured and it\u2019s a gift, it\u2019s a gift of thousands of dollars to the underinsured carrier because of the prejudice that\u2019s going to result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">Ultimately, the judge refused to give appellants\u2019 proposed instruction 7B. Instead, in its closing instructions to the jury, the trial court said, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-5\">I do want to say, there\u2019s been some kind of obscure references to <em>the </em>\u2014 what <em>we call underinsurance and basically, to repeat, it simply means that when you recover for someone\u2019s fault that harms you, you recover against the person who harmed you. But suppose, for example, you don\u2019t believe it\u2019s </em>enough? It\u2019s not a fair compensation. <em>You have a right under certain circumstances to go against or to claim against your own policy </em>which may carry what we call under insurance so that in a sense you <em>make up a deficit </em>in the eyes of the Plaintiffs, <em>a deficit. </em>However\u2014 and, of course, you would be curious to know what the amount, if any, there was before this trial commenced and the answer that I\u2019ve given you before is that that is absolutely not involved in this case and you should not speculate about that. I\u2019m not even hinting that there has been anything like that. I\u2019m only trying to explain what this concept of under insurance means but for your purposes, knowing that explanation, I ask you ... to confine yourselves only to the decision you have to make in this case. And that is simply this, Ms. Boone was harmed by the negligence of Mr. Sites. She\u2019s entitled to fair compensation based upon the evidence that she has submitted to you in this courtroom in this trial. What do you think is fair compensation, given the accident, given what she\u2019s testified to? What she may or may not be looking elsewhere for, has absolutely nothing to do with this case. Nothing. Keep your blinders on and look only at that one question, phrased here as two questions. What are the damages, if any? And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>I break them out into two. Past medical expenses. B. non-economic.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-5\">After the court instructed the jury, the following occurred: [APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: ... I except to the failure of the Court to give instruction 7A. From what I understand I\u2019m being allowed to argue that. That\u2019s the one about failure to call an expert witness. 7B, I have argued strenuously that it distorts the verdict in favor of the Defendant (inaudible).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-7\">No. 9,1 think that susceptibility to injuries here in this case, if for no other reason than the fact she had been in a previous accident and the fact that she had arthritis. I think, in effect, the-and that\u2019s right out of PJI. The fact that an injury might have been-the effect that an injury might have upon a particular person....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-8\">[COURT]: It would have been most helpful had you put it in the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-9\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: [Defense counsel] put it in the case.... My client came to the doctor saying that she had previous neck trouble. That\u2019s all it takes. Same for aggravation of a previous condition, no. 10 ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">Although the judge said he would give an instruction on the collateral source rule, he failed to do so. When appellants\u2019 lawyer pointed out the omission during exceptions, the court reiterated that it would instruct on the collateral source rule. Nevertheless, it did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-11\">In closing argument, appellants\u2019 counsel told the jury: \u201cThe issue of the importance of the 1996 accident was a significant issue, perhaps the most significant issue. Defense counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>referred again and again to the 1996 accident or other accidents in order to minimize the damages due to the 1998 accident at issue here.\u201d Appellants\u2019 attorney asked the jury to award damages of $150,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">The defense attorney argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-5\">Please keep in mind that this is a contract case. It\u2019s about an agreement that the Boones made with my client. That\u2019s what it\u2019s about. It\u2019s not about other accidents in which they were involved. It\u2019s not about Mr. Boone\u2019s back injury 20 years ago. It\u2019s not about any of that. It\u2019s about an agreement. And the agreement is, that <em>if the Boones were injured by someone and not sufficiently compensated by that person\u2019s insurance my client would step in. </em>That\u2019s the deal we struck and my client is fully prepared to honor that agreement in the event that you find \u2014 you know, whatever number it is that you attribute to the injuries claimed by the Plaintiffs. <em>If they haven\u2019t been compensated already, my folks stand ready to pay.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-6\">Was the labrum tear which was repaired in the surgery related to the accident in 1996 or was it related to the accident in 1998. If there\u2019s a question in your mind, you cant give damages for that. [Appellants\u2019 attorney] had to prove that to you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Further, the defense attorney told the jury that American was \u201cnever quibbling about the accident.\u201d Indeed, she conceded that \u201c[i]t was always a significant accident,\u201d adding: \u201cI would expect you to compensate her for having been in the car accident.\u201d But, defense counsel maintained that \u201c[t]he question is, what damages did this lady and her husband sustain, if any?\u201d Appellee\u2019s counsel suggested to the jury that it award damages in the range of $12,000 to $25,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">As we noted, the jury returned a verdict of $10,864.48 for medical expenses and $5,000 for past and future pain and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>suffering. After the court denied appellants\u2019 post-trial motions, this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">We shall include additional facts in our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Appellants contend that the circuit erred in refusing \u201cto instruct the jury on the mechanism of underinsurance,\u201d in a manner consistent with appellants proposed jury instruction 7B.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellants insist that, \u201c[hjaving made the presence of underinsurance well known, the Court was obliged to tell the jury the law applicable to underinsurance.\u201d Moreover, they point out that the Insurer \u201cnever challenged the correctness of the plaintiffs proposed instruction----\u201d In their view, the Insurer\u2019s</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-9\">excuse that the jury doesn\u2019t need to know, and that the law would sort it out later, is simply unacceptable. The trial judge should never have left the jury in a fog as to how the insurance worked. This is not a situation where the instructions otherwise fairly covered the matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-10\">Further, appellants maintain that, \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-11\">despite this complicated scenario of underinsurance \u2014 understood only by lawyers who do this kind of work, and certainly not by jurors \u2014 there was repeated mention and comment on underinsurance without any explanation of how it worked____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-12\">Thus, appellants theorize that they suffered a reduced verdict because of the court\u2019s failure to explain to the jury that any award of damages would be reduced by the amount that appellants already recovered from Sites, so as to clarify that appellants would not enjoy a windfall or a \u201cdouble recovery.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>As a result of the court\u2019s failure to so advise the jury, appellants maintain that the jury undoubtedly believed that the damages it awarded merely constituted \u201ca supplement\u201d or \u201cadd-on\u201d to \u201can unknown sum already recovered [from Sites], rather than a full verdict for the entire amount of damages.\u201d In appellants\u2019 view, \u201c[t]he extremely low verdict \u2014 out of all proportion to the uncontradicted expert evidence of Dr. Sheph[a]rd,\u201d and less than the $12,000 to $25,000 \u201crange\u201d urged by American\u2019s attorney, \u201cre-enforces the conclusion that the jury was confused.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">In urging that we uphold the trial judge, appellee counters that \u201c[t]he jury is not to be burdened with extraneous information regarding limits and mathematical calculations.\u201d In it\u2019s view, \u201c[t]he jury is simply to be told that it is to determine the compensation, if any, to which a Plaintiff is entitled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">In the context of this matter, in which the court twice said that the case involved a claim for underinsurance coverage as a result of an alleged \u201cdeficit\u201d in appellants\u2019 recovery from Sites, the tortfeasor, we agree with appellants that the jury may have been confused as to whether it was to award compensation as a supplement to the recovery from Sites, or, instead, to award damages as if no recovery had ever been obtained by the Boones from Sites.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">We begin our analysis with reference to Maryland Rule 2-520(c). It provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-7\">(c) <em>How Given. </em>The court may instruct the jury, orally or in writing or both, by granting requested instructions, by giving instructions of its own, or by combining any of these methods. The court need not grant a requested instruction if the matter is fairly covered by instructions actually given.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AiM\">It is beyond cavil that a trial court must properly instruct the jury on a point of law that is supported by some evidence in the record. <em>See Myers v. Alessi, </em>80 Md.App. 124, 132, 560 A.2d 59 [1989] (\u201cIt is firmly established that under Md. Rule 2-520(c) a trial judge is not obligated to give a requested instruction if the matter is fairly covered in the instructions already given.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>317 Md. 640, 566 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>A.2d 101 (1989); see also Gunning v. State, 347 Md. 332, 347-48, 701 A.2d 374 (1997) (interpreting analogous criminal rule, Rule 4-325(c)); <em>Dykes v. State, </em>319 Md. 206, 220, 571 A.2d 1251 (1990) (applying Md.

State, </em>118 Md.App. 317, 349, 702 A.2d 928 (1997), (\u201cMaryland Rule-4-325(c) provides that if a party requests an instruction that correctly states the applicable law generated by the evidence, which has not been covered in the instructions already given, the trial court is required to give the instruction.\u201d), <em>aff'd, </em>350 Md. 585, 714 A.2d 841 (1998). Indeed, when requested, \u201c \u2018it is incumbent upon the court ... to give an instruction on every essential question or point of law supported by the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Robertson v. State, </em>112 Md.App. 366, 374, 685 A.2d 805 (1996) (quoting <em>Bruce v. State, </em>218 Md. 87, 97, 145 A.2d 428 (1958)); <em>see Smith v. State, </em>302 Md. 175, 179, 486 A.2d 196 (1985). This is because a party is \u201cgenerally entitled to present his theory of the case through a requested instruction when there is evidence before the jury that supports it.\u201d <em>Robertson, </em>112 Md.App. at 375, 685 A.2d 805; <em>see Johnson v. State, </em>303 Md. 487, 512, 495 A.2d 1 (1985), (\u201cThe test for whether an instruction was proper has two aspects: (1) whether the instruction correctly states the law, and (2) whether the law is applicable in light of the evidence before the jury.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 1093, 106 S.Ct. 868, 88 L.Ed.2d 907 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">In <em>Robertson, </em>112 Md.App. at 385, 685 A.2d 805, a criminal case, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-5\">The main purpose of a jury instruction is to aid the jury in clearly understanding the case and considering the testimony; to provide guidance for the jury\u2019s deliberations by directing their attention to the legal principles that apply to and govern the facts in the case; and to ensure that the jury is informed of the law so that it can arrive at a fair and just verdict. Accurate jury instructions are also essential for safeguarding a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. The court\u2019s instructions should fairly and adequately protect an accused\u2019s rights by covering the controlling issues of the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Conversely, a trial court is not required to give a particular instruction unless it constitutes an accurate statement of the law <em>and </em>is applicable to the facts and circumstances of the case. <em>See Wegad v. Howard Street Jewelers, Inc., </em>826 Md. 409, 414, 605 A.2d 123 (1992) (noting that any requested instruction must meet two conditions: \u201c(1) the [requested] condition must correctly state the law, and (2) that law must be applicable in light of the evidence before the jury.\u201d); <em>see also Mack v.

Nor is a trial court required to give an instruction that is redundant. As the Court of Appeals explained in <em>Farley v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>355 Md. 34, 46-47, 733 A.2d 1014 (1999):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-4\">[T]he standard of review for jury instructions is that so long as the law is fairly covered by the jury instructions, reviewing courts should not disturb them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-5\">Thus, simply because a requested instruction is an accurate statement of the law and supported by the evidence does not mean the trial judge is required to give it to the jury. So long as the trial judge has covered the applicable law in another instruction, or combination of instructions, Md. Rule 2-520(c) makes clear that he or she does not have to give it to the jurors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Recently, this Court elaborated on the standard of review as to jury instructions.

Dorchester County Family YMCA, Inc., </em>139 Md.App. 664, 672, 779 A.2d 963 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">Both sides rely on <em>Farley v. Allstate Insurance Co., 355 </em>Md. 34, 733 A.2d 1014, <em>supra, </em>to support their respective positions. In <em>Farley, </em>the appellants brought a breach of contract action against Allstate, their own insurance company, for nonpayment of underinsured motorist benefits. Mr. Farley, who was injured in an automobile accident, had settled with the tortfeasor\u2019s insurer for the policy limits of $25,000. Based on the underinsurance protection afforded by their own insurance company, the Farleys then sued their own insurer to recover additional damages. At trial, the court specifically instructed the lawyers \u201cnot to inform the jurors, that the case involved underinsured motorist coverage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 42, 733 A.2d 1014. Moreover, the court directed counsel not to disclose the terms of the insurance policy, including the policy limits, or the amount of the settlement. Thereafter, the jury only awarded the Farleys damages of $31,087.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">On appeal, the Farleys complained about the trial court\u2019s refusal to allow them to introduce in evidence the actual insurance policy, including the amount of coverage. They argued that they were prejudiced, because the jury did not know the \u201c \u2018whole picture\u2019 \u201d and had \u201cto decide the case in a \u2018vacuum\u2019....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 42, 733 A.2d 1014. The Court of Appeals rejected that contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">The <em>Farley </em>Court acknowledged that when an \u201cinsurance carrier is a party to the litigation, obviously the existence of insurance cannot be kept from the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 42, 733 A.2d 1014. The Court was clear, however, that \u201c[i]n such cases ... the <em>amount </em>of uninsured/underinsured motorist <em>coverage </em>should not be disclosed unless the amount itself is in controversy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 42, 733 A.2d 1014 (emphasis added). As the Court explained, \u201cthe amount of an insured\u2019s coverage is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>relevant to the jury\u2019s consideration of damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 43, 733 A.2d 1014. It reasoned that \u201cif the jury were provided with a definitive amount of available policy limits the likely result would be a distorted jury verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the Court said that \u201cthe amount of policy limits is in no way probative of the issue of damages, absent a controversy in the amount of coverage itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 45, 733 A.2d 1014. Because the policy was \u201cirrelevant\u201d to the issue of the Farleys\u2019 damages, no error occurred. <em>Id. </em>at 45, 733 A.2d 1014.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">In reaching its result, the Court pointed out that the case was not \u201ca contract action in the sense that any provisions of the insurance policy were at issue.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>Rather, the compensation sought by the <em>Farleys </em>was \u201cfor tort-not contract-damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, the jury\u2019s \u201csole responsibility was to ... determine what amount, if any, Allstate should be obligated to pay----\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 46, 733 A.2d 1014. The Court also noted that the verdict sheet \u201creflect[ed] the tort-not contract-flavor of the case when it directed] the jurors to decide\u201d such matters as \u201cnoneconomic damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the Court was satisfied that, despite the label of a contract claim, the trial court \u201cproperly instructed the jury to consider the issue of damages in a tort case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">The <em>Farley </em>Court also reaffirmed its holding in <em>Allstate Insurance Co. v. Miller, </em>315 Md. 182, 553 A.2d 1268 (1989). <em>Farley, </em>355 Md. at 43, 733 A.2d 1014. We turn to consider that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Ms. Miller was injured in a motor vehicle accident and sued her employer\u2019s insurer under the uninsured motorist provision of her employer\u2019s policy. Significantly, the trial court \u201cdirected the jury to only consider the issue of the plaintiffs damages,\u201d based on \u201cthe elements of damage that typically are involved in a tort case.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>315 Md. at 184, 553 A.2d 1268. The <em>Miller </em>Court noted that, from the jury\u2019s perspective, the case involved the issue of damages, if any, arising from the underlying tort action. <em>Id. </em>at 185, 553 A.2d 1268. When the jury returned a verdict in excess of the uninsured third party policy limits, Allstate argued that the verdict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>should be reduced to the amount of the policy limits. Miller disagreed, claiming Allstate failed to introduce the policy limits and therefore it could not do so after the verdict. The Court disagreed, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-4\">[Miller\u2019s] argument might be persuasive had this case gone to the jury on the contract claim against Allstate. But, as we have seen, what actually went to the jury was the question of damages arising from the tort claim of Miller against Sowell. <em>We are dealing with what was functionally presented to the jury as a tort case.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-5\"><em>Miller, </em>315 Md. at 190, 553 A.2d 1268 (emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">The <em>Miller </em>Court added:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-7\">\n<em>[T]he amount of uninsured motorist coverage should not be disclosed unless the amount is in controversy.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-8\"><em>[Wjhat the jury was directed to consider, and all the jury was directed to consider, was the issue of damages in a tort case. </em>In this posture of the case, and under these circumstances, rather than require a party to establish uninsured motorist policy limits as an affirmative defense or as a limitation of exposure, <em>the better rule is to allow the jury to make its decision on the issue of damages without being informed of the amount of coverage available. </em>Therefore, the admission of uninsured motorist coverage amounts should not be a tactical decision left to the parties\u2019 discretion. <em>The fact of the limit of uninsured motorist coverage is irrelevant to the issue of the amount of tort damages.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Atk\"><em>Id. </em>at 191-92, 553 A.2d 1268 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellants never urged the trial court to inform the jury of the amount of coverage available under American\u2019s policy. Therefore, neither <em>Farley </em>nor <em>Miller </em>is directly on point.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">As in <em>Farley </em>and <em>Miller, </em>however, this case clearly proceeded as the functional equivalent of a tort case. Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>lants sought tort damages from their Insurer, and the trial court presented the jury with instructions consistent with a tort case. But, unlike in <em>Miller </em>and <em>Farley, </em>the question presented here concerns the adequacy of the jury instructions, given that the jury was aware that appellants had already recovered some unknown sum of damages from Sites as the tortfeasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">As we see it, this case illustrates the colloquialism that a little bit of knowledge can be a dangerous thing. There is no question that the jury was informed that appellants had already recovered some money from Sites, and that the Boones were not satisfied with the amount of that recovery. The jury was also told that, as a result of that dissatisfaction, appellants brought an underinsurance claim against American, their own Insurer. On more than one occasion, the court attempted to explain the concept of underinsurance to the jury. Indeed, in its final jury instructions, the court twice told the jurors that appellants pursued their claim against American because of the alleged \u201cdeficit\u201d with regard to appellants\u2019 recovery from the tortfeasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Nevertheless, what the jury was not told was quite important to an accurate understanding of the matter. The jury was not told that the sum previously recovered by appellants from Sites would be deducted from the amount of any award of damages. The jury\u2019s ignorance as to that matter certainly could have affected its understanding of the value to appellants of any damages that it awarded. Given appellee\u2019s concession that the accident was a serious one, however, it seems unlikely that the jury realized that it was actually awarding nothing to appellants. Yet, that is the consequence of what occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">To be sure, the court and appellee\u2019s counsel told the jury to award just compensation to appellants. The jury was also told not to speculate about the sum already recovered from Sites by appellants. Nevertheless, looking at the case as a whole, the jury could well have thought that the damages it awarded were in addition to the unspecified sum already recovered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>appellants from Sites, and not subject to a reduction equal to the sum already recovered from the tortfeasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">We recognize that a countervailing argument could be made that the jury knew its award was not a mere supplement, and it understood it was to arrive at the amount of appellants\u2019 damages, as if no other recovery had been obtained. This argument carries some plausibility, because it would be difficult for a jury to determine the appropriate amount of a supplemental award without knowing what precise sum it was supplementing.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The uncertainty as to what the jury intended persuades us that the instructions were incomplete; the court did not clearly advise the jury to assess damages as if no other recovery had been obtained by the Boones. Instead, the jury may have been confused as to how it was to calculate damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Certainly, if the jury had never known of appellants\u2019 recovery from the tortfeasor, it would have awarded the total damages it believed appropriate, and the court then could have made any necessary deductions from the jury\u2019s award. Yet, because the jury knew of appellants\u2019 prior recovery from Sites, there is ambiguity with respect to the interpretation of the damages awarded by the jury. We cannot determine with assurance whether the sum awarded represented the jury\u2019s assessment of the total amount of damages, or instead, whether the verdict represented the jury\u2019s desire to supplement the \u201cdeficit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">The confusion underscores that it was incumbent upon the trial judge to fashion an instruction that made clear to the jury how it was to proceed in assessing damages. In this regard, what we said in <em>Green v. State, </em>119 Md.App. 547, 562, 705 A.2d 133 (1998), is apt. \u2018When the evidence generates an issue that is not covered by a pattern instruction, we must count on the court to incorporate relevant and valid legal principles gleaned from the case law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">In our view, the court could have considered several variations with respect to appellants\u2019 proposed Instruction 7B. \u25a0 For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>example, the court could have told the jury that it was to award the total amount of damages, if any, that it believed appellants were entitled to recover, as if the Insurer were the sole tortfeasor. Alternatively, the court could have made plain to the jury that it was to assume that no money was ever recovered by appellants from Sites, and then award appellants whatever sum, if any, the jury believed represented appellants\u2019 total damages. In other words, the court could have explained to the jury that, in making an award of damages, it was to disregard any other monetary recovery obtained by appellants, and make an award as if no other sum had been obtained by appellants. Or, the court could have informed the jury that its award of damages, if any, was not meant to serve as a supplement to the recovery obtained from Sites; therefore, the jury was to award the full and total amount the jury deemed appropriate. The court also could have told the jury that it would deduct from any damages awarded by the jury the amount that appellants already recovered from Sites, so as to prevent a double recovery by appellants. Alternatively, the court could have told the jury to make an award of the full and complete amount that it believed appellants were entitled to receive, without regard to any other sum appellants may already have collected, because the court would not permit a double recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">As a result of the court\u2019s failure to make clear to the jury how it was to proceed, the jury may have believed it was awarding appellants $15,864.48 as a supplement to whatever amount appellants had already recovered from Sites. Therefore, we shall vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">In light of our ruling, we need not address appellants\u2019 other contentions, as they are not likely to recur on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY REVERSED.
