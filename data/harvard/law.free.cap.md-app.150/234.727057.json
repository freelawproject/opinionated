In the adjudicatory hearing, Delric admitted to having committed a second degree assault on another juvenile.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">At the restitution hearing (held separately from both the adjudicatory and disposition hearings), appellant challenged, on hearsay and authentication grounds, the introduction of eleven exhibits, all of which were related to medical or dental services provided to the victim. The court admitted ten of the eleven exhibits on the basis that Title 5 of the Maryland Rules (i.e., the Maryland Rules of Evidence) is inapplicable in a parental/juvenile restitution hearing and, in the alternative, that strict application of the rules of evidence is not required in a juvenile restitution hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Appellant raises two questions for our review. We have rephrased the second question for simplicity, but have left appellant\u2019s first question intact.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-8\">1. Did the juvenile court err, at the restitution hearing, by admitting evidence that does not satisfy the requirements of Title 5 of the Maryland Rules?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-9\">2. Did the juvenile court abuse its discretion in ordering restitution?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">We answer both questions in the negative, and affirm the ruling of the juvenile court.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>FACTUAL and PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">On February 8, 2001, Delric H.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> committed a second degree assault on a fellow student. Delric \u201cchased the victim, punched him in his face, then picked up the victim and body slammed him.\u201d As a result, \u201c[t]he victim fell, face first on the sidewalk, injuring his mouth and nose ... chippfing] two teeth and one tooth was smashed.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">In due course, an appropriate petition was filed alleging Delric to be a delinquent child and, on July 6, 2001, the juvenile court held an adjudicatory hearing and a disposition hearing immediately thereafter. At this time, the court adjudicated Delric a delinquent child and placed him on supervised probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Several months later, on October 2, 2001, the court convened a restitution hearing. That hearing was recessed and then resumed and concluded on October 19, 2001. During the hearing, the State presented evidence, through the testimony of the minor victim\u2019s father, detailing the hospital visit on the day of the assault, and the charges for medical and dental care that resulted. According to the father\u2019s testimony, the victim was transported by ambulance to Montgomery County General Hospital. As a result of the assault, and the resulting facial and dental injuries, doctors and dentists removed four of the victim\u2019s teeth.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">The State sought to introduce eleven exhibits to prove that the medical and dental expenses were necessitated by the assault, and to establish the appropriate amount of restitution. The eleven exhibits included copies of bills for medical services and treatment and medication, all of which had been paid by the victim\u2019s father by check, credit card, or cash.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Counsel for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>Delric made a timely objection to admission of the bills on the grounds that all of the exhibits constituted hearsay, and further, that they were not properly authenticated business records as required by Md. Rules 5 \u2014 803(b)(6), 5-901, and 5-902.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Noting the objection, the juvenile court ruled that the Maryland Rules of Evidence do not apply in a restitution hearing, because Md. Rule 5-101(b)(9) excepts the application of the rules in a sentencing proceeding under Md. Rule 4-342. In reviewing Md. Rule 4 \u2014 342(j) (2001),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> titled \u201cRestitution from a parent!,]\u201d the court determined that the present restitution hearing fell within the purview of Rule 4-342; thus, he opined, the rules of evidence did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">As an alternative, citing Md. Rules 5-101(b)(12) and 5-101(c)(8), the court declined to apply strict rules of evidence, finding that prior to adoption of the Maryland Rules of Evidence, common law rules of evidence had not applied to restitution hearings. The juvenile court judge stated, \u201cI am going to decline to apply strict rules of evidence to these proceedings ... at least in so far as these bills go.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Despite finding the rules of evidence inapplicable, or otherwise relaxed, the court reviewed each of the eleven exhibits under a \u201cgeneral reliability requirement,\u201d to determine if they passed \u201csome kind of minimal, entry level smell test.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>his review, the court \u201cfound them all to pass muster, except number nine.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, State\u2019s Exhibits 1 through 8,10, and 11 were admitted into evidence. The ten bills totaled $6,693.89.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">STANDARD of REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Given the two questions presented by appellant, we face two different standards of review. In reviewing whether the court properly determined that the Maryland Rules of Evidence do not apply, or are otherwise relaxed, in a restitution hearing, we must determine if the court\u2019s legal conclusions were legally correct. <em>Gregg Neck Yacht Club, Inc. v. County Commr\u2019s of Kent County, </em>137 Md.App. 732, 752, 769 A.2d 982 (2001) (citations omitted). Then, we shall review the trial court\u2019s order, requiring Delric and his mother to pay restitution, under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>In re Lome S., </em>123 Md.App. 672, 680, 720 A.2d 920 (1998) (citing <em>In re Don Me., </em>344 Md. 194, 200-01, 686 A.2d 269 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">\n<em>1. Did the juvenile court err at the restitution hearing, by admitting evidence that does not satisfy the requirements of Title 5 of the Maryland Rules?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">Whether the Maryland Rules of Evidence (Md. Rule 5-101 <em>et </em>seq.) apply in a parental/juvenile restitution hearing is, we conclude, a question of first impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-11\">Here, as we have noted, the juvenile court ruled that Md. Rule 5-101(b)(9) excepts the rules of evidence from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>application in a sentencing proceeding under Md. Rule 4-342, and that the present case was a restitution hearing under Rule 4- 342(j). Although we agree with the juvenile court\u2019s ultimate result, we disagree with the conclusion as to the applicability of Md. Rule 4-342(j), because that rule applies to restitution hearings in criminal proceedings, but not in juvenile delinquency proceedings.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That interpretation was made clear in <em>In re Victor B., </em>336 Md. 85, 646 A.2d 1012 (1994), wherein the Court of Appeals said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-5\">We find that neither the Maryland Rules nor the Juvenile Causes Act provides for the application of the criminal rules of Title 4 to juvenile proceedings. Furthermore, we find no implied incorporation of the criminal rules into the juvenile rules.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-6\">We hold that title 4 of the Maryland Rules, which governs procedure in criminal cases, is not applicable to juvenile proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 96, 646 A.2d 1012; <em>cf. In re John M., </em>129 Md.App. 165, 189, 741 A.2d 503 (1999) (\u201cAlthough juvenile proceedings are civil in nature, they are governed by the rules of procedure contained in Chapter 11 of the Maryland Rules.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">As an alternative ground, citing Md. Rules 5-101(b)(12) and 5- 101(c)(8), the court declined to strictly apply rules of evidence, based on its conclusion that common law rules of evidence had not applied to restitution hearings prior to the adoption of the Maryland Rules of Evidence. We note that an oft-accepted practice was to waive or relax evidentiary rules in restitution hearings befoie (and after) the formal adoption of Title 5 of the Maryland Rules on July 1, 1994. Nonetheless, we hesitate to conclude that restitution courts were never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>bound by the laws of evidence prior to the adoption of the Maryland Rules. Our language in <em>In re Appeal No. 769, 25 </em>Md.App. 565, 335 A.2d 204 (1975), suggests that, at least at one time, rules of evidence did apply in restitution hearings. <em>Id. </em>at 571, 335 A.2d 204 (\u201cThe rules of evidence applicable to civil cases shall apply at [parental restitution] hearings. Rule 912, \u00a7 c.\u201d);<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>see also In re Johnson, </em>254 Md. 517, 524, 255 A.2d 419 (1969)(\u201cWhile [juvenile] proceedings are informal, \u00a7 60, the rules of practice, of procedure, of evidence, and standards of fairness must be observed.\u201d) (citations omitted), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>403 U.S. 926, 91 S.Ct. 2257, 29 L.Ed.2d 706 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">In Maryland, a \u201ccourt may enter a judgment of restitution against the parent of a child, the child, or both as provided under Article 27, \u00a7 807 of the Code.\u201d Md.Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-829 (Repl.Vol.1998).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Article 27 \u00a7 807(a)(1), in turn, outlines the factors that a court will review in determining whether to require the juvenile or parent to pay restitution to a victim. Md. Ann.Code art. 27, \u00a7 8-207 (Repl.Vol.1996 &amp; Supp.2000).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We draw special attention to the fact that a \u00a7 807 parental/juvenile restitution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>hearing \u201cmay be held as part of the sentencing or disposition hearing.\u201d Md. Ann.Code art. 27, \u00a7 807(a)(3)(iii).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Notably, pursuant to Md. Rule 5 \u2014 101(c)(6), a court may decline to require strict application of the rules in \u201c[Juvenile] Disposition hearings under Rule 11 115.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">We believe it logical to conclude from relevant provisions of the Maryland Code and Maryland Rules that a strict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>application of the rules is not necessary when a restitution hearing is held in conjunction with a disposition (or sentencing) hearing.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> O\u00fcr reasoning is further supported by Md. Rule 11-118 (\u201cJuvenile Causes\u201d), which states that a restitution hearing \u201cmay be conducted contemporaneously with a disposition hearing, if appropriate.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We further conclude that, regardless of whether the restitution hearing is held contemporaneously with a disposition hearing, a court may \u201cdecline to require strict application\u201d of Title 5 of the Maryland Rules, to a parental/juvenile restitution hearing.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> To interpret the applicability of the rules of evidence in a restitution hearing based solely on whether that hearing is held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>contemporaneously with, or separately from, a disposition hearing would be illogical and inconsistent.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">In 1975, the Maryland General Assembly enacted the Juvenile Causes Act (House Bill 483). 1975 Md. Laws 554. The new Act, among other things, amended the section dealing with adjudicatory hearings, and consolidated language dealing with a parent\u2019s liability from Title 3 Subtitle 8 of the Courts Article and separate statutory law for Montgomery County (Title 4 Subtitle 5 of the Courts Article).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Alan M. Wilner, <em>Summary and Explanation of Proposed Juvenile Code, </em>Senate Judicial Proceedings, S.B. 291 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">In response to the legislative change, the Court of Appeals, based upon a recommendation of the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure (\u201cthe Rules Committee\u201d), amended Chapter 900 of the Maryland Rules. <em>See </em>FORTY NINTH REPORT OF THE STANDING COMMITTEE ON RULES OF PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE (1975). As such, the 1975 version of Md. Rule 914 \u201cAdjudicatory Hearing,\u201d no longer included language regarding the applicability of the rules of evidence. Also of note, the 1975 version of Md. Rule 919, titled \u201cParents\u2019 Liability \u2014 Hearing\u2014Recording and Effect,\u201d like the current version of Md. Rule 11-118, provided that such a hearing could be \u201cconducted as part of a hearing under Rule 915 (Disposition Hearing).\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>Appellant argues that <em>In re Appeal No. 769, supra, </em>25 Md.App. 565, 335 A.2d 204, stands for the proposition that the Maryland Rules of Evidence apply in a parental/juvenile restitution hearing. Although we did state, in <em>dicta, </em>that the \u201crules of evidence applicable to civil cases shall apply at such hearings,\u201d our finding was based on then Md. Rule 912(c) (1974), titled \u201cThe Adjudicatory Hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 571, 335 A.2d 204. The 1974 version of Md. Rule 912(c)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak1\">The rules of evidence applicable to criminal cases shall apply to delinquency hearings. The rules of evidence applicable to civil cases shall apply to all other hearings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Md. Rule 912(c), however, no longer exists and its language has not survived. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 11-101 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">As a result of the amendment to Chapter 900 of the Maryland Rules, there is no present counterpart to former Rule 912(c), nor has there been since the passage of the Juvenile Causes Act in 1975. Thus, the rationale supporting our .finding in <em>In re Appeal No. 769 </em>is no longer supportable, and appellant\u2019s argument is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Additionally, we believe that the universally rejected application of the adversarial system to juvenile proceedings lends support to our conclusion that strict application of the rules of evidence is not required. Writing for the Court of Appeals in <em>In re Victor B., supra, </em>336 Md. 85, 646 A.2d 1012, Judge Raker set out a concise and accurate history of the development of the juvenile justice system in the United States, with particular reference to the Maryland Juvenile Causes Act. <em>Id. </em>at 90-94, 646 A.2d 1012. \u201c[T]he Juvenile Causes Act gives clear indication that juvenile proceedings- are not criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>matters and that they retain their \u2018special and informal nature.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 92, 646 A.2d 1012 (citations omitted). Consistent with this view is the fact that \u201call hearings\u201d under the Juvenile Causes Subtitle are to be conducted in an informal manner. Md.Code, Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3 \u2014 812(f)(1) (Repl.Vol. 1998 &amp; Supp.2000) (now found at \u00a7 3-8A-13(f)(l)).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Applying the same rationale, we fail to see the merit in waiving strict application of the rules of evidence in a criminal restitution proceeding under Md. Rule 4 \u2014 342(j) (2001) <em>(see </em>Md. Rule 5-101(b)(9)), but requiring strict application in a juvenile restitution proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Moreover, our decision is consistent with other states that have addressed whether evidentiary rules apply in restitution proceedings. Many states, including Alabama, Indiana, Kansas, New Mexico, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin, either completely dispense with, or relax, the rules of evidence in restitution hearings, often because the restitution hearing is held in conjunction with a sentencing or disposition hearing.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>Wisconsin restitution statute, for example, is similar in scope to Maryland law, but it also allows the court to \u201cwaive the rules of practice, procedure, pleading or evidence ...\u201d in order to \u201cdo substantial justice between the parties.... \u201d <em>See </em>Wis. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 973.20 (2001); <em>State v. Madlock, </em>230 Wis.2d 324, 602 N.W.2d 104, 110 (CT.App.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">We are not concerned that our ruling will open the \u201cflood gates\u201d to a victim who would seek to introduce speculative or unsubstantiated evidence in support of an attempt to recover restitution to which there is no entitlement. First, our holding leaves the application or relaxation of the rules of evidence to the discretion of the trial judge. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 5-101(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Second, and more notably, a statutory safeguard is found in Article 27, \u00a7 807(a)(1)(h) (now Crim. Proc. \u00a7 ll-603(a)(2)), which requires a direct causal connection between a juvenile\u2019s delinquent act and the actual expenses suffered by the victim as a condition to an award of restitution. <em>See In re Levon A., </em>361 Md. 626, 639-41, 762 A.2d 572 (2000). Accordingly, the juvenile court judge or master must serve as a gatekeeper to ensure that each item of evidence presented shows that as a \u201cdirect result\u201d of the delinquent\u2019s acts, the victim incurred \u201cactual medical, dental, hospital, counseling, funeral, burial expenses, any other direct out-of-pocket losses or loss of earnings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">Our review of the record before us reveals that the juvenile court did exactly what is required by statute, ruling that the State bore \u201cthe burden of proving necessary elements of ... [art. 27, \u00a7 ] 807\u201d and that the exhibits had to \u201cpass some muster, in terms of reliability, in connection with the event.\u201d Indeed, after the trial court conducted a thorough analysis of each of the State\u2019s eleven exhibits, the judge ultimately found that Exhibit 9 was not sufficiently reliable without other corroborating evidence. Therefore, even though a court may decline to require a strict application of evidentia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>ry rules, there still exists an inherent reliability/credibility requirement which a proponent of the offered evidence must satisfy.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">We hold that a juvenile court has the discretion, in the interest of justice, to decline the strict application of the Maryland Rules of Evidence (\u00a7 5-101 <em>et seq.) </em>in a restitution hearing.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Accordingly, we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">\n<em>2. Did the juvenile court abuse its discretion in ordering restitution?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">In Maryland, juvenile courts have \u201cbroad discretion to order restitution, either against the juvenile himself, a parent, or both.\u201d <em>In re John M., supra, </em>129 Md.App. at 174, 741 A.2d 503 (citing <em>In re Don MC., supra, </em>344 Md. at 201, 686 A.2d 269). Restitution under art. 27, \u00a7 807 serves several objectives, including: (1) rehabilitation of the defendant; (2) compensation of the victim; and (3) penalizing the transgressor. <em>See id.</em><footnotemark><em>23</em></footnotemark><em> </em>One purpose is to \u201ccompensate victims who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>have been injured or who have suffered property loss as a result of the wrongful acts of a minor....\u201d <em>Id.; see also In re Zephrin D. </em>69 Md.App. 755, 761, 519 A.2d 806 (1987). \u201cRestitution \u2018can \u201cimpress upon the [juvenile] the gravity of harm he has inflicted upon another[,]\u201d[] and \u201cprovide an opportunity for him. to make amends.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>In re Levon A., </em>124 Md.App. 103, 132, 720 A.2d 1232 (1998) (in turn quoting <em>In re Herbert B., </em>303 Md. 419, 427, 494 A.2d 680 (1985)), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>361 Md. 626, 762 A.2d 572 (2000)). As such, compensation of the victim is an important factor to consider in the overall goal of rehabilitating the juvenile respondent. <em>See In re Don Mc., supra, </em>344 Md. at 203, 686 A.2d 269. Restitution \u201cis also penal in nature since liability arises \u2018as a consequence of a presumed neglect of parental responsibilities.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Zephrin D., supra, </em>69 Md.App. at 761, 519 A.2d 806 (quoting <em>In re Appeal No. 321, </em>24 Md.App. 82, 85, 329 A.2d 113 (1974)).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">As we have discussed, a court may order restitution if the \u201cvictim suffered actual medical, dental, hospital, counsel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>ing, funeral, burial expenses, any other direct out-of-pocket losses, or loss of earnings as a direct result of the crime.\u201d Md. Ann.Code art. 27, \u00a7 807(a)(1)(ii) (Repl.Yol.1996 &amp; Supp. 2000). A court may not order restitution, however, if \u201cthe defendant or liable parent does not have the ability to pay the judgment or restitution ...\u201d or if there exists \u201c[g]ood cause to establish extenuating circumstances as to why a judgment of restitution is inappropriate in a case.\u201d Md. Ann.Code art. 27, \u00a7 807(a)(4) (now Crim. Proc. \u00a7 ll-605(a) (2001)).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Therefore, a juvenile court must conduct a \u201creasoned inquiry\u201d into the respondent\u2019s and parents\u2019 ability to pay. <em>In re Don Mc., supra, </em>344 Md. at 203, 686 A.2d 269; <em>In re Levon A., supra, </em>124 Md.App. at 145, 720 A.2d 1232.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">At the restitution hearing, Delric\u2019s counsel argued that neither Delric nor his mother could afford to pay any restitution. Given that Delric was, at the time, only twelve years old, and without income or resources, counsel argued that a court order requiring Delric to pay would frustrate the rehabilitative purpose of restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Delric\u2019s mother testified that she was a single parent of four sons (ages 15, 12, 9, and 7) and that Delric\u2019s father does not pay the $124 per month court-ordered child support, and is approximately $5,000 in arrears.

He further found that Delric will be capable of earning money in a few years. The court ordered Delric and his mother to pay, jointly and severally, $6,693.89 in monthly installments of $50.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">The juvenile court concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>\u00cd think that there is a present ability, on the part of Ms. B[] to uh, pay reasonable restitution in this case.

And, would, would be unjust and everything else.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-5\">But, uh, as [the ASSISTANT STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY] quite right points out, this is not a woman who is without the means, or ability to earn a living, and is in fact, doing so, with very modest uh, expenses, at this time. She is not disabled, or in any way rendered incapable of, of earning a living. And she has a son, who, in a few years, will also be capable of earning money, to contribute toward this restitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-6\">Again, everything keying on the reasonableness of the payment program, that is established. And, I think that the numbers suggested by the state are probably a little high, and I\u2019m to come in with a very low ball figure that, would amount to about a dollar seventy ($1.70) a day. Okay, I don\u2019t think that that figure is going to break the back of this family, and I don\u2019t intend for it to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-7\">I understand that it\u2019s going to take a long time for it to be paid off, but uh, again, it\u2019s not the victim\u2019s fault, and certainly, whatever the hierarchy of the purposes of restitution, making the victim, in this case, completely whole, because it\u2019s within the ten thousand dollar ($10,000.00) cap, is certainly within that. And, uh, this is again, a family whose son did nothing to put himself in the way of running up these very high dental bills.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-8\">\u2019 So, I am going to order judgement [sic], joint and several between Delric and his mother, in the amount of six thousand, six hundred and ninety-three dollars and eighty-nine cents ($6,693.89), payable at the rate of fifty dollars ($50.00) a month.

Instead, Delric argues that neither he nor his mother have the ability to pay, relying on <em>In re Levon </em>A, <em>supra, </em>124 Md.App. 103, 720 A.2d 1232 <em>(rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>361 Md. 626, 762 A.2d 572 (2000)) to support his argument that the juvenile court abused its discretion. In that case, however, we found that the court had conducted a \u201creasoned inquiry,\u201d and found no abuse of discretion. Among other factors, the court considered the juvenile\u2019s age and circumstances, that the juvenile would soon be old enough to get a job, and that the juvenile would have a reasonable time to pay the damages. <em>Id. </em>at 144, 720 A.2d 1232.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The facts of the case before us are not dissimilar to those in <em>In re Levon A. </em>Here, as in <em>In re Levon </em>A, the juvenile court judge found that Delric would, before too long, be capable of earning money on a steady basis.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> <em>Id.; see also In re Don Me, supra, </em>344 Md. at 203, 686 A.2d 269 (the restitution court abused its discretion because it \u201cdid not consider the age or circumstances of the child, or the ability of the child or the child\u2019s parent to pay the restitution____\u201d). Instead of a lump sum payment, the court extended the restitution, so that Delric and his mother, jointly and severally, could amortize the obligation at the rate of $50 per month; a rate the court pointed out \u201cwould amount to about a dollar seventy ($1.70) a day.\u201d Moreover, here, unlike in <em>In re Levon </em>A, the court found a present ability of Delric\u2019s mother to pay restitution. She is not \u201cwithout the means, or ability to earn a living, and is in fact, doing so, with very modest uh, expenses, at this time.\u201d As such, the amount owed by Delric on a monthly basis, assuming payment of one-half of the ordered monthly payment, would be $25 (approximately $0.85 per day); that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>an amount of restitution this Court found reasonable in <em>In re Levon A Id. </em>at 145, 720 A.2d 1232.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Our review of the record convinces us that the juvenile court conducted a \u201creasoned inquiry\u201d into the ability to pay.
