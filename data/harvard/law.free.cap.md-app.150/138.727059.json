Is there substantial evidence in the record to support appellant\u2019s decision to discipline Ms. Spencer for practicing pharmacy after her license had expired and for failing to retain documentation of continuing education credits required for license renewal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-12\">II. By renewing appellee\u2019s license prior to completing its investigatory and disciplinary process regarding her alleged violations of the Pharmacy Act occurring prior to renewal, did the Board waive its right to discipline her for those violations?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-13\">III. In the absence of any showing of actual bias by appellant\u2019s members against appellee, did arguments at the hearing between her attorney and two of appellant\u2019s members regarding the attorney\u2019s statements during the hearing deprive her of due process.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>We hold that appellant did not waive its right, as a matter of law, to discipline appellee for violations of the Pharmacy Act by renewing her license during the pendency of its investigation of possible wrongdoing. We also hold that appellant deprived \u00e1ppellee of her right to be treated in a fair and unbiased manner as required by the Administrative Procedure Act and the Maryland Constitution; and, therefore, the case must be remanded in order that appellee may receive a fair hearing of the disputed charges against her. Finally, in light of our answer to the last question, we refrain from addressing whether the record contains substantial evidence to support appellant\u2019s decision to discipline appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">On July 1, 1999, appellee\u2019s pharmacist license expired. She continued to practice pharmacy without a license until August 16, 1999. On August 30, 1999, appellee submitted a renewal application to appellant, along with documentation that she had completed the continuing education requirements. On September 14, 1999, appellant issued a renewal license to appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Appellant issued charges against appellee on February 16, 2000, alleging that she had practiced pharmacy without a license for a period of six weeks and that she had failed to maintain records of required continuing education credits. Appellant scheduled a case resolution conference (CRC) to attempt to resolve the matter without the necessity of a hearing. Mr. Stanton Ades and Ms. Laura Schneider, two members of the Board, represented appellant at the CRC. The settlement negotiations were unsuccessful. Both Mr. Ades and Ms. Schneider sat on the panel of Board members who eventually heard this contested case. On many occasions, beginning in July, 2000, appellee sent letters to counsel for appellant, seeking to have the matter referred to the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH). Appellee believed appellant incapable of giving her a fair and impartial hearing because appellant had been intimately involved in settlement negotiations with appellee and may have prejudged the case. Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>lant repeatedly denied appellee\u2019s requests to move the case to OAH, stating that appellant\u2019s knowledge of settlement negotiations did not disqualify it from hearing evidence. In further justification for refusing to move the case, appellant stated that appellee \u201cfailed to assign any specific facts indicating the Board would not be an impartial arbiter,\u201d and also noted that the Board \u201cha[d] never delegated a matter to the Office of Administrative Hearings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Finally, on August 14, 2000, appellee filed a motion to refer the case to the Office of Administrative Hearings or, in the alternative, to recuse members of the Board. Appellant denied that motion on September 15, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Appellant held a hearing on the matter on September 20, 2000, and resumed the hearing on January 8, 2001. Counsel for appellant had given books containing exhibits to the members of the Board on the morning of the hearing. When counsel for appellee arrived for the hearing, he noticed that at least one member of the Board was reviewing evidence before the start of the hearing. Counsel for appellee complained about the member reviewing documents that were not in evidence, and asked that member to recuse himself. This request was denied. He then renewed the motion to move the case to OAH and appellant denied that motion also. Finally, counsel for appellee asked that the two members who were involved in settlement negotiations recuse themselves, and that request was also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Appellee did not dispute that she had practiced pharmacy without a license for a period of six weeks. Her counsel argued, however, that her practice of pharmacy without a license was authorized under Md.Code (1984, 1999 RephVol.), \u00a7 10-226(b) of the State Government Article,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> because she had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>submitted a timely renewal application. Appellee did not present any evidence, other than her testimony, that she had filed a renewal application prior to the expiration of her license on July 1,1999. Appellant\u2019s records did not reveal any application, check, or money order from appellee prior to July 1, 1999. Appellant determined that appellee\u2019s testimony on the matter lacked credibility and found that she had not filed a timely renewal application.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">During the hearing, counsel for appellee accused members of the Board of prejudging the case, of sleeping during the hearing, and of not paying attention to testimony. After the accusation about sleeping, the hearing deteriorated to the point where several members of the Board engaged in a heated conversation with counsel for appellee involving demands for apologies and chastisements about finger pointing from counsel and members of the Board.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Finally, one of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>Board members asked counsel for appellee to leave the room, but he remained and continued arguing. Eventually, counsel was asked if he would act appropriately, and he said he would, so the hearing continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">Later, counsel for appellee objected to the entry of a mail log, and argued that it \u201cdoes not go to [appellee\u2019s] credibility.\u201d Ms. Hawkins, one of the Board members, stated \u201csure it does.\u201d When counsel then said to the Board, \u201cMs. Hawkins already said out loud it went to credibility,\u201d Ms. Hawkins denied saying it and then added, \u201cI did not [say that], and you\u2019re a bold-faced liar.\u201d Counsel for appellee objected to being called a liar during the proceeding and attempted to have Ms. Hawkins removed from hearing the case, but that request was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">On February 21, 2001, appellant issued its Final Decision and Order, finding that appellee had violated Md.Code (1981, 2000 RepLVoL), \u00a7\u00a7 12-301, 12-701, 12-707(e), and 12-313(b)(24) of the Health Occupations Article.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>placed appellee on probation, imposed a fine, and reprimanded her.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Appellee filed a Petition for Judicial Review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City on March 21, 2001. On August 28, 2001, the court held a hearing on the Petition for Judicial Review and on August 31, 2001, entered its Order, reversing the decision of appellant and vacating appellant\u2019s Final Decision and Order. The court\u2019s reasons for reversing and vacating appellant\u2019s decision are located in the oral opinion of the court. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-5\">Let me come to the issue that is of real concern to this Court. .It is that the trier of fact, the Board if you will, must maintain an appearance that is fair and just. And that under the circumstances to let all persons know that the hearing before it will be fairly reviewed and interpreted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-6\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-7\">What is clear [is that] there was unnecessary, inappropriate accusations going on within the hearing. It is true, in review of the ease itself, is [sic] that the court needs only to determine whether there was substantial evidence of a, [sic] from the record on the whole to support the decision. But that is really only half of the concern.... [T]he other is whether or not ... there was a violation of due process and the law in which the determination was made. If we go to the latter discussion then on[e] would say how the evidence was determined is effected by how the law is respected during the course of the hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-8\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-9\">This court\u2019s interpretation of the record is ... that the Board\u2019s actions and reactions individually ... raises serious questions as to whether or not it was effected [sic] in its determination in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">In addition, the circuit court judge determined that the record lacked substantial evidence to support appellant\u2019s find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>ings and thus reversed the Board. Appellant timely noted this appeal on September 27, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">The final decision of an administrative agency in a contested case is subject to review under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), Md.Code Ann., State Gov. Art. \u00a7 10-222. Section 10-222(h) provides that the reviewing court may:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-7\">(1) remand the case for further proceedings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-8\">(2) affirm the final decision; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-9\">(3) reverse or modify the decision if any substantial right of the petitioner may have been prejudiced because a finding, conclusion, or decision:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-10\">(i) is unconstitutional;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-11\">(ii) exceeds the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the final decision maker;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-12\">(iii) results from an unlawful procedure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-13\">(iv) is affected by any other error of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-14\">(v) is unsupported by competent, material, and substantial evidence in light of the entire record as submitted; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-15\">(vi) is arbitrary or capricious.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-16\">As this Court noted in <em>Montgomery County Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Services v. P.F., </em>137 Md.App. 243, 264-65, 768 A.2d 112 (2001):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-17\">Appeals from the [ALJ] to the circuit court, and from the circuit court to the appellate courts, are governed by the same standards of review____ The test for determining whether the ... findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence is whether reasoning minds could reach the same conclusion from the facts relied upon by the [agency].... When an agency\u2019s decision is based on an erroneous legal conclusion, however, we will substitute our own judgment for that of the agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-20\">(Internal citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b169-21\">It is well settled that a reviewing court may not substitute its judgment for that of the administrative agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>or make its own findings of fact when reviewing the decision of an ALJ. <em>Charlotte Marsheck v. Board of Trustees of the Fire &amp; Police Employees\u2019 Ret. System of the City of Baltimore, </em>358 Md. 393, 402, 749 A.2d 774 (2000). Where an agency\u2019s decision is based on an erroneous conclusion of law, however, this deference does not apply. <em>Mayor of Ocean City v. Purnell-Jarvis, Ltd., </em>86 Md.App. 390, 402, 586 A.2d 816 (1991)(citing <em>Supervisor of Assessments of Montgomery County v. Asbury Methodist Home, </em>313 Md. 614, 547 A.2d 190 (1988)). In such a case, we \u201cmust substitute [our] judgment for that of the agency if our interpretation of the applicable legal principles is different.\u201d <em>Perini Services, Inc. v. Maryland Health Resources Planning Comm\u2019n., </em>67 Md.App. 189, 201, 506 A.2d 1207 (1986)(citing <em>Ramsay, Scarlett &amp; Co., Inc. v. Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>302 Md. 825, 490 A.2d 1296 (1985)). A reviewing court can and should review whether an agency has acted within its statutory powers or has otherwise made an error of law. <em>Brzowski v. Maryland Home Imp. Comm\u2019n, </em>114 Md.App. 615, 691 A.2d 699 (1997), cert. denied, 346 Md. 238, 695 A.2d 1227 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">As a preliminary matter, we hold that appellant did not waive its right to discipline appellee by renewing her license to practice pharmacy during the pendency of its investigation of her. Appellee places great emphasis on the relationship between section 10-226(b)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the State Government Article and section 12-310(a) of the Health Occupations Article.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We interpret the code sections to require the Board to issue a license to a person who meets the stated requirements and that the license does not expire if a. timely renewal application has been filed. Those sections do not, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>deprive the Board of the power to sanction appellee if it finds, after a fair hearing, that she did not file a timely renewal application and that, therefore, she practiced pharmacy for a period of time without a license. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1981, 2000 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 12-701, 12-707(e)(l), and 12-313(b)(24) of the Health Occupations Article.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The fact that the Board chose to renew a license upon receipt of an untimely renewal application does not deprive the Board of the authority to sanction for prior violations of the applicable statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">With regard to appellee\u2019s due process concerns, we note that Section 10-201 of the State Government Article states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-5\">The purpose of this subtitle is to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-6\">(1) ensure the right of all persons to be treated in a fair and unbiased manner in their efforts to resolve disputes in administrative proceedings governed by this subtitle; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-7\">(2) promote prompt, effective, and efficient government.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">In addition, Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of 'Rights states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-9\">That no man ought to be taken or imprisoned or disseized of his freehold, liberties or privileges, or outlawed, or exiled, or, in any manner, destroyed, or deprived of his life, liberty or property, but by the judgment of his peers, or by the law of the land.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">Procedural due process guaranteed to persons in this State by Article 24 requires \u201cthat administrative agencies performing adjudicatory or quasi-judicial functions observe the basic principles of fairness as to parties appearing before them.\u201d <em>Maryland State Police v. Zeigler, </em>330 Md. 540, 559, 625 A.2d 914 (1993). This doctrine of fairness is \u201c \u2018specifically applicable\u2019 to issues of disqualification, although \u2018disqualification will not be permitted to destroy the only tribunal with power in the premises.\u2019 \u201d <em>Regan v. Chiropractic Examiners, </em>355 Md. 397, 408-09, 735 A.2d 991 (1999)(quoting <em>Board of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number><em>Medical Examiners v. Steward, </em>203 Md. 574, 582, 102 A.2d 248 (1954)).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">As previously mentioned, two of the members of the Board that heard this case also participated in settlement discussions with appellee before the hearing. The record in this case reflects that appellant considered those settlement negotiations and perhaps relied on their knowledge of those negotiations in rendering the Final Decision and Order.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In our view it was unnecessary to note in the Final Decision and Order that \u201c[ajlthough Respondent agreed to a proposal at the conference, she later rejected it,\u201d unless the Board considered that fact in their deliberations. More significantly, appellant denied appellee\u2019s right to be treated in a fair and unbiased manner when a member of the Board displayed blatant hostility toward appellee\u2019s counsel during the hearing, causing an appearance of impropriety.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Unfortunately, the actions and statements of some of the members who presided over the hearings held on September 20, 2000, and January 8, 2001, lead this Court to conclude that appellee was denied a fair and unbiased resolution of her dispute with appellant, in violation of section 10-201 of the State Government Article and Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>Because the decision of appellant was unconstitutional and resulted from an unlawful procedure, this Court will affirm, in part; vacate, in part; and remand the case for further proceedings.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Md.Code (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 10-222(h)(3)(i) and 10-222(h)(3)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">There are no definitions in the Administrative Procedure Act for the relevant terms (fair, unbiased, unlawful procedure) found in sections 10-201 and 10-222(h). <em>See </em>Md.Code (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-202 of the State Government Article. Appropriate analogies can be drawn, however, from the Maryland Rules and case law. <em>See Regan v. Chiropractic Examiners, </em>355 Md. 397 at 410, 735 A.2d 991 (1999) (noting in a case involving the Maryland Board of Chiropractic Examiners that \u201cthe \u2018appearance of impropriety\u2019 standard set forth in our cases involving judges and some others is applicable generally to the participation of members of Maryland administrative agencies performing quasi-judicial or adjudicatory functions\u201d).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ana\">Md. Rule 16-813, Canon 3(C), provides in pertinent part: RECUSAL. (1) A judge should not participate in a proceeding in which the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned, including but not limited to instances where: (a) the judge has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party, or personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceeding; ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Courts have recognized that there is a strong presumption that judges are impartial and will refrain from presiding over a matter when appropriate. <em>Jefferson-El v. State, </em>330 Md. 99, 107, 622 A.2d 737 (1993); <em>Boyd v. State, </em>321 Md. 69, 74, 80, 581 A.2d 1 (1990); <em>Doering v. Fader, </em>316 Md. 351, 360, 558 A.2d 733 (1989); <em>Reed v. Baltimore Life Ins. Co., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>127 Md.App. 536, 553, 556, 733 A.2d 1106 (1999). This presumption can be overcome, however, if the aggrieved party proves the existence of actual bias. <em>Jefferson-El, </em>330 Md. at 107, 622 A.2d 737. In other words, the party requesting recusal must show that the trial judge has a personal bias concerning the motioning party, or personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceeding. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">In addition, the presumption of impartiality of judges can be overcome if the motioning party can show the existence of an appearance of impropriety. <em>Boyd, </em>321 Md. at 85-86, 581 A.2d 1. The Court of Appeals has recognized that it is essential that the judicial process not only operate fairly and but also appear to operate fairly. <em>Id. See also Jefferson-El, </em>330 Md. at 107, 622 A.2d 737. Consequently, courts have determined that recusal is mandated when a trial judge reasonably appears to hold a bias or prejudice against the moving party. <em>Boyd, </em>321 Md. at 85-86, 581 A.2d 1; <em>see also Jefferson-El, </em>330 Md. at 107, 622 A.2d 737; <em>Reed, </em>127 Md.App. at 554, 733 A.2d 1106; <em>Goldberger, </em>96 Md.App. at 321, 624 A.2d 1328.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-5\">[T]he test to be applied is an objective one which assumes that a reasonable person knows and understands all the relevant facts.... Like all legal issues, judges determine appearance of impropriety \u2014 not by what a straw poll of the only partly informed man-in-the-street would show \u2014 but by examining the record facts and the law, and then deciding whether a reasonable person knowing and understanding all the relevant facts would recuse the judge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-6\"><em>Boyd, </em>321 Md. at 86, 581 A.2d 1 (quoting <em>In re Drexel Burnham Lambert, Inc., </em>861 F.2d 1307, 1313 (2nd Cir.1988)); <em>see also Surratt v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>320 Md. 439, 465, 578 A.2d 745 (1990) (stating the standard as \u201cwhether a reasonable member of the public knowing all the circumstances would be led to the conclusion that the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">As previously stated, two of the Board members hearing the case had personal knowledge of disputed eviden<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>tiary facts concerning the proceeding because they had intimately participated in settlement negotiations with appellee. In and of itself, the participation by a Board member in both the settlement negotiations and the following hearing, does not pose a problem. <em>See Regan, 355 </em>Md. at 412, 735 A.2d 991 (noting that \u201cadministrative decision makers do not automatically become biased merely because they have become familiar with the facts of a proceeding through the performance of their administrative duties\u201d). The record in this case, however, reflects that appellant considered those settlement negotiations in rendering its Final Decision and Order. In addition, the fact that the tribunal was reviewing documents provided by one party, prior to their introduction as evidence during the hearing, disturbs this Court. The consideration of settlement negotiations and the review of documents not in evidence both contributed to the appearance of impropriety in this case. More disturbing than either of these problems, however, is the behavior of Ms. Hawkins during the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">It does appear to this Court that counsel for appellee crossed the line from zealous advocacy to inappropriate and uncivil behavior at times during the course of the hearing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> At the point of the conversation with Ms. Hawkins, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>counsel was engaged in appropriate advocacy and cannot be charged fairly with goading her into calling him a liar. He objected to the admission of a document and noted that it \u201cdid not go\u201d to his client\u2019s credibility. In response, Ms. Hawkins said, \u201csure it does,\u201d indicating that she believed it was relevant to credibility. Counsel later noted in argument that Ms. Hawkins said the document went to credibility. She then denied saying that and called him a liar.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Ms. Hawkins created an unacceptable appearance of impropriety by calling counsel a bold-faced liar during the course of the hearing.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>In the instant case, a reasonable member of the public knowing all the relevant facts would conclude that appellant\u2019s impartiality was questionable. The hearing started out poorly when appellee\u2019s counsel arrived and \u201ccaught\u201d the members of the Board reviewing documents not in evidence before the hearing started. In addition, it was inappropriate for the Board to consider anything it learned during the unsuccessful settlement negotiations, when issuing its Pinal Opinion and Order. Of much more concern to this Court, however, is the statement by Ms. Hawkins to appellee\u2019s counsel. Once the hearing deteriorated to the point where a member of the reviewing tribunal called the attorney for appellee a \u201cbold faced liar,\u201d the appearance of impartiality and fairness of the whole proceeding vanished.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">In light of the actions by the Board that caused an appearance of impropriety in the proceedings in this case before the Board, this Court holds that the circuit court did not err by finding that appellee was denied due process in that hearing. Consequently, we remand this case to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City with instructions to remand the case to the Board, directing appellant to delegate the authority to conduct the contested case hearing and to issue the final administrative decision in this case to the OAH.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>JUDGMENT AFFIRMED IN PART, AND VACATED IN PART.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO REMAND TO THE MARYLAND STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.

However, with regard to the circuit court\u2019s determination that the record lacked substantial evidence to support appellant\u2019s substantive conclusions, we vacate. That decision should not be made until appellee has been afforded a fair hearing. Once appellee is granted a fair hearing before an unbiased tribunal, the evidence presented at that time may or may not support appellant\u2019s substantive position.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b175-6\">.

A lawyer should treat all persons with courtesy and respect, and at all times abstain from rude, disruptive, and disrespectful behavior ... A lawyer should speak and write civilly in all communications with the court ... A lawyer should avoid displays of temper toward the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">Guidelines on Civility, adopted by the Bar Association of Baltimore City, May 14, 1996; <em>See also, </em>Maryland State Bar Association, Code of Civility, (noting that lawyers \u201cwill abstain from disparaging personal remarks or acrimony toward any participants in the legal process ... will speak and write civilly and respectfully to the Court ... will not engage in conduct that offends the dignity and decorum of judicial and administrative proceedings ...\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b176-4\">. While we recognize that the Board sitting in this case was not comprised of judges, they were acting in a quasi-judicial function and are held to basic standards of fairness. <em>See Regan v. Chiropractic Examiners, </em>355 Md. 397 at 410, 735 A.2d 991 (1999)(noting in a case involving the Maryland Board of Chiropractic Examiners that \"the 'appearance of impropriety\u2019 standard set forth in our cases involving judges and some others is applicable generally to the participation of members of Maryland administrative agencies performing quasi-judicial or adjudicatory functions\u201d); <em>Maryland State Police v.

The previously cited Guidelines on Civility state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-5\">A judge should not employ hostile, demeaning or humiliating words in opinions or in written or oral communications with lawyers, parties or witnesses ... A judge should treat lawyers and litigants with impartiality and courtesy while maintaining control of proceedings ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Guidelines on Civility, adopted by the Bar Association of Baltimore City, May 14, 1996. In addition, Canon 2 of the Maryland Code of Judicial Conduct states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-7\">A judge should behave with propriety and should avoid even the appearance of impropriety.

It should be noted that the Court of Appeals has stated that courts have been reluctant to find an appearance of impropriety on the basis of a <em>litigant's </em>actions. <em>Regan, </em>355 Md. at 414, 735 A.2d 991. The cases the Court used to illustrate this point include cases where courts were unwilling to disqualify judges because a party had refused to support the re-election of the judge; a litigant had written an article criticizing the judge; a litigant sued or threatened to sue a judge; a litigant made intemperate and scurrilous\u201d attacks on a judge. <em>Id. </em>This case is not akin to any of those situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>In addition, appellant cites to <em>Carey v.

This Court in <em>Carey </em>held that the circuit court judge in that case did not have to recuse himself and that a \u201cjudge may ... cordially dislike and even distrust an attorney and yet be capable of doing exact justice towards his client.\u201d <em>Id. </em>There is nothing cordial about a member of the Board calling appellee\u2019s counsel a \u201cbold-faced liar.\u201d <em>Carey </em>does not change our analysis of the facts in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b177-8\">.

The Court of Appeals addressed the purpose for the creation of the OAH and noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-7\">One of the main objectives of the legislature in establishing the OAH was to provide an impartial hearing officer in- contested cases. A hearing officer employed by and under the control of the agency where the contested case or other disputed action arises, often results in the appearance of an inherent unfairness or bias against the aggrieved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-8\"><em>Anderson v.
