Johnson (collectively \u201cappellees\u201d) filed motions to quash administrative subpoenas directing them to attend and give testimony at a police department disciplinary hearing. Appellees argued that, as newspaper reporters, they have a qualified privilege under the First Amendment and cannot be compelled to testify. The circuit court quashed the summonses and this appeal followed, in which Prince George\u2019s County, appellant, presents three questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-10\">1. Did the Circuit Court err in granting the Appellees!\u2019] Motion to Vacate Order and Quash Summons by finding that the Prince George\u2019s Police Department failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>show a compelling and overriding interest in the news reporters\u2019 testimony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-4\">2. Did the Circuit Court err in its application of the Maryland Shield Law and The First Amendment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-5\">3. Does the media have an absolute privilege from testifying?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">For the reasons that follow, we hold that neither the First Amendment nor the Maryland Shield Law entitles appellees to refuse to testify at the administrative hearing. We shall therefore reverse the judgments of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">On August 13, 2001, appellees were at the federal courthouse in Greenbelt, Maryland, covering a trial that involved allegations of misconduct by two Prince George\u2019s County Police Officers. Newspaper articles written by appellees reported that, during the lunch break, in the courtroom vestibule, Officer Brian Lott stated, \u201cI wish I would have been there in '95. I would have shot the bastards, and we wouldn\u2019t have all this crap.\u201d The statement attributed to Officer Lott appeared in an article written by Mr. Castenada for <em>The Washington Post, </em>an article written by Mr. Johnson.for <em>The Gazette Newspapers, </em>and in an article written by Mr. Hartley for <em>The Prince George\u2019s Journal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">In response to the publications, the County initiated an investigation, and ultimately filed an administrative charge (of \u201cunbecoming conduct\u201d) against Officer Lott. When contacted by the County\u2019s investigator, appellees refused to give statements and stated that they would not testify at the administrative hearing. Thereafter, appellant issued summonses directing that the appellees appear and give testimony at the disciplinary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-10\">Appellant obtained \u2022 a court order requiring appellees to appear before the hearing board in accordance with the summonses. Subsequently, appellees filed motions to vacate the court\u2019s order and quash the summonses. At the hearing on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>appellees\u2019 motions, the circuit court heard argument from counsel to the parties and from counsel to Officer Lott. Appellees argued that their published articles should be relied upon as their statements. Additionally, appellee Hartley offered an affidavit as a substitute for his testimony. Appellant\u2019s counsel represented to the court that (1) an attorney, who was also present at the federal courthouse, heard only a portion of Officer Lott\u2019s statement; (2) the County\u2019s investigator had questioned everyone present at the courthouse when the statement was purportedly made; and (3) nobody else either heard the statement or is willing to admit to such.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">Although Officer Lott did not file a motion to intervene or any other pleading with the circuit court, his counsel argued that if the reporters were compelled to testify, he would want to (1) examine any notes that appellees had made, and (2) conduct a very extensive cross-examination of the appellees, consisting of 150-200 questions. According to Officer Lott\u2019s counsel, if appellees testified and the court limited his right to question them, Officer Lott would be deprived of his right to constitutionally adequate cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Ruling from the bench, the circuit court found that, although the appellees were in possession of information that is relevant to the issue of whether Officer Lott engaged in unbecoming conduct, (1) the County would be able to present evidence of Officer Lott\u2019s statement by means of an alternative, non-media source; (2) a trier of fact could find the newspaper articles to be persuasive evidence that Officer Lott made the statement in question; (3) Mr. Hartley\u2019s offer to provide an affidavit was a reasonable alternative to appellees\u2019 testimony; and (4) appellees could assert a qualified privilege that would prevent Officer Lott\u2019s counsel from conducting a \u201cfull\u201d cross examination. Based upon those findings, the circuit court quashed the summonses, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-6\">The fact of the matter is that the Court cannot imagine fashioning a protective measure that would be respectful of the right of Officer Lott to confr\u00f3ntate [sic], to confront live witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>Quite frankly, what I have right here is that [the] arguments [by Officer Lott\u2019s counsel] on behalf of Mr. Lott tips the scale.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-4\">The Court does believe that Officer Lott would have a right to a full cross examination of the witnesses as to bias. And bias can be reached in a number of fashions. But even beyond the bias questions there would be a right of cross examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-5\">The Court believes it would be unreasonable to restrict cross examination to preclude questioning of the reporters as to what investigation was conducted in relationship to hearings, what was reported to have been heard. And the Court finds that Prince George\u2019s County has not established a compelling and overriding interest in the disclosure that would be sought by allowance of the subpoenas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-6\">And the Motion of Rubin [Ruben] Castenada and Gregory P; Johnson to Vacate and Quash Summonses and the Motion to Vacate the Motion for Order to Testify and Quash Summonses for Testimony of Eric Hartley are granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">An order granting a motion to alter or amend judgment is ordinarily reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Falcinelli v. Cardascia, </em>339 Md. 414, 430, 663 A.2d 1256 (1995); <em>Gallegos v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>144 Md.App. 213, 235, 797 A.2d 795 (2002), <em>cert. granted, </em>370 Md. 268, 805 A.2d 265 (2002); <em>Wormwood v.

State, </em>300 Md. 233 at 247, 477 A.2d 776 (1984) (reviewing a court\u2019s order denying a motion to quash a summons under the abuse of discretion standard).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In this case, however, we are persuaded that the circuit court erred as a matter of law in arriving at the premature conclusion that the motions should be quashed on the ground that appellees would be entitled to avoid their obligation to answer questions that Officer Lott\u2019s counsel had the right to ask.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">I. The First Amendment</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Appellant argues that (1) appellees are eyewitnesses to a relevant event; (2) the appellees\u2019 testimony is not obtainable from alternative means; and (3) appellant has a compelling and overriding interest in presenting evidence of what occurred on the occasion at issue. According to appellant, even if appellees have a qualified privilege, it would not be applicable in this instance because neither the United States Supreme Court nor a Maryland appellate court has ever ruled that members of the press have an absolute privilege to refuse to testify. Appellees argue that, under the First Amendment and Article 40 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>have a qualified privilege that entitles them to refuse to testify in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">In <em>Branzburg v. Hayes, </em>408 U.S. 665, 682, 92 S.Ct. 2646, 33 L.Ed.2d 626 (1972), a majority of the United States Supreme Court rejected the argument that news. reporters have a testimonial privilege:\u2019</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-5\">We are asked to create another [privilege] by interpreting the First Amendment to grant newsmen a testimonial privilege that other citizens do not enjoy. This we decline to do. Fair and effective law enforcement aimed at providing security for the person and property of the individual is a fundamental function of. government, and the grand jury plays an important, constitutionally mandated role in this process. On the records now before us, we perceive no basis for holding that the public interest in law enforcement and in ensuring effective grand jury proceedings is insufficient to override the consequential, but uncertain, burden on news gathering that is said to result from insisting that reporters, like other citizens, respond to relevant questions put to them in the course of a valid grand jury investigation or criminal trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 690, 92 S.Ct. 2646 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">Although it did not establish a privilege,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the <em>Branzburg </em>Court noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-8\">news gathering is not without its First Amendment protections, and grand jury investigations if instituted or conducted other than in good faith, would pose wholly different issues for resolution under the First Amendment. Official <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>harassment of the press undertaken not for purposes of law enforcement but to disrupt a reporter\u2019s relationship with his news sources would have no justification. Grand juries are subject to judicial control and subpoenas to motions to quash. We do not expect courts will forget that grand juries must operate within the limits of the First Amendment as well as the Fifth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 707-08, 92 S.Ct. 2646 (footnote omitted). In a concurring opinion, Justice Powell stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-5\">Indeed, if the newsman is called upon to give information bearing only a remote and tenuous relationship to the subject of the investigation, or if he has some other reason to believe that his testimony implicates confidential source relationships without a legitimate need of law enforcement, he will have access to the court on a motion to quash and an appropriate protective order may be entered. The asserted claim to privilege should be judged on its facts by the striking of a proper balance between freedom of the press and the obligation of all citizens to give relevant testimony with respect to criminal conduct. The balance of these vital constitutional and societal interests on a case-by-case basis accords with the tried and traditional way of adjudicating such questions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 710, 92 S.Ct. 2646.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">The <em>Branzburg </em>dissent advocated a rule that would require the government to prove three elements before a news reporter could be compelled to testify before a grand jury: (1) \u201cthere is probable cause to believe that the newsman has information that is clearly relevant to a specific probable violation of law;\u201d (2) \u201cthe information sought cannot be obtained by alternative means less destructive of First Amendment rights;\u201d and (3) the government has \u201ca compelling and overriding interest in the information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 743, 92 S.Ct. 2646. In <em>Tofani v. State, </em>297 Md. 165, 465 A.2d 413 (1983), the Court of Appeals made it \u201cclear that <em>Branzburg </em>expressly declined to create <em>any </em>testimonial privilege, absolute or conditional.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 185, 465 A.2d 413. Noting that a number of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>jurisdictions have recognized a qualified \u201cnewsgatherers\u2019 privilege\u201d under the First Amendment,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and/or provided some protections to \u201ca non-party journalist ... called as a witness,\u201d the <em>Tofani </em>Court concluded that \u201c[a]t most, these [type of] cases establish the principle that when an important interest, such as the First Amendment right to gather news conflicts with other important constitutional interests, courts must carefully consider and balance the competing interests in resolving the controversy.\u201d <em>Tofani, </em>297 Md. at 188, 465 A.2d 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">In <em>WBAL-TV Div., Hearst Corp. v. State, supra, </em>the Court of Appeals noted that \u201c[t]here is no specific set of criteria applied uniformly by all courts to determine whether the privilege precludes disclosure in a particular case.\u201d 300 Md. at 242-243, 477 A.2d 776. That case involved the issue of whether the circuit court had properly denied a motion to quash a summons requiring a television station to produce \u201couttakes\u201d of an interview with a criminal defendant that the State wanted to use as evidence at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 235, 477 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>776. WBAL argued that it had a qualified privilege to refuse to release the outtakes,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that the three part test discussed in the <em>Branzburg </em>dissent was applicable to the summons. <em>Id. </em>at 243-44, 477 A.2d 776.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">Without adopting the three part test urged by WBAL, the Court of Appeals concluded that \u2014 even if a qualified privilege existed \u2014 the State met its burden. <em>Id. </em>at 247, 477 A.2d 776. Therefore, the Court affirmed the decision of the trial court to deny WBAL\u2019s motion to quash the summons. <em>Id. </em>at 247, 477 A.2d 776. The defendant\u2019s videotaped statements related to the murders for which he had been charged, and were obviously relevant to the State\u2019s case. <em>Id. </em>at 244, 477 A.2d 776. The statements were highly relevant as they went to the ultimate question of the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence and were voluntary admissions of the defendant. <em>Id. </em>The statements on the outtakes were admissions by a party opponent that could not be duplicated or obtained from any alternative source. WBAL was the sole possessor of the videotaped statements. The three persons who heard or made the statements \u2014 the defendant, the reporter, and the cameraman\u2014 were not likely to provide a verbatim account of what had been said. It was most unlikely that the defendant would voluntarily incriminate himself. The State had an overriding and compelling interest in the disclosure of the statements, which had such a high \u201cdegree of relevance\u201d and \u201cprobative value.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 244-45, 477 A.2d 776.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">In <em>Delaney v. Superior Court (Kopetman), </em>50 Cal.3d 785, 268 Cal.Rptr.753, 789 P.2d 934 (1990), the Supreme Court of California held that newspersons who observed an arrest were required to testify on the issue of whether the defendant had consented to a search of his jacket, even though the newspersons had not published any accounts of their observations. Although a majority of the court applied a \u201cbalancing\u201d test, Justice Mosk explained why the \u201calternative source\u201d issue is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>of no consequence when the reporter is an eyewitness to the event at issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-4\">I concur, nonetheless, in the court\u2019s judgment because I find that the alternative source rule is inapplicable when the information sought is the reporter\u2019s own observations as a percipient witness of a transitory event.- The alternative source rule arose in cases, such as those cited ante, in which the information in question had been gathered from documents, interviews, public meetings,'and the like. In such cases the content of the information existed in some objective and stable form, capable of independent verification \u2014 the documents could be independently inspected, the interviewees could be contacted, etc. What the defendants in those cases were primarily interested in was not the reporters\u2019 perceptions but the content of these independent information sources.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq_\">In the case of eyewitnessed transitory events, however, no such independent, stable information source exists. Equally significant is the well-established fact that there are often major discrepancies between different eyewitness accounts of the same event, owing to distortions and biases in both perception and memory. (See <em>People v. McDonald </em>(1984) 87 Cal.3d 351, 363-365 [208 Cal.Rptr. 236, 690 P.2d 709, 46 A.L.R.4th 1011], and authorities cited; Note, Did Your Eyes Deceive You: Expert Psychological Testimony on the Unreliability of Eyewitness Identification (1977) 29 Stan.L.Rev. 969, 971-989.) Thus, two percipient witnesses of the same event are not in any sense fungible. And unlike the document or the interview, the transitory unrecorded event is not subject to subsequent independent verification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-6\">Accordingly, the reporter as a percipient witness is not an \u201cexception\u201d to the alternative-source rule. Rather, in such situations the rule simply does not apply: in a real sense, two eyewitnesses to the same event are not alternative sources of the same information, but sources of different information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>In the present case, defendant was able to show a reasonable possibility that the information would assist in ascertaining the truth. Because the information he seeks from the reporters is their contemporaneous observations of a transitory event, he has met the second threshold by showing that no real alternative source of the information exists. He is therefore entitled to the reporters\u2019 testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 957-58. We agree with that analysis, which comports with the general rule dating to \u201c1742 that \u2018the public has a right to every man\u2019s evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashford v. State, </em>147 Md. App. 1, 61, 807 A.2d 732 (2002) (quoting <em>Kastigar v. United States, </em>406 U.S. 441, 443, 92 S.Ct. 1653, 32 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972); <em>Branzburg v. Hayes, </em>408 U.S. 665, 688, 92 S.Ct. 2646, 33 L.Ed.2d 626 (1972)).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Our conclusion is consistent with the following cases: <em>State v. Turner, </em>550 N.W.2d 622, 628 (Minn.1996) (holding that a news reporter had no privilege to avoid testifying about alleged criminal activity that the reporter personally observed); <em>State v.

San Francisco, </em>748 F.Supp. 722, 726 (N.D.Cal.1990) (holding that a cameraman cannot refuse to testify about an incident that the cameraman personally observed while filming a different story); <em>Bartlett v. Superior Court, </em>150 Ariz. 178, 722 P.2d 346, 350 (Ct.App.1986) (holding that, because it does not implicate any confidential source or information, a news reporter could not refuse to produce the reporter\u2019s videotape of an automobile accident); <em>Bell v. Des Moines, </em>412 N.W.2d 585, 588 (Iowa 1987) (noting that a reporter may not avoid testifying about observations made as an eyewitness); <em>In re Ziegler, </em>550 F.Supp. 530, 532 (W.D.N.Y.1982) (holding that a news reporter cannot avoid testifying about events that the reporter personally observed outside of a courtroom); <em>Alexander v.

Appellees claim that the newspaper articles themselves, and the affidavit offered by Mr. Hartley,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>suffice to prove the charges made against Officer Lott. It is obvious that the newspaper articles and the affidavit are hearsay evidence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-4\">[I]t is well settled that the procedure followed in administrative agencies usually is not as formal and strict as that of the courts. As such, the rules of evidence are generally relaxed in administrative proceedings. Stated differently, that which is inadmissible in a judicial proceeding is not per se inadmissible in an administrative proceeding. It follows, therefore, that hearsay evidence that is inadmissible in a judicial proceeding is not necessarily inadmissible in an administrative proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-5\"><em>Travers v.

It is also well settled that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-6\">while administrative agencies are not constrained by technical rales of evidence, they must observe basic rules of fairness as to the parties appearing before them so as to comport with the requirements of procedural due process afforded by the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court has remained steadfast in reminding agencies that to be admissible in an adjudicative proceeding, hearsay evidence must demonstrate sufficient reliability and probative value to satisfy the requirements of procedural due process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number><em>Travers, </em>115 Md.App. at 411, 693 A.2d 378 (citations omitted).

While the appellees\u2019 articles constitute the basis for appellant\u2019s complaint against Officer Lott, and appellees are not \u201cvictims\u201d whose statements might well be unreliable, it cannot be said that the appellees are \u201cdisinterested\u201d witnesses.

Other than the appellees, only one person acknowledged hearing anything, and this person heard only a portion of Lott\u2019s statement. Appellant is not obligated to depose every person present within earshot on the day in question to determine if someone has not been forthcoming. Appellant, therefore, has no other reasonable alternative to putting the appellees on the stand.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>Appellant has a compelling and overriding interest in calling appellees to testify. Adjudicating and disciplining the wrongdoing of errant officers is of utmost importance. If Officer Lott did make the statement, appellant has reason to question whether a sanction should be imposed. Appellant has an interest in maintaining the public\u2019s confidence in the police force. The Prince George\u2019s County Police Department has been the subject of repeated articles that are critical of its failings and deficiencies.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s ability to adjudicate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>merits of a disciplinary proceeding is essential to the public trust in the system established to deal with police misconduct. Appellees claim that they have several interests of their own that are entitled to protection.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> None of these interests outweighs appellant\u2019s interest in the appellees\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">Appellees are not protecting the confidential source of any information: they are the source. The possibility that individual reporters may be reassigned and other reporters assigned to cover this story is an insignificant intrusion on the press that does not override appellant\u2019s compelling interest in the information. Nor are facts present here that the <em>Branzburg </em>Court cautioned about. Appellant is not unnecessarily harassing appellees, and is not seeking information remotely or tenuously related to its case. The testimony sought goes to the heart of the matter: whether Officer Lott made the statements in question.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>II. The Maryland Shield Law</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">At common law, \u201cno privilege was afforded newsmen ... to conceal from judicial inquiry either the source of their information or the information itself.\u201d <em>Lightman v. State, </em>15 Md.App. 713, 717, 294 A.2d 149, <em>aff'd, </em>266 Md. 551, 295 A.2d 470 (1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>411 U.S. 951, 93 S.Ct. 1922, 36 L.Ed.2d 414 (1973) (citations omitted). Maryland\u2019s Shield Law, Md.Code (1995 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 9-112 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings article (\u201cC.J.\u201d), ensures that appellees are not a \u201ctool of the judicial system.\u201d In 1896, Maryland was the first state to enact a Shield Law protecting the media from revealing the source of its information. <em>Id. </em>Maryland\u2019s present Shield Law, in pertinent part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aap\">(c) Scope - of privilege. \u2014 Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, any judicial, legislative, or administrative body, or any body that has the power to issue subpoenas may not compel any person described in subsection (b) of this section to disclose:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-6\">(1) <em>The source of any news or information </em>procured by the person while employed by the news media, whether or not the source has been promised confidentiality; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-7\">(2) <em>Any news or information procured by the person while employed by the news media, </em>in the course of pursuing professional activities, for communication to the public <em>but which is not so communicated, </em>in whole or in part....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">C.J. \u00a7 9-112(c) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">In <em>Lightman, </em>a reporter for the <em>Baltimore Evening Sun </em>was summoned to testify before a grand jury concerning illegal drug activities in Ocean City. According to Lightman\u2019s news article, he had personally witnessed drug activity in a pipe shop. Claiming that the \u201csource\u201d of his information was the business\u2019 shopkeeper, Lightman refused to testify before the grand jury. Both this Court and the Court of Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>concluded that Lightman could be required to disclose the location of the pipe shop and the identity of all those that he had observed engaging in illegal activities:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-4\">\u201cThe general principle of privileged communications is based, in part, on the fundamental condition that the communication originate in confidence that it will not be disclosed without the communicant\u2019s consent.\u201d See 8 Wigmore (McNaughton Rev.1961) Section 2285.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-5\">\u201cWhere a newsman, by dint of his own investigative efforts, personally observes conduct constituting the commission of criminal activities by persons at a particular location, the newsman, and not the persons observed, is the \u201csource\u201d of .the news or information in the sense contemplated by the statute. To conclude otherwise in such circumstances would be to insulate the news itself from disclosure and not merely the source, a result plainly at odds with the Maryland law espoused in dictum in <em>Sheridan.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-6\">As in <em>Branzburg, </em>the situs of the criminal activity, and the persons participating in it, was in this case part of the information obtained by the appellant through his own personal observations and, consequently, neither the identity of the shopkeeper nor the location of the shop constituted the \u201csource\u201d of the news or information published by the appellant. Had the substance of appellant\u2019s information been learned, not by personal observation but been supplied to him by an informant, the identity of that informant would clearly be protected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-7\"><em>Lightman, </em>15 Md.App. at 724-25, 294 A.2d 149.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">When <em>Lightman </em>was decided, the Shield Law did not protect from disclosure the actual news or information procured by the reporter. We expressly acknowledged this in <em>Light-man </em>and invited the General Assembly to make any change. <em>Id. </em>at 726, 294 A.2d 149. Subsequently, the legislature enact<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>ed Chapter 113 of the Acts of 1988, which is, in essence, the present Shield Law. It now protects both the source of any news or information, C.L. \u00a7 9-112(c)(l), and the \u201cnews or information procured by the person while employed by the news media.\u201d C.L. \u00a7 9-112(c)(2). The legislature, however, made no change to the principle that a news reporter who personally observes a situation is the \u201csource\u201d of the information.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Because none of the appellees is a \u201csource\u201d of information protected by the Shield Law, and because all of the appellees have \u201ccommunicated\u201d what they claim to have witnessed, neither C.L. \u00a7 9 \u2014 112(c)(1) nor C.L. \u00a7 9-112(c)(2) is applicable to the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">Even if subsections (c)(1) or (c)(2) afforded any protection to the appellees, they were not entitled to the relief that they received in the circuit court. C.L. \u00a7 9-112(d)(l) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGq\">(d) <em>Court may compel disclosure. </em>\u2014 (1) A court may compel disclosure of news or information, if the court finds that the party seeking news or information protected under subsection (c)(2) of this section has established by clear and convincing evidence that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-5\">(i) The news or information is relevant to a significant legal issue before any judicial, legislative, or administrative body, or any body that has the power to issue subpoenas;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-6\">(ii) The news or information could not, with due diligence, be obtained by any alternate means; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>(iii) There is an overriding public interest in disclosure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">For the reasons set forth above, we are persuaded that appellant satisfied its burden of persuasion under this provision, which is essentially a codification of the factors discussed in the <em>Brcmzburg </em>dissent. We therefore hold that the circuit court erred in quashing the summonses requiring appellees to appear and testify at Officer Lott\u2019s administrative hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Proceedings on Remand</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Our conclusion that appellees are compellable witnesses does not mean that the Shield Law will be inapplicable to every question that they might be asked at the administrative hearing. Officer Lott\u2019s right to meaningful cross-examination is not a license to acquire information protected by C.L. \u00a7 9-112(c)(2), which protects appellees from disclosing, <em>inter alia, </em>(1) news or information not communicated to the public, or (2) appellees\u2019 notes, sound tapes or any \u201cother data ... not itself disseminated in any manner to the public.\u201d It is well settled that a witness\u2019 direct examination does not, of itself, constitute a waiver of any applicable privilege. <em>See, e.g., Avery v. State, </em>15 Md.App. 520, 536, 292 A.2d 728 (1972); <em>Oliver v. State, </em>53 Md.App. 490, 499, 454 A.2d 856 (1983); <em>Clark v. State, </em>364 Md. 611, 662, 774 A.2d 1136 (2001). The holdings in these cases are applicable to C.L. \u00a7 9-112(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">During the administrative hearing, each appellee will be entitled to a determination of whether he may refuse to answer a particular question on the ground that the answer would result in the disclosure of privileged information. In the first instance, this determination must be made by the hearing board.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We are confident that the hearing board will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>protect appellees\u2019 rights under the Shield Law as well \u2022 as Officer Lott\u2019s right to meaningful cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">ORDER OF THE CIRCUIT COURT QUASHING AP-PELLEES\u2019 SUBPOENAS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED FOR ENTRY OF ORDER DENYING APPELLEES\u2019 MOTIONS TO QUASH SUBPOENAS; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEES.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b608-9\">.

The argument that a reporter\u2019s affidavit should be received as an alternative to the reporter\u2019s testimony constitutes a waiver of whatever privilege might be applicable. Unlike an offer of compromise excluded under Md. Rule 5-408, when a reporter asks the court to substitute an affidavit for the reporter\u2019s testimony, that argument constitutes a waiver. The Unites States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama has ruled that a reporter\u2019s qualified privilege under the First Amendment is waived if the reporter gives a litigant an affidavit detailing the substance of the conversation in question. <em>Pinkard v. Johnson, </em>118 F.R.D. 517 (M.D.Ala.1987). In <em>Pinkard, </em>the plaintiff and the defendants worked for a racing commission. The plaintiff publicly exposed the policies and procedures of the commission. In his civil suit, the plaintiff alleged that in retaliation for the disclosure, the defendants fabricated charges of sexual harassment against him. While investigating the claim, the plaintiff's attorney took a reporter's voluntary statement relating to a conversation the reporter had with one of the defendants. Subsequently, the reporter gave an affidavit to plaintiff's counsel attesting to his statement. The plaintiff and the defendants sought to depose the reporter. The reporter objected, arguing that he had a qualified privilege under the First Amendment. The federal district court found that the reporter had waived his qualified privilege. It explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-6\">Both parties are entitled to depose Mr. Chandler [the reporter] concerning the substance of a conversation about which he has already submitted a signed affidavit. On August 11, 1987, Mr. Chandler voluntarily submitted to a taped interview concerning the conversation he had with defendant Johnson [a defendant]. Through this action, the Court finds that Mr. Chandler waived his qualified reporter privilege with regard to this conversation. A reporter is not free to give a sworn statement to a litigant, and later invoke the qualified reporter privilege to keep this information from the Court. However, Mr. Chandler has waived his qualified reporter privilege only as to matters relating to the conversation he had with defendant Johnson a few weeks prior to December 3, 1986.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 523.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-8\">Additionally, the <em>Pinkard </em>Court stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-9\">Federal courts have held generally that the qualified privilege does not apply when the reporter is being questioned about an incident to which he or she may be a witness like any other member of the public. <em>See, e.g., Miller v.

In examining appellees, appellant has proposed that it would be \"fact specific as to what the news persons physically heard Officer Lott say on the day in question.\u201d Additionally, it suggests limiting the cross-examination of appellees to (1) whether the reporter was present at the time and place when the statement was made; (2) whether the reporter was in physical proximity to hear Lott make the statement; (3) whether the reporters individually heard the statement; and (4) what was their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>ability to hear and what was said. This questioning would not be unduly burdensome and any interest of appellees that may be implicated does not override appellant\u2019s interests.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b624-7\">. In <em>Bilney v. Evening Star Newspaper Co., </em>43 Md.App. 560, 406 A.2d 652 (1979), we concluded, in part, that the Shield Law protected two persons from divulging their confidential source of information. Burke and Kram had obtained from a confidential source information about University of Maryland basketball players' academic performances. They asserted that the information was voluntarily and gratuitously given to them. The two passed on the information to the <em>Star, </em>which ran an article in the <em>Diamondback </em>detailing the players\u2019 academic failings. The basketball players sued claiming invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of mental distress. The appellants in <em>Bilney </em>argued that Burke and Kram had waived their right not to reveal the source of their information because they characterized the information as having been \u201cvoluntarily and gratuitously\u201d given. We declined to endorse this argument, and concluded that Burke and Kram had not waived their right to reveal the source of their information.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b625-8\">. The member of the hearing board assigned to rule on objections to questions has the duty to sustain an objection to an improper question. Lawyers who participate in the hearing will be doing so in their roles as officers of the court, and must \"not confuse the absolute right to cross-examine with the less-than-absolute right to ask a specific question.\" <em>Elmer v. State, </em>119 Md.App. 205, 217, 704 A.2d 511 (1998) <em>rev. on different grounds, </em>353 Md. 1, 724 A.2d 625 (1999). In a trial, the appropriate remedy for incomplete cross-examination is left to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>sound discretion of the trial court, whose remedy of choice will be affirmed on appeal unless the reviewing court is persuaded that the trial court abused its discretion. See, e.g., <em>Meley v. De Coursey, </em>204 Md. 648 at 655, 106 A.2d 65 (1954), and John W. Strong, <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 19 (4th ed.1992). During the administrative hearing, if the hearing board concludes that a witness does have a privilege to refuse to answer a particular question, it will be for the hearing board to determine whether all or part (or none) of that witness\u2019 testimony should be stricken. Such a. determination involves the exercise of sound discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
