Appellants\u2019 claims arose when Christine Honeycutt (\u201cChristine Honeycutt\u201d) withdrew approximately $13,000 from the account of Sheldon maintained with the Bank. Christine Honeycutt was a former officer of Sheldon and, at the time of the withdrawal, was an authorized signatory on Sheldon\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-11\">On March 13, 2000, Sheldon commenced an action against Christine Honeycutt, the former wee-president and secretary of Sheldon, in the District Court of Maryland for Baltimore City in connection with her withdrawal of funds from Sheldon\u2019s account with the Bank (hereinafter referred to as the \u201cDistrict Court action\u201d). On May 4, 2000, Sheldon amended its original Complaint in the District Court to assert additional claims against Christine Honeycutt and to add the Bank as a defendant. In its Amended Complaint, Sheldon asserted claims for conversion, breach of contract, and negligence against the Bank for permitting the allegedly unauthorized withdrawal.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>On June 15, 2000,- Sheldon filed a Second Amended Complaint in the District Court, adding another claim against Christine Honeycutt and, at the same time, requested a jury trial. The District Court denied Sheldon\u2019s untimely request for a jury trial on June 29, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">On January 8, 2001, the Estate filed a Complaint against Christine Honeycutt and the Bank in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City and requested a jury trial (hereinafter referred to as the \u201cCircuit Court action\u201d). The Estate, in its Complaint, asserted claims for conversion, breach of contract, and negligence against the Bank for permitting the allegedly unauthorized -withdrawal of funds from Sheldon\u2019s account with the Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">On March 9, 2001, a Third Amended Complaint was filed in the District Court action adding the Estate as a co-plaintiff. The Estate asserted the same claims against the Bank\u2014 conversion, breach of contract, and negligence \u2014 as it had previously asserted in the Circuit Court action. The Estate also requested a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">On May 22, 2001, the Bank filed a Motion for Summary Judgment in the Circuit Court action. In its Motion, the Bank argued that (i) the Estate was not the real party in interest and did not have standing to sue the Bank because the claims asserted by the Estate were for wrongs allegedly committed against Sheldon as a corporate entity and, therefore, could only be brought by Sheldon, and (ii) at the time Christine Honeycutt withdrew funds from Sheldon\u2019s account, she was an authorized signatory on the account and, therefore, the Bank committed no legal wrong when it permitted the withdrawal. Neither of the parties requested a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">On June 18, 2001, the Honorable Thomas E. Noel granted the Bank\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment and dismissed the Estate\u2019s claims against the Bank. Judge Noel did not issue a memorandum opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">Shortly after the circuit court granted the Bank\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment, the original Complaint in the Circuit Court action was amended to add Sheldon as a co-plaintiff. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>the Amended Complaint, Sheldon asserted the same claims against the Bank \u2014 conversion, breach of contract and negligence \u2014 that had previously been asserted by the Estate (on which summary judgment had been granted) and that were being asserted by Sheldon in the pending District Court action.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">On July 9, 2001, a hearing was held in the District Court action on the Bank\u2019s Motion to Dismiss the Estate for improper joiner. At that hearing, the Honorable John P. Miller stayed further proceedings in the District Court action until final disposition of the Circuit Court action.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">On August 1, 2001, the Bank filed another Motion for Summary Judgment in the Circuit Court action, this time as to Sheldon\u2019s claims. In that Motion, the Bank argued that (i) the District Court for Baltimore City first acquired jurisdiction over the claims brought by Sheldon and, therefore, the claims should be heard by the District Court, and (ii) at the time Christine Honeycutt withdrew funds from Sheldon\u2019s account, she was an authorized signatory on the account and, therefore, the Bank committed no legal wrong when it permitted the withdrawal.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">A hearing on the Bank\u2019s second Motion for Summary Judgment was held on September 21, 2001, before the Honorable John Carroll Byrnes. At the conclusion of the hearing, Judge Byrnes granted the Bank\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment and dismissed Sheldon\u2019s claims against the Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">Appellants\u2019 claims against Christine Honeycutt in the Circuit Court action were tried without a jury on February 15, 2002. The Honorable William D. Quarles presided and rendered a verdict in favor of the Estate and against Christine Honeycutt on the breach of contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">The Estate and Sheldon filed a timely Notice of Appeal, on March 13, 2002, and now present two questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-10\">I. WAS THE LOWER COURT LEGALLY CORRECT IN GRANTING THE MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT OF APPELLEE, BANK OF AMERICA, N.A. (\u201cAPPELLEE BANK\u201d) AGAINST APPEL<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>LANT SHELDON, INC. AND APPELLANT ESTATE, ON THE BASIS THAT THERE WAS NO FACTUAL EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE CONTENTION THAT APPELLEE BANK HAD BREACHED ITS AGREEMENT AND/OR HAD BEEN NEGLIGENT IN THIS MATTER?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-5\">II. DID THE LOWER COURT ABUSE ITS DISCRETION BY REFUSING TO GRANT A CONTINUANCE TO EITHER APPELLANT IN ORDER TO PURSUE DISCOVERY AGAINST THE APPELLEE BANK IN THIS CASE?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">Ron Honeycutt was the president, treasurer, and sole stockholder of Sheldon, Inc., which trades as Sheldon\u2019s Lounge, a bar located in Baltimore City. Christine Honeycutt was, at one time, Ron Honeycutt\u2019s wife and held the position of vice-president and secretary of Sheldon.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On July 1, 1984, Ron Honeycutt and Christine Honeycutt opened a business checking account with Maryland National Bank, now known as Bank of America, N.A., in the name of Sheldon\u2019s Lounge.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At that time, Ron Honeycutt and Christine Honeycutt executed a signature card for the account. The signature card read, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-9\">In consideration of the opening of this account and the maintenance thereof by Maryland National Bank (hereinafter \u201cBank\u201d), the signer(s) (hereinafter \u201cdepositor\u201d) by the signature(s) subscribed below agree(s) to the Rules and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>Regulations of Contract provided to depositor herewith. Bank is authorized to recognize and rely upon any of the signature(s) below on checks, drafts and orders for the payment of money, the withdrawals of funds, or the transaction of any business to this account. Depositor acknowledges receipt of a copy of the Rules and Regulations governing this account.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">On the signature card, Ron Honeycutt and Christine Honeycutt checked off the box requiring only one signature to transact any business on the account. Ron Honeycutt and Christine Honeycutt were the only authorized signatories on the account and remained the only authorized signatories throughout the entire time that the Bank maintained the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Ron Honeycutt died February 10, 2000.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On February 15, 2000, Christine Honeycutt withdrew funds in the amount of $13,066.48 from Sheldon\u2019s account. At the time of withdrawal, an employee of the Bank retrieved and reviewed the signature card on file with the Bank in order to verify Christine Honeycutt\u2019s authority to direct and conduct transactions on Sheldon\u2019s account. The Bank did not inquire as to Christine Honeycutt\u2019s status with respect to Sheldon, nor did they inquire of anyone at Sheldon as to her status. At the time, the Bank was unaware that Ron Honeycutt had died. The withdrawal took the form of a cashier\u2019s check made payable to Christine Honeycutt. According to the signature card on file at the Bank at the time Christine Honeycutt withdrew the funds, she was an authorized signatory on the account and the Bank was authorized to recognize and rely upon her signature on orders for the withdrawal of funds or the transaction of any business to the account. It was Christine Honeycutt\u2019s conten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>tion that the bank employees told her that the \u201cmoney belonged to her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">I. Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Appellants argue that the circuit court was not legally correct in granting the Bank\u2019s Motions for Summary Judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We disagree. Judge Noel granted Bank\u2019s first Motion for Summary Judgment against the Estate on June 18, 2001. Judge Byrnes granted the Bank\u2019s second Motion for Summary Judgment against Sheldon on September 25, 2001. For the sake of clarity, we address each of the motions for summary judgment separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">A. Summary Judgment against Sheldon.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">During the September 21, 2001 hearing on appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the following colloquy occurred, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-9\">The Court: ... That being stated in the case that is to say they are not consolidated and one is stayed, I see no reason why this matter can[\u2019]t be resolved one way or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>other and I am, I[\u2019]m here to be persuaded so to speak but the matter whether you use the reasonable standard or the, the signature card standard, the Bank should prevail here. I mean I struggle to see how \u2014 what the Bank is supposed to do when a person comes in and I[\u2019]m accepting by the way for the sake of this discussion her assertions that she was told by the Bank officials that she could, that the money was hers. Two different officials or two different employees. One of them, [sic] And the, to me its entirely reasonable and logical if someone goes to the Bank and says I[\u2019]m a signatory on this account. May I withdrawal the money? The answer is not going to be no. The answer is going to be yes. Now the next level of scrutiny that you would put to them is that they then begin to check her benefices and say well, are you still married, you know, are you \u2014 we heard a rumor on the street that you were divorced and your husband and yourself aren[\u2019]t getting along and by the way, we[\u2019]ve never seen you here before. What are you doing here? Isn[\u2019]t there someone else who normally does the banking? Is your husband alive? I don\u2019t think Banks, I don\u2019t think case law puts that burden on the Bank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-5\">[Appellant\u2019s Counsel]: That[\u2019]s [sic] as far as the inquiry goes but what I would suggest is that when you have a corporate account something more is required and I think something more reasonably is required. Again, this was a matter which they saw, okay, this is Christine Honeycutt. They cut a check to Christine Honeycutt. They don[\u2019]t cut a check to Christine Honeycutt in her capacity as secretary or as treasurer but to Christine Honeycutt. She[\u2019]s not here, this is not a multiple party account. She is on this account as a corporate officer and the bottom line is that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-6\">The Court: What is the Bank\u2019s answer to that specific point which is that they[\u2019]ve breached their standard of care by giving her a check personally when she was an officer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>[Appellee\u2019s Counsel]: I[\u2019]m [sic] not sure if the Bank would have looked at that check as a personal check. I[\u2019]m not sure if\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQL\">The Court: Because it was drawn on the corporate accounts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-6\">[Appellee\u2019s Counsel]: Exactly. T[\u2019]m not sure if they would have said, if they would had [sic] to say Christine Honeycutt as vice president of Sheldon\u2019s Lounge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-7\">The Court: I don\u2019t know of any case law or even bank practice that even calls for that. I understand your logic. Do you have an expert banking person who[\u2019]s going to say that that[\u2019]s the standard of care?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-8\">[Appellant\u2019s Counsel]: I, I can[\u2019]t say Your Honor that I do at this point....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-9\">The Court:.... Listen, I think rather than take up your time unnecessarily. This is a case that has to be decided on the present record and the facts of the present record do not justify holding the Bank accountable when they responded pursuant to the agreement that they had that they could withdrawal or authorize the withdrawal of money on her signature. And nothing that you[\u2019]ve said at this hearing nor anything that I[\u2019]ve read in the papers suggest that there[\u2019]s a standard of care out there that[\u2019]s going to be substantiated by an expert or anyone else to, that suggests that they have a duty that goes beyond the card and that they[\u2019]re to conduct inquiries into the private lives and business circumstances of their customers before they will honor what they[\u2019]ve already agreed to honor which is to pay out of our requests. And therefore the motion will have to be granted as to those four counts. Thank you very much.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">Following the hearing, Judge Byrnes entered the following order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-11\">Upon consideration of the foregoing Motion and Opposition to Motion for Summary Judgment and Memorandum of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>Law in support thereof, it is, this 21 day of September, 2001, by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-5\"><em>ORDERED: </em>That Defendant Bank\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment be and the same is hereby Granted as to Counts 9,10,11 and 12.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Sheldon argues that the Bank breached its duty of care \u201cby failing to make an adequate inquiry as to the authority of Christine Honeycutt to conduct banking on behalf of the business.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">\u201cA bank and its customers enjoy a debtor/creditor relationship in which the rights and liabilities of each are contractual.\u201d <em>Gordon, Feinblatt, Rothman, Hoffberger &amp; Hollander v. Gerhold, </em>90 Md.App. 360, 376, 600 A.2d 1194 (1992); <em>see also Kiley v. First Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>102 Md.App. 317, 326-27, 649 A.2d 1145 (1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>338 Md. 116, 656 A.2d 772 (1995). \u201cImplicit in the contract [between the bank and customer] is the duty of the bank to use ordinary care in disbursing the depositor\u2019s funds.\u201d <em>Gillen v. Maryland Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>274 Md. 96, 101, 333 A.2d 329 (1975) (citing <em>Commonwealth Bank v. Goodman, </em>128 Md. 452, 97 A. 1005 (1916)). In <em>Kiley, supra, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-8\">A signature card may constitute a contract between a bank and its customer. <em>Fleming v. Bank of Va., </em>231 Va. 299, 343 S.E.2d 341, 344 (Va.1986) (\u201cThe signature card constituted the contract between the parties and, subject to the statutory schemes, regulates their rights and duties.\u201d); <em>Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp. v. West, </em>244 Ga. 396, 260 S.E.2d 89, 91 (Ga.1979) (\u201cThe signature card and the checks drawn against the account are the contract documents between the bank and the customer.\u201d); <em>Chickerneo v. Soc\u2019y Nat\u2019l Bank of Cleveland, </em>58 Ohio St.2d 315, 390 N.E.2d 1183, 1185 (Ohio 1979).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-9\"><em>See </em>5(a) Michie on Banks &amp; Banking, Ch. 9, \u00a7 1, at 30 (1994 Repl.Vol.) (\u201cA \u2018signature card\u2019 is a contract which creates a savings account or checking account....\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number><em>Kiley, </em>102 Md.App. at 327, 649 A.2d 1145. <em>See also University Nat\u2019l Bank v. Wolfe, </em>279 Md. 512, 521, 369 A.2d 570 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Here, Ron and Christine Honeycutt, on July 1, 1984, opened a business checking account in the name of Sheldon\u2019s Lounge with the Bank\u2019s predecessor. On that same day, Ron and Christine Honeycutt executed a signature card and checked off the box requiring only one signature to transact any business on the account. Similar to our decisions in <em>Riley </em>and <em>Wolfe, </em>the signature card created a contractual obligation on the part of the Bank to pay the depositor\u2019s funds only as authorized by the signature card. The plain language of the signature card established that both Ron and Christine Honeycutt were authorized signatories able to transact business on Sheldon\u2019s account.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Moreover, the signature card expressly and unambiguously provided that the Bank is authorized to recognize and rely upon either of Ron or Christine Honeycutt\u2019s signatures on checks, drafts and orders for the payment of money, the withdrawal of funds, or the transaction of any business to Sheldon\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">When Christine Honeycutt withdrew funds from Sheldon\u2019s account, we find, the Bank did not breach any standard of care owed to appellants. The Bank exercised reasonable care when it inspected the signature card on file for Sheldon\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>account and verified that Christine Honeycutt was an authorized signatory on the account. Moreover, we are persuaded that no further inquiry was required as the Bank was legally entitled to release the funds to Christine Honeycutt based upon the express authority created by the signature card.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, because there was no genuine dispute as to any material fact, <em>i.e., </em>that the 1984 signature card was the authoritative document on file with the Bank, we find that the lower court was correct to conclude, as a matter of law, that the signature card controlled the transaction and was 'correct to enter summary judgment in favor of appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Sheldon also argues that the Bank breached its duty of care by \u201cfailing to disburse the funds in the account in accordance with the type of account at issue and the terms of the signature card.\u201d In light of our analysis above, we find no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>merit in this argument and decline to address it.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> ,</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">B. Summary Judgment against the Estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">The Estate argues that the circuit court was legally incorrect when it granted the Bank\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment; however, the Estate failed to adequately brief this argument, and thus, we decline to address it on appeal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8-504(a)(5)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>; <em>see also Bryan v. State Roads Comm\u2019n, </em>115 Md.App. 707, 715, 694 A.2d 522 (1997) (\u201cWe need not address this argument because, by failing to present it in their initial brief, appellants\u2019 have waived the argument on appeal\u201d); <em>Beck v. Mangels, </em>100 Md.App. 144, 149, 640 A.2d 236 (1994); <em>Federal Land Bank of Baltimore, Inc. v. Esham, </em>43 Md.App. 446, 457-58, 406 A.2d 928 (1979) (\u201cIn prior cases where a party initially raised an issue but then failed to provide supporting argument, this Court has declined to consider the merits of the question so presented but not argued.\u201d). We are persuaded that the circuit court was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">II. Motion for Continuance</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">Appellants argue that the circuit court abused its discretion by refusing to grant a continuance.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Specifically, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>appellants argue that there was a \u201creasonable possibility that another signature card does exist\u201d and that the court abused its discretion by not allowing appellants to continue the discovery process. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">In the District Court action on October 3, 2000, Sheldon was first made aware, through discovery, that the Bank possessed only one signature card for Sheldon\u2019s account, dated July 1, 1984, at the time of the transaction.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In the Circuit Court action, appellants were again made aware, on May 2, 2001, through discovery, that the Bank did not have in its possession any other signature cards for Sheldon\u2019s account besides the July 1, 1984 signature card.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In addition, the Affidavit of Theresa A. Karamian, which was attached to the Bank\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>Motion for Summary Judgment against Sheldon, supports the undisputed fact that the only signature card on file with the Bank was the July 1, 1984 signature card. Thus, the only evidence of a contract between appellants and the Bank was the signature card. This signature card expressly authorized the Bank to disburse funds from the Sheldon account to either Ron or Christine Honeycutt.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">In <em>Utica Mutual Insurance Co. v. Miller, </em>130 Md.App. 373, 746 A.2d 935, <em>cert. denied, </em>359 Md. 31, 753 A.2d 3 (2000), appellant argued that \u201cit should have been permitted to conduct discovery before the circuit court ruled on appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment\u201d and added that \u201cdiscovery may have allowed it to raise issues of material fact that would defeat appellee\u2019s motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 390, 746 A.2d 935. The <em>Utica </em>Court held that the circuit court \u201cdid not err in granting appellee\u2019s summary judgment motion before allowing appellant to conduct discovery pertaining to other insurance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 395, 746 A.2d 935. The <em>Utica </em>Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-5\">A general allegation that there is a dispute of material fact is insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment. <em>See Lowman v. Consolidated Rail Corp., </em>68 Md.App. 64, 70, 509 A.2d 1239, <em>cert. denied, </em>307 Md. 406, 514 A.2d 24 (1986) (quoting <em>Brown v. Suburban Cadillac, Inc., </em>260 Md. 251, 257, 272 A.2d 42 (1971)). Moreover, the mere submission of an affidavit, or other evidence in opposition to a motion for summary judgment, does not ensure that a triable issue of fact will be generated. <em>See Bennett v. Baskin &amp; Sears, </em>77 Md.App. 56, 71, 549 A.2d 393 (1988). Even when there are factual disputes, when \u201cresolution of these disputes makes no difference in the determination of the legal question ... [the disputed facts] do not prevent the grant of summary judgment.\u201d <em>Seaboard Sur. Co. v. Richard F. Kline, Inc., </em>91 Md.App. 236, 247, 603 A.2d 1357 (1992).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-6\">[Md.] Rule 2-501(d) addresses the use of affidavits in contesting a summary judgment motion. It provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-7\">If the court is satisfied from the affidavit of a party opposing a motion for summary judgment that the facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>essential to justify the opposition cannot be set forth for reasons stated in the affidavit, the court may deny the motion or may order a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or discovery to be conducted or may enter any other order as justice requires.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-5\">In <em>A.J. Decoster Co. v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., </em>333 Md. 245, 634 A.2d 1330 (1994), the Court of Appeals addressed the requirements to justify additional discovery before a grant of summary judgment. In <em>Decoster, </em>the trial court granted a defendant\u2019s summary judgment motion on limitations grounds. The plaintiff argued that the trial court erred because if it was allowed to complete discovery, it may have been able to allege the existence of material facts that would have extended the limitations period. Conversely, the defendant argued that its affidavit supported the grant of summary judgment and mere speculation was not enough to generate an issue of material fact. <em>See id. </em>at 261, 634 A.2d 1330.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-6\">The Court of Appeals held that the trial court did not err in granting the motion for summary judgment. Writing for the Court, Chief Judge Murphy explained that \u201cwhile ... (a trial] court has discretion to deny a motion for summary judgment so that a more complete factual record can be developed, it is not reversible error if the court chooses not to do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 262-63, 634 A.2d 1330. Because the plaintiff below \u201cfailed to set forth facts controverting those proffered\u201d by the defendant, the Court held that the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 263, 634 A.2d 1330.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-7\"><em>Utica, </em>130 Md.App. at 391-92, 746 A.2d 935. <em>See also Chaires v.

The trial court had sufficient evidence before it to rule on the legal issues presented, and thus we are persuaded that it was not an abuse of discretion to deny a continuance pending further discovery. Appellants\u2019 factually unsupported theory that there may be another signature card is simply not enough to overcome summary judgment. <em>See Utica, </em>130 Md.App. at 391, 746 A.2d 935.

In 1992, Ron Honeycutt and Christine Honeycutt were divorced and, pursuant to the couple\u2019s separation agreement, Christine Honeycutt agreed to waive all of her interest in Sheldon, Inc., for the sum of $10,000.

From 1987 until the date of Ron Honeycutt\u2019s death in February 2000, the persons who did the banking at the Frankford Avenue branch, on behalf of Sheldon's Lounge, were Ron Honeycutt and his assistant, Nancy McLaughlin. Ms. McLaughlin was given power of attorney over the account in 1996. In addition, McLaughlin later married Ron Honeycutt and became Nancy Honeycutt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b634-10\">. In resolving a motion for summary judgment, the Court must decide whether there is any genuine dispute as to material facts, and if not, whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Beatty v. Trailmaster Products, Inc., </em>330 Md. 726, 737, 625 A.2d 1005, 1010 (1993). A trial court may grant summary judgment only if \"the motion and response show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Md. Rule 2-501(e). The Court must view the evidence and the permissible inferences from that evidence in a light most favorable to the plaintiffs. <em>See Houston v. Safeway, </em>346 Md. 503, 521, 697 A.2d 851, 860 (1997); <em>Impala Platinum v. Impala Sales, </em>283 Md. 296, 327, 389 A.2d 887, 905 (1978). Therefore, the non-moving party can defeat a motion for summary judgment by proffering facts that would be admissible in evidence in order to generate an issue that must be resolved by the trier of fact. <em>See A.J. Decoster Co. v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., </em>333 Md. 245, 261, 634 A.2d 1330, 1338 (1994); <em>Moura v. Randall, </em>119 Md.App. 632, 640, 705 A.2d 334, 338 (1998).

The interpretation of a written contract is ordinarily a question of law for the court and, therefore, is subject to <em>de novo </em>review by an appellate court. In determining the meaning of contractual language, Maryland courts have long adhered to the principle of the objective interpretation of contracts. Under the objective interpretation principle, where the language employed in a contract is unambiguous, a court shall give effect to its plain meaning and there is no need for further construction by the court. If a written contract is susceptible of a clear, unambiguous and definite understanding ... its construction is for the court to determine. Further, the clear and unambiguous language of an agreement will not give way to what the parties thought the agreement meant or was intended to mean.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\"><em>Wells </em>v. <em>Chevy Chase Bank, F.S.B., </em>363 Md. 232, 250-51, 768 A.2d 620 (2001) (citations and quotation marks omitted). <em>See also Auction &amp; Estate Representatives, Inc. v.

The Court of Appeals in <em>Taylor v.

In addition, the Maryland Uniform Commercial Code expressly recognizes the validity of a signature on negotiable instruments by an authorized representative, and provides that \"... the representative person is bound by the signature to the same extent the represented person would be bound if the signature were on a simple contract.\u201d <em>See </em>Md.Code Ann., Com.
