Because neither attacks the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the convictions, we need not and do not recite the facts of the crimes. Instead, we limit our opinion to an analysis of their respective contentions and the facts pertinent thereto. In the published portion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1235\">*1235</page-number>opinion, we evaluate Barillas\u2019s contention that he was denied his state constitutional right to counsel because his trial attorney was suspended from practice during the last three days of a six-day trial. In the nonpublished portion of the opinion, we consider Hurtado\u2019s contention that the trial court erred when it failed to obtain his <em>personal </em>waiver of presence at a readback to the jury of a portion of the trial testimony and we address the Attorney General\u2019s claims of sentencing error. Because we find no merit to either defendant\u2019s contention of error, we affirm the convictions, making minor modifications to the judgments to reflect the imposition of $200 restitution fines and the proper amount of conduct credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">Barillas Was Not Denied His State Constitutional Right to Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">\n<em>Factual Background to the Disciplinary Action</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">Barillas was represented by W. Merrill Davidson (Davidson). Davidson had been admitted to practice law in California in 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-9\">In November 1991, several years before Barillas\u2019s trial commenced, the State Bar of California (State Bar) initiated disciplinary proceedings against Davidson with issuance of an order to show cause.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b899-10\">On November 10, 1993, Davidson and the State Bar entered into a disposition of the matter. The State Bar dismissed several counts in return for Davidson\u2019s stipulation that he had commingled client trust funds with his own money.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The parties stipulated that Davidson was to be suspended for one year; that execution of the suspension be stayed; that Davidson be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1236\">*1236</page-number>placed upon probation for two years; and that during the first sixty days of that probationary term, Davidson would \u201cbe actually suspended from the practice of law in the State of California.\u201d The stipulation provided that the probationary period and the period of actual suspension for 60 days would commence on \u201cthe date on which the order of the Supreme Court in this matter becomes effective.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">On April 27, 1994, the Supreme Court filed an order implementing the stipulated disposition, including Davidson\u2019s actual suspension from the practice of law for 60 days. Rule 953(a) of the California Rules of Court provides that a disciplinary order becomes effective 30 days after it has been filed. Thus, Davidson\u2019s suspension took effect on Friday, May 27, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">\n<em>Defendant\u2019s Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">Trial commenced on Monday, May 23, 1994, with voir dire. No proceedings were conducted on May 24. The People presented their case on May 25, 26, and 27. Barillas testified on his own behalf on Friday, May 27. The case recessed for the three-day Memorial Day weekend. On Tuesday, May 31, the parties presented closing argument, the court instructed the jury, and deliberations commenced. On Wednesday, June 1, the jury found Barillas guilty as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">On August 8, Barillas moved for a new trial based on Davidson\u2019s suspension.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court asked Davidson when he had learned that the order of suspension had been filed. He responded: \u201cIt actually\u2014It was after the jury reached a verdict and we had set the matter down for P&amp;S, and because\u2014It was the day after the verdict that I became aware of the suspension. . . . [\u00b6] The effective date would be the 3rd of June, because that is the date I received notice. That is the date I got actual notice. The suspension was supposed to have taken effective [sic] May 27, and that was after the\u2014We were still in trial at that time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b900-8\">The court ruled: \u201cThe defendant having been in trial, the trial having already been engaged, and the fact that the attorney did not receive notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1237\">*1237</page-number>until after the conclusion of the entire trial . . . , I do not see merit to defendant\u2019s claim. ...[\u00b6] I just do not see any failure in representation. I should indicate as well that during the course of the trial I saw no defect in the representation by the defense. Consequently, your request for a new trial, based on that ground, is denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">In two recent cases, our Supreme Court addressed the issue of the relationship between trial counsel\u2019s license to practice law and the defendant\u2019s state constitutional right to counsel.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The first is <em>In re Johnson </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 689 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 170, 822 P.2d 1317]. In that case, Johnson had been represented by Raymond Hane (Hane) who, pursuant to Business and Professions Code section 6102, had been automatically suspended from the practice of law following his conviction of child molestation. While formal disciplinary proceedings were pending, Hane submitted his resignation to the State Bar. Thereafter, Hane represented Johnson at trial. The State Bar accepted Hane\u2019s resignation after Johnson had been sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">In a subsequent habeas corpus proceeding, Johnson sought to set aside his conviction on the basis he had been denied his constitutional right to counsel. The court first considered and rejected the claim that Hane\u2019s automatic suspension was sufficient to demonstrate Johnson had been denied the right to counsel. \u201cWe are not persuaded that a suspension under section 6102 [of the Business and Professions Code] alone creates a presumption of incompetence or deprives the defendant of his right to the \u2018fully licensed attorney\u2019 contemplated by article I, section 15. Commission of any felony or other offense that may have involved moral turpitude triggers the suspension <em>whether or not the crime was related to the attorney\u2019s practice or affected the quality of the attorney\u2019s representation of clients. . . . </em>An attorney who is professionally competent does not become any less competent upon the filing of an order made pursuant to section 6102 suspending the attorney from practice. The date on which such an order is filed has no bearing on the attorney\u2019s knowledge or ability.\u201d (1 Cal.4th at pp. 696-697, italics added.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1238\">*1238</page-number>The court then went on to explain that an automatic suspension based upon the attorney\u2019s conviction of a crime of moral turpitude\u2014such as the offense committed by Hane\u2014did not necessarily establish that the attorney was \u201cunfit to practice, let alone incompetent\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 697) and that was a matter to be resolved in the subsequent disciplinary proceeding. The court concluded that Hane\u2019s suspension \u201cin and of itself did not establish, as a matter of law, that he was unfit to practice law. Moreover, a conclusion that an attorney who has committed an offense of moral turpitude is unfit to practice law is not necessarily a judgment on the attorney\u2019s professional competence. We do not presume that a suspended attorney lacks professional competence. \u2018Merely because an attorney has been disciplined for some infraction of the rules by which he must abide is no reason for assuming that he is not a qualified and efficient lawyer. Erring morally or by breach of professional ethics does not necessarily indicate a lack of knowledge of the law.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 699.)</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">The Supreme Court then turned to the issue of the legal significance of Hane\u2019s resignation from the State Bar <em>prior to </em>representing Johnson at trial. It held that \u201crepresentation by a member of the State Bar is now essential if the constitutional guaranty [of the right to counsel] is to be satisfied.\u201d <em>(In re Johnson, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at pp. 700-701.) It concluded that representation by an individual who, although formerly licensed, has resigned from the State Bar, results in a denial of the right to counsel as a matter of law. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 701.) \u201cThe court will not examine the quality of the representation in such cases since an essential element of the constitutional right to counsel is counsel\u2019s status as a member of the State Bar.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>On that basis, it found Johnson had met his burden of establishing he had been denied the right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">The other relevant Supreme Court case is <em>People </em>v. <em>Sanchez </em>(1995) 12 Cal.4th 1 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 843, 906 P.2d 1129]. There, a disciplinary proceeding was pending against defense counsel Toton at the time he commenced representation of Sanchez in a death penalty matter. The allegations primarily involved Toton\u2019s handling of money received on behalf of his clients. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 37.) Toton was ultimately disbarred a month after the trial was completed. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 39.) On appeal, one issue was whether Sanchez had been denied his state constitutional right to counsel. The court found that he had not. Relying upon its reasoning in <em>In re Johnson, supra, </em>the court concluded \u201cthat the fact disciplinary proceedings were pending against counsel Toton did not <em>automatically </em>render Toton\u2019s performance inadequate or prejudice defendant\u2019s right to effective counsel. [Citation.] ... In fact, unlike the attorney in <em>Johnson, </em>Toton was a member of the State Bar at all times during his representation of defendant. \u2018\u201cErring morally or by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1239\">*1239</page-number>breach of professional ethics does not necessarily indicate a lack of knowledge of the law.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] We simply are not persuaded that Toton\u2019s unrelated disciplinary problems in any way influenced his representation of defendant or otherwise rendered him unfit as a matter of law. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sanchez, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at p. 44, original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">As we shall explain, we believe the tenor of our Supreme Court\u2019s analyses in <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Sanchez </em>compels rejection of Barillas\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On its face, <em>Johnson </em>is distinguishable from this case because there counsel\u2019s suspension was automatically triggered by his felony conviction and was an interim measure pending a formal disciplinary proceeding whereas here Davidson\u2019s suspension was the ultimate disciplinary measure imposed following a stipulated resolution of the charges first lodged against him. That fact is important because one reason <em>Johnson </em>rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that automatic suspension equates with a presumption of incompetence or denial of the right to counsel was that the significance of the conviction was a matter to be adjudicated in the subsequent disciplinary action. (See 1 Cal.4th at pp. 696-699.) That element is not present here because by the time of Barillas\u2019s trial, the nature and scope of Davidson\u2019s discipline had been fully resolved. Nonetheless, we cannot conclude that Davidson\u2019s suspension automatically resulted in a denial of Barillas\u2019s right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">One of the themes in <em>Johnson </em>is that not every professional delict automatically demonstrates incompetence but that its factual underpinnings must be carefully examined in order to decide if representation by the disciplined attorney has violated a criminal defendant\u2019s right to counsel. (1 Cal.4th at pp. 699-700.) \u201cDiscipline is imposed on the basis of an attorney\u2019s criminal conduct or violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct in order to protect the public from dishonest or corrupt attorneys <em>as well as from those who fail to provide competent professional services. </em>Suspension or disbarment may be deemed necessary to protect clients from dangers other than inadequate representation, and to maintain public confidence in the bar. Although, in some cases, misconduct occurs in the course of representation of a client, and adversely affects the quality of representation, this is not invariably so.\u201d <em>(In re Johnson, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 697, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">Here, the basis of Davidson\u2019s suspension was his commingling of client funds with his own money. This does not demonstrate incompetence to provide an adequate defense in a criminal proceeding. In general, breach of a professional ethical obligation does not necessarily indicate a lack of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1240\">*1240</page-number>knowledge of the law. <em>(In re Johnson, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 699.) In specific, review of Davidson\u2019s State Bar disciplinary file demonstrates that, in this case, counsel\u2019s deviation was not the functional equivalent of a professional incompetence. Nothing in the file indicates that Davidson lacked the skills a criminal defendant could reasonably expect counsel to possess. On the contrary, the file refers to \u201cmany letters of recommendation from lawyers and judges\u201d about Davidson. The misconduct which formed the basis of the suspension is characterized as \u201caberrational.\u201d Davidson recognized his actions were improper and was appropriately remorseful. In sum, Davidson\u2019s suspension was unrelated to the issue of his competency as a criminal defense attorney. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Sanchez, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at p. 44.) Stated another way, while Davidson\u2019s violation of a professional duty rendered him unfit to practice law, the particular violation and subsequent suspension did not affect his professional competence insofar as representation of Barillas is concerned. We therefore conclude that Davidson\u2019s suspension during the last three days of a six-day trial did not result in a denial of Barillas\u2019s state constitutional right to counsel.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">In light of this analysis, we reject Barillas\u2019s request that we remand the matter for a \u201cfull evidentiary hearing surrounding the circumstances of counsel\u2019s suspension and when he actually received notice [of the suspension].\u201d The circumstances surrounding the suspension are fully explained in the State Bar file, the contents of which we have taken judicial notice. (See fn. 1, <em>ante.) </em>Barillas fails to suggest what additional information would be gained at an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">Nor would there be any value to a hearing on the issue of when Davidson actually received notice of the suspension order. The implicit thrust of this request is the argument that the trial court erred when it credited Davidson\u2019s explanation that he did not have <em>actual </em>knowledge of the suspension until June 3, after the jury returned its verdicts. This approach misses the mark. Rule 953(a) of the California Rules of Court provides that a disciplinary order is effective 30 days after its filing by the Supreme Court. That rule controls this situation and means that Davidson\u2019s suspension became effective during trial on May 27. The date Davidson actually received, opened, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1241\">*1241</page-number>and read the order is legally irrelevant to the issues raised and decided in this appeal. The fact, be it a fact, that a disciplined attorney such as Davidson knew about the disciplinary order but nonetheless continued to represent a criminal defendant could very well affect the State Bar\u2019s attitude toward the attorney (e.g., did counsel willfully disobey a disciplinary order?)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but it would have no impact on the nature of the representation afforded. We therefore return to our earlier conclusion. Davidson <em>was </em>suspended from the practice of law during the last three days of the trial but that fact, in and of itself, is insufficient to establish Barillas was denied his right to effective counsel. If Barillas wishes to pursue a claim of inadequate representation, he must meet the criteria established by case law (see, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Pope </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 412 [152 Cal.Rptr. 732, 590 P.2d 859, 2 A.L.R.4th 1] and <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(1984) 466 U.S. 668 [80 L.Ed.2d 674, 104 S.Ct. 2052]), a path he has not pursued on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">III-V<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b905-8\">The judgment as to defendant Hurtado is modified: (1) to provide that he has custody credit for 344 total days, including 114 days conduct credit; and (2) to reflect the imposition of a $200 restitution fine pursuant to Government Code section 13967.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-9\">The judgment as to defendant Barillas is modified to reflect the imposition of a $200 restitution fine pursuant to Government Code section 13967.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-10\">As so modified, both judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-11\">Epstein, J., and Hastings, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b899-11\">Barillas requested we take judicial notice of five documents generated by the State Bar in regard to the disciplinary action.

In February 1988, Respondent [Davidson] was employed by Elaine Hodges (\u2018Hodges\u2019) to handle a legal matter related to the care and support of her then-living grandmother, Ruby Gilmore (\u2018Gilmore\u2019). [\u00b6]2. Respondent was required to hold in trust approximately $32,000.00 on behalf of Hodges for the purpose of paying Gilmore\u2019s expenses. Respondent deposited the $32,000.00 into his personal money market account number 001-804049 at Culver National Bank and business savings account number 001-404059 at Culver National Bank, rather than placing the money in a trust account. [\u00b6]3. Respondent withdrew funds from the aforementioned accounts and combined the funds with his own cash in a safe at his residence. Thereafter, Respondent utilized cash from his safe to purchase cashier\u2019s checks, which he provided to Hodges for the purpose of paying Gilmore\u2019s expenses. [\u00b6]4. Respondent commingled the funds of his client with his personal funds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ayn\">The stipulation further recites that Davidson\u2019s actions were a willful violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct, rule 4-100(A). That rule provides: \u201cAll funds received or held for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1236\">*1236</page-number>the benefit of clients by a member or law firm, including advances for costs and expenses, shall be deposited in one or more identifiable bank accounts labelled \u2018Trust Account,\u2019 \u2018Client\u2019s Funds Account\u2019 or words of similar import, maintained in the State of California, or, with written consent of the client, in any other jurisdiction where there is a substantial relationship between the client or the client\u2019s business and the other jurisdiction.

In <em>People </em>v. <em>Medler </em>(1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 927 [223 Cal.Rptr. 401], a divided Court of Appeal held that a defendant had not established he had been denied effective assistance of counsel merely because his trial attorney had been suspended from practice at the time of trial because of nonpayment of State Bar dues. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Hinkley </em>(1987) 193 Cal.App.3d 383 [238 Cal.Rptr. 272], the appellate court concluded that the defendant had been denied his constitutional right to counsel because at the time of trial, the attorney\u2019s practice had been taken over by the superior court based upon a finding that he was incompetent as a matter of law to represent his clients.
