Perez marshaled defendants, Calvin Reese and Shean Watkins, to help her recover the property. Unfortunately, defendants interpreted their mission as a license to commit burglary (count I [Pen. Code, \u00a7 459; all subsequent undesignated section references are to the Penal Code]) assault with a firearm (count II [\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(2)]), and robbery (count III [\u00a7211]). Defendant Reese was accused of personally using a firearm while committing these acts (\u00a7 12022.5, subd. (a)), and defendant Watkins was accused of being armed with a rifle while committing them (\u00a7 12022, subd. (a)(1)). Defendant Reese was additionally accused of being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm (count IV [\u00a7 12021]). Both allegedly had prior records which brought them within the scope of section 667, subdivisions (a) and (b)-(i).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">A jury convicted defendants of the above mentioned crimes (except as to count II, on which Watkins alone was acquitted) and found the weapons enhancements true. The trial court found the allegations of prior convictions true. Sentenced to lengthy terms in state prison, defendants claim a host of errors going to both the convictions and the sentences. In the published portion of the opinion, we conclude the trial court erroneously admitted a videotape of the conditional examination of a witness, but the error is harmless. In the unpublished portion of the opinion, we consider and reject defendants\u2019 other contentions of prejudicial error. We shall therefore affirm the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">Factual and Procedural Background<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Prosecution witness Jeffrey Arrich was unavailable to testify at trial because he had to leave the state by the time of trial. When informed of this fact, the trial court ordered a conditional examination of Arrich on videotape pursuant to section 1335 et sequitur.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A written transcript of the examination was also prepared. Over defendants\u2019 objection that only the reading of the written transcript of the testimony at trial was authorized by law, the court then admitted the videotape in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Renewing their unsuccessful argument below, defendants contend it was prejudicial error to admit the videotape in lieu of the written transcript of the testimony. We agree admission of the videotape was error but conclude the error is harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">In approaching the issue tendered by defendants, we are mindful that, \u201cWhether this court believes videotaping is as reliable as, or more advantageous than, the traditional means of recording a deposition is not the issue. Rather, the question presented is whether the use of videotape for the recording and reporting of deposition testimony has been <em>authorized, </em>by the Legislature.\u201d <em>(Bailey </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 970, 977 [140 Cal.Rptr. 669, 568 P.2d 394], original italics [no statutory warrant for videotaping of civil deposition]; see also <em>Edmiston </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 699, 704 [150 Cal.Rptr. 276, 586 P.2d 590] [no statutory warrant for videotaping medical examination in civil case].) The procedures for taking a deposition in a criminal case may not conflict with statutory procedures governing conditional examinations set out in the Penal Code. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(Runyan) (1978) 20 Cal.3d 523, 528 [143 Cal.Rptr. 609, 574 P.2d 425, 2 A.L.R.4th 681].)</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">The procedures for the taking and use of a deposition of a witness in a criminal case are set out in sections 1335 through 1345, dealing with the conditional examination of a witness.  In construing this statutory scheme \u201c \u2018We begin with the fundamental rule that a court \u201cshould ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.\u201d [Citation.] In determining such intent \u201c[t]he court turns first tp the words <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>themselves for the answer.\u201d [Citation.] We are required to give effect to statutes \u201caccording to the usual, ordinary import of the language employed in framing them.\u201d [Citations.] \u201cIf possible, significance should be given to every word, phrase, sentence and part of an act in pursuance of the legislative purpose.\u201d [Citation.] \u201c[A] construction making some words surplusage is to be avoided.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 <em>(Moyer </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 222, 230 .. . .)\u201d <em>(Woosley </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 758, 775-776 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 30, 838 P.2d 758].)</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">In arguing that the statutory scheme does not allow admission of a videotaped deposition, defendants cite section 1343, which provides, \u201cThe testimony given by the witness <em>must be reduced to writing, </em>and authenticated in the same manner as the testimony of a witness taken in support of an information.\u201d (Italics added.) If the statute is given its ordinary meaning, it plainly requires that the testimony shall be reduced to writing, not videotaping.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">The Attorney General disputes this view. The Attorney General acknowledges he has issued an opinion concluding a videotape of a conditional examination may not be used in lieu of a written transcript. (67 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 178 (1984).) However, he now contends his prior opinion was in error. According to the Attorney General, the requirement of section 1343, that testimony must be reduced to writing, must be read together with Evidence Code section 250, which provides: \u201c \u2018Writing\u2019 means handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording upon any tangible thing any form of communication or representation, including letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combinations thereof.\u201d Since this broad definition of a \u201cwriting\u201d includes a videotape, the Attorney General argues that the requirement of section 1343, that testimony be reduced to writing, is satisfied by videotaping the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">We cannot accept the Attorney General\u2019s new argument. The Evidence Code applies in criminal proceedings \u201cExcept as otherwise provided by statute . . . .\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 300.) Here, a written transcript of a conditional examination is \u201cotherwise provided by statute\u201d for three reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">First, the Attorney General\u2019s argument proves too much. If Evidence Code section 250 governs the recording of deposition testimony, then it authorizes \u201cevery . . . means of recording upon any tangible thing any form of communication . . . .\u201d The statute would thus authorize widely disparate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>modes of recording testimony, ranging from videotapes to audiotapes to computer applications. We do not believe the Legislature intended that the recording of deposition testimony be subject to such wide fluctuations in the mode of recording.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Second, the Attorney General\u2019s construction of section 1343 cannot be reconciled with a companion statute, section 1345.  \u201c \u2018It is \u201ca cardinal rule of statutory construction\u201d that \u201c \u2018every statute should be construed with reference to the whole system of law of which it is a part so that all may be harmonized and have effect.\u2019\u201d [Citations.]\u201d\u2019 <em>(Ladd </em>v. <em>County of San Mateo </em>(1996) 12 Cal.4th 913, 927 [50 Cal.Rptr.2d 309, 911 P.2d 496].)  Section 1345 provides in relevant part, \u201cThe deposition . . . may be <em>read </em>in evidence by either party on the trial if the court finds that the witness is unavailable as a witness . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) A videotape is not \u201cread\u201d in evidence; rather, it is \u201cshown\u201d to the trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Finally, \u201cThe interpretation of an ambiguous statutory phrase may be aided by reference to other statutes which apply to similar or analogous subjects. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Woodhead </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1002, 1008 [239 Cal.Rptr. 656, 741 P.2d 154].)  We note that the Legislature knows how to authorize the videotaping of a deposition if it wishes to do so, because it has done so expressly in civil cases. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 2025, subd. (/).) Where the Legislature has authorized videotaped depositions in civil cases, it has accompanied this authorization by elaborate statutory guidelines, set forth in the margin,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> regulating the conditions under which the deposition is taken and circumstances of its admission in evidence. These <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>guidelines are evidently designed to ensure fairness in the deposition procedure and to provide procedures for ruling on objections before the videotape is shown to the trier of fact. We cannot believe that the Legislature would go to such great lengths to ensure fairness in a civil videotaped deposition, where only money may change hands, and yet make no provision for such fairness in the taking of a criminal deposition, where a defendant\u2019s freedom is at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">For all these reasons, then, we conclude the statutory scheme governing conditional examinations does not authorize the admission in evidence of a videotaped deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">The Attorney General relies on <em>People </em>v. <em>Moran </em>(1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 398 [114 Cal.Rptr. 413] and <em>People </em>v. <em>Ware </em>(1978) 78 Cal.App.3d 822 [144 Cal.Rptr. 354]. <em>Moran </em>involved the use of a videotape of a witness\u2019s preliminary hearing testimony. The case does not discuss the statutory framework governing conditional examinations and is therefore inapposite. Like <em>Moran, Ware </em>also involved the use of a videotape of a witness\u2019s preliminary hearing testimony. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ware, supra, </em>78 Cal.App.3d at p. 822.) Although the court concluded the videotaped preliminary hearing amounted to a conditional examination <em>(id. </em>at p. 828) the court undertook no analysis of the statutory scheme governing conditional examinations. To the extent <em>Ware </em>suggests the statutory scheme authorizes the admission in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>evidence of a videotape of a conditional examination, we respectfully decline to follow it.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">We conclude the trial court erred in admitting the videotape over defendants\u2019 express objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">We must still decide, however, what standard of prejudice applies. Defendants assert that we must (as it were) redact the trial so as to expunge Arrich\u2019s testimony and decide whether the remaining evidence would support their convictions. They fail to explain why we should do so, however. If the trial court had granted their motion to exclude the videotape of Arrich\u2019s examination, it would presumably have admitted instead the written transcript of that examination as defense counsel proposed; thus the evidence would have been before the jury in any event.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Defendant Reese raises the claim that the trial court\u2019s error was of constitutional dimension; he asserts that the court violated the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and the California Constitution\u2019s separation of powers provision (Cal. Const., art. Ill, \u00a7 3).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He cites no authority other than the constitutional provisions themselves, however, and makes no articulated argument as to how they were violated. Thus his constitutional claim is waived. <em>(Troensegaard </em>v. <em>Silvercrest Industries, Inc. </em>(1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 218, 228 [220 Cal.Rptr. 712].)</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">We conclude that the applicable standard of reversible error is the standard ordinarily applied to claims of evidentiary error, that of <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243], i.e., whether it is reasonably probable defendants would have obtained a more favorable result in the absence of the error. Under this standard, the error was plainly harmless. Defendants have pointed to no inherent unfairness in the use of the videotape. Defense counsel cross-examined Arrich fully and made effective use of any internal inconsistencies and contradictions with other evidence they found in his story. We see no reasonable probability that defendants would have achieved a better result if the court had admitted a written transcript of Arrich\u2019s testimony instead of the videotape.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>II-VII<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Puglia, P.
