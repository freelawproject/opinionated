Code, \u00a7 288, subd. (a))<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and two counts of annoying or molesting a child under eighteen (\u00a7 647.6), with allegations of two 1989 lewd act convictions (\u00a7 288, subd. (a)) as prior \u201cstrikes\u201d under the legislative version of three strikes (\u00a7 667, subds. (b)-(i)). A jury found him guilty of one lewd act and one molest count, each regarding two-year-old Sara K. (counts III and IV), but deadlocked as to the two other counts, regarding eight-year-old Shawnte A. (counts I and II). In bifurcated trial to the court, the priors were found true (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (a), (d) and (e), 667.51, subd. (a)). Stofle appeals following his sentence to two concurrent terms of twenty-five years to life.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">All four counts concerned events of May 6, 1994, when Stofle attended a day-long party and gathering of relatives at a cousin\u2019s cabin. Present were a couple, Jeff (Stofle\u2019s cousin) and Dee Dee, and their four children\u2014Sara and Shawnte included. All were to spend the night there, and the children and some adults were sleeping on the cabin floor. Sometime after 9 p.m., Jeff and Dee Dee got into an argument. Jeff walked out, and Dee Dee went out to look for him. Stofle helped look briefly but then went back to the cabin.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">When Jeff and Dee Dee later returned together to the cabin, they found everyone inside apparently asleep and Stofle lying on the floor next to two-year-old Sara. Dee Dee had dressed Sara in a nightgown and panties and zipped up her \u201cBarney\u201d sleeping bag all the way, but Stofle\u2019s blanket now covered them both. Jeff, concerned because he heard that Stofle had molested a young girl in the past, had Dee Dee go and check on Sara. She did and, when she pulled the blanket back, saw that Sara\u2019s sleeping bag was unzipped all the way, her panties were pulled down to midthigh and her buttocks were exposed. When she reached down to pick Sara up, her right hand felt Stofle\u2019s erect penis next to the child\u2019s buttocks, and Dee Dee saw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>that his jeans fly was opened. She \u201cfreaked,\u201d picked Sara up quickly, ran into the bedroom and told Jeff.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">That was the basis for the two charges which the jury sustained. Not sustained were the two regarding eight-year-old Shawnte, who came to Jeff afterward and told him that while he and Dee Dee were outside the cabin, Stofle had come to her, told her, \u201cYour dad said for me to give you a goodnight kiss,\u201d and then \u201cFrench kissed\u201d her and rubbed her bottom. Dee Dee summoned police, who interviewed Shawnte and arrested Stofle.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Under a limiting instruction confining its use to show common design or plan, jurors learned that Stofle had in May 1988 molested a six-year-old girl, Sara D., in similar circumstances, by kissing her and placing his hand between her legs, possibly penetrating her vagina with his finger. Those acts led to Stofle\u2019s 1989 prior \u201cstrikes\u201d (for offenses of May 3 and 4, 1988), but jurors were not told this or that he had been convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">\n<em>Uncharged-acts evidence</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>*</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\"><em>Pre-enactment \u201cstrikes\u201d </em>*</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">\n<em>Separation of powers*</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">\n<em>Vagueness of punishment*</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">\n<em>Vagueness of credits</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b240-12\">Under a separate heading, Stofle argues that subdivision (c)(5) of section 667, in limiting in-prison credits to \u201cone-fifth of the total term,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is void for vagueness because it fails to \u201cspecify[] how this limitation is to be applied . . . .\u201d He argues that there are \u201cat least three, equally reasonable[,] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>methods of applying the limitation\u201d and that any method chosen by the Department of Correction to implement the provision would be \u201carbitrary\u201d and \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d as likely to affect unspecified \u201ccertain prisoners\u201d \u201cmore adversely\u201d than others. The Attorney General responds: (1) the claim \u201cis not yet ripe\u201d since Stofle had not yet been granted or denied credits by the time of judgment and had many years to go before reaching his minimum eligible parole date (MEPD); (2) Stofle lacks standing to raise hypothetical situations which he posits; and (3) the subject credits do not apply to him\u2014a \u201cthird strike\u201d defendant sentenced to an indeterminate as opposed to determinate term. Without deciding ripeness, we find the latter two points dis-positive. Stofle does not show that the credits limitation is fatally vague in all situations, and he is thus limited to an as-applied challenge to those aspects affecting his own case. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sipe </em>(1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 468, 480-481 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 266].) His problem, we agree, is that the limitation simply does not apply to the indeterminate term which he received.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Subdivision (c)(5) of section 667 refers to \u201ccredits awarded pursuant to\u201d section 2930 et seq. (fn. 3, <em>ante), </em>and the parties agree that the relevant section in that article is section 2933. That section does allow credits greater than the one-fifth limitation, but it expressly applies to persons sentenced to state prison \u201cunder Section 1170\u201d (\u00a72933, subd. (a)), which by its terms applies to \u201cdeterminate sentences\u201d (\u00a7 1170, subd. (a)). Stofle\u2019s term of 25 years to life is <em>indeterminate </em>(see \u00a7 669), and he offers no reply to this analysis as offered in the respondent\u2019s brief. Anticipating a reply which never came, the Attorney General correctly notes that the Penal Code does specially allow credits to apply in some indeterminate life terms with parole m\u00ednimums. This is done by a clear statement that the credits \u201cshall apply to reduce any minimum term\u201d specified in that subdivision or section (see, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 190, subds. (a) and (c), 217.1, subd. (b), 667.51, subd. (d), 667.61, subd. (j), 667.7, subd. (a)(1), 667.71, subd. (b), 667.72, subd. (b); 667.75, and 2933.1, subd. (b); but see <em>People </em>v. <em>Jenkins </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 234, 247 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 903, 893 P.2d 1224] [for reasons of intent and to avoid absurd results, construing \u00a7 667.7 as limiting murderers to \u00a7 190 credits]), and effectively allows an earlier MEPD. However, the statement regarding credits in three strikes is different. It does not say that the credits \u201cshall apply\u201d to any specified life or minimum term; it simply limits \u201c[t]he total amount of credits awarded,\u201d without mention of indeterminate terms (fn. 3, <em>ante). </em>In these circumstances, we must apply the general rule that release on parole is barred until a specified minimum term has elapsed (\u00a7 3046). The credit limitation is not vague as to Stofle\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>\n<em>Concurrent terms as double punishment</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>*</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">\n<em>Five-year enhancement*</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">\n<em>Dual use of prior as double punishment*</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">\n<em>Urgency measure validity*</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">The judgment is modified (1) to stay execution of the term of 25 years to life imposed on count IV, such stay to become permanent when service of sentence under count III is completed <em>(In re Adams </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 629, 637 [122 Cal.Rptr. 73, 536 P.2d 473]), and (2) to impose an additional 5 years for the found-true enhancement allegation of prior serious felony conviction (\u00a7 667, subd. (a)(1)). As so modified, the judgment is affirmed. Because the addition of the mandatory five-year enhancement term may alter the superior court\u2019s determination of the propriety of the total length of sentence (cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Burns </em>(1984) 158 Cal.App.3d 1178, 1181-1184 [205 Cal.Rptr. 356]), the cause is remanded to that court for the purpose of entertaining any application which Stofle may make, within thirty days of the finality of this opinion, for the superior court to exercise any discretion it may have to strike a prior \u201cstrike\u201d on the motion of counsel or on its own motion in the furtherance of justice under section 1385 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Romero) </em>(S045097), argued and submitted Apr. 2, 1996<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark>).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">Kline, P.
