The judge of compensation found that she was a \u201cgratuitous employee\u201d not entitled to compensation, noting that she was not paid for her efforts and was motivated solely by maternal kindness.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">It is undisputed that petitioner\u2019s son was an employee of respondent. Petitioner\u2019s undisputed proofs also established that it was a standard practice, encouraged by respondent, for newsboys who could not complete their appointed rounds to engage a substitute. Two other mothers who had acted as substitutes testified' for petitioner. Petitioner testified that she was given her son\u2019s papers by respondent\u2019s \u201cbranch manager.\u201d The branch manager\u2019s mother, who did most of the hiring of children in his area, testified that respondent was not and did not wish to be notified every time a substitute delivered papers.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\"> It is clear that one who volunteers his services and neither receives nor expects to receive payment is not an employee for workers\u2019 compensation purposes. <em>Cerniglia v. Passaic, </em>50 <em>N. J. Super. </em>201 (App. Div. 1958); <em>Armitage v. Trustees of Mt. Fern M. E. Church, </em>33 <em>N. J. Super. </em>367 (Cty. Ct. 1954) ; 1A <em>Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, </em>\u00a7 47.41 (1973). However, here petitioner did not volunteer to provide gratuitous services to respondent. She merely substituted for her son, performing the same services at the same expense to respondent. While monetary reward is a necessary component of an employment relationship, that reward need not flow to the person doing the work. See 1A <em>Larson, op. cit., </em>\u00a7 47.41 at 8.163. n. 1. and eases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>Despondent clothed petitioner\u2019s son with the authority to engage a substitute. Despondent did not wish to be advised of specific substitutions, which occurred routinely in the course of its business. Despondent had at least implied notice of this particular substitution, as its \u201cbranch manager\u201d gave the papers to petitioner. We therefore conclude that an implied contract of employment arose between petitioner and respondent and that she is thus entitled to compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">We find it unnecessary to consider petitioner\u2019s assertion that respondent should be required to provide compensation under the \u201cemergency services\u201d doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Lastly, we reject respondent\u2019s claim that petitioner was not an employee for workers\u2019 compensation purposes because her employment was \u201ccasual.\u201d N. J. <em>S. A. </em>34:15-36. Unavailability of newsboys due to illness and other causes was a regular occurrence and the employment of substitutes thus did not constitute casual employment. See <em>Graham v. Green, </em>31 N. J. 207 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">Reversed and remanded for a determination of nature and extent of petitioner\u2019s disability.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
