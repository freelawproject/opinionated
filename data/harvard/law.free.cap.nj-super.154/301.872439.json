Consequently he denied the motion in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The motion was brought pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:50-1(f), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-7\">On motion, with briefs, and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or his legal representative from a final judgment, order or proceeding for the following reasons: * * * (f) any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment or order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">Before proceeding to the merits of the issues raised in this appeal, we observe that a plenary hearing is not mandated <em>ipso facto </em>by a motion. In <em>Shaw v. </em>Shaw, 138 <em>N. J. Super. </em>436, 440 (App. Div. 1976), we held that wheire the affidavits do not show the existence of a genuine issue of material fact the trial judge need not take oral testimony and may decide the motion without a plenary hearing. In <em>Skillman v. Skillman, </em>136 <em>N. J. Super. </em>348, 350 (App. Div. 1975), we referred to the need for a \"sufficient <em>prima facie </em>case\u201d to entitle a moving party to a plenary hearing. See also <em>Hallberg v. </em>Hallberg, 113 <em>N. J. Super. </em>205, 208 (App. Div. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">There is, of course, no doubt that plaintiff was not entitled to either a reopening of the judgment or to a rescission of the settlement agreement merely by virtue of her affidavit and certifications. The fundamental issue before us is whether she was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on the basis of the record made below. The answer to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>question in the light of the holdings of <em>Shaw, Skillman </em>and <em>Hallberg, supra, </em>depends upon whether that record indicates that there was a reasonable probability that plaintiff might be entitled to the relief sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">In the words of <em>Court Invest. Co. v. Perillo, </em>48 <em>N. J. </em>334 (1966):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-5\">Such a motion under (f) is addressed to the discretion of the trial court. That discretion is a broad one to be exercised according to equitable principles, and the decision reached by the trial court will be accepted by an appellate tribunal in the absence of an abuse of its discretion. No categorization can be made of the situations which would warrant redress under <em>subsection </em>(f). As Justice Proctor noted in <em>Hodgson v. Applegate, </em>31 N. <em>J. </em>29, 41 (1959), the very essence of (f) is its capacity for relief in exceptional situations. And in such exceptional cases its boundaries are as expansive as the need to achieve equity and justice, [at 341]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">The parties separated in 1973, after ten years of a marriage which produced two daughters. In 1975 the children were six and four years of age. On January 19, 1974 plaintiff engaged the attorney who represented her until after the divorce proceedings were completed. That attorney filed the action for divorce in October 1974. There is no dispute that the challenged agreement was the product of negotiations for a considerable interval before it was executed on June 4, 1975 and its subsequent revisions on June 17, July <em>2 </em>and July 16, 1975. On August 7, 1975 plaintiff testified at the divorce hearing before the same Judge from whose order this appeal was taken. At the conclusion of the hearing the agreement was made a part of the Judgment by reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">The settlement agreement is not unconventional either in form or in substance. Essentially, it provides for custody of the children in plaintiff with rights of visitation for defendant. The children are to be supported by defendant by payment to plaintiff of $5,000 a year for each and certain other benefits at defendant\u2019s expense, such as summer camp, medical care and being named as beneficiaries in a life insurance policy on defendant. Plaintiff received $40,000 a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>year by way of permanent alimony (subject to her payment of income taxes thereon), a lump sum support payment of $12,750, a new automobile, life insurance on defendant\u2019s life and the use of a New York City apartment rent free for one year. Under the caption \u201cEquitable Distribution\u201d defendant agreed to pay to plaintiff by certain installments, tax-free to her, the sum of $250,000, together with interest on the unpaid balances, \u201cin full and complete satisfaction of any and all claims which [she] may have against [him] including her rights to equitable distribution under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:34-23 * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s affidavit in essence asserts that as the consequence of mental problems engendered by her husband\u2019s infidelity, indifference to and mistreatment of her:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-6\">When I executed the Property Settlement Agreement and authorized the subsequent consent Order of Divorce which incorporated by reference that Agreement, I was suffering a nervous breakdown and was mentally incompetent. I did not then have the emotional and intellectual ability to handle my matters and to deal realistically with the issues which faced me at that time, * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">By letter certification addressed to plaintiff\u2019s attorney, Dr. A. David Etess, a psychiatrist of New York City, stated that plaintiff \u201cwas in a psychoanalytically-oriented psycho-therapeutic relationship\u201d with him from April 8, 1974 to July 30, 1975, first on a bi-weekly and later on a weekly basis. His opinions as to her mental state are not focused on any specific time but range over the approximately 16 months that he saw her. He certified that her \u201cjudgment was faulty and she had no capacity to comprehend or follow through (goal directed) on any insights, suggestions or interpretations that were made to her.\u201d She failed in a business venture because she had \u201cno business acumen.\u201d She was \u201cnot of sound mind and was emotionally unfit to govern herself or her affairs * * *. Her judgment was faulty to the extent that she could not possibly comprehend in any reasonable and self-protective manner the nature and effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number><em>of </em>any decision-making process.\u201d His diagnosis was depressive neurosis with multiple drug abuse and occasional suicidal ideation.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">The affidavits and certifications of various individuals who had occasion to observe plaintiff during the period of time covered by the affidavit and certifications presented by her, together with the transcript of the proceedings before the same judge from whose order this appeal is taken, overwhelmingly refute plaintiff\u2019s allegations of incompetency.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">These documents to which no reply affidavits were submitted by plaintiff demonstrate that from a description of her activities as well as her statements to them that plaintiff was far from' being unaware of the terms of and benefits that she would receive under the challenged agreement. They also demonstrate her knowledge of what she was surrendering.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The transcript of the divorce hearing is enlightening. -Following are some excerpts taken from said transcript:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-7\">Q Now, Mrs. Barrie, I show you a property settlement agreement which is dated July 29, 1975, do you recognize it? A Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-8\">Q Does it consist of 14 pages and 39 paragraphs? A It certainly does.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-9\">* * * <em>* </em>* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-10\">Q Does this agreement encompass many, many months of negotiations between you and your husband and your respective Counsel? A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-11\">* * * * * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-12\">Q Are you familiar with each and every paragraph of the agreement? A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-13\">Q Do you have any questions you would like; to ask myself or the Court with regard to the agreement? A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-14\">Q Do you agree with the agreement concerning negotiations back and forth and you agree to abide by its terms?, A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-15\">* * * * * * * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-16\">EXAMINATION BY THE COURT:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-17\">Q You agree to accept $40,000 a year payable on equal monthly installments for alimony? A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-18\">Q You understand that subject to the cut-off conditions, that is, for all practical purposes not likely to be modified upwards or downwards? A I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-19\">Q This is your bite at the apple? A So to speak.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"a6q-dedup-0\">Q You only get one bite? A I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>Q You will receive for the children $5,000 per year, payable in equal monthly installments, but if you remarry and the alimony is discontinued, you will receive $10,000 per year per child for their support in equal monthly installments, is that your understanding? A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-5\">Q Will that be adequate to support the children in the manner that you have been supporting them while you were living with your husband? A Yes, under the conditions that he will provide education beyond that, certainly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-6\">Q Together with the other provisions in the agreement? A Certainly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-7\">Q Now, you will pay the first $50 of any medical expenses not covered by insurance, do you understand that? A I don\u2019t believe that was a provision, your Honor, I don\u2019t think that that was \u2014 I think that $50 represents if I incur, the bill is to be incurred beyond that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">Plaintiff had filed two affidavits challenging the jurisdiction of the State of New York in an earlier proceeding for divorce which had been instituted by defendant. Each is consistent with the other documents submitted by defendant in revealing that plaintiff suffered from no mental impairment. In the words of the judge, she \u201cknew what was going on.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">The judge\u2019s observations of plaintiff\u2019s demeanor, comprehension and speech when she appeared before him at the divorce hearing are entitled to substantial weight. There was no doubt in his mind at that hearing that plaintiff \u201cwas lucid and seemed to comprehend what was going on and that she seemed quite competent and in control of herself and be able to comprehend what we were talking about.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">We conclude from the record that there was no genuine issue of material fact. Since our view accords with that of the judge, we find that he did not abuse his discretion in denying an evidentiary hearing. <em>Court Invest. Co. v. Perillo; Shaw v. Shaw; Skillman v. Skillman; Hallberg v. Hallberg, </em>all <em>supra. </em>See also, <em>Gulick v. Gulick, </em>113 <em>N. J. Super. </em>366 (Ch. Div. 1971), wherein Judge Fritz said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-11\">* * * The end product of such an inquiry is the informed judgment of the judge based on a full presentation of the facts toward the goal of a fair adjudication of support. The significant component is the availability of all facts. Where the parties agree after arms-length negotiation, and the court\u2019s approval by incorporation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>into a judgment appears, I think it can be fairly presumed that the totality of facts was available. To permit a court to be asked on the application of either one of the litigants at some later time to re-examine the facts which they and the court have already considered, toward the end of adding a supervening judgment to the parties\u2019 own considered determination, seems to me to be wrong in several respects. First, it fosters a sort of second-bite-from-the-apple philosophy. Either party may consciously accept a voluntary determination of support with confidence that if things do not work out right, he can start all over again. Second, it imposes upon a trial judge the obligation of making a determination as to support, not in the relatively uncluttered arena of a first presentation of the facts, but rather, influenced, subconsciously or otherwise, by the support considerations which the parties have voluntarily assumed after full fact finding, as it were. Third, it encourages something less than the best judgment in the litigants, at the important moment of the divorce, to bring to bear all those factors which might be the subject of proper consideration with regard to the matter of support. Finally, as noted in <em>Martindell, </em>it inflicts on the courts and the parties a heavy and unnecessary burden of belated re-examination. [113 <em>N. J. Super, </em>at 369]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">Plaintiff urges that <em>Palko v. Palko, </em>150 <em>N. J. Super. 255 </em>(App. Div. 1976), rev\u2019d on dissenting opinion, 73 <em>N. J. </em>395 (1977), mandates at least an evidentiary hearing. We do not agree. The facts are not at all analogous. In <em>PalTco </em>the wife, after her husband\u2019s death, sought relief similar to that sought by plaintiff in the instant case, based on the husband\u2019s deceptions and misrepresentations as to the extent of his financial worth. Allegedly this caused her to accept by way of a settlement agreement less than she would otherwise have accepted. Her allegations were in no way disputed, since the executor of the husband\u2019s estate failed to submit any countering affidavit. On this record the Supreme Court 'agreed with the dissent of Judge Seidman that the wife was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on her motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">It is clear that plaintiff in the instant case bottoms her claim for relief solely on her alleged mental state \u2014 not on any kind of deception by defendant \u2014 and the contents of the counter affidavits and certifications obviously dissipate her assertions as well as those of her physician. <em>i </em>For the foregoing reasons the order is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
