HOFFMAN, Appellant.</parties>\n<p data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"citation\" id=\"b64-6\">[Cite as <em>Norwalk v.

Appellant entered a not guilty plea and the case was set for trial on December-6, 1988. Prior to the trial, on that date, appellant filed a written motion to dismiss for failure of the complaint and affidavit to state facts sufficient to constitute an offense under Crim.R. 3. The motion, which was renewed orally during trial, was overruled and appellant was found guilty and given a fine. It is from the denial of the motion to dismiss and judgment of conviction that this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">In support of his assignment of error, appellant argues that the uniform traffic citation as completed and given to him by the officer does not set forth facts sufficient to state an offense under Crim.R. 3 and that in accordance with this court\u2019s decisions in <em>Sylvania v. Badger </em>(1978), 64 Ohio App.2d 78, 18 O.O.3d 52, 411 N.E.2d 195, and <em>Norwalk v. Ezell </em>(Mar. 13, 1987), Huron App.No. H-86-31, unreported, 1987 WL 7792, his motion to dismiss should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">Appellee essentially responds that when viewing the face of the citation as a whole, including all the filled-in blanks and check marks, a \u201cplethora\u201d of facts is set forth such as the time the offense took place, the year and make of the car, that the road was asphalt, that it was a residential area, that the pavement was wet and that appellant almost caused an accident and, therefore, <em>Badger </em>and <em>Ezell </em>can be distinguished.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">Crim.R. 3 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-10\">\u201cThe complaint is a written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged. It shall also state the numerical designation of the applicable statute or ordinance. It shall be made upon oath before any person authorized by law to administer oaths.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-11\">In <em>Badger, supra </em>at 79, 18 O.O.3d at 53-54, 411 N.E.2d at 196-197, which involved an offense similar to the one in this case, this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-12\">\u201cThe complaint and summons in the instant case was the \u2018Ohio Uniform Traffic Ticket,\u2019 as mandated by Traffic Rule 3. The box checked for the nature of the violation indicated the following: \u2018operated without regard to safety (described below).\u2019 The only description entered on the ticket was \u2018driving without due regard for safety.\u2019 The ordinance was cited, but no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>statement of the facts giving rise to the violation was written on the face of the ticket; thus, defendant was not specifically informed which of his acts or omissions constituted the offense. We find that the traffic ticket was not properly completed and, therefore it was not a valid complaint in accordance with Crim.R. 3.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">In <em>Ezell, supra, </em>the defendant-appellant was charged with a violation of a Norwalk Zoning Ordinance in a complaint that stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-6\">\u201c * * * Dennis Ezell at Norwalk, Huron County, Ohio, on or about July 23, 1986, did unlawfully fail to abide by an order of the zoning inspector of the City of Norwalk made pursuant to Section 1135.02 of the Norwalk City Ordinances in violation of Sec. 1135.99 Norwalk City Ordinance * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">This court found in that case that the complaint, as stated, \u201c * * * is devoid of any facts concerning the crime charged. The only operative fact contained therein was that appellant failed \u2018 * * * to abide by an order of the zoning inspector * * * pursuant to Section 1135.02 * * V This is not sufficient to comply with Crim.R. 3.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-8\">\u201cIn a criminal action, an accused has a constitutional right to be informed of the nature and cause of accusations against him. Therefore, the complaint must contain the essential elements of the crime with which he is charged. * * * \u00bb</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-11\">The affidavit which charged the appellant in this case was a Uniform Traffic Citation, on which a check mark was placed in the box next to the words \u201cOperated Without Regard to Safety.\u201d In the area designated \u201cDescription of Offense\u201d the officer wrote \u201cWilful Reckless Operation\u201d and inserted Ordinance No. 333.09(A). While the face of the citation does contain information regarding such facts as the year and make of the car, the pavement, the visibility and the road surface, it is clear that there were no more operative facts set forth in the complaint in this case than in <em>Badger </em>or <em>Ezell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b66-12\">This court must note that the Norwalk Municipal Court records indicate that the officer did write a very complete statement of the specific action that constituted the offense charged; however, this was done on a separate page that was filed with the court but not furnished to the appellant as part of the charging document.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-13\">In accordance with the above, this court finds that appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-14\">On consideration whereof appellant John B. Hoffman, was prejudiced and denied a fair trial. The judgment of the Norwalk Municipal Court is reversed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>and appellant is hereby discharged. This cause is remanded to the trial court for assessment of costs. Costs assessed against appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b67-5\">Handwork, P.J., and Glasser, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
