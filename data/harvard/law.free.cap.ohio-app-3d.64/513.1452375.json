Wuest and Helen H. Degler, hereinafter collectively referred to as \u201cborrowers,\u201d appeal from a summary judgment foreclosing on a mortgage loan made to them by First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Lima (\u201cFirst Federal\u201d), and assigned to plaintiff-appellee Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (\u201cFHLMC\u201d). In its complaint, FHLMC prayed for foreclosure, judgment on the note and both compensatory and punitive damages for fraud. In their amended answer and counterclaim, the borrowers made claims against FHLMC, and also brought in First Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>as a third-party defendant, asserting claims for slander of credit and for fraudulently, and without authority, making them a loan of First Federal\u2019s <em>credit </em>rather than of <em>money. </em>Of these claims, only the claim for foreclosure has been expressly adjudicated by the trial court. Although the trial court\u2019s judgment arguably disposes, by implication, of the borrowers\u2019 counterclaims and third-party claim, it cannot be said to dispose of FHLMC\u2019s claim against the borrowers for fraud, nor does it dispose of FHLMC\u2019s claim for money damages on the borrowers\u2019 note. Accordingly, this appeal must be dismissed for want of a final appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">This is the latest of a series of cases to reach this court involving a reprehensible scheme to take unfair advantage of borrowers and lending institutions. The previous cases are: <em>Transamerica Financial Services v. Stiver </em>(1989), 61 Ohio App.3d 49, 572 N.E.2d 149; <em>Society Bank, N.A. v. Kellar </em>(1989), 63 Ohio App.3d 583, 579 N.E.2d 717; and <em>Merchants &amp; Mechanics Fed. S. &amp; L. Assn. v. Brown </em>(June 27, 1989), Greene App. No. 88-CA-103, 1989 WL 72225. This scheme was explained in a Wall Street Journal article that was submitted to the trial court in the case before us in support of FHLMC\u2019s motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In that article by Constance Mitchell, a Wall Street Journal staff reporter, the essence of the scheme was explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-6\">\u201cFederal authorities are investigating a scam against banks by customers paying off loans using worthless certified drafts drawn on Mexican banks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-7\">\u201cWhen such a draft is presented for payment, the U.S. bank either receives notice that the Mexican bank doesn\u2019t exist, or it receives a replacement sight-draft drawn on a second Mexican bank, thus further delaying collection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-8\">\u201cA sight-draft is a check that is payable \u2018on sight,\u2019 or on demand when presented to the bank on which it\u2019s drawn. Typically, banks don\u2019t question their use as they might a personal check, because the bank assumes the funds have been collected in advance by the issuer of the draft.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-9\">\u201cThe Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating incidents of the fraud in at least four states \u2014 Ohio, Missouri, Arizona, and California \u2014 and an agency spokesman indicated the practice is spreading. In several midwestern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>cities, home owners and small business operators are paying off mortgages and other loans using worthless drafts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-4\">\u201c \u2018This is serious because the financial community is getting flooded with these things,\u2019 said Robert Siller, an FBI agent investigating the Ohio incidents. \u2018The losses can mount up.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-5\">\u201cMr. Siller said borrowers ar\u00e9 learning about this scheme at \u2018debtors parties\u2019 held at hotels in various cities. There, salesmen seek to convince attendees they can pay off their loans immediately by using a Mexican bank draft. For a fee, usually about 15% of the amount of their loans, the debtors are sold a bank draft and told that lenders, by law, must accept the draft.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-6\">\u201cIn some cases, according to the FBI, the salesmen are members of anti-banking organizations. These groups believe the Federal Reserve System is unconstitutional and they are using the practice as a way to burden the Fed, which they claim is liable for the funds once a U.S. bank accepts the drafts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-7\">\u201cUnder an apparent technicality in federal banking laws, once a bank accepts such drafts and tries to redeem them, the borrower is off the hook. Furthermore, it is unclear whether banks that have accepted the drafts can legally collect the collateral used to secure the original loans.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-8\">\u201cIn dozens of instances, U.S. banks have agreed to accept the drafts., And, according to Mr. Siller, at least one borrower \u2014 a Sidney, Ohio farmer \u2014 got the deed back for his farm after paying off his mortgage with such a draft. His bank, which wasn\u2019t identified, has filed suit to collect on the debt, but the case is pending.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-9\">\u201cAccording to lawsuits filed by several banks, the certified drafts are drawn on Panora Credit Trust, and by World Credit Reserve, both of Acapulco, Mexico. Some other banks have received drafts drawn on Central American institutions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-10\">\u201cThe FBI spokesman said it is still unclear how the salesmen are obtaining checks from these foreign banking concerns, and whether the foreign banks even exist. And, he added, U.S. borrowers using them have been \u2018unduly\u2019 uncooperative.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-11\">Based on the foregoing account, the circumstances in the case before us were typical of the scheme. The borrowers used the borrowed funds to purchase a home, and, instead of repaying the borrowed funds, presented a \u201csight draft\u201d drawn on the \u201cPanora Credit Trust\u201d with an Acapulco, Mexico address. Efforts by FHLMC to collect the draft were unsuccessful, and disclosed that the \u201cPanora Credit Trust\u201d did not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-12\">At the hearing on the motion for summary judgment, the trial court inquired of the borrowers\u2019 attorney of record, and was unable to elicit any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>representation that the \u201cPanora Credit Trust\u201d existed in fact. The trial court found that the alleged issuer of the sight draft did not, in fact, exist, and based its disposition of the borrowers\u2019 defenses to the foreclosure action upon that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">The borrowers have propounded a plethora of defenses, counterclaims, and third-party claims in this case, but the essence of their legal position is best illuminated in a colloquy between their attorney of record and the trial court during the hearing on the motion for summary judgment, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: What is your reasoning for claiming the original note is invalid?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-6\">\u201cMR. MANOGG [the borrowers\u2019 attorney]: Because there was no consideration given for it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: Let\u2019s expand on that a little further. Would you please explain that to me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-8\">\u201cMR. MANOGG: Okay. Consideration as far as we are taking the position, as far as it has to be something of value\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: I understand that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-10\">\u201cMR. MANOGG: What this lending institution did, the only consideration ever given for this note and mortgage was just a mere bookkeeping entry on their books. There was no money ever extended to the defendants. There\u2019s nothing of value given them. Now, if there\u2019s nothing of value given, if there\u2019s no money given them, then the note is no good.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: Uh-huh. Your client got nothing. Is that what you\u2019re saying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-12\">\u201cMR. MANOGG: Nothing of value, right. He got a piece of paper maybe, but nothing of value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: What would your discovery that you\u2019ve requested elicit? In all your wildest dreams, what do you think you might discover?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-14\">\u201cMR. MANOGG: Nothing of value given. There\u2019s no money given to the defendants when they executed the note and mortgage. It was just a bookkeeping entry, a shuffling of paper with no money ever extended.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-15\">\u201cTHE COURT:. Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-16\">\u201cWhat do you say to that, Mr. Gregg?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-17\">\u201cMR. GREGG [FHLMC\u2019s attorney]: Your Honor, this is one of the millions of typical transactions where Mr. Wuest, Mr. Degler <em>\\sic </em>] bought a home and borrowed the money from my client in order to pay the seller the price for the home, of most of the large part of the price for the home; so it\u2019s a ridiculous position that he\u2019s taking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: Is that true that they borrowed money from plaintiff to buy a home?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-4\">\u201cMR. MANOGG: They thought they were borrowing money, but in fact they did not get money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: They got their home, didn\u2019t they?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-6\">\u201cMR. MANOGG: They\u2019re living in the home, right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: You claim because the dollars didn\u2019t change hands, it was a bookkeeping entry, that that means there was no consideration; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-8\">\u201cMR. MANOGG: Right. If in fact the originator of the note did not actually give money to whoever who was selling the house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: You mean actually hand them dollars?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-10\">\u201cMR. MANOGG: Or something that could be converted into dollars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: Your client ended up with his house, didn\u2019t he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-12\">\u201cMR. MANOGG: Well, if I defraud you, am I entitled to keep the fruits of my fraud? No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: What\u2019s the fraud?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-14\">\u201cMR. MANOGG: By giving whoever sold this house, I don\u2019t know their name, John Doe, whoever it was, a worthless check, a worthless piece of paper in exchange for title to that real estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-15\">\u201cTHE COURT: You\u2019re talking about the plaintiff\u2019s check?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-16\">\u201cMR. MANOGG: Or their possessor title [sic].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-17\">\u201cTHE COURT: Why is it worthless?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-18\">\u201cMR. MANOGG: Because there\u2019s no money backing it up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-19\">\u201cTHE COURT: We\u2019re getting down to this issue about bookkeeping reserves. Is that what you\u2019re talking about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-20\">\u201cMR. MANOGG: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-21\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. That\u2019s what I want to be sure I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-22\">\u201cMR. MANOGG: And we have an expert, that former bank auditor that when we get to trial will testify to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-23\">\u201cTHE COURT: In other words, any banking institution that has some kind of a negative net worth can\u2019t negotiate checks. Is that what you\u2019re saying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-24\">\u201cMR. MANOGG: If they don\u2019t have sufficient federal reserve notes or money backing them up, that is right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-25\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, that applies to almost three-quarters of our savings and loans nowaday, from what I read in the paper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-26\">\u201cMR. MANOGG: Probably applies to a higher percentage than that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: In other words, those three-fourths of the savings and loans in our country are exercising fraudulent intentions when they negotiate checks with people who want to buy homes. Is that your position?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-4\">\u201cMR. MANOGG: Yes; if they don\u2019t have the funds to back it up, that\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: I just want to be sure I understand your position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-6\">\u201cMR. MANOGG: I agree with that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">The trial court had no use for the borrowers\u2019 ingenuous argument that they were victims of fraud because their loan was not in the form of \u201cmoney\u201d even though that loan accomplished their purpose in buying a home, and, as evidenced by the opinions of this court in <em>Transamerica Financial Services v. Stiver, Society Bank, N.A. v. Kellar, </em>and <em>Merchants &amp; Mechanics Fed. S. &amp; L. Assn. v. Brown, </em>cited <em>supra, </em>neither do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">The borrowers have asserted three assignments of error, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahv\">\u201cFirst Assignment of Error</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-10\">\u201cThe trial court erred in granting summary judgment when genuine issues of material fact exist and were not addressed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-11\">\u201cSecond Assignment of Error</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-12\">\u201cThe trial court denied defendants due process by suppressing discovery which would enable them to prove their counterclaim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-13\">\u201cThird Assignment of Error</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-14\">\u201cThe trial court erred in forcing defendants to retain a licensed attorney of record in order to litigate or to have access to the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-15\">Although this court, in recent cases, has previously rejected the borrowers\u2019 legal arguments in support of their first assignment of error, we do not find it necessary to reach the merits of this appeal. The trial court\u2019s judgment entry provides only for the remedy of foreclosure with respect to FHLMC\u2019s mortgage lien. It in no way disposes of the FHLMC claim on the promissory note, or its claim for both compensatory and punitive damages for fraud. Even if the trial court\u2019s decision were deemed to dispose, <em>sub silentio, </em>of the borrowers\u2019 counterclaims and third-party claims, it is not capable of being construed to dispose of FHLMC\u2019s claims on the promissory note and for fraud. There<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>fore, this appeal must be dismissed for want of a final appealable order, since there are claims pending in the trial court that have not yet been resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">This appeal will be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b549-7\">Wilson and Grady, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b544-10\">. Although a newspaper article does not ordinarily satisfy the evidentiary requirements for summary judgment contained in Civ.R. 56, the borrowers, who were then represented by counsel, did not object to the introduction of this article, along with other, similar materials, in their response to the motion for summary judgment. Therefore, any objection to the consideration of these materials was waived.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
