At issue is whether the evidence before the trial court, concerning appellant\u2019s alleged occupational disease, is sufficient to conclude the ailment was a condition predating employment and therefore noncompensable within the meaning of <em>State, ex rel. Miller, v. Mead Corp. </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 405, 12 O.O.3d 348, 390 N.E.2d 1192.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">For the reasons stated below, we reverse the granting of summary judgment and remand to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">Appellant Betty Frazier began her employment with appellee Inland Division, General Motors Corporation, on August 27, 1967. During her employment, appellant developed problems with her hands, wrists, fingers and arm. Appellant\u2019s claimed ailment was diagnosed by Dr. Jose Duarte as bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome caused by her employment duties and activities.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant filed an application with the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation under the provisions in R.C. 4123.68(BB).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">On March 13, 1987, a district hearing officer for the Industrial Commission rejected appellant\u2019s application. The hearing officer found that the appellant did not contract her claimed occupational disease in the course of employment. The Dayton Regional Board of Review affirmed the hearing officer\u2019s decision on August 13, 1987. On November 12, 1987, the Industrial Commission refused to consider any further appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">On February 2, 1988, appellant filed an appeal with the court of common pleas pursuant to R.C. 4123.519.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant testified at her August 17, 1988 deposition that she did not experience trouble with her upper extremities before working for Inland Division. According to appellant\u2019s deposition, her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>symptoms began manifesting themselves in October 1984, about the time Inland added the Buick T pad to the assembly line.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellant admitted in her deposition that she had undergone numerous medical procedures to relieve a variety of ailments in her upper extremities.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Appellee, Inland Division, presented the testimony of two physicians: Dr. Koppernhoefer and Dr. Meelhuysen. Dr. Koppernhoefer testified that he examined appellant on January 20, 1987. Appellee requested this examination. Dr. Koppernhoefer stated his opinion that appellant did not contract carpal tunnel syndrome from her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Dr. Meelhuysen testified at his deposition that he treated appellant on prior occasions dating back to 1976. However, Dr. Meelhuysen had not seen appellant since 1978. Dr. Meelhuysen testified that in 1976 appellant suffered from borderline carpal tunnel syndrome. Dr. Meelhuysen also testified that, to his knowledge, appellant did not exhibit any symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome prior to working for Inland.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">Appellee filed a motion for summary judgment. The trial sustained appellee\u2019s motion. The trial court concluded that Frazier\u2019s disease was a preexisting condition barred by the rule of <em>State, ex rel. Miller, v. Mead Corp. </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 405, 12 O.O.3d 348, 390 N.E.2d 1192. Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal, raising three assignments of error. Due to the similarities of fact and law in the assignments we will consider them together.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-8\">\u201cI. The trial court committed prejudicial error when it granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment which was filed pursuant to Rule 56 of the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure as it misapplied and misinterpreted the Supreme Court holding in <em>State, ex rel Miller v. Mead Corp. </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d, as there was no evidence establishing that the plaintiff had a disease pre-existing her employment with the defendant involving either hand or wrist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-9\">\u201cII. The court erred when it sustained defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment when the evidence was unrefuted that the plaintiff contracted an occupational disease of left carpal tunnel syndrome.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-10\">\u201cHI. It was error for the trial court to sustain defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 of the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure as there was a material issue of fact as to the nature of appellant\u2019s medical condition and diagnosis prior to October of 1984.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-11\">A nonscheduled disease is compensable only when it is contracted in the course of employment. <em>State, ex rel. Ohio Bell Tel. Co., v. Krise </em>(1975), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>42 Ohio St.2d 247, 71 O.O.2d 226, 327 N.E.2d 756. A disease predating employment, though aggravated by that employment, is not compensable. <em>State, ex rel. Miller, v. Mead Corp., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Applicants for benefits are required to state how they were exposed to the cause of the disease, the work done when the disease began, and the date its symptoms first appeared. Frazier attributed her disease to repetitive use of her hands in handling materials. She stated the condition first appeared in 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">The trial court granted summary judgment upon its finding that, according to the sworn statements of appellant and two physicians testifying for appellee, the disease or its symptoms manifested themselves prior to 1984 and as early as 1976. The court found that these earlier symptoms could not be subsequently labeled carpal tunnel syndrome in October 1986 to escape the stigma of condition predating that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">The requirement that applicants state particularly the causes of their disease by exposure, work and date of symptoms is a reasonable procedural device for guiding the inquiry of the Industrial Commission. It should not be used to define \u201ccourse of employment\u201d in a manner overly narrow in relation to the purposes of the statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">Some disease conditions manifest themselves slowly and sporadically, through symptoms which in their early stages are not conclusively linked to employment or a specific disease. Many workers, and particularly those in the employ of large concerns, are exposed to continuing causation factors while passing through a variety of positions and assignments. It is only after a substantial period of time and work experiences that the condition manifests itself clearly in a medical context and conclusively as a disability. Because the provisions of R.C. Chapter 4123 must be construed liberally in favor of the employee,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> these factors must be considered where applicable in a benefits determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">An inquiry into a claim is not bound by common law or statutory rules of evidence or by technical or formal rules of procedure. R.C. 4123.515. Likewise, the information provided by an employee in a claim application is not to be construed in a strict or hypertechnical way. As in the Civil Rules, an application for benefits should be construed under the standards of notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>pleading. Deviations of proof are not fatal to the claim when they are consistent with the claim for relief requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">We construe the phrase \u201ccourse of employment\u201d to include the entire term of the employment relationship between the claimant and the employer by whom the claimant is employed when the disability is experienced. \u201cCourse of employment\u201d is not limited to that immediate employment activity to which the claimant is assigned when the disability is manifested. That interpretation would limit coverage to only those diseases that arise from current activities, an approach contrary to the purposes of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Frazier\u2019s employment with General Motors began in 1967. The course of her employment for purposes of her claim includes any employment activity from 1967 through the date her claim is determined.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">The record contains no support for the view that Frazier\u2019s disease predated her commencement of employment in 1967. If that defense is asserted by appellee, it remains a genuine issue of material fact precluding summary judgment under Civ.R. 56. If it is not asserted, Frazier\u2019s claim requires determination on its merits otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">The judgment of the trial court will be reversed. The case will be remanded for further proceedings according to this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b640-10\">Wilson and Fain, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b637-10\">. \"Carpal tunnel syndrome\u201d is defined as \"a complex of symptoms resulting from compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel, with pain and burning or tingling paresthesia (abnormal sensation) in the fingers and hand, sometimes extending to the elbow.\u201d The Sloan-Dorland Annotated Medical-Legal Dictionary (1987) 689.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b637-11\">.
