Throughout the day the four played games and drank. It was not long after midnight when an argument began which ended when appellant plunged a knife into Otis Palmer\u2019s chest. The knife severed the aorta, causing Otis Palmer\u2019s death on July 7, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">On April 27, 1989, a jury found appellant guilty of aggravated murder pursuant to R.C. 2903.01(A). Thereafter, the trial court entered a conviction of aggravated murder against appellant and sentenced appellant to life imprisonment with parole eligibility after twenty years of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-9\">Appellant now seeks our review and raises the following assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-10\">\u201cI. The trial court committed prejudicial error when over objection it admitted testimony with respect to \u2018other crimes, wrongs or acts\u2019 by defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-11\">\u201cII. The trial court violated defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination during cross-examination when he was required to admit to the killing of the victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-12\">\u201cHI. The trial court committed prejudicial error when it failed to give an adequate, complete and sufficient curative instruction to the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b745-14\">In his first assignment, appellant contends that the trial court, over objections, permitted testimony of two state\u2019s witnesses that violated Evid.R. 404(B). This rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-15\">\u201cEvidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>Appellant\u2019s first complaint involves the following testimony of Darla Jacocks, appellant\u2019s sister, during direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-5\">\u201cQ: I need to ask you before you give testimony today whether or not you are afraid of Dennis Jacocks?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-6\">\u201cA: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-7\">\u201cMR. WEINER: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-9\">\u201cQ: Would you tell the jury why you are afraid?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-10\">\u201cA: Dennis frightens me because lately he\u2019s been threatening a lot. He\u2019s jumped on me several times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-11\">\u201cQ: When did he threaten you? What were the circumstances?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-12\">\u201cA: Well, it was last time probably about a month before the stabbing Dennis had came in, and he was lying on the love seat so I asked him if he would mind taking his foot off the armrest because it was broken. And he got very upset about it. And he took his knife out and started whirling it around. And he said if Debra or I answered the door or answered the telephone\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-13\">\u201cMR. SHARTZER: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-14\">\u201cA: He\u2019d do something to us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-15\">\u201cMR. WEINER: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-16\">\u201cTHE COURT: Overruled.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-17\">The state asserts that the above testimony is relevant and nonprejudicial because the jury, when determining a witness\u2019 credibility, should consider all circumstances affecting that witness. We disagree. In <em>State v. Moore </em>(1948), 149 Ohio St. 226, 36 O.O. 566, 78 N.E.2d 365, at paragraph two of the syllabus, our Supreme Court succinctly held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-18\">\u201c * * * [Tjestimony as to threats made by the defendant against a third person sometime prior to the killing, with which former incident the deceased had no connection and which formed no /\u00bfart of the affair in which the deceased was killed, is not, over objection, admissible in evidence against the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-19\">Clearly, the testimony of Darla Jacocks regarding a prior threat made by appellant against Darla had no connection with Otis Palmer\u2019s death and such testimony would in no way aid a jury in its determination of Darla\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-20\">However, the state asserts that even if the admission of such testimony was error, the error was harmless. In order for us to find an error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>harmless, we must find that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Chapman v. California </em>(1967), 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705; <em>State v. Eubank </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St.2d 183, 187, 14 O.O.3d 416, 418, 398 N.E.2d 567, 569.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">After an examination of the instant record, we find more than sufficient evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt and therefore find that the erroneous admission of the above evidence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error concerns the following testimony of the state\u2019s rebuttal witness, Sharon Subich. Apparently, Subich was present at appellant\u2019s preliminary hearing and saw the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-7\">\u201cThe defendant turned in his chair toward his sister Miss Jacocks and mouthed the words, you know I am going to kill you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">We find the rebuttal testimony was not improperly admitted in the instant case. During trial, appellant testified on his own behalf and specifically denied threatening Debra Jacocks at the preliminary hearing. To rebut this denial, the state called Subich and elicited the above testimony. We believe the rebuttal testimony was relevant and nonprejudicial in aiding the jury in its determination of appellant\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is hereby overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b747-11\">In his second assignment, appellant claims that the trial court violated his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination by permitting the following question on cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-12\">\u201cLet\u2019s so that it\u2019s absolutely clear, we\u2019ll take care of a couple of elements of this matter. You admit to this jury that you caused the death of Otis Palmer; correct?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-13\">The purpose of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination is to protect persons from being compelled to incriminate themselves. <em>Miranda v. Arizona </em>(1966), 384 U.S. 436, 467, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 1624, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, 719. Here, appellant voluntarily took the stand in his own defense and therefore voluntarily subjected himself to proper cross-examination, as above. We find nothing in the record to suggest that appellant was compelled to testify in his own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-14\"><em>\u201cA </em>defendant who chooses to testify waives his privilege against compulsory self-incrimination with respect to the testimony he gives, and that waiver is no less effective or complete because the defendant may have been motivated to take the witness stand in the first place only by reason of the strength of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>the lawful evidence adduced against him.\u201d <em>Harrison v. United States </em>(1968), 392 U.S. 219, 222, 88 S.Ct. 2008, 2010, 20 L.Ed.2d 1047, 1051.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Accordingly, we find appellant\u2019s second assignment without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">During the instant jury charge, the trial court instructed the jury that they must unanimously find appellant not guilty of aggravated murder before they could consider the lesser offense of murder. This was clearly erroneous. However, appellant admits that no objection was made to that portion of the charge. Nevertheless, the jury, after approximately three hours of deliberation, submitted the following written question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-8\">\u201cAt this point we cannot obtain twelve votes for either guilty or not guilty of aggravated murder. As we understand our directions, we cannot consider the lesser offense of murder unless we obtain a unanimous vote on the first offense. What are your instructions?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">Thereupon, the trial court had the jury return to the courtroom and gave the following curative instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-10\">\u201cYour instructjions [sic] are, the law can\u2019t force people. If you cannot reach a unanimous verdict one way or the other, then you can consider either of the lesser included offenses. You may retire.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-11\">In his final assignment, appellant claims that this curative instruction was inadequate and insufficient. We disagree. We find the curative instruction, although not exemplary, sufficiently instructed the jury on the law and sufficiently cured the previous erroneous instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-12\">Therefore, we overrule appellant\u2019s final assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-13\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Richland County is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-14\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b748-15\">Milligan and John R. Hoffman, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
