The city raises one assignment of error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It argues that there exists no conflict between the ordinance and the general laws of Ohio, specifically R.C. 2923.18 and 715.60, and that the ordinance is not an unreasonable and arbitrary exercise of its police power. We agree with the city that the general laws of Ohio do not prohibit municipalities from reasonably regulating blasting within their boundaries. However, we affirm the judgment of the court of common pleas that this ordinance, which totally bans blasting as a means of construction, is unconstitutional in that it is in conflict with the general laws of the state of Ohio and is arbitrary and unreasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>and bears no substantial relationship to public health, safety or the general welfare of the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">On February 15, 1988, the city adopted Ordinance No. 1988-07, which states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-5\">\u201cAN ORDINANCE TO ESTABLISH THE HOURS FOR SURFACE CONSTRUCTION OPERATIONS.

On March 23, 1988, after a hearing the court granted this temporary restraining order. On April 15, 1988, the court incorporated the record which was taken in reference to the temporary restraining order into its hearing on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>merits and declared Brooklyn Ordinance No. 1988-07 unconstitutional. Appellant timely appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">Section 3, Article XVIII, of the Ohio Constitution confers upon municipalities the power \u201c * * * to adopt and enforce within their limits such local police, sanitary and other similar regulations, as are not in conflict with general laws,\u201d <em>Fondessy Enterprises, Inc. v. Oregon </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St.3d 213, 23 OBR 372, 492 N.E.2d 797, and which are rationally based on the goals of maintaining the health, safety and general welfare of the community. <em>Pepper Pike v. Landskroner </em>(1977), 53 Ohio App.2d 63, 7 O.O.3d 44, 371 N.E.2d 579, paragraph one of the syllabus. In determining whether an ordinance is in \u201cconflict\u201d with general laws, the test is whether the ordinance permits or licenses that which the statute forbids and prohibits, and vice versa. <em>Struthers v. Sokol </em>(1923), 108 Ohio St. 263, 140 N.E. 519, at paragraph two of the syllabus; <em>Fondessy, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">The trial court found this ordinance to be in conflict with R.C. 715.60 and 2923.18. R.C. 715.60 allows any municipal corporation to \u201c * * * regulate the transportation, keeping, and sale of gunpowder and other explosives or dangerous combustibles and materials, and provide or license magazines therefor.\u201d Since this statute does not deal with the use of explosives it cannot be said to be in conflict with the prohibition of blasting as a means of construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">R.C. 2923.18 allows for the acquisition of licenses and temporary permits to use various kinds of dangerous ordnance for certain purposes, one of which is construction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It specifically indicates that a \u201cpermit shall be issued * * * to * * * use dangerous ordnance * * *,\u201d however, it does not eliminate the municipality\u2019s ability to regulate this activity if it unduly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>burdens the health and safety of the community, R.C. 2923.18(D) Cf. <em>Curtis v. Cleveland </em>(1959), 170 Ohio St. 127, 10 O.O.2d 85, 163 N.E. 682. A total ban on blasting is not a \u201cregulation\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 2923.18.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The total elimination of blasting as a means of construction is therefore in conflict with this statute and consequently the ordinance is invalid. <em>Fondessy Enterprises, Inc., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">But even if this ordinance were valid, a legislative enactment will not stand if it is demonstrated that the ordinance is in its application \u201carbitrary, capricious, and bears no reasonable relationship to the health, safety or general welfare of the community.\u201d <em>Pike v. Landskroner, </em>53 Ohio App.3d at 63, 7 O.O.3d at 44, 371 N.E. at 580. A person attacking an ordinance must introduce sufficient evidence to demonstrate that this relationship does not exist. If such evidence is introduced, the municipality must also present evidence to support the validity of the ordinance on the basis of health, safety or general welfare or risk that the ordinance will be found unconstitutional. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">The Sewer District provides wastewater treatment and interceptor sewer facilities to the city of Cleveland and forty-one surrounding communities. On September 24, 1985, the Sewer District was ordered by the court of common pleas (\u201ccourt order\u201d) to construct and place in service the Southwest Interceptor Sewer (\u201cSWI\u201d). This construction is necessary to eliminate overflow and discharge of untreated sewage into the environment. Pursuant to the court order and the terms and conditions of the federal grants, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>construction contracts for the SWI must be initiated and completed within a specified timetable.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">At the time this action was instituted SWI Contracts 1, <em>2, </em>3 and 4 were under construction. SWI Contract 4 included areas of construction within the city of Brooklyn. The next segment of the project, and the one affected by the ordinance, was SWI Contract 5. This contract requires the construction of an interceptor which necessitated the sinking of at least one access shaft to a depth of one hundred feet through rock in a non-residential area of the city of Brooklyn. Bids on Contract 5 were scheduled for March 15, 1988. On February 15, 1988, the city adopted Ordinance No. 1988-07, which totally prohibits blasting as a means of construction for any contract entered into after February 27, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Edward J. Walter, the city\u2019s seismologist, testified that previous to this ordinance the city had another ordinance which regulated blasting. That ordinance established standards to which the user of explosives within the city must adhere. For example, it regulated particle velocity and hours when blasting was permitted. It required contractors to maintain liability insurance, required detailed records of each detonation, and provided penalties for violators. Edwards testified that based on data he collected from previous detonations which involved SWI Contract 4, none of these blasts was of the magnitude that would cause even minor damage to homes. Ronald Connors, an adjuster who had personally inspected fifteen homes as a result of claims submitted alleging property damage from blasting during construction of SWI Contract 4, stated that he found no evidence of damage attributable to blasting. Thomas Novotny, a professional geophysicist, was retained to perform noise and vibration studies during construction of SWI Contract 4. He concluded that vibrations caused by blasting during construction of SWI Contract 4 were not capable of causing structural damage. Novotny posited that an absolute ban on blasting as a means of construction is totally unreasonable, especially since the city\u2019s previous ordinance adequately regulated blasting. Other testimony indicated that the total ban on blasting could delay completion of SWI contracts and raise the cost of construction of SWI Contract 5 by one million dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">The city did not proffer any evidence to support the validity of the ordinance. It introduced no evidence that a total ban was necessary for the preservation of the health, safety or general welfare of the community. Therefore, the trial court properly declared the ordinance invalid and unconstitutional on its face and in application.
