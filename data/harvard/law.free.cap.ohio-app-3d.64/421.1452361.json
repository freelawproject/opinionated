Bertosa. Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleged defendants wrongfully withheld payment of accrued sick leave benefits upon retirement of each of the police officers in violation of R.C. 124.39. Plaintiffs\u2019 prayer sought relief in mandamus, payment of the accrued benefits and money damages under Section 1983, Title 42, U.S.Code. Subsequent to the filing of the complaint, the East Cleveland Fraternal Order of Police withdrew as a plaintiff, thereby leaving as plaintiffs the nine employees of the East Cleveland Police Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground, <em>inter alia, </em>the city of East Cleveland and its city officials are exempt from following R.C. 124.39 under the home rule provision of the Ohio Constitution. Plaintiffs opposed defendants\u2019 motion. On August 1, 1987, the trial court journalized an order granting defendants\u2019 summary judgment on the merits, but failed to address whether plaintiffs were entitled to a writ of mandamus. Plaintiffs appealed to this court. In <em>East Cleveland F. O.P. v. East Cleveland </em>(Oct. 20, 1988), Cuyahoga App. No. 54346, unreported, 1988 WL 112867, this court remanded the case <em>sub judice </em>for a determination on plaintiffs\u2019 request for a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">On March 7, 1989 the trial court journalized an order modifying the court\u2019s August 11, 1987 entry to state \u201cwrit of mandamus denied\u201d and further ordered plaintiffs\u2019 complaint dismissed with prejudice at plaintiffs\u2019 costs. Plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal assigning two errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 assignments of error follow:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-8\">\u201cI. The trial court erred in finding that East Cleveland Resolution 1767 prevails over conflicting portions of Revised Code Sections 124.38 and 124.39 as those statutes are laws of a general nature adopted by the Ohio General Assembly and manifest a statewide concern.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-9\">\u201cII. The trial court erred in finding that East Cleveland Resolution 1767 prevails over O.R.C. 124.39 as the statute concerns the general welfare of employees and is a valid enactment pursuant to Article II, Section 34 of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">Plaintiffs\u2019 assignments of error have merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">Plaintiffs argue the trial court erred when it granted summary judgment to defendants since R.C. 124.39 prevails over the East Cleveland ordinance on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>two grounds: (1) R.C. 124.39 is a statute of general nature adopted for a statewide concern, and (2) R.C. 124.39 is a statute concerning the general welfare of employees pursuant to Section 34, Article II, of the Ohio Constitution. Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments are persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">R.C. 124.39(B) and (C) provide in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-6\">\u201c(B) Except as provided in division (C) of this section, <em>an employee </em>of a political subdivision covered by section 124.38 or 3319.141 [3319.14.1] of the Revised Code <em>may elect, </em>at the time of retirement from active service with the political subdivision, and with ten or more years of service with the state, any political subdivisions, or any combination thereof, <em>to be paid in cash for one-fourth the value of his accrued but unused sick leave credit.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-7\"><em>a </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-8\">\u201c(C) A political subdivision may adopt a policy allowing an employee to receive payment for <em>more than one-fourth the value of his unused sick leave or for more than the aggregate value of thirty days </em>of his unused sick leave, or allowing the number of years of service to be less than ten. The political subdivision may also adopt a policy permitting an employee to receive payment upon a termination of employment other than retirement or permitting more than one payment to any employee.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">The sole issue in the case <em>sub judice </em>is whether the city of East Cleveland may enact a resolution, <em>viz., </em>Resolution No. 1767, which would deny the right to compensation provided for in R.C. 124.39(B). Resolution No. 1767 provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-10\">\u201cNOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Commission of the City of East Cleveland, County of Cuyahoga, State of Ohio, four-fifths of all members thereof concurring:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-11\">\u201cSECTION 1: It is hereby established and declared that the policy of the City of East Cleveland is and shall be that <em>upon their retirement, employees of the City of East Cleveland shall not receive any part of their unused sick leave as pay.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-12\">The resolution is in direct conflict with state law, <em>viz., </em>R.C. 124.39(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-13\">In <em>Weir v. Rimmelin </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 55, 56, 15 OBR 151, 152, 472 N.E.2d 341, 343, the court succinctly summarized the holding of <em>Clermont Environmental Reclamation Co. v. Wiederhold </em>(1982), 2 Ohio St.3d 44, 2 OBR 587, 442 N.E.2d 1278, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-14\">\u201cWhere the General Assembly has enacted legislation pursuant to the state\u2019s police power which governs a statewide concern, the statute takes precedence over ordinances enacted under the home rule authority of municipalities.\u201d See, also, Section 3, Article XVIII, Ohio Constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>In <em>South Euclid Fraternal Order of Police v. D\u2019Amico </em>(1983), 13 Ohio App.3d 46, 13 OBR 49, 468 N.E.2d 735, this court held R.C. 124.38 is a law of general nature which prevails over conflicting municipal ordinances. R.C. 124.38 and 124.39 are closely related since R.C. 124.38 creates vested rights in sick leave and R.C. 124.39 provides the method for a retiring employee to receive a percentage of his/her accrued sick time in cash. Thus, it reasonably follows that R.C. 124.39 is a law of general nature, governing a statewide concern, which prevails over conflicting municipal ordinances. <em>Weir, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">Section 34, Article II of the Ohio Constitution provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-5\">\u201cLaws may be passed fixing and regulating the hours of labor, establishing a minimum wage, and providing for the comfort, health, safety and <em>general welfare </em>of all employees; <em>and no other provision of the constitution shall impair or limit this power.\u2019\u2019 </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">R.C. 124.39 was clearly enacted pursuant to Section 34, since it provides for the general welfare of employees and gives such employees incentive to accumulate sick time. Consequently, the supremacy clause of Section 34, emphasized above, operates to invalidate conflicting legislation, including East Cleveland Resolution No. 1767 enacted pursuant to the \u201chome rule\u201d provision of Section 3, Article XVIII. Moreover, it may be noted R.C. 124.39(C) provides that a political subdivision may adopt a policy allowing a retiring employee to receive more than one fourth of the value of his unused sick leave. As a general rule of statutory construction, the specific mention of one thing implies the exclusion of another. <em>Montgomery Cty. Bd. of Commrs. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 171, 175, 28 OBR 262, 265, 503 N.E.2d 167, 170. Since R.C. 124.39(C) expressly provides that the political subdivision may pay its retired employees <em>more </em>than one fourth of their accumulated sick time in cash, R.C. 124.39 necessarily implies the exclusion of a provision permitting political subdivisions to deny retiring employees <em>less </em>than the statutorily mandated one-fourth percentage in cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">We, therefore, find the city of East Cleveland cannot constitutionally enact Resolution No. 1767.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">Accordingly, plaintiffs\u2019 assignments of error are well taken and are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">Judgment reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-11\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b454-12\">Krupansky, P.J., and Stillman, J., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b454-13\">John F. Corrigan, J., dissents.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b455-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>Saul G. Stillman, J., retired, of the Eighth Appellate District, sitting by assignment.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b455-4\">John F. Corrigan, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"APr\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s holding that the home rule provision of the Ohio Constitution fails to exempt the city of East Cleveland from the operation of R.C. 124.39(B). This statute does not constitute a law of general nature governing a state-wide concern. The majority\u2019s determination represents a further evisceration of a municipality\u2019s power to regulate purely local matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">\u201cThe purpose of the Home Rule amendments was to put the conduct of municipal affairs in the hands of those who knew the needs of the community best, to wit, the people of the city.\u201d <em>Benevolent Assn. v. Parma </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 375, 379, 15 O.O.3d 450, 453, 402 N.E.2d 519, 522, fn. 1. I recognize that the state\u2019s interest in regulating matters of state-wide concern appropriately limits the home rule powers of a municipality. However, R.C. 124.39(B) interferes with the municipality\u2019s home rule power to fiscally manage the general welfare right of sick leave as established under R.C. 124.38.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">This court has previously determined that R.C. 124.38 is a law of a general nature that establishes for covered employees a vested right in accumulated sick leave. See <em>South Euclid Fraternal Order of Police v. D'Amico </em>(1983), 13 Ohio App.3d 46, 47, 13 OBR 49, 50, 468 N.E.2d 735, 737. However, the municipal employer retains the power to regulate sick leave pursuant to home rule provided that such regulation does not effectively extinguish the benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">Here, the East Cleveland resolution does not destroy the employee\u2019s right to sick leave but merely limits the availability of the benefit to the period of employment. This policy is consistent with the underlying purpose of R.C. 124.38 which is merely to ensure that municipal employees will receive a <em>\u201cminimum </em>sick leave benefit.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) Ebert v. Bd. of Mental Retardation </em>(1980), 63 Ohio St.2d 31, 32, 17 O.O.3d 19, 20, 406 N.E.2d 1098, 1099-1100. The East Cleveland resolution does not reduce the benefit below minimal amounts. Rather, the East Cleveland resolution precludes the award of what amounts to a retirement bonus to qualifying municipal employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">In <em>Civil Serv. Personnel Assn. v. Akron </em>(1984), 20 Ohio App.3d 282, 20 OBR 374, 485 N.E.2d 775, the Court of Appeals for Summit County addressed an issue similar to the issue in the instant action. In that case, the defendant city of Akron refused to give new municipal employees who had transferred from other public agencies credit for sick leave accumulated during that prior employment. This policy directly contravenes the provision in R.C. 124.38 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>which requires the crediting of sick leave accumulated in the public agency from which the employee transfers. In affirming the trial court\u2019s declaration that the city\u2019s home rule powers prevail over that provision of R.C. 124.38, the court of appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-5\">\u201cTransferring sick leave credits does not revolve around a statewide concern that all public employees be granted some sick leave. Rather, it concerns a matter of fiscal policy which is well within the realm of local self-government, and not a concern for any political body except the municipality against which it is desired to be applied.\u201d <em>Id., </em>20 Ohio App.3d at 284, 20 OBR at 376, 485 N.E.2d at 777-778.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">I find this reasoning persuasive. Here, the disposition upon retirement of the accumulated sick leave of municipal employees constitutes a matter of local fiscal policy rather than a matter of state-wide concern. The city\u2019s resolution does not operate to impair the sick leave benefit created under R.C. 124.38. The resolution appropriately limits the availability of the benefit to the period of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">The intent of R.C. 124.39(B) is to discourage the misuse of sick leave. The vested right is to sick leave claimed pursuant to the statute. Under home rule a municipality has the power and is in the best position to determine what method to employ to discourage abuse of sick leave. In <em>South Euclid Fraternal Order of Police v. D\u2019Amico, supra, </em>13 Ohio App.3d at 48, 13 OBR at 52, 468 N.E.2d at 738, cited by the majority, this court, in finding the South Euclid ordinance unconstitutional, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-8\">\u201cThis ordinance contains two major parts, \u2018137.04 SICK LEAVE DEFINED,\u2019 and \u2018137.06 JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL OF SICK LEAVE.\u2019 The first part is clearly unconstitutional since only R.C. 124.38 can define what \u2018sick leave\u2019 is. <em>The second part is just as clearly within the power of the city to enact procedures to see that sick leave is properly used.\" </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">There are numerous methods to discourage unwarranted absenteeism and to reward faithful performance of duties which do not have a direct fiscal impact. This type of decision properly rests with the municipality.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">Accordingly, I would affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment that the city\u2019s sick leave resolution constitutes a proper exercise of the city\u2019s home rule powers.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
