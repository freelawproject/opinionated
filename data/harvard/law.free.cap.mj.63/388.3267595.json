We granted review of the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9M\">WHETHER THE LOWER COURT ERRED WHEN IT DETERMINED THAT THE MILITARY JUDGE DID NOT ABUSE HIS DISCRETION BY ADMITTING EVIDENCE OF UNCHARGED MISCONDUCT IN VIOLATION OF MILITARY RULE OF EVIDENCE 404(b) OVER DEFENSE OBJECTION.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">We hold that the military judge abused his discretion when he admitted the evidence of uncharged misconduct over defense objection. However, we further hold that Appellant suffered no material prejudice to his substantial rights as a result of this error. Therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Appellant, a twenty-nine-year-old sergeant in the Marine Corps at the time of his court-martial, was a member of Headquarters and Service Battalion, Marine Corps Base, Quan-tico, Virginia. At the time of the alleged offenses, Appellant was serving as an instructor at Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG), Maryland. The charges in Appellant\u2019s case stemmed from alleged incidents of unwanted physical and verbal advances by Appellant toward four female Army trainees at APG, Private (PVT) SD, PVT SK, Private First Class (PFC) LT, and PFC BL, in the fall of 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">Prior to trial, defense counsel moved to suppress Appellant\u2019s statements on November 21, 1997, to special agents from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS). Specifically, the defense sought to suppress a written statement made by Appellant detailing his physical encounters with PVT SK, PVT SD, and PFC LT. According to Appellant\u2019s written statement, he and the three trainees kissed, but it was voluntary and willing on their part. The military judge denied Appellant\u2019s motion to suppress. At trial, Appellant proceeded on a theory that the physical interactions between Appellant and the four trainees were in fact consensual, in accordance with his written statement to NCIS.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">During pretrial motions, the Government sought to introduce the testimony of RB, a former Marine Lance Corporal, who was stationed with Appellant at Twentynine Palms, California, in the spring of 1994. In addition to her testimony, the Government also sought to introduce a Diserimination/Sexual Harassment Incident Report as part of Appellant\u2019s service record book. The two-page report detailed the investigation of RB\u2019s allegations and the actions taken against Appellant as a result. The Government offered both pieces of evidence under Military Rule of Evidence (M.R.E.) 404(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">During a session pursuant to Article 39(a), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 839(a) (2000), prior to trial, the trial counsel and the military judge had the following exchange on the admissibility of RB\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-11\">MJ: What is\u2014how is it that this [sic] relevant? What does [RB] have to say about what happened in 1994, how is [sic] relevant to the offenses in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-12\">TC: Okay, sir. First, on the accused\u2019s intent, we\u2019ve got offenses that have to do with the intent of the accused and these will [sic] talk about, we believe, this evidence will allow the members to see the accused\u2019s intent, what the ease law that I\u2019ve cited talks about as a predatory intent on the part of the accused. We have not\u2014 well, we\u2019ve got a few theories, sir. This is not by any chance the mantra that is exactly in the\u2014common plan, scheme, intent, motive. This is\u2014we\u2019ve got three purposes, we\u2019re offering it, and first is the intent, second is to defeat the accused\u2019s claim that the acts were consensual, and third to show the accused\u2019s plan, if you will, to sexually harass, dominate and touch subordinate females that he\u2019s able to separate from the pack, if you will. And, admittedly the third and the first may merge at some point, but the evidence itself will give the members a picture of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>the accused\u2019s intent. And intent is relevant in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-5\">MJ: Okay. You focus on the intent. You believe that this evidence would be relevant on the issue of intent as it relates to the indecent assault specification?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-6\">TC: That\u2019s correct, sir. We believe that and we believe also when you talk about the plan of the accused that that encompasses the sexual harassment and maltreatment aspects that were charged with it. And that\u2019s why I say at some point they may merge, but certainly we do believe it impacts on his intent to gratify his sexual desire. The acts that [RB] will testify, the statements that he made, the repeated nature of the statements, the complete ignorance of [his] comments, please stop, leave me alone, just the complete roll over and you\u2019ll see how that and what has happened in the instance with these four victims, how that segues and we\u2019ll be able to show the members the intent of the accused here. It gives them a picture of it and we believe it is necessary for the government\u2019s case, it\u2019s relevant, material, and it\u2019s permissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">In response, defense counsel objected to the introduction of RB\u2019s testimony on multiple grounds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-8\">DC: I would ask how the government is going to link up [RB]\u2019s testimony with Sergeant Barnett\u2019s intent? He\u2019s made\u2014 Major Bowe has made some general propositions but there\u2019s a total lack of specificity here as to how whatever she says is going to prove either intent, plan, or defeat the claim of consent to Sergeant Barnett. I would state that these things are so temporally removed that there is no logical nexus in either times, place, or space between what happened in 1994 and what happened in 1997____ I believe what you\u2019re going to hear is no allegations of an indecent assault by [RB] at all. Basically they are the nature of repeated comments. She\u2019s going to say that she told him to stop a bunch of times and he didn\u2019t, whereas the allegations from Aberdeen once told to stop, Sergeant Barnett apparently did stop. In Aberdeen the allegations involved being [sic] one on one contact, being alone and trying to ensure that they\u2019re alone and in a closed space. Whereas, [RB] is going to say whenever one instance of touching occurred, occurred [sic] with a couple of other Marines in the room. There was no actual one on one contact with him, just a series of phone calls and comments----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-12\">That being said ... this is definitely going to fail the 403 legal relevancy test, definitely a substantial risk of unfair prejudice to the accused, confusion of the issues, and a great propensity to mislead the members, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-13\">During another session pursuant to Article 39(a), UCMJ, the military judge ruled on the Government\u2019s motion to admit RB\u2019s testimony and the incident report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-14\">MJ: Gentlemen, the defense of mistake of fact has an essential part, whether it\u2019s mistake of fact as to a specific intent offense or a general intent offense, that the accused\u2019s mistake of fact as to consent, that\u2019s the mistake of fact at issue in this case, was honestly held, that he truly believed it that is, that in this ease PFC [LT], [PVT SD], [PVT SK] and PFC [BL] consented to his touchings and comments---The testimony of [RB] is relevant in that it shows that on a prior occasion that the accused was informed in what appear to be very clear terms that his conduct wasn\u2019t welcomed, and, hence, not consented to under similar circumstances. Hence, it\u2019s relevant in this proceeding---- I noted that they are relevant given the defense posture and the evidence which has been introduced in support of that posture. I will give a cautionary instruction to the members on the use of the evidence and, hence, I\u2019m convinced that with that instruction being provided to the members both now and during\u2014or prior to their deliberations that the probative value of this evidence is not substantially outweighed by its prejudicial impact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-18\">The page 11 entry and the incident report which was provided to me for consideration on this matter in the Article 39(a) session previously, and which I have considered herein, are not admitted and will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>not be admitted pursuant to this. I find that their prejudicial impact to admit at this time the page 11 entry would be cumulative and that at this time that its introduction would be substantially more prejudicial than probative.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">Before RB was brought before the members to testify, the military judge gave the following limiting instruction at the defense counsel\u2019s request:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-5\">MJ: Evidence that the accused may have made sexually provocative comments to [RB] and may have touched her in a purportedly provocative manner may be considered by you for the limited purpose of its tendency, if any, to rebut the contention of the defense evidence that the accused\u2019s participation in the offenses of indecent assault under Charge IV with [PVT SD], [PFC LT], and [PVT SK], and the offenses of maltreatment in the specifications under Charge II with [PVT SD] and [PFC LT], [PVT SK], and [PFC BL] as the result of mistake on the accused\u2019s part as to consent on the part of the persons who were in Charge II and IV, which are before you, the object of the accused\u2019s alleged sexual touchings and/or comments. You may not consider this evidence for any other purpose and you may not conclude from this evidence that the accused is a bad person or has criminal tendencies and that he therefore committed the offenses which are charged and which are before the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">The military judge repeated this instruction at the close of RB\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">During the prosecution\u2019s case, all four of the complaining witnesses testified against Appellant. Although each of the trainee\u2019s testimony differed, three of the four trainees described a physical encounter with Appellant that included kissing and fondling. The fourth trainee testified that Appellant mentioned wanting to kiss her during class one morning and also attempted to tickle her on another occasion. None of the trainees testified that she told Appellant to stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">RB testified that, while serving as the maintenance company clerk at Twentynine Palms in 1994, she and Appellant \u201chad to communicate on a daily basis\u201d for administrative reasons. RB stated that she began receiving phone calls from Appellant that \u201cstarted out on a business matter\u201d but would then change. When asked to elaborate on this change, RB offered the following: \u201cThe tone of his voice would change. He started making comments [that] I had a sexy voice, things of that nature. He would whisper comments to me over the phone.\u201d When asked what specific comments Appellant made, RB stated that \u201c[t]here [were] several comments ranging from, you have a sexy voice, you should have married a man like me, not your husband. He made a comment that he wanted to know what it was like to have sex with a white pregnant woman. I was pregnant at the time.\u201d RB testified that in addition to Appellant\u2019s frequent phone calls, he also made similar comments to her in-person, although \u201c[v]ery few times.\u201d The only physical contact RB testified to was Appellant rubbing his arm on her arm while they were both seated in Appellant\u2019s office at his computer.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">On the issue of consent, trial counsel and RB had the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-11\">Q: Now, when Sergeant Barnett made these comments to you over the phone, what would you say to him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-12\">A: On several occasions I asked him to stop.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-13\">Q: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-14\">A: Stop calling and hang up the phone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-15\">Q: When you would tell him to stop, stop'\u2014-give us an idea of what you would say to him? Would you simply say stop or did you make a comment, what would it be?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-16\">A: I started out just by saying, you know, you don\u2019t need to be saying these things. Then it started being like you need to stop making these comments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-17\">Q: And when you would make your comment like that, you need to stop or stop making these comments, would Sergeant Barnett respond at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-18\">A: No, sir, he did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-19\">Q: And on occasion would more sexual comments follow?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-20\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Q: And then you said you had to hang up the phone?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-5\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">During closing arguments, trial counsel summarized the import of RB\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-7\">Is the accused aware of what he is doing? Is he aware of what he is doing, or is this a mistake? Is he aware of what he is doing? Ask yourself that. And when you\u2019re thinking about that, and you\u2019re thinking about the four victims in this case, think about [RB]. Think about what happened to her three years before these events. She told you how she was sexually harassed by the accused. Not anything like these privates, not anything like these privates. Touched, the comments, \u2018You shouldn\u2019t have married him, you should have married a guy like me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-8\">She says no. Why is this important? Why is that important, \u201cShe says no\u201d? Because it doesn\u2019t matter. She tells you she says no. She has to hang up on him. She has to hang up on him a number of times. Sometimes he comes and visits her and he says it, and she can\u2019t hang up. You get a picture of what these privates were going to go through.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">Trial defense counsel, by contrast, reiterated Appellant\u2019s mistake of fact defense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-10\">The military judge is going to instruct you, mistake of fact is a defense to indecent assault, sexual harassment, mistreatment. What was going on through Sergeant Barnett\u2019s mind? It doesn\u2019t even have to be reasonable for indecent assault. No matter how unreasonable, as long as he perceived there was consent\u2014and you see that in his statement\u2014and you saw that from the testimony of these girls, that they said no and he kept going and they didn\u2019t do anything, they said nothing, he kept going. You know, a reasonable person would consider that to be consent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-11\">Following closing arguments, the military judge instructed the members on the mistake of fact defense and repeated his earlier limiting instruction with regard to RB\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-12\">On review, the lower court applied the three-part test set forth in <em>United States v. Reynolds, </em>29 M.J. 105, 109 (C.M.A.1989), to determine whether RB\u2019s testimony should have been admitted under M.R.E. 404(b). <em>Barnett, </em>2004 CCA LEXIS 285, at *3-*4, 2004 WL 3015292, at *l-*2. The lower court concluded that the evidence had been properly admitted and that the military judge did not abuse his discretion. 2004 CCA LEXIS 285, at *6-*7, 2004 WL 3015292 at *2.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-15\">First, the finder of fact could reasonably conclude that the acts RB complained of did occur and that the appellant is the person who committed those acts.... Second, the appellant\u2019s commission of the prior acts is probative of whether he believed the victims consented to his physical contact. Consent was a material issue raised by the appellant in his own defense. Third, while the relevant evidence was prejudicial to the appellant, the danger of unfair prejudice did not substantially outweigh its probative value. The military judge gave a cautionary instruction immediately before and after RB\u2019s testimony and again before deliberations on findings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-16\">2004 CCA LEXIS 285, at *6, 2004 WL 3015292, at *2 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-17\">On appeal to this Court, Appellant argues that the military judge abused his discretion when he allowed RB to testify. According to Appellant, RB\u2019s testimony fails all three of the prongs in <em>Reynolds. </em>Specifically, Appellant argues that RB\u2019s testimony was not probative of Appellant\u2019s mistake of fact defense \u201cbecause her allegations constituted completely different facts and circumstances.\u201d With regard to the third prong, Appellant argues that the probative value of RB\u2019s testimony did not outweigh its prejudicial value. \u201c[RB]\u2019s testimony only created a picture of Appellant\u2019s propensity to engage in inappropriate behavior. The unfair prejudicial effect of [RB]\u2019s testimony included that Appellant was obsessive and possessed uncommon sexual fetishes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-18\">In response, the Government argues that the military judge did not abuse his discretion and that he properly applied the three-prong test in <em>Reynolds. </em>The Government further asserts that, even if the military judge did err, there was no material preju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>dice to Appellant\u2019s substantial rights. In support of this conclusion, the Government summarizes the evidence in this case, and reiterates the strength of the Government\u2019s case at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">\u201cA military judge\u2019s decision to admit or exclude evidence is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>United States v. McDonald, </em>59 M.J. 426, 430 (C.A.A.F.2004) (citing <em>United States v. Tanksley, </em>54 M.J. 169, 175 (C.A.A.F.2000), <em>overruled on other grounds by United States v. Inong, </em>58 M.J. 460, 464 (C.A.A.F.2003)). \u201c[A] military judge abuses his discretion if his findings of fact are clearly erroneous or his conclusions of law are incorrect.\u201d <em>United States v. Ayala, </em>43 M.J. 296, 298 (C.A.A.F.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">M.R.E. 404(b)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-7\">Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">As noted, this Court in <em>Reynolds </em>established a three-part test to determine the admissibility of uncharged misconduct under M.R.E. 404(b):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-9\">1. Does the evidence reasonably support a finding by the court members that appellant committed prior crimes, wrongs or acts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-13\">2. What \u201cfact ... of consequence\u201d is made \u201cmore\u201d or \u201cless probable\u201d by the existence of this evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-14\">3. Is the \u201cprobative value ... substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice\u201d?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-15\">29 M.J. at 109 (citations omitted). The evidence at issue must fulfill all three prongs to be admissible. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe first and second prongs address the logical relevance of the evidence.\u201d <em>McDonald, </em>59 M.J. at 429; M.R.E. 401; M.R.E. 402; <em>see also Huddle-ston v. United States, </em>485 U.S. 681, 686-87, 689, 108 S.Ct. 1496, 99 L.Ed.2d 771 (1988). \u201cThe third prong ensures that the evidence is legally, as well as logically, relevant.\u201d <em>McDonald, </em>59 M.J. at 429; M.R.E. 403; <em>see also Huddleston, </em>485 U.S. at 687-88, 108 S.Ct. 1496.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-16\">Here, as detailed above, trial counsel offered three theories to support admission of the uncharged misconduct evidence, including intent,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> plan,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and to rebut Appellant\u2019s mistake of fact defense. Despite defense counsel\u2019s objection, the military judge admitted the evidence as relevant to rebut Appellant\u2019s claim that the four trainees consented to his advances. Specifically, as noted previously, the military judge stated that RB\u2019s testimony was \u201crelevant in that it shows that on a prior occasion ... the accused was informed in what appear to be very clear terms that his conduct wasn\u2019t welcomed, and, hence, not consented to under similar circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-17\">Resolution of the issue in this case centers around the second and third prongs of <em>Reynolds. </em>The first question in this case is one of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>logical relevance\u2014whether the factual dissimilarities between the offenses charged at trial and the prior uncharged misconduct were so great such that the military judge abused his discretion when he allowed RB to testify. The second question in this case, assuming the prior uncharged misconduct was logically relevant, is one of legal relevance\u2014-whether any unfair prejudice created by the evidence outweighed its probative value. We address these two questions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">\n<em>Logical relevance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">The military judge\u2019s ruling to admit the evidence was premised on two related implicit findings, first, that because RB did not consent to his actions, Appellant should have known that the four trainees also did not consent, and, second, that Appellant should have known because the circumstances were similar in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">With regard to the first implicit finding, consent, as a legal matter, and in the context of adult relations, is a fact-specific inquiry that must be made on a case-by-case basis. <em>See United States v. Hibbard, </em>58 M.J. 71, 75-76 (C.A.A.F.2003); <em>see Manual for Courts-Martial, United States </em>pt. IV, para. 45.b.(l)(b) (2005 ed.) <em>(MCM). </em>In this case, the facts are such that consent, or lack thereof, cannot be determined with reference to the prior uncharged misconduct. With RB, Appellant engaged in escalating verbal harassment of a eoworker, resulting in RB explicitly telling Appellant to stop calling her and to stop making inappropriate comments. By contrast, with the four trainees, Appellant engaged in largely continuous physical harassment of subordinates in a teaching environment where he was never explicitly told to stop. Regardless of whether Appellant should have known that his advances toward subordinate female trainees were inappropriate, RB\u2019s requests that Appellant stop calling her and stop making sexual comments does not show that Appellant could not have mistakenly believed that any of the four trainees consented to his later actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">With regard to the second implicit finding, there are significant factual differences between the circumstances RB described and those the four trainees described, aside from those noted above. In <em>Morrison, </em>this Court conducted a six-part analysis of prior uncharged misconduct to determine admissibility under M.R.E. 404(b) where the accused was charged with multiple specifications of child molestation. 52 M.J. at 122-23. Citing <em>United States v. Munoz, </em>32 M.J. 359, 363 (C.M.A.1991), this Court identified the following as relevant to its analysis: (1) the \u201c[r]elationship between victims and appellant\u201d; (2) the \u201c[a]ges of the victims\u201d; (3) the \u201c[n]ature of the acts\u201d; (4) the \u201c[s]itus of the acts\u201d; (5) the \u201c[c]ircum-stances of the acts\u201d; and (6) the \u201c[t]ime span.\u201d <em>Id. </em>All but the second criterion is relevant to this case. We examine these criteria in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-11\"><em>Relationship between the victims and appellant: </em>Unlike the four trainees, who were students under Appellant\u2019s supervision, RB testified that she had only an administrative relationship with Appellant in which she was not subject to his supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-12\"><em>Nature of the acts: </em>RB testified that the only physical contact she had with Appellant was when he rubbed his arm against hers while they were both seated at the computer in his office. By contrast, three of the four trainees testified to repeated overt sexual acts that included kissing and fondling. The fourth trainee testified that Appellant mentioned wanting to kiss her during class one morning and also attempted to tickle her on another occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-13\"><em>Situs of the acts: </em>RB testified that Appellant made inappropriate comments toward her over the telephone and also in-person when he would stop by her office. The one incident of touching occurred in Appellant\u2019s office. By contrast, Appellant\u2019s statements to the four trainees were always in-person. Furthermore, Appellant\u2019s comments and actions did not occur in an office setting, but rather, in the context of his teaching duties, in a tank, for example, or in a classroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-14\"><em>Circumstances of the acts: </em>In this case, as in <em>Morrison, </em>there is no common theme. 52 M.J. at 123. While there are multiple, notable similarities between the circumstances of Appellant\u2019s acts towards the four trainees, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>compared to the circumstances of Appellant\u2019s largely verbal conduct toward RB, the similarities are few.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\"><em>Time </em>span: The charges against Appellant stem from incidents occurring in late October 1997 through early November 1997. By contrast, RB testified that her encounters with Appellant were from April 1994 until August of 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">In sum, the evidence of Appellant\u2019s prior uncharged misconduct with RB had only marginal logical relevance to the present charged conduct. Despite trial counsel\u2019s arguments to the contrary, RB\u2019s explicit instructions to Appellant to stop are not probative of whether Appellant reasonably could have mistaken the four trainees\u2019 silence as consent. Furthermore, the evidence is only marginally relevant under either of the other two theories trial counsel offered\u2014intent and plan. During trial counsel\u2019s lengthy proffer to the military judge, he argued that RB\u2019s testimony would be probative of Appellant\u2019s \u201cpredatory intent\u201d and also \u201cto show the accused\u2019s plan ... to sexually harass, dominate and touch subordinate females that he[ ] [was] able to separate from the pack____\u201d However, both of these alternative bases for admissibility are weak. As in <em>Morrison, </em>\u201c[t]he charged acts were so overtly sexual that motive and intent were not in issue.\u201d 52 M.J. at 123. In addition, Appellant\u2019s actions toward RB, and the context in which they occurred, do not tend to show a common plan. RB was not a subordinate female to Appellant in the same way that the trainees were. As noted, Appellant and RB had a purely administrative, as opposed to an instructive, relationship. In addition, there was no \u201cpack\u201d from which Appellant could separate RB.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">\n<em>Legal relevance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">Even assuming the evidence of Appellant\u2019s prior uncharged misconduct was logically relevant, to be admissible, it must still pass the test of legal relevance under the third prong of <em>Reynolds. </em>Recently, in <em>United States v. Berry, </em>this Court outlined the following criteria for testing legal relevance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-10\">In conducting the M.R.E. 403 balancing test a military judge should consider the following factors: the strength of the proof of the prior act; the probative weight of the evidence; the potential to present less prejudicial evidence; the possible distraction of the fact-finder; the time needed to prove the prior conduct; the temporal proximity of the prior event; the frequency of the acts; the presence of any intervening circumstances; and the relationship between the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-13\">61 M.J. 91, 95-96 (C.A.A.F.2005) (citing <em>United States v. Wright, </em>53 M.J. 476, 482 (C.A.A.F.2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-14\">In his ruling on the defense motion, the military judge did not conduct the balancing inquiry under M.R.E. 403 on the record. <em>See id. </em>at 96 (\u201cWhere the military judge is required to do a balancing test under M.R.E. 403 and does not sufficiently articulate his balancing on the record, his evidentiary ruling will receive less deference from this court.\u201d). Instead, the military judge stated the following: \u201cI\u2019m convinced that with that instruction being provided to the members both now and during\u2014or prior to their deliberations that the probative value of this evidence is not substantially outweighed by its prejudicial impact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-15\">As defense counsel argued at trial, RB\u2019s testimony carried a \u201csubstantial risk of unfair prejudice\u201d to Appellant including \u201cconfusion of the issues, and a great propensity to mislead.\u201d Both of these statements are true. The issue in this case was whether the four trainees consented to Appellant\u2019s actions. RB\u2019s testimony was, at best, marginally probative on this point. Furthermore, in order to challenge RB\u2019s credibility, the defense called various witnesses to rebut her claims and also to refute what she claimed reporting at the time of the incident. Just as importantly, RB\u2019s testimony raised the specter of unfair prejudice in two ways. First, RB\u2019s testimony portrayed Appellant to the members as not just a noncommissioned officer who abused his authority over trainees, but as a sergeant who made advances toward the Marine wife of another Marine. Second, some of Appellant\u2019s comments included racial overtones. RB testified that a \u201cfew times\u201d Appellant told her that \u201che wanted to know <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>what it was like to have sex with a white pregnant woman.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">In light of the marginal relevance of RB\u2019s testimony, we conclude that the danger of unfair prejudice from these aspects of RB\u2019s testimony substantially outweighed the probative value of the evidence. In this context, the military judge\u2019s limiting instruction could not eliminate the unfair prejudice created by RB\u2019s testimony in light of its low probative value coupled with the nature of the prejudice. C<em>f. United States v. Owens, </em>21 M.J. 117, 124 (C.M.A.1985) (finding a limiting instruction that restricted members\u2019 consideration to an issue on which prior act evidence had \u201cconsiderable probative value\u201d substantially reduced evidence\u2019s \u201cprejudicial tendencies\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">For the above reasons, even assuming the evidence was logically relevant, the military judge erred when he found that the danger of unfair prejudice did not substantially outweigh its probative value. M.R.E. 403. Therefore, the evidence in this ease fails to fulfill not only the second, but also the third prong of <em>Reynolds.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">\n<em>Prejudice</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">Having determined that the military judge abused his discretion, we must now determine whether this error resulted in material prejudice to Appellant\u2019s substantial rights. Article 59(a), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 859(a) (2000). \u201cWe evaluate prejudice from an erroneous evidentiary ruling by weighing (1) the strength of the Government\u2019s case, (2) the strength of the defense case, (3) the materiality of the evidence in question, and (4) the quality of the evidence in question.\u201d <em>United States v. Kerr, </em>51 M.J. 401, 405 (C.A.A.F.1999) (citing <em>United States v. Weeks, </em>20 M.J. 22, 25 (C.M.A.1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-13\">Here, the Government\u2019s case, aside from RB\u2019s testimony and the two-page incident report, was strong. All four of the complainants testified and there were similarities between their respective rendition of events. There is nothing in the record to indicate that these four individuals were not credible witnesses. The defense, by contrast, did not present a compelling case. The crux of Appellant\u2019s defense was that he reasonably believed that the four trainees consented to his actions. However, all four denied that the encounters were consensual and each recounted some type of nonverbal manifestation of their unwillingness to be touched by Appellant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Finally, the evidence involving RB, even if relevant, was of marginal importance given the difference in contexts. As stated above, the events involving RB happened almost three years earlier. In addition, the defense brought in two witnesses to rebut RB\u2019s version of events. For these reasons, we hold that the erroneous admission of RB\u2019s testimony was harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-14\">DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"b453-15\">The decision of the United States Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b445-10\">. Appellant was originally charged with indecent assault under this specification. Appellant was acquitted of this offense, but found guilty of the lesser included offense of indecent acts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b450-10\">. Although M.R.E. 413 permits evidence of similar crimes in sexual assault cases, we do not decide whether the evidence in this case would have been admissible under M.R.E. 413 for two reasons. First, M.R.E. 413 was not in effect at the time of Appellant\u2019s court-martial. <em>See United States v. Morrison, </em>52 M.J. 117, 121 n. 4 (C.A.A.F.1999). Second, Appellant's uncharged misconduct does not qualify as sexual assault under M.R.E. 413.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b450-11\">. As noted, trial counsel offered the following explanation when pressed by the military judge on the theory of intent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-12\">[Cjertainly we do believe that it impacts on his intent to gratify his sexual desire. The acts that [RB] will testify, the statements that he made, the repeated nature of the statements, the complete ignorance of [his] comments, please stop, leave me alone, just the complete roll over and you'll see how that and what has happened in the instance with these four victims, how that segues and we\u2019ll be able to show the members the intent of the accused here.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b450-19\">. As noted, trial counsel offered the following explanation on the theory of plan: \"[A]nd third to show the accused's plan, if you will, to sexually harass, dominate and touch subordinate females that he\u2019s able to separate from the pack....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b453-10\">. PVT SD testified that she pulled her legs together when Appellant touched her legs and pubic area and pushed his hand away when Appellant rubbed her breast.
