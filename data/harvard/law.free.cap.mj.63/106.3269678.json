Contrary to his pleas, he was convicted of one specification of indecent acts and one specification of wrongful possession of visual depictions of nude minors, both offenses in violation of Article 134, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 934 (2000). Appellant was sentenced to a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for twelve months, and reduction to E-l. The convening authority approved only nine months of confinement and waived automatic forfeitures but otherwise approved the sentence as adjudged. The Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals found no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>error and affirmed. <em>United States v. Brisbane, </em>No. ACM 35384 (A.F.Ct.Crim.App. Nov. 5, 2004).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">For the reasons stated below, we conclude, based on the facts in this case, that Ms. Lynch, the Family Advocacy treatment manager who initially questioned Appellant, was acting in furtherance of a law enforcement investigation. As a result, Appellant was entitled to a rights advisement under Article 31, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 831 (2000). However, we find the admission of Appellant\u2019s statements to Ms. Lynch harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because Appellant repeated the same information, and more, to the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) six weeks later, and these statements were admissible. These subsequent statements were not derivative of Appellant\u2019s earlier statements to Ms. Lynch; they were voluntary, and Appellant has not demonstrated that AFOSI engaged in the type of \u201cquestion-first\u201d tactic addressed by the Supreme Court in <em>Missouri v. Seibert, </em>542 U.S. 600, 124 S.Ct. 2601, 159 L.Ed.2d 643 (2004). With respect to Issue III, we conclude that the evidence was legally sufficient. Based on the circumstances of Appellant\u2019s case, any rational factfinder could find beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant\u2019s possession of child pornography was service-discrediting or prejudicial to good-order and discipline. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b164-12\">On or about June 1, 2001, Appellant showed his eight-year-old stepdaughter, S, pictures of naked adult women on his computer in response to her question about what she would look like when she was older. S meant the question in terms of what she would wear when she graduated. Appellant misunderstood the question, as he told one of his colleagues, to be how would S develop physically. At the time, Appellant\u2019s wife was on vacation in Hawaii. S subsequently told a neighbor about the pictures, and the neighbor called Family Advocacy to report the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-13\">After Family Advocacy received this \u201creferral,\u201d the Child Sexual Maltreatment Response Team (CSMRT)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> convened. Ms. Lynch, the Family Advocacy treatment manager and a civilian Department of Defense employee, testified that the participants agreed that she, Ms. Lynch, would conduct the initial interviews of Appellant and S.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>trial, Ms. Lynch stated that the CSMRT decided that she would go first \u201c[t]o determine if we had enough information to proceed.\u201d Upon examination by the court, Ms. Lynch responded in the affirmative when the military judge inquired whether she was \u201cnormally the one who is the first [] to conduct interviews after a CSMRT meeting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">On June 1, 2001, Ms. Lynch interviewed S and then Appellant. According to Ms. Lynch, she explained to Appellant that he had \u201climited confidentiality\u201d during their interview. Ms. Lynch did not give Appellant an Article 31 rights advisement. In response to questions from the trial counsel, Ms. Lynch stated that she had never given anyone an Article 31 rights advisement or <em>Miranda </em>warnings and that she had not received any training in the matter because that was \u201cjust not part of [her] job.\u201d Ms. Lynch testified at trial that Appellant was \u201cvery cooperative\u201d during the interview and that \u201c[h]e seemed relaxed.\u201d Ms. Lynch\u2019s first question to Appellant was: \u201cDid you do it?\u201d Ms. Lynch testified that Appellant told her that his stepdaughter had been asking questions about her body. He then stated that in response he had downloaded some pictures from an adult site on the Internet and had shown them to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">After Ms. Lynch completed her interviews, the information was forwarded to the Family Maltreatment Case Management Team (FMCMT).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> According to Special Agent Corey Allison, AFOSI decided not to pursue the matter at that time because it \u201clacked credible information to open a substantive investigation.\u201d He testified that the matter was reported as a \u201czero.\u201d Special Agent Allison gave the following explanation of a \u201czero\u201d: \u201cIt means informational file. It is documented and an inquiry is to be documented for future reference, if necessary.\u201d After categorizing the file as a \u201czero,\u201d Special Agent Allison, according to procedure, forwarded the file to a \u201cforensic science consultant.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Later, the forensic consultants recommended that AFOSI revisit the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-17\">On June 27, 2001, the FMCMT met. According to an e-mail dated July 6, 2001, from Sharon K. Burnett, the AFOSI Detachment Commander, additional information was provided during this meeting \u201cwhich raised some concerns.\u201d At trial, defense counsel sought to establish through cross-examination that it was Ms. Lynch\u2019s information that prompted AFOSI to open an investigation. However, Special Agent Allison maintained that it was the recommendation by the forensic science consultant that AFOSI revisit the case that prompted the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-18\">On July 13, 2001, Special Agents Allison and Chris Winters interviewed Appellant in their office.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Special Agent Allison testified that they \u201cread [Appellant] his rights, [and] he agreed to speak to us without the presence of an attorney.\u201d Special Agent Allison characterized Appellant\u2019s demeanor as \u201ccalm and forthright.\u201d Appellant reduced the content of his interview with AFOSI to a signed statement in which he admitted showing nude adult pictures to his stepdaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-19\">After concluding the interview, Special Agent Allison and Jim Scott, a member of the Joint Drug Enforcement Team, accompanied Appellant back to his government quar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>ters where he agreed to show them the pictures he had shown his stepdaughter. After viewing the pictures, Special Agent Allison asked for Appellant\u2019s consent to take possession of the computer for analysis. However, after giving consent, but before Special Agent Allison took possession of the computer, Appellant produced on the screen \u201cwhat looked like thumbnail pictures of naked children.\u201d According to Special Agent Allison, Appellant\u2019s demeanor at that moment \u201cchanged considerably.\u201d \u201cHe started to shake, visibly sweating, turned red, turned around stammering,\u201d telling the Agent that he \u201c \u2018thought it was okay to have pictures of child pornography as long as it was for educational purposes.\u2019 \u201d Later that day, Appellant signed a confession relating to the child pornography found on his computer.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">At some point after initiation of the investigation but before trial, Appellant had a conversation with his neighbor, Staff Sergeant (SSGT) Justin Gilbert, concerning the pictures that Appellant had downloaded and his subsequent interaction with his stepdaughter regarding the pictures. According to SSGT Gilbert, Appellant indicated that he had downloaded some adult pictures in order to answer his stepdaughter\u2019s questions about how she would develop physically as she got older. Appellant further explained to SSGT Gilbert that the pictures were \u201ctasteful\u201d and were \u201ckind of like you\u2019d find of a girl on the beach.\u201d Appellant went on to describe how the neighbors had heard of this and had reported him to the authorities who in turn had confiscated his computer. Also according to SSGT Gilbert, Appellant stated that \u201cthe worst thing that they were going to get him on was that he only had seven pictures of kids on his computer.\u201d At trial SSGT Gilbert testified that he found this conversation \u201ckind of disturbing\u201d to the point that he contacted AFOSI to inquire whether any of the pictures included images of his children. He learned that none of the images included his children.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Appellant challenges his conviction before this Court on the grounds that: (1) the military judge abused his discretion when he failed to suppress Appellant\u2019s statements to the Family Advocacy provider; (2) his subsequent interrogation by Government agents was unconstitutional in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Missouri v. Seibert, </em>(3) the absence of a cleansing warning by AFOSI tainted his subsequent statements to them, even though those statements were preceded by a rights warning; and (4) the Government did not present sufficient evidence on the issues of prejudice to good order and service-discrediting conduct regarding his possession of visual depictions of nude minors.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">The Government responds that Appellant was not entitled to a rights advisement under Article 31 because the Family Advocacy provider was not working as a law enforcement agent when she interviewed Appellant, and therefore, she was not subject to the UCMJ. The Government further argues that Appellant\u2019s subsequent confession to AFOSI was voluntary under all the circumstances and therefore not tainted by his previous admissions to Ms. Lynch. Finally, the Government argues that the prosecution was not required to prove actual harm to the service\u2019s reputation to support Appellant\u2019s conviction for possession of visual depictions of nude minors.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">\n<em>Appellant\u2019s Statements to the Family Advocacy Provider</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">\u201cWhen there is a motion to suppress a statement on the ground that rights\u2019 warnings were not given, [this Court] reviewfs] the military judge\u2019s findings of fact on a clearly-erroneous standard, and ... conclusions of law <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Swift, </em>53 M.J. 439, 446 (C.A.A.F.2000) (citing <em>United States v. Ayala, </em>43 M.J. 296, 298 (C.A.A.F.1995)); <em>United States v. Moses, </em>45 M.J. 132, 135 (C.A.A.F.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-11\">Article 31(b) reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b166-12\">No person subject to this chapter may interrogate, or request any statement from an accused or a person suspected of an offense without first informing him of the nature of the accusation and advising him that he does not have to make any statement regarding the offense of which he is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>accused or suspected and that any statement made by him may be used as evidence against him in a trial by court-martial.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">10 U.S.C. \u00a7 831(b) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Resolution of the first issue in this case turns on whether Ms. Lynch, the Family Advocacy treatment manager, was a \u201cperson subject to the code\u201d for the purposes of Article 31(b) and Military Rule of Evidence (M.R.E.) 305(e). Under M.R.E. 305(b)(1), such a person \u201cincludes a person acting as a knowing agent of a military unit or of a person subject to the code.\u201d We have identified:</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">at least two instances when civilian investigators working in conjunction with military officials must comply with Article 31: \u201c(1) When the scope and character of the cooperative efforts demonstrate \u2018that the two investigations merged into an indivisible entity,\u2019 and (2) when the civilian investigator acts in furtherance of any military investigation, or in any sense as an instrument of the military.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\"><em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>60 M.J. 239, 252 (C.A.A.F.2004) (quoting <em>United States v. Penn, </em>18 C.M.A. 194, 199, 39 C.M.R. 194, 199 (1969) (citations omitted)); <em>see also United States v. Lonetree, </em>35 M.J. 396 (C.M.A.1992); <em>United States v. Quillen, </em>27 M.J. 312, 314 (C.M.A.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">This Court most recently considered the issue of social workers and Article 31 in <em>United States v. Raymond, </em>38 M.J. 136 (C.M.A.1993). In that case, this Court held that a psychiatric social worker was not acting as an investigative agent of law enforcement where the appellant arrived without any command-referral document and the social worker had no contact with the command before or after the appellant\u2019s walk-in appointment. <em>Id. </em>at 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">The Court in <em>Raymond </em>also considered the effect of an Army regulation dealing with child abuse: \u201cIt is not a law enforcement program; it is a community services program. The cooperative effort required by the regulation does not render every member of the military community a criminal investigator or investigative agent____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 138-39. Finally, this Court noted in <em>Raymond </em>that \u201cthere is no historical duty of health professions engaged in treatment to warn based on the purpose behind Article 31(b).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-13\">In <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>this Court considered the admissibility of statements made to a State of Texas Department of Human Services investigator-social worker. 36 M.J. 107, 109 (C.M.A.1992). In that ease, this Court focused on whether the social worker\u2019s investigation merged with the military investigation or whether she was acting as an agent of military investigators. <em>Id. </em>at 115. The Court answered both of these questions in the negative based on three findings: (1) lack of \u201ccommunication or coordination between the two camps\u201d; (2) the social worker \u201cremained in the mode of social worker\u201d; and (3) the social worker pursued her own \u201climited, state objectives\u201d and cooperated with military authorities \u201conly where necessary to effectuate her own goals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>With regard to the first finding, this Court noted, specifically, that the social worker \u201cdid not in any way coordinate [her] meeting [with the appellant] with military police or prosecutorial authorities or notify them that she intended to interview appellant.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b167-14\">We now turn to the facts in this case. The military judge found that Ms. Lynch\u2019s interviews were \u201cnot for any law enforcement purpose.\u201d Rather, in the military judge\u2019s view, Ms. Lynch\u2019s \u201cprimary purpose in conducting the interview was for treatment purposes.\u201d The Air Force court concluded that the \u201cclinical social worker was not \u2018functioning as a mere conduit for military authorities\u2019 nor was there evidence of any understanding between her and military authorities \u2018designed to subvert the purposes of Article 31.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brisbane, </em>No. ACM 35384, slip op. at 1. As such, the Air Force court found that, in her independent role, Ms. Lynch was not obligated to advise Appellant in accordance with Article 31(b). <em>Id. </em>at 1-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-15\">AFOSI and the Family Advocacy treatment manager are integral parts of the CSMRT. They work closely on initial assessments of complaints. Consequently, the initial complaint that Appellant was suspect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>ed of having acted inappropriately with his stepdaughter was assessed at a CSMRT meeting. The CSMRT decided to have Ms. Lynch proceed first with the interviews of Appellant and his stepdaughter to determine whether they \u201chad enough information to proceed.\u201d According to Ms. Lynch, the CSMRT made this decision \u201call together.\u201d Once Ms. Lynch obtained Appellant\u2019s admissions, she reported them to the FMCMT. Although the AFOSI representatives on the FMCMT initially decided not to pursue the matter, they were in receipt of Ms. Lynch\u2019s information. Finally, despite stating that her role in questioning Appellant was to provide treatment, Ms. Lynch also stated that she was not treating Appellant for any condition.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> These facts render the military judge\u2019s finding that Ms. Lynch \u201chad not been approached by anyone in the Air Force command structure or by law enforcement personnel in an attempt to enlist her aid in collecting information to prosecute the ease\u201d untenable. Furthermore, while there was no direct evidence of an understanding between Ms. Lynch and military authorities \u201c\u2018designed to subvert the purposes of Article 31,\u2019\u201d this is not the test for whether the UCMJ applies. <em>Brisbane, </em>No. ACM 35384, slip op. at 1 (quoting <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>36 M.J. 107, 117 (C.M.A.1992)). Nor is the test an issue of the questioner\u2019s \u201cprimary purpose.\u201d Rather, as noted in <em>Rodriguez </em>and discussed above, this Court has identified at least two instances when civilians working in conjunction with military officials must comply with Article 31. <em>See Rodriguez, </em>60 M.J. at 252 (quoting <em>Penn, </em>18 C.M.A. at 199, 39 C.M.R. at 199 (1969) (citations omitted)). In this case, Ms. Lynch acted in furtherance of a military investigation. It does not matter that her actions in this regard were not deliberately aimed at subverting Appellant\u2019s rights. Nor does it matter what her \u201cprimary purpose\u201d might have been.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-20\">We also distinguish this case from <em>Raymond </em>and <em>Moreno. </em>Unlike the situation in <em>Raymond, </em>Appellant\u2019s command directed him to see Ms. Lynch. Furthermore, Ms. Lynch was in regular contact, both before and after her interview with Appellant, with members of the military law enforcement community. <em>Cf. Raymond, </em>38 M.J. at 139; <em>Moreno, </em>36 M.J. at 115. Finally, Ms. Lynch was fully aware of Appellant\u2019s prior contact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>(or lack thereof) with AFOSI in this case. <em>Cf. Raymond, </em>38 M.J. at 138; <em>Moreno, </em>36 M.J. at 109. As noted, it was a team decision, made by the members of the CSMRT, which included a representative from AFOSI, that Ms. Lynch would conduct the first interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Although we note that the \u201ccooperative effort\u201d required by AFI 40-301 in this case \u201cdoes not render every member of the military community a criminal investigator or investigative agent,\u201d Ms. Lynch\u2019s actions in this case were more akin to an investigative agent than a social worker. <em>Raymond, </em>38 M.J. at 138-39. On cross-examination, Ms. Lynch stated that the first thing she asked appellant when he arrived for his interview was \u201c[d]id you do it?\u201d <em>Cf. United States v. Swift, </em>53 M.J. 439, 447 (C.A.A.F.2000) (holding that the accused\u2019s supervisor, a military criminal investigator, should have advised Swift of his rights when he demanded that he respond to certain \u201caccusations\u201d). In addition, Ms. Lynch stated that she did not in fact treat Appellant for any condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">We conclude that the record does not support the military judge\u2019s findings that Ms. Lynch was not acting \u201cfor any law enforcement purpose,\u201d but rather was engaged in treating Appellant. In our view, the record supports the contrary conclusion that Ms. Lynch was acting as an \u201cinvestigative agent of law enforcement,\u201d by virtue of her close coordination with base legal and investigative personnel. <em>Raymond, </em>38 M.J. at 136. Therefore, as a threshold matter, Ms. Lynch was a \u201cperson subject to the code\u201d for the purposes of Article 31(b) and M.R.E. 305(c). The next question we must consider is whether the other requirements of Article 31 were met such that Appellant was entitled to a rights advisement. The military judge did not make findings in this regard because he determined that Ms. Lynch did not meet the threshold requirement of being a person subject to the code.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">As we noted in <em>United States v. Cohen, </em>63 M.J. 45, 49 (C.A.A.F.2006), Article 31(b) contains four textual predicates. First, the article applies to persons subject to the UCMJ. Second and third, the article applies to interrogation or requests for any statements from \u201can accused or a person suspected of an offense.\u201d Fourth, the right extends to statements regarding the offense(s) of which the person questioned is accused or suspected.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">In <em>Cohen, </em>we sought to provide a context for this Court\u2019s decisions with regard to the second and third textual predicates. <em>See id. </em>at 49-50. However, unlike <em>Cohen, </em>this case does not present any question as to whether Ms. Lynch was requesting a statement from a person she suspected of an offense. <em>See United States v. Bradley, </em>51 M.J. 437, 441 (C.A.A.F.1999). \u201c[Assessing all the facts and circumstances at the time of the interview,\u201d it is clear to us that Ms. Lynch was acting in an official law enforcement or disciplinary capacity. <em>United States v. Swift, </em>53 M.J. at 446 (quoting <em>United States v. Good, </em>32 M.J. 105, 108 (C.A.A.F.1991)). As noted earlier, Ms. Lynch, in conjunction with the law enforcement representatives on the CSMRT, decided to conduct the first interview of Appellant. According to her testimony, the reason for her interview was to decide if they had sufficient evidence to proceed, ostensibly, with a case against Appellant. In keeping with this, the first question she asked Appellant during their meeting was whether he committed the offense. Finally, Ms. Lynch admitted that she never provided Appellant with any treatment. Unlike <em>Cohen, </em>where the inspector general acted independently, consulting only with legal personnel on an ad hoc basis, all of Ms. Lynch\u2019s actions were coordinated with AFOSI and other members of the CSMRT involved in law enforcement activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">With respect to Article 31(b)\u2019s third textual predicate, this Court applies an objective test. \u201cWhether a person is a suspect is an objective question that is answered by considering all the facts and circumstances at the time of the interview to determine whether the military questioner believed or reasonably should have believed that the service-member committed an offense.\u201d <em>Swift, </em>53 M.J. at 446; <em>Good, </em>32 M.J. at 108. During her testimony, Ms. Lynch stated that she suspected Appellant of an offense at their first meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>We conclude that the remaining requirements of Article 31(b) were met in this case. As a result, Ms. Lynch should have informed Appellant of his Article 31 rights prior to the interview. Even though Ms. Lynch advised Appellant that his statements were not confidential, and he spoke to her voluntarily, this does not otherwise negate the requirements of Article 31(b). <em>See </em>M.R.E. 304(a), M.R.E. 305(a). Therefore, Appellant\u2019s statements to Ms. Lynch, the Family Advocacy treatment manager, should have been suppressed by the military judge and could not be used to support his convictions. However, this does not resolve the question of whether Appellant\u2019s subsequent statements to AFOSI were admissible. Nor does it answer the question of whether the pictures found on Appellant\u2019s computer should have been admitted as the basis for the second specification of Charge I, wrongful and knowing possession of visual depictions of nude minors.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">\n<em>Appellant\u2019s Statements to AFOSI</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">With regard to Appellant\u2019s second and third challenges, we must decide whether AFOSI\u2019s subsequent interrogation of Appellant was unconstitutional in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Missouri v. Seibert, </em>and whether the absence of a cleansing warning tainted Appellant\u2019s statements, even though those statements were preceded by a full rights warning.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">The military judge did not make any findings with regard to whether Appellant\u2019s subsequent statements to AFOSI were voluntary because Appellant only challenged their admission as derivative evidence at trial. In light of its conclusion that Ms. Lynch acted independently, the Air Force court found the issue of whether AFOSI properly questioned Appellant moot. <em>Brisbane, </em>No. ACM 35384, slip op. at 2. This Court has looked to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Oregon v. Elstad, </em>470 U.S. 298, 105 S.Ct. 1285, 84 L.Ed.2d 222 (1985), which distinguished between two classes of involuntary confessions, for guidance on evaluating the admissibility of a confession obtained subsequent to one that is deemed illegally obtained:</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">[W]here the earlier confession was \u201cinvoluntary\u201d only because the suspect had not been properly warned of his panoply of rights to silence and to counsel, the volun-tariness of the second confession is determined by the totality of the circumstances. The earlier, unwarned statement is a factor in this total picture, but it does not presumptively taint the subsequent confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\"><em>United States v. Cuento, </em>60 M.J. 106, 109 (C.A.A.F.2004) (quoting <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>32 M.J. 76, 79 (C.M.A.1991)). One of the circumstances this Court takes into account is the presence of a \u201ccleansing warning,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> however, the absence of such is not fatal to a finding of voluntariness. <em>Cuento, </em>60 M.J. at 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-11\">The classic listing of the other factors used in a voluntariness analysis is found in the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Schneckloth v. Bustamante:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b170-12\">In determining whether a defendant\u2019s will was overborne in a particular case, the Court has assessed the totality of all the surrounding circumstances\u2014both the characteristics of the accused and the details of the interrogation. Some of the factors taken into account have included the youth of the accused, his lack of education, or his low intelligence, the lack of any advice to the accused of his constitutional right, the length of detention, the repeated and prolonged nature of the questioning, and the use of physical punishment such as the deprivation of food or sleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-13\">412 U.S. 218, 226, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-14\">In his brief, Appellant also argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Seibert </em>applies to the facts of this case. In <em>Seibert, </em>police arrested the respondent following the deaths of the respondent\u2019s son and another teenager. 542 U.S. at 604, 124 S.Ct. 2601. At the suppression hearing, the interviewing officer admitted that he consciously withheld <em>Miranda </em>warnings, \u201cthus resorting to an in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>terrogation technique he had been taught: question first, then give the warnings, and then repeat the question \u2018until I get the answer that she\u2019s already provided once.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 605-06,124 S.Ct. 2601. In <em>Seibert, </em>the Court invalidated the \u201cpolice protocol\u201d described above that called for elicitation of an unwarned confession, followed by rights warnings, and elicitation of the same confession. 542 U.S. at 604, 124 S.Ct. 2601. Because the officer in <em>Seibert </em>was very candid about the procedure, the Court noted that \u201cthe focus is on facts apart from intent that show the question-first tactic at work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 616 n. 6,124 S.Ct. 2601.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">According to Appellant, the base legal office and AFOSI similarly engaged in a purposeful plan to evade his constitutional rights by arranging for Ms. Lynch to interview him first, without a proper rights advisement. <em>Cf. Seibert, </em>542 U.S. at 605-06, 124 S.Ct. 2601. Then, Appellant argues, AFOSI sought to interrogate him with the benefit of his earlier unwarned statements to Ms. Lynch.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">Although <em>Seibert </em>altered the inquiry under <em>Elstad, </em>the facts in Appellant\u2019s ease are distinguishable. First, in contrast to <em>Seibert, </em>the two interviews in Appellant\u2019s case occurred almost six weeks apart. Further, although there was coordination between AFOSI and the Family Advocacy staff, the record does not demonstrate a deliberate effort aimed at securing an unwarned confession for later use in securing a warned confession. <em>Cf. United States v. Phillips, </em>32 M.J. 76 (C.M.A.1991) (suppressing appellant\u2019s statements where this Court found that the Naval Investigative Service special agent used earlier, unwarned interviews and statements as a starting point for his interrogation). According to Special Agent Allison, AFOSI did receive information about the incident through the FMCMT. However, Special Agent Allison denied that Ms. Lynch\u2019s June 1, 2001, interview was the reason that AFOSI pursued its investigation. Rather, AFOSI\u2019s decision to interview Appellant was based on a forensic consultant\u2019s recommendation that AFOSI pursue an investigation. <em>Seibert </em>does not ban coordination among individuals. Rather, it is aimed at a very specific, deliberate practice of successive interrogations to secure an admissible confession. What happened in this case does not rise to that level.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">Because the evidence in this case does not support a conclusion that Family Advocacy and AFOSI engaged in the type of unconstitutional practice prohibited by <em>Seibert, </em>the test for whether the second confession is admissible is whether it was voluntary under all the circumstances. <em>See Cuento, </em>60 M.J. at 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">Here, there was no cleansing warning because Special Agent Allison and his colleagues did not believe that Appellant was entitled to a warning when he first confessed to Ms. Lynch. Therefore, our determination of whether Appellant\u2019s second confession to Special Agent Allison was voluntary hinges on other factors, including those identified in <em>Bustamante. </em>First, Appellant\u2019s interview with Special Agent Allison occurred almost a <em>month </em>and a half after his initial interview with Ms. Lynch. This was a substantial amount of time for Appellant to weigh the pros and cons of continuing to talk with military authorities about showing pictures of nude adult women to his stepdaughter. Second, Appellant was a mature, experienced member of the military. At the time of the incident, Appellant was a twenty-eight-year-old staff sergeant with almost ten years of military service. Third, the conditions of Appellant\u2019s second interview were not coercive or inhumane. Special Agent Allison testified that Appellant was asked to come in and speak with AFOSI about an incident involving his daughter. After Appellant waived his rights and agreed to give a written statement, Special Agent Allison and a colleague followed Appellant back to his house so that Appellant could show them the pictures he had shown to his stepdaughter. There is nothing to suggest that Appellant\u2019s free will was overborne.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-11\">This conclusion is supported by the fact that Appellant did not believe that he had done anything criminal in showing pictures to his stepdaughter. In his written confession, Appellant admits only that his approach was \u201cincorrect.\u201d According to Special Agent Alii-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>son\u2019s testimony, it was not until Appellant brought up pornographic pictures of children on his computer that he became nervous. Before that, Special Agent Allison testified that Appellant was \u201ccalm.\u201d This comports with Ms. Lynch\u2019s description of Appellant\u2019s demeanor during her initial interview with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Based on the foregoing, while we agree with Appellant that he was entitled to a rights warnings prior to his interview with Ms. Lynch, we find that his statements to AFOSI were voluntary under the circumstances and not barred by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Seibert, </em>notwithstanding the absence of a cleansing warning. Thus, the military judge did not err in admitting these statements or the evidence subsequently seized from Appellant\u2019s computer. In light of these later, more detailed statements describing his conduct, we conclude that the admission of Appellant\u2019s initial statements to Ms. Lynch was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Hallock, </em>27 M.J. 146 (C.M.A.1988) (citing <em>United States v. Remai, </em>19 M.J. 229, 233 (C.M.A.1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">\n<em>Appellant\u2019s Possession of the Pictures</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">We turn now to the final issue in the case, whether the evidence was legally sufficient to sustain Appellant\u2019s conviction for possession of child pornography under clauses one and two of Article 134. The Air Force court found that \u201c[Ajppellant\u2019s possession of ... pictures was prejudicial to good order and discipline or of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces.\u201d <em>Brisbane, </em>No. ACM 35384, slip op. at 2. Appellant now argues that there is no evidence that his possession of pictures of nude minors was service-discrediting or conduct prejudicial to good order and discipline. The Government argues that Appellant\u2019s mere possession of sexually explicit images of minors is an act involving moral turpitude, and as such, is inherently prejudicial to good order and discipline and service-discrediting.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">The knowing possession of images depicting sexually explicit conduct by minors, whether actual or virtual, when determined to be service-discrediting conduct or conduct prejudicial to good order and discipline, is an offense under Article 134. <em>United States v. Mason, </em>60 M.J. 15, 20 (C.A.A.F.2004). However, <em>Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, </em>535 U.S. 234, 122 S.Ct. 1389, 152 L.Ed.2d 403 (2002), created a \u201cconstitutional dimension\u201d to an Article 134 charge that did not exist previously. As a result, the elements of service discredit or prejudicial conduct must be considered in the context of a military member\u2019s possession of what might be considered virtual child pornography, or pornography the Supreme Court otherwise determined was constitutionally protected in a civilian context. <em>Mason, </em>60 M.J. at 19; <em>United States v. O\u2019Connor, </em>58 M.J. 450, 454 (C.A.A.F.2003). In light of <em>Free Speech Coalition </em>we look to the record to determine whether the evidence demonstrates that an accused\u2019s conduct is service-discrediting and/or prejudicial to good order and discipline, even if such conduct would have been protected in a civilian context.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">After taking Appellant\u2019s statement regarding the showing of nude adult photographs to his stepdaughter, the AFOSI investigators accompanied Appellant to his home. Based on Appellant\u2019s consent, the investigators entered the home where Appellant showed the agents images of nude adults he had shown to his stepdaughter and sought to explain why he had done so. In the course of this conduct, Appellant inadvertently displayed images of child pornography to the agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">Following this disclosure, Appellant was charged with a violation of clauses one and two of Article 134.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Appellant subsequently told his neighbor, SSGT Gilbert, that he possessed seven pictures of child pornography. This disclosure alarmed SSGT Gilbert enough that he contacted AFOSI to determine whether any of the pictures included images of his children. \u201cViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>prosecution,\u201d we conclude that \u201cany rational trier of fact\u201d could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant\u2019s possession of the pictures in question was prejudicial to good order and discipline or service-discrediting. <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); <em>United States v.
