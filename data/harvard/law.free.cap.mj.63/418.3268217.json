Contrary to his pleas, after a contested general court-martial before members, he was convicted of carnal knowledge and indecent acts with a child, in violation of Articles 120 and 134, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 920, 934 (2000). He was sentenced to a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for nine years and reduction to pay grade E-l. The convening authority approved the adjudged sentence. The United States Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed. <em>United States v. Washington, </em>61 M.J. 574, 578 (N.M.Ct.Crim.App.2005). Upon Appellant\u2019s petition, we granted review of the following two issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AF6\">I. WHETHER LEGALLY SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE WAS PRESENTED TO PROVE THE OFFENSE OF CARNAL KNOWLEDGE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-22\">II. WHETHER THE LOWER COURT ERRED WHEN IT RULED THAT A MILITARY JUDGE MAY ADMINISTER AN OATH OF TRUTHFUL TESTIMONY TO A CHILD AFTER THE TESTIMONY IS COMPLETE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-23\">On Issue I, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, we conclude that the evidence was legally sufficient. On Issue II, we conclude that in the context of this case, Appellant was not materially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>prejudiced by the failure to administer the oath in light of the corrective action taken. As a result, we affirm the decision of the United States Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">At the time of the alleged offenses, Appellant and his wife, Krystal, lived in on-base housing along with their triplets, age five, and their daughter, C.B., age eight. At Appellant\u2019s court-martial, Krystal testified that around 9:30 a.m. on June 27, 1998, she left the house to buy breakfast for the family at Hardee\u2019s. She returned home a little before 10:00 a.m., and soon afterwards, made arrangements to drive her mother to Georgia. Krystal intended to drive and spend the night in Georgia with her mother and a friend, leave the children with Appellant, and return home the following day. She discussed child care arrangements with Appellant, and told C.B. to take a bath. When Krystal and her mother left the house at about 10:30 a.m., Appellant was in bed wearing basketball shorts.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Krystal testified that not long after leaving the house, she realized she forgot to pack a particular dress. She returned home and tried to open the screen door. The screen door was generally left unlocked, but upon her return, she found it locked. She tapped on the window of the triplets\u2019 room, and all three came to the door and opened it. Krystal asked where C.B. was, and the children told her she was \u201cin the room with daddy.\u201d Krystal walked into her bedroom to get the dress and saw Appellant and C.B. in bed together.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">Krystal testified that she became angry because she believed C.B. had ignored her demand to take a bath. She asked C.B., \u201c[djidn\u2019t I tell you to take a bath?\u201d When C.B. tried to get out of bed, Appellant grabbed her and said, \u201c[l]eave the girl alone. She\u2019s just laying here.\u201d Krystal and Appellant began to argue, and when Appellant continued to not let C.B. out of bed, Krystal pulled hard on the bed covers. Before Appellant could pull the covers back up, Krystal saw that he and C.B. were \u201cspooned into each other.\u201d C.B.\u2019s underwear and shorts were at the foot of the bed, and Appellant was totally naked. Krystal testified that Appellant had a partial erection in that \u201cabout-to-lose-it stage.\u201d She attempted to call the police, but Appellant disconnected the phone and tried to restrain her, telling her she was not going to \u201cleave the house thinking that\u2019s what [she had seen].\u201d Krystal hurriedly ordered all four children, still in their night clothes and without shoes, into her car and drove them six to eight hours to Georgia.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b476-10\">A. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b476-11\">Appellant first challenges his conviction on the ground that there was insufficient evidence to prove he committed carnal knowledge on June 27, 1998. He argues the offense of carnal knowledge requires proof of sexual penetration, and the Government failed to introduce legally sufficient evidence showing he engaged in an act of sexual intercourse with C.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-12\">An Article 120(b), UCMJ, violation for carnal knowledge requires: (1) that the accused commit an act of sexual intercourse; (2) with a person who is not the accused\u2019s spouse; and (3) who is under sixteen years old. \u201cPenetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete\u201d the offense. Article 120(c), UCMJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-13\">When determining whether the evidence was legally sufficient to show an act of sexual intercourse on June 27, we \u201c \u2018view[ ] the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution\u2019 \u201d and decide whether \u201c \u2018any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>55 M.J. 375, 385 (C.A.A.F.2001) (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)); <em>United States v. Turner, </em>25 M.J. 324, 324 (C.M.A.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-14\">At the court-martial, the specification for carnal knowledge alleged that Appellant, did \u201con divers occasions, between on or about 15 April 1998 and 27 June 1998, commit the offense of carnal knowledge with [C.B.], a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>child under the age of 12.\u201d In light of Krystal\u2019s testimony about discovering her husband naked in bed with C.B. on June 27, the Government\u2019s case focused on the events of that day. The members found Appellant guilty of carnal knowledge on June 27, but they did not find he committed the offense on prior divers occasions. Appellant\u2019s central argument is that although C.B. testified about acts of vaginal penetration prior to June 27, the members found him not guilty of those acts, and therefore those same acts could not be considered by either the members or the Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals when determining whether he committed carnal knowledge on June 27. He argues that without the prior acts evidence, there is insufficient evidence showing vaginal penetration occurred on June 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">For the reasons stated below, we disagree. First, the Government offered some evidence showing vaginal penetration occurred on June 27. Second, in light of the different standards necessary to convict, as opposed to admit, other acts evidence, the members and the lower court might appropriately consider evidence of those prior divers acts for which Appellant was found not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">\n<em>Evidence Referring to Events on June 27</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">On the first day of her testimony, C.B. nodded affirmatively when the Government asked whether Appellant had \u201ctouched [her] private parts with his private part more than once.\u201d She testified, without reference to any specific day, that Appellant put his private part \u201cinside [her] private part,\u201d and that \u201cwhite stuff\u2019 came out of his private part on her belly. She also testified about the specific events on June 27, and stated that after her mother left for Georgia, she sat on her parents\u2019 bed to watch television. After Appellant came in, he took off their shorts, they got under the covers and \u201che started rubbing on [her].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">The following day, the Government recalled C.B. She reiterated her earlier testimony and also stated that the penetration did not hurt because it was partial. Trial counsel elicited the following testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-3\">Q. But he did put his private part in your private part, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-9\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-10\">Q. Why didn\u2019t it hurt?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-11\">A. I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-12\">Q. You don\u2019t know? Did it go all the way inside you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-13\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-14\">Q. Did it go inside you though?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-15\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-16\">Q. Do you remember we talked about the one incident that your mother walked in on you, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-17\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-18\">Q. Did your daddy touch you times before that, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-19\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-20\">Q. Did he <em>also </em>put his private part inside your private part before that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-21\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-22\">Emphasis added. It is clear from this exchange that trial counsel asked C.B. questions pertaining specifically to vaginal penetration. Immediately on the heel of those questions, trial counsel asked whether Appellant <em>\u201calso </em>put his private part inside [her] private part before\u201d June 27. (emphasis added). For sure, this testimony is subject to more than one interpretation; however, viewing the testimony in the light most favorable to the Government, a reasonable trier of fact could infer that the word \u201calso\u201d was inclusive, and meant that acts of penetration occurred not only before June 27, but <em>also </em>on June 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-23\">\n<em>Evidence of Prior Acts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b477-24\">Appellant also argues that because the members found him not guilty of carnal knowledge on divers occasions before June 27, the Court of Criminal Appeals erred in relying on evidence regarding those divers acts in upholding the factual and legal suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>ciency of the charge to carnal knowledge on June 27.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">Appellant\u2019s argument that those other acts cannot be considered fails for two related reasons. First, the admissibility of other acts evidence is governed by the Military Rules of Evidence (M.R.E.), and not by the members\u2019 verdict. Second, Appellant is arguing, in essence, that a finding of not guilty amounts to a finding of fact\u2014in this case a finding that C.B.\u2019s other acts testimony was false. However, a finding of not guilty is not a finding of fact, but a determination that the government has not proved all the elements of the charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Watts, </em>519 U.S. 148, 155, 117 S.Ct. 633, 136 L.Ed.2d 554 (1997); <em>see also Dowling v. United States, </em>493 U.S. 342, 348, 110 S.Ct. 668, 107 L.Ed.2d 708 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Moreover, with respect to other acts evidence involving child molestation and sexual assault, M.R.E. 413 and M.R.E. 414 are \u201cintended to provide for more liberal admissibility of character evidence in criminal cases.\u201d <em>Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, </em>Analysis of the Military Rules of Evidence app. 22 at A22-36 to A22-37 (2005 ed.) [hereinafter Drafters\u2019 Analysis]. Specifically, M.R.E. 414(a) provides that \u201c[i]n a court-martial in which the accused is charged with an offense of child molestation, evidence of the accused\u2019s commission of one or more offenses of child molestation is admissible and may be considered for its bearing on any matter to which it is relevant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Before a court may submit evidence of prior charged or uncharged acts to a jury, it must examine \u201cthe evidence in the case and decide[] whether the jury could reasonably find the conditional fact ... by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Huddleston v. United States, </em>485 U.S. 681, 690, 108 S.Ct. 1496, 99 L.Ed.2d 771 (1988); <em>Dowling, </em>493 U.S. at 348-50, 110 S.Ct. 668. This Court in <em>United States v. Reynolds, </em>29 M.J. 105, 109 (C.M.A.1989), while not citing <em>Huddleston, </em>set forth a \u201cthree-prong test [] consistent with <em>Huddleston\u201d </em>to govern the admissibility of other acts evidence. <em>United States v. McDonald, </em>59 M.J. 426, 429 (C.A.A.F.2004). Although <em>Reynolds </em>dealt with evidence of uncharged misconduct, its three-prong test can apply to evidence of charged misconduct.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The test contains the following elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-10\">1. Does the evidence reasonably support a finding by the court members that the appellant committed prior crimes, wrongs or acts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-11\">2. What \u201cfact ... of consequence\u201d is made \u201cmore\u201d or \u201cless probable\u201d by the existence of this evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-12\">3. Is the \u201cprobative value ... substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice\u201d?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-13\"><em>Reynolds, </em>29 M.J. at 109 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-14\">Applying the first prong of the <em>Reynolds </em>analysis to the facts of this case, we conclude that a jury could reasonably find that the prior acts occurred. C.B. testified consistently for over two days that her father had on multiple occasions before June 27 \u201cput his private part inside [her] private part.\u201d What distinguishes these other acts from the acts committed on June 27 is the quantum of evidence offered to prove them, not the reliability of C.B.\u2019s testimony. The focus of the Government\u2019s case was on the acts occurring on June 27, not the other acts, for it was on June 27 that C.B.\u2019s mother discovered Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>lant in bed with C.B. and her testimony could support C.B.\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">As for the second <em>Reynolds </em>prong, evidence is relevant under M.R.E. 401 when it has \u201cany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d M.R.E. 401; <em>United States v. Berry, </em>61 M.J. 91, 95 (C.A.A.F.2005). In this case, evidence that Appellant may have engaged in the near identical acts with his daughter in the months prior to June 27 is relevant to the determination of whether Appellant engaged in similar conduct on June 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Applying the M.R.E. 403 balancing test for the third <em>Reynolds </em>prong, the probative value of this evidence was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. It was integral to the charged conduct, integral to C.B.\u2019s testimony regarding the events of June 27, and consistent in detail and tenor with the evidence regarding June 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">Because the members could reasonably find by a preponderance of the evidence that the other prior acts occurred, and the other acts evidence is logically and legally relevant, the members and lower court could properly consider evidence of carnal knowledge committed before June 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, including C.B.\u2019s testimony, the evidence that Appellant was found naked in bed \u201cspooning\u201d C.B. with a partial erection, and the evidence of carnal knowledge committed before June 27, we conclude that a rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that carnal knowledge occurred on June 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">B. Administration of the Oath After Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">We now turn to Appellant\u2019s second claim that his conviction and sentence should be set aside because the witness oath was administered to C.B. after her first day of testimony was complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-11\">The first day C.B. was called to testify, trial counsel asked her a series of questions about whether she knew the meaning of telling the truth, and the difference between telling the truth and telling a lie. The following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-14\">Q. Do you know what the truth is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-15\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-16\">Q. What is the truth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-17\">A. Telling what really happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-18\">Q. If I told you\u2014what is a lie? Do you know what a he is? Tell me what a he is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-19\">A. Not tehing the truth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-20\">Q. Not telling the truth. So if I told you the sky was purple right now, what would that be?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-21\">A. Alie.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-22\">Q. That would be a he, right?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-23\">At this point, the military judge interrupted the exchange to ask trial counsel to stand a httle further from C.B. so that she would speak in a louder voice. After the interruption, trial counsel commenced with C.B.\u2019s direct examination without administering the witness oath. At the end of the direct examination, consisting of nine pages in the record, trial counsel asked C.B. the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-24\">Q. Why did you say what you said today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-25\">A. Telling the truth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-26\">Q. You swore that everything you said today was the truth, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-27\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-28\">At this point, trial counsel told the military judge there was nothing further, but also stated that \u201c[t]he only thing, sir, if you require me to swear her in, I will. I think we have pretty much covered it, sir. I didn\u2019t officially do it.\u201d Trial counsel then engaged in the following exchange with C.B.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-29\">Q. [C.B.], your testimony today, was it the truth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-30\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-31\">Q. Was it the whole truth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-32\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-33\">A. Was it nothing but the truth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-34\">Q. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-35\">A. So help you God?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-36\">Q. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>The following day C.B. was recalled to testify. On redirect, trial counsel asked whether C.B. remembered that it was important to tell the truth. C.B. stated that she remembered and testified that she had told the truth the previous day. Defense counsel did not object to the failure to formally swear in C.B. at the beginning of her first day of testimony, at the close of her testimony, or at the outset of her testimony on the second day of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">M.R.E. 603 provides: \u201cBefore testifying, every witness shall be required to declare that the witness will testify truthfully, by oath or affirmation administered in a form calculated to awaken the witness\u2019s conscience and impress the witness\u2019s mind with the duty to do so.\u201d M.R.E. 603 \u201crequires that a witness swear or affirm that he will tell the truth,\u201d but it \u201cestablishes no specific colloquy to be used in carrying out this requirement. Any process that is sufficient to \u2018awaken the witness\u2019s conscience ... \u2019 is satisfactory.\u201d <em>United States v. Allen, </em>13 M.J. 597, 599 (A.F.C.M.R.1982) (quoting Stephen A. Saltzburg, Lee D. Schinasi &amp; David A. Schlueter, <em>Military Rules of Evidence Manual </em>276 (1981)). As stated in the Drafters\u2019 Analysis, M.R.E. 603 is taken without change from the Fed.R.Evid. 603. Drafters\u2019 Analysis app. 22 at A22-45. The Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules for Fed.R.Evid. 603, states that \u201c[t]he rule is designed to afford the flexibility required in dealing with ... children\u201d and that \u201c[ajffirmation is simply a solemn undertaking to tell the truth____\u201d As with the Fed.R.Evid. 603, M.R.E. 603 requires no special verbal formula, but instead requires that the oath be meaningful to the witness, including a child witness, and impress upon the witness the duty to tell the truth. <em>See Allen, </em>13 M.J. at 599-601; <em>see Spigarolo v. Mea-chum, </em>934 F.2d 19, 24 (2d Cir.1991) (\u201cWhen children testify, the trial court may fashion an oath or affirmation that is meaningful to the witness.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Because Appellant did not object to the failure of trial counsel to place C.B. under oath, Appellant waived the issue absent plain error.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Odom, </em>736 F.2d 104, 112 (4th Cir.1984); <em>United States v. Pluta, </em>176 F.3d 43, 51 (2d Cir.1999); <em>see United States v. Powell, </em>49 M.J. 460, 465 (C.A.A.F.1998) (in absence of objection, plain error analysis applies). In this context, the rationale for applying waiver is twofold: \u201cFirst, the defect or failure could have been corrected if a timely objection had been made; second, in the absence of a waiver rule counsel might deliberately avoid objecting to a witness being unsworn in order to have a ground of appeal.\u201d <em>Odom, </em>736 F.2d at 115. Under our plain error analysis, Appellant must show that there was error, the error was plain or obvious, and that the error materially prejudiced his substantial rights. <em>Powell, </em>49 M.J. at 463-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">There is no doubt that the failure to administer the oath before C.B.\u2019s testimony was error, and that the error was obvious. The plain text of M.R.E. 603 required C.B., by oath or affirmation, to declare that she would testify truthfully \u201cbefore testifying.\u201d The initial colloquy between C.B. and trial counsel fell short of this requirement. However, Appellant\u2019s claim fails because he cannot show he was materially prejudiced by the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">Trial counsel asked if C.B. knew the difference between the truth and a he, and C.B. indicated that she understood. At the end of her testimony, C.B. stated that she had told the \u201cwhole truth\u201d and \u201cnothing but the truth.\u201d She then swore that everything she said had been the truth. When C.B. was recalled, she also stated that she only told the truth the previous day. Although the colloquy between trial counsel and C.B. was not a formal oath or affirmation, C.B. demonstrated she understood her duty to tell the truth. In short, consistent with the purpose of M.R.E. 603, but not its temporal requirement, the record of trial reveals that C.B. was alert to the necessity of telling the truth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>both at the beginning of her testimony and at the outset of the second day of her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">Appellant counters that while C.B. may have been aware of her obligation to tell the truth, she was not aware of the consequences of failing to do so, a requirement Appellant derives from the language of M.R.E. 603 regarding \u201cduty\u201d and the general knowledge possessed by most adults that those who lie on the witness stand may be subject to perjury. In addressing this argument, we need not reach beyond the confines of this ease. The law is clear, both in the text of M.R.E. 603 and its analysis, and in federal circuit ease law. A particular formula is not required in administering an oath or affirmation, although adherence to the benchbook formula will minimize dispute. This is particularly true in the case of children, where oaths and affirmations may be specially tailored to impress on the particular child the importance of telling the truth. This can be accomplished, as it has been accomplished for many years, without imparting to the child the perils of perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">For these reasons, Appellant has not shown that the error prejudiced his substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">The decision of the United States Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b478-7\">. In addressing legal and factual sufficiency, the Criminal Court of Appeals opinion states inter alia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-8\">A careful reading of the record of trial discloses that sufficient evidence of each and every element of both offenses was presented to the members through testimony and other evidence adduced at trial. C.B. testified that the appellant had touched her \"private parts\u201d on more than one occasion prior to, or on the morning of, the alleged incident. <em>Washington, </em>61 M.J. at 577.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b478-15\">. <em>In Huddleston, </em>485 U.S. at 689, 108 S.Ct. 1496, the Supreme Court concluded that evidence of uncharged acts is admissible if the jury can reasonably conclude that the other acts occurred and that the defendant was the actor. The Supreme Court has applied the <em>Huddleston </em>analysis to evidence of prior charged acts. <em>See Dowling, </em>493 U.S. at 348-50, 110 S.Ct. 668; <em>Watts, </em>519 U.S. at 156, 117 S.Ct. 633 (quoting <em>Dowling, </em>493 U.S. at 349, 110 S.Ct. 668). Because <em>Reynolds </em>is consistent with <em>Huddleston, </em>the <em>Reynolds </em>test also applies to prior charged acts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b480-6\">. We agree with the conclusion of the Court of Criminal Appeals that whether Appellant\u2019s absence of objection is considered waiver or forfeiture, the appropriate standard of review is one of plain error. <em>Washington, </em>61 M.J. at 576 n. 1. Therefore, we need not and do not address the distinction between forfeiture and waiver in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
