The appellant was sentenced to confinement for six months, forfeiture of $737.00 pay per month for six months, reduction to pay grade E-l, and a bad-conduct discharge. The convening authority approved the sentence as adjudged. As a matter of clemency, the convening authority deferred adjudged and automatic forfeitures prior to taking his action, then waived automatic forfeitures for six months and suspended adjudged forfeitures for the same period.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-12\">We have considered the record of trial, the appellant\u2019s brief asserting three assignments of error,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Government\u2019s answer, the appellant\u2019s reply, and the outstanding oral argument by both counsel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We conclude that the findings and sentence are correct in law and fact and that no error materially prejudicial to the substantial rights of the appellant was committed. <em>See </em>Arts. 59(a) and 66(c), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 859(a) and 866(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-13\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b684-14\">The appellant was convicted of using indecent language and committing an indecent assault upon the female attendant of the phone center at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, on 28 April 2002. The victim contacted the police that same day to report the offenses. The following day, the appellant submitted to questioning by Special Agent Le-Sane of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), and ultimately signed a sworn statement regarding the incident. In that statement, the appellant admitted using indecent language, rubbing his hand against the victim\u2019s breast, hugging her, and positioning himself with his groin against her buttocks while he may have been in an aroused state.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-15\">Trial was held on 18 June 2002 (arraignment) and 16-18 October 2002. The appellant did not testify at trial. The appellant was represented at trial by civilian defense counsel, Richard McNeil. Mr. McNeil is an experienced attorney, a retired Marine Corps judge advocate with twenty-five years of military law experience. Record at 48, 303. He is also a former judge. <em>Id. </em>at 377. In his opening statement, Mr. McNeil addressed the statement given by the appellant to Special Agent LeSane. He described the inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>view process wherein the appellant initially talked to the agent about being in the phone center to make a call. Then he described the agent pulling out a videotape and telling the appellant that the incident was on tape. The remainder of Mr. McNeil\u2019s opening statement was essentially an argument that once the appellant was shown the tape, he told the truth, that his subsequent sworn statement<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was a truthful recitation of what actually took place, and that what took place was simply the result of bad judgment, not a crime. <em>Id. </em>at 137-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">In closing, Mr. McNeil returned to the theme he began in his opening:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-6\">But when you place that videotape on the table, Sergeant Tovar realized that he had to be a little more forthright. He had to be more candid about what actually transpired in there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-7\">... We believe that statement is accurate and it\u2019s correct. That he basically stated out the facts of what transpired. And if you read his statement, and you believe it, you must acquit him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 303. Mr. McNeil also argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-9\">[Trial counsel] asked the special agent, How reliable is this technique? And he said, Very reliable. And then there\u2019s another question, and the special agent said that he believed it worked here. So what, again, does that tell you? That tells you it\u2019s a reliable technique. <em>Plus, common sense tells us it\u2019s a reliable technique.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 304 (emphasis added). Mr. McNeil continued his theme of the case in his closing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"asz-dedup-0\">The special agent signed it after Sergeant Tovar signed it. That implies to most of us that were in this courtroom, that the special agent believed that that was an honest assessment on behalf of Sergeant Tovar. <em>Because if he didn\u2019t, the special agent, after 11 of (sic) 12 years of experience, and almost 1000 interrogations, would have said, we have to ask you more questions. </em>We have to go a little further. But they did not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 304 (emphasis added). Mr. McNeil continued this theme throughout his closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-12\">The appellant\u2019s statement to NCIS was admitted into evidence, without objection, prior to opening statements. The appellant himself never testified at trial on the merits. Special Agent LeSane testified on direct concerning his interrogation of the appellant. He described the appellant\u2019s demeanor and the interrogation itself, essentially following Mr. McNeil\u2019s opening statement outline. After describing how the appellant gave his first version of events, the special agent stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-13\">A. ... And at that time, I determined deception.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-14\">Q. Why did you think that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-15\">A. Because I\u2014during my experience as a law enforcement officers [sic], 11 years, an innocent person would give you the whole account of it. He wouldn\u2019t just leave out a couple of important issues like, Did (sic) you touch her breasts, or, Did (sic) you touch her butt?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-16\">Record at 220-21. No objection was made by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-17\">Special Agent LeSane explained how he then pulled out a videotape (which was actually blank) and told the appellant that he had the incident on tape. The appellant\u2019s demeanor changed; he asked for a smoke break, which was granted. The appellant came back in and said: \u2018Well, let me tell you what happened.\u201d He then proceeded to tell Special Agent LeSane a more complete version of events that now included his grabbing the victim\u2019s breast and buttocks. <em>Id. </em>at 221. Again, there was no objection to this testimony. The appellant\u2019s fuller version of events was put into a typed statement that he swore to and signed. <em>Id. </em>at 222.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-18\">On cross-examination, Mr. McNeil returned to the deception theme:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-19\">Q. And prior to [pulling out the videotape], you were concerned about some of the information he\u2019d given you. Correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-20\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-21\">Q. You thought he was being deceptive?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aat-dedup-0\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>Q. Or maybe not being totally candid. I mean, he admitted he was there with the young lady. Correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-4\">A. Yes, he admitted he was there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Mr. McNeil\u2019s final question to Special Agent LeSane was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-7\">Q. And at the end of this process, you were satisfied with this statement. Correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-8\">A. Yes, sir, for the time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-10\">\u201cHuman Lie Detector\u201d Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b686-11\">In the vernacular of the military justice system,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201chuman lie detector\u201d testimony is \u201c[A]n opinion as to whether the person was truthful in making a specific statement regarding a fact at issue in the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Kasper, </em>58 M.J. 314, 315 (C.A.A.F.2003)(citing <em>United States v. Whitney, </em>55 M.J. 413, 415 (C.A.A.F.2001)). The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces has listed several reasons why \u201chuman lie detector\u201d testimony is impermissible:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-12\">1. Determination of truthfulness exceeds the scope of a witness\u2019 expertise, because the expert lacks specialized knowledge of whether the declarant was telling the truth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-13\">2. Such an opinion exceeds the limits on character evidence set forth in Military Rule of Evidence 608, Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (2002 ed.), because it offers an opinion as to the declarant\u2019s truthfulness on a specific occasion, rather than knowledge of the declar-ant\u2019s reputation for truthfulness in the community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-20\">3. Such testimony places a stamp of truthfulness on the declarant\u2019s story in a manner that usurps the jury\u2019s exclusive function to weigh evidence and determine credibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-21\"><em>See Kasper, </em>58 M.J. at 315. In an early case, the Court of Military Appeals noted, \u201cthe factfinders are perfectly capable of observing and assessing a witness\u2019 credibility.\u201d <em>United States v. Cameron, </em>21 M.J. 59, 63 (C.M.A.1985). This truism is obviously less useful where, as here, the witness does not testify in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-22\">The issue of \u201chuman lie detector\u201d testimony arises most frequently in cases involving expert opinions regarding the truthfulness of victim statements (either in or out of court)\u2014particularly the statements of infant victims or rape victims\u2014elicited by the Government to prove a case against a defendant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In these cases, the improper opinions as to credibility were most often used to bolster the testimony of the alleged victim. This is not such a case. This case falls among those that involve opinions by investigators on the veracity of statements made by an accused.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-23\">We learn from both lines of eases that admission of credibility evidence of the type at issue in this case does not automatically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>result in a finding of prejudicial error leading to reversal of a conviction. Rather, each case must be decided on its own facts, and in each case a harm analysis performed. Where, as here, there was no objection to the testimony at trial, we must review the allegation of error under the plain-error standard. <em>United States v. Birdsall, </em>47 M.J. 404, 409-10 (C.A.A.F.1998). \u201cTo overcome waiver, appellant must convince us that (1) there was error; (2) that it was plain or obvious; and (3) that the error materially prejudiced a substantial right. We will reverse for plain error only if the error had \u2018an unfair, prejudicial impact\u2019 on the findings or sentence.\u201d <em>Schlamer, </em>52 M.J. at 85-86 (quoting <em>United States v. Powell, </em>49 M.J. 460, 463 (C.A.A.F.1998)).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Article 59(a), UCMJ, limits military appellate courts from reversing a finding or sentence for legal error unless the error materially prejudices an appellant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>Powell, </em>49 M.J. at 465. A reviewing court must put the complained of testimony in context to determine if the witness\u2019 opinions amount to prejudicial plain error. <em>See United States v. Eggen, </em>51 M.J. 159, 161 (C.A.A.F.1999). No prejudice will be found if any error was induced or invited by the defense. <em>Id. </em>at 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">The first question we must address is whether the NCIS agent\u2019s testimony constituted error. The appellant has the burden of persuading us that there was plain error. <em>Powell, </em>49 M.J. at 464-65. He has not done so in this case. The central tenet of the appellant\u2019s case at trial was that the final statement he gave to Special Agent LeSane was complete and credible. That was Mr. McNeil\u2019s theory of the case as reflected in his opening statement and closing argument, as well as his own questioning of Special Agent LeSane. None of the agent\u2019s comments, now objected to for the first time on appeal, implied otherwise. The appellant, neither at trial nor on appeal, disputed the obvious fact that his original statement to Special Agent LeSane was not entirely correct. Deception was obvious on its face from the appellant\u2019s changed story. The appellant may not claim error on appeal where the trial proceeded exactly in accordance with his own attorney\u2019s theory of the case. <em>Cf. United States v. Cacy, </em>43 M.J. 214, 218 (C.A.A.F.1995); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>60 M.J. 964, 970 (A.F.Ct.Crim.App.2005), <em>rev. denied, </em>62 M.J. 438 (C.A.A.F.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">Likewise, even if it was error to admit Special Agent LeSane\u2019s comments regarding deception, such error is far from plain in light of the appellant\u2019s strategy at trial. The appellant\u2019s approach at trial was to show that the facts, as revealed in the final statement signed by the appellant, were true, and evidence of consensual behavior, not criminal acts. He wanted the members to believe his sworn statement to NCIS, unlike the accused in <em>Kasper, </em>who wished the members to disbelieve her pretrial statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">Further, no prejudice occurred. The appellant does not address prejudice in his briefs. To determine if error is harmless, the court will assess what effect the error had or may have had on the factfinder\u2019s decision. <em>United States v. Cobb, </em>45 M.J. 82, 86 (C.A.A.F.1996). Where inconsistencies and contradictions in the appellant\u2019s statement were obvious and would have raised questions concerning the credibility of the statement even in the absence of the witness\u2019 improper opinion testimony, there is no prejudice. <em>See id. </em>\u201cIf, when all is said and done, the conviction is sure that the error did not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect, the verdict and the judgment should stand, except perhaps where the departure is from a constitutional norm or a very specific command of Congress.\u201d <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 764-65, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946)(footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-10\">As was the case in <em>Cobb, </em>the appellant\u2019s veracity problems were apparent from the face of his statements, and he was not prejudiced. <em>See Cobb, </em>45 M.J. at 87; <em>see also United States v. Terry, </em>61 M.J. 721 (N.M.Ct.Crim.App.2005), <em>rev. denied, </em>2006 CAAF LEXIS 158 (C.A.A.F. May 19, 2006); <em>United States v. Simmons, </em>54 M.J. 883 (N.M.Ct.Crim.App.2001). The appellant\u2019s deception was obvious from the differences between the two statements he gave to Special Agent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>LeSane.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Any trier of fact would reach the same conclusion, even without the agent\u2019s comments, particularly in light of Mr. McNeil\u2019s questioning of Special Agent Le-Sane and Mr. McNeil\u2019s opening statement and closing argument. The appellant\u2019s second story was obviously different than his first story.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">We find no error based on Special Agent LeSane\u2019s testimony, and, in any event, no prejudice to the appellant. This assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">Factual Sufficiency</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">The appellant alleges that the facts in his case do not support his conviction. We disagree. Military courts of criminal appeals must determine both the factual and legal sufficiency of the evidence presented at trial. <em>United States v. Turner, </em>25 M.J. 324, 325 (C.M.A.1987); <em>see </em>Art. 66, UCMJ. The test for factual sufficiency is whether, after weighing all of the evidence in the record of trial and making allowances for the lack of personal observation, this court is convinced of the appellant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Turner, </em>25 M.J. at 325. The test for legal sufficiency is whether, considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, a reasonable fact finder could have found all the essential elements beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)). The term \u201creasonable doubt\u201d does not mean the evidence must be free of conflict. <em>United States v. Reed, </em>51 M. J. 559, 562 (N.M.Ct.Crim.App.1999), <em>aff'd, </em>54 M.J. 37 (C.A.A.F.2000). The factfinder may \u201cbelieve one part of a witness\u2019 testimony and disbelieve another.\u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>8 M.J. 52, 59 (C.M.A.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-12\">In the instant ease, the real question is whether there was sufficient evidence to corroborate the appellant\u2019s confession to Special Agent LeSane.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> After carefully reviewing the record, we are convinced that a reasonable factfinder could find the appellant guilty of indecent assault and indecent language based on all the evidence presented at trial. While not free of conflict, the members found the testimony of Lance Corporal Sanchez and the complaining witness to be credible, as do we. It is not mandatory that the victim of an indecent assault scream or fight a Sergeant of Marines who is attacking her, in order to be deemed credible, as suggested by the appellant. We also do not find it surprising that a victim waited until her attacker departed before calling the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-13\">We find the evidence in support of the appellant\u2019s conviction to be legally sufficient. Moreover, on the basis of the entire record, we are convinced of the appellant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. We find no merit in this assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-14\">Unreasonable Multiplication of Charges</p>\n<p id=\"b688-15\">The appellant alleges that charging him with indecent language, along with indecent assault, constituted an unreasonable multiplication of charges. We disagree. To determine whether there has been an unreasonable multiplication of charges, we consider five factors: (1) did the appellant object at trial; (2) are the charges aimed at distinctly separate criminal acts; (3) do the charges misrepresent or exaggerate the appellant\u2019s criminality; (4) do the charges unreasonably increase the appellant\u2019s punitive exposure; and (5) is there any evidence of prosecutorial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>overreaching or abuse in the drafting of the charges and specifications? <em>United States v. Quiroz, </em>57 M.J. 583, 585-86 (N.M.Ct.Crim.App.2002)(en <em>banc), aff'd, </em>58 M.J. 183 (C.A.A.F.2003)(summary disposition).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">In deciding issues of unreasonable multiplication of charges, we also consider Rule for Courts-Martial 307(c)(4), Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (2002 ed.), Discussion, which provides the following guidance: \u201cWhat is substantially one transaction should not be made the basis for an unreasonable multiplication of charges against one person.\u201d In considering all of these factors, we grant appropriate relief if we find \u201c \u2018the \u201cpiling on\u201d of charges so extreme or unreasonable as to necessitate the invocation of our Article 66(e), UCMJ, authority [to affirm only such findings of guilty and so much of the sentence as we find correct in law and fact and determine, on the basis of the <em>entire record, should be approved], \u2019 </em>\u201d <em>Quiroz, </em>57 M.J. at 585 (quoting <em>United States v. Quiroz, </em>53 M.J. 600, 607 (N.M.Ct.Crim.App.2000)); <em>see also United States v. Foster, </em>40 M.J. 140, 144 n. 4 (C.M.A.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Applying the non-exclusive <em>Quiroz </em>factors and the guidance provided by R.C.M. 307, we conclude that:</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">1. The appellant did not object at trial to being charged with both offenses;</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">2. The charges are aimed at distinctly separate criminal acts;</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">3. The charges did not misrepresent or exaggerate the appellant\u2019s criminality;</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">4. The charges did not unreasonably increase the appellant\u2019s punitive exposure at his special court-martial; and,</p>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">5. Charging the appellant with both offenses was not overreaching or abuse in the drafting of the charges and specifications at the time of charging.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-11\">We find that charging the appellant with indecent assault and indecent language did not constitute an unreasonable multiplication of charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-12\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b689-13\">Accordingly, the findings of guilty and the sentence, as approved by the convening authority, are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-14\">Senior Judge CARVER and Judge GEISER concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b684-10\">.

Other uncorroborated confessions or admissions of the accused that would themselves require corroboration may not be used to supply this independent evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-16\">The quantum of evidence needed to corroborate a confession, however, is not great.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-18\">The independent evidence necessary to establish corroboration need not be sufficient of itself to establish beyond a reasonable doubt the truth of facts stated in the admission or confession. The independent evidence need raise only an inference of the truth of the essential facts admitted. The amount and type of evidence introduced as corroboration is a factor to be considered by the trier of fact in determining the weight, if any, to be given to the admission or confession.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-19\">Mil.
