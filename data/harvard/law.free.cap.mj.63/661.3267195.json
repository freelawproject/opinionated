Contrary to his pleas, the appellant was found guilty of conspiracy to possess cocaine and wrongful use of cocaine, in violation of Articles 81 and 112a, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 881, 912a. A military judge sitting as a general court-martial sentenced the appellant to a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for 7 months, and reduction to E-l. The convening authority approved the findings and sentence as adjudged. The appellant argues that the military judge improperly denied his request to suppress evidence supporting the charges, on the basis that such evidence was the fruit of an illegal traffic stop by the local police. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b709-10\">On 7 September 2003, Sergeant (Sgt) K.R. Edwards of the Goldsboro, North Carolina, Police Department, was on patrol in a marked police vehicle. Sgt Edwards is a veteran police officer with approximately 29 years of law enforcement experience, including extensive drug interdiction training and experience. Between 0600 and 0630 hours, Sgt Edwards observed the appellant sitting in his idling vehicle, parked on an otherwise empty street, directly in front of an apartment house known by Sgt Edwards to be used for the illegal sale of narcotics. The appellant parked his vehicle on the same side of the street as the \u201cdrug house,\u201d but was pointed in the opposite direction of normal traffic flow. The appellant\u2019s vehicle was the only one on the street at that time. The residents on that street parked their vehicles in their driveways.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-11\">The drug house had been under observation by the police for several months prior to the events in issue. An occupant of that house, DT, was a known drug dealer. Sgt Edwards had, in the past, approached people who were parked near the house who subsequently admitted to him they were there to purchase crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-14\">As he was driving by the appellant\u2019s idling vehicle, Sgt Edwards observed a female proceed from a doorway of the drug house known by police to be the \u201cdrug transaction door,\u201d and walk toward the appellant\u2019s vehicle. Sgt Edwards was \u201c90% sure\u201d that he recognized the woman, BAW, who he encountered about a month earlier after she suffered a drug overdose, apparently brought about by taking a combination of pills and alcohol.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-15\">Sgt Edwards drove past the appellant\u2019s vehicle and continued to observe the appellant and BAW in his rearview mirror while he waited at a traffic light. Sgt Edwards saw BAW look in his direction and pause at the appellant\u2019s passenger door, without opening it. When the traffic light changed, Sgt Edwards proceeded through the intersection and, as he did so, he watched BAW enter the appellant\u2019s vehicle. At that point, he suspected BAW had purchased drugs at the house. Sgt Edwards broadcast a description of the appellant\u2019s car and the direction it was heading over the police radio.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-16\">\u25a0Shortly thereafter, the appellant\u2019s car was stopped by Officer Wayne Cannucci, also with the Goldsboro Police Department. Sgt Edwards arrived at the scene within minutes of the stop. While Officer Cannucci interviewed the appellant, Sgt Edwards spoke to BAW, who was in the passenger seat. BAW first denied there were any drugs in the vehicle. After Sgt Edwards informed BAW that they were prepared to have a drug detection dog walk around the vehicle, BAW produced several rocks of crack cocaine. The appellant and BAW were both placed under arrest for possession of cocaine after each gave the officers a different story about the circumstances surrounding their presence near the drug house that morning. After BAW was handcuffed, she informed Sgt Edwards that the appellant told her he used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>illegal drugs the night before, and that he drove her to the drug house to purchase cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">Later that morning, Special Agent (SA) William Byrd, from the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, picked up the appellant after notification of his arrest by the Goldsboro police. After returning to base with SA Byrd, the appellant voluntarily provided a urinalysis specimen after accomplishing a written consent form. The appellant\u2019s urine tested positive for the presence of ben-zolecgonine, a cocaine metabolite.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Rulings regarding the admission or exclusion of evidence, including rulings on motions to suppress, are reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>60 M.J. 239, 246 (C.A.A.F.2004) (citing <em>United States v. Monroe, 52 </em>M.J. 326, 330 (C.A.A.F.2000)). <em>See also United States v. Henley, </em>48 M.J. 864, 868 (A.F.Ct.Crim.App.1998), aff<em>'d, </em>53 M.J. 488 (C.A.A.F.2000). When there is a motion to suppress, the military judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed on a clearly erroneous standard, and conclusions of law are reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Ayala, </em>43 M.J. 296, 298 (C.A.A.F.1995). Whether the facts surrounding an investigative stop constitute \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>58 M.J. 429, 432 (C.A.A.F.2003) (citing <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">\u201cTemporary detention of individuals during the stop of an automobile by the police, even if only for a brief period and for a limited purpose, constitutes a \u2018seizure\u2019 of \u2018persons\u2019 within the meaning of [the Fourth Amendment].\u201d <em>Whren v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 806, 809-10, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996). \u201cAn investigative stop of an individual is permissible under the Fourth Amendment \u2018where a police officer observes unusual conduct which leads him reasonably to conclude in light of his experience that criminal activity may be afoot.\u2019 \u201d <em>Robinson, </em>58 M.J. at 432 (quoting <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 30, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968)). \u201c \u2018[Reasonable suspicion\u2019 is a less demanding standard than probable cause and requires a showing considerably less than [a] preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Wardlow, </em>528 U.S. 119, 123, 120 S.Ct. 673, 145 L.Ed.2d 570 (2000) (citing <em>United States v. Sokolow, </em>490 U.S. 1, 7, 109 S.Ct. 1581, 104 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989)). The Fourth Amendment requires only that a law enforcement officer have a \u201cminimal level of objective justification for making the stop.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In reviewing reasonable suspicion determinations, we look at the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d to see whether the detaining officer had a \u201cparticularized and objective basis\u201d for suspecting legal wrongdoing prior to the stop. <em>United States v. Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. 266, 273, 122 S.Ct. 744, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-9\">In <em>Robinson, </em>the Court discerned that there are two elements which constitute the concept of \u201cparticularized suspicion\u201d: (1) the assessment must be based on all the circumstances, and (2) there must exist \u201ca suspicion that the particular individual being stopped is engaged in wrongdoing.\u201d <em>Robinson, </em>58 M.J. at 433 (quoting <em>United States v. Cortez, </em>449 U.S. 411, 418, 101 S.Ct. 690, 66 L.Ed.2d 621 (1981)). In regard to the first element, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-10\">The analysis proceeds with various objective observations, information from police reports, if such are available, and consideration of the modes or patterns of operation of certain kinds of lawbreakers. From these data, a trained officer draws inferences and makes deductions\u2014inferences and deductions that might well elude an untrained person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 433 (quoting <em>Cortez, </em>449 U.S. at 418, 101 S.Ct. 690). In regard to the second element, the Court noted that although the factual basis required for the stop must be \u201cmore than a mere hunch,\u201d it \u201cneed not rise to the level of probable cause, and it falls considerably short of a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-12\">The <em>Robinson </em>Court also observed that, \u201c[i]n considering the totality of the circumstances, the detaining officer may consider a series of acts which are innocent in themselves, but which, taken together, warrant further investigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. at 274-75, 122 S.Ct. 744). Further<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>more, \u201c[w]hile mere presence in a high-crime area, standing alone, is insufficient for reasonable suspicion, it is a \u2018relevant contextual consideration.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Wardlow, </em>528 U.S. at 124, 120 S.Ct. 673). The fact that a vehicle seems out of place is a relevant consideration. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>190 F.3d 668, 672 (5th Cir.1999)). The time of day is relevant as well. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>190 F.3d at 672).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The case cited by the appellant, <em>United States v. Sprinkle, </em>106 F.3d 613 (4th Cir.1997), serves as an adequate baseline for our analysis of \u201cparticularized suspicion\u201d in the instant case. In <em>Sprinkle, </em>police observed a known drug felon, VP, who had recently been released from prison, sitting in a parked vehicle in a neighborhood known for considerable narcotics trafficking. They then observed Sprinkle, who was not known to the police, come out of a house and enter VP\u2019s vehicle. VP and Sprinkle huddled together at the center console of the vehicle with their hands close together. The nearest police officer believed Sprinkle was about to pass something to VP and alerted his partner. VP, upon observing the police officer, placed his hand to the left side of his face as if to conceal himself from the officer. Nothing was seen in the two suspects\u2019 hands. As the police officers headed for their vehicles, VP drove away in a normal, unsuspicious manner. The vehicle was blocked by an unrelated traffic stop. As the officers approached VP\u2019s vehicle, Sprinkle stepped out of the car and fled once the officer initiated a patdown. In the course of his flight, Sprinkle fired a handgun at the pursuing officer. He was eventually disarmed and arrested. At trial, the federal district judge granted the defense motion to suppress evidence of the gun as the fruit of an unlawful stop. On appeal, the lower court\u2019s decision was reversed on other grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">In both <em>Sprinkle </em>and the instant case, one of the two parties involved had a drug-related history. In <em>Sprinkle, </em>VP was a known narcotics felon. In the present case, BAW was known to Sgt Edwards because of her prior abuse of drugs and alcohol. In both cases, some suspicious behavior was observed before the stop\u2014VP and Sprinkle\u2019s hand motions in the front seat of the vehicle and BAW\u2019s hesitation to enter the appellant\u2019s vehicle until she observed Sgt Edwards\u2019 vehicle pulling away after the traffic light turned green. In neither case did the vehicle of VP or the appellant depart the scene in a suspicious manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">Had there been no further basis for Sgt Edwards\u2019 \u201cparticularized suspicion\u201d than the above, the appellant\u2019s argument would be stronger; however, the two eases differ significantly in some respects. First, VP\u2019s car was parked on a busy street in the late afternoon. Had the officer not recognized VP, the car\u2019s presence would hardly have aroused any suspicion. The appellant\u2019s vehicle, on the other hand, was observed parked near a known drug house at dawn, facing in the wrong direction, with its engine running, on an otherwise deserted street. These circumstances were only exacerbated by the fact that the residents on that street all parked their vehicles in their driveways as was usual in that neighborhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">Sgt Edwards observed BAW standing in close proximity to a door of a known drug house. She then proceeded to the appellant\u2019s vehicle, and paused as she watched Sgt Edwards\u2019 marked police car drive away. BAW then got into the appellant\u2019s vehicle. In contrast, the house from which Sprinkle emerged just prior to entering VP\u2019s vehicle had no such notoriety, nor was Sprinkle known to the officer as having any connection to drug abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">All of these circumstances, when viewed in their totality, were sufficient to lead Sgt Edwards\u2014a 29-year law enforcement veteran\u2014 to draw inferences and make \u201cdeductions that might well elude an untrained person.\u201d <em>Robinson, </em>58 M.J. at 433 (citing <em>Cortez, </em>449 U.S. at 418, 101 S.Ct. 690). At trial, Sgt Edwards clearly articulated that he drew upon his 29 years of law enforcement experience generally, his extensive experience in drug interdiction specifically, and his familiarity with the criminal activities associated with the house in question, when he concluded that one or more of the individuals in the appellant\u2019s vehicle was engaged in criminal wrongdoing. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, we find that Sgt Edwards had a basis for a \u201cparticu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>larized suspicion\u201d of criminal activity sufficient to warrant the investigative stop of the appellant\u2019s vehicle. We hold that the military judge did not abuse his discretion in failing to suppress the evidence in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">The approved findings and sentence are correct in law and fact, and no error prejudicial to the substantial rights of the appellant occurred. Article 66(c), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 866(c); <em>United States v. Reed, </em>54 M.J. 37, 41 (C.A.A.F.2000). Accordingly, the approved findings and sentence are</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b709-12\"> It is unclear from the record how the drugs were obtained.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
