On appeal, he alleges that his pleas to these offenses were improvident and that his sentence was inappropriately severe. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-19\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b761-20\">The facts necessary for resolution of the assigned errors are these: the appellant purchased a quantity of alcohol, brought it to his dormitory room on Malmstrom Air Force Base, and shared it with RM, a 14-year-old girl. Although he did not know RM\u2019s precise age, the appellant knew she was under the age of 21. Dormitory rules forbid providing alcohol to anyone under 21 years of age; the appellant was aware of these rules, and understood that violating them could result in punishment under military law.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-21\">After consuming the alcohol, RM and the appellant engaged in oral sodomy. The appellant at one point pulled away from RM to retrieve a camcorder that he kept in his room. RM then resumed sodomizing the appellant while he videotaped the act. This ended about 90 seconds later, when RM stopped because she was feeling ill and needed to go into the bathroom. She soon thereafter went to sleep. The appellant stipulated that this was a result of the alcohol he gave her.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-22\">Although the appellant knew RM was under 21, he told the military judge, he believed her to be over 18. The appellant argues that this was sufficient to render his pleas improvident because sodomy between consenting adults is protected under <em>Lawrence v. Texas, </em>539 U.S. 558, 123 S.Ct. 2472, 156 L.Ed.2d 508 (2003). Thus, he contends, his claimed mistaken belief as to RM\u2019s age amounts to a \u201cmatter inconsistent with the plea\u201d under Article 45, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 845, requiring the military judge to reject his guilty plea on the sodomy specification. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number><em>Id. See generally United States v. Marcy, </em>62 M.J. 611, 613 (A.F.Ct.Crim.App.2005), <em>pet. denied, </em>63 M.J. 254 (2006) (when accused raises matter inconsistent with guilty plea, military judge may not accept the plea unless inconsistency can be resolved). He similarly claims his plea to the Article 134, UCMJ, specification was improvident, arguing that he did not \u201cknowingly videotape ... a child under 16 years of age, engaging in oral sodomy\u201d because he did not know RM\u2019s true age.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">\n<em>Providency of the Appellant\u2019s Pleas</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">We review the military judge\u2019s decision to accept a guilty plea for an abuse of discretion and review the entire record of trial to determine whether such an abuse occurred. <em>United States v. Eberle, </em>44 M.J. 374, 375 (C.A.A.F.1996); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>42 M.J. 443, 445 (C.A.A.F.1995). We find no abuse of discretion here. The appellant\u2019s main assumption\u2014that his sodomy with RM would have been permissible had she been over 18\u2014is incorrect. As our superior appellate court has held, not all sodomy falls within the liberty interest protected in <em>Lawrence. </em>Because of the special need for discipline in the armed forces, conduct that might otherwise be protected under <em>Lawrence </em>may still be punishable under Article 125, UCMJ. This is particularly so when it involves a violation of some other military duty. <em>United States v. Marcum, </em>60 M.J. 198, 206-07 (C.A.A.F.2004). The appellant\u2019s conduct exemplifies this principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">Although the appellant may have been misinformed about RM\u2019s true age, he nevertheless understood she was too young to lawfully consume alcohol. As the appellant admitted during the providence inquiry, he received and signed a memorandum when he moved into the dorms which stated that giving alcohol to persons under age 21 \u201cis punishable under the UCMJ.\u201d The record of trial reveals a clear sequence of events. First, the appellant provided RM with alcohol\u2014 enough to make her sick, and, we have no doubt, enough to impair her judgment. Next, he proceeded to engage in sodomy with her. We conclude that the appellant\u2019s willful violation of military law, as a precursor to sodomy with RM, took his actions \u201coutside any protected liberty interest recognized in <em>Lawrence.\u201d See United States v. Stirewalt, </em>60 M.J. 297, 304 (C.A.A.F.2004) (zone of autonomy established by <em>Lawrence </em>must be considered in light of military regulations and the interests of order and discipline they reflect), <em>cert. denied, </em>544 U.S. 923, 125 S.Ct. 1682, 161 L.Ed.2d 482 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">Because his sodomy with RM was not protected conduct under <em>Lawrence, </em>we conclude that the appellant\u2019s guilty plea to the Article 125, UCMJ, offense was provident. We likewise find that the appellant\u2019s knowing videotaping of this illegal act provided a sufficient factual basis to support his guilty plea on the Article 134, UCMJ, specification, irrespective of his knowledge of RM\u2019s age.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-11\">Although we sustain his Article 134, UCMJ, conviction, we find that the maximum punishment for that offense is less than the parties calculated at trial. The parties agreed that the appellant\u2019s conduct was analogous to that forbidden by federal anti-child pornography statutes, exposing the appellant to a maximum of ten years of confinement. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2252(a)(4), 2252(b)(2). To be punished under this statute, however, the appellant must have known not merely that he was videotaping RM as she engaged in sexually-explieit conduct, but also her age. <em>United States v. X-Citement Video, </em>513 U.S. 64, 78, 115 S.Ct. 464, 130 L.Ed.2d 372 (1994). Under the facts of this case, we find that the Article 134, UCMJ, specification is not properly analogous to a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252, and the military judge erred when calculating the maximum confinement for the Article 134, UCMJ, offense. Instead, the most closely-related offense is indecent acts with another, for which the maximum punishment includes five years of confinement, rather than ten. <em>Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (MCM), </em>Part IV, \u00b6 90e. (2005 ed.).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>\n<em>Sentence Reassessment and Sentence Appropriateness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">Having found error in the calculation of the appellant\u2019s maximum possible sentence,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we must consider whether we can reassess the sentence. If we can determine that, \u201cabsent the error, the sentence would have been at least of a certain magnitude,\u201d then we \u201cmay cure the error by reassessing the sentence instead of ordering a sentence rehearing.\u201d <em>United States v. Doss, </em>57 M.J. 182, 185 (C.A.A.F.2002) (citing <em>United States v. Sales, </em>22 M.J. 305, 307 (C.M.A.1986)); <em>United States v. Peoples, </em>29 M.J. 426, 428 (C.M.A.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">The maximum punishment for the appellant\u2019s misconduct, as calculated by the parties at trial and accepted by the military judge, was a dishonorable discharge, confinement for 31 years, total forfeitures of pay and allowances, reduction to E-l, and a fine. When correctly calculated, the maximum punishment includes confinement for only 26 years. The disparity between these figures, however, does not affect the facts underlying the appellant\u2019s misconduct, and we are satisfied that the military judge who sentenced the appellant would have arrived at the same sentence using the lesser maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Finally, the appellant contends that his sentence, as adjudged and approved, was inappropriately severe. We consider sentence appropriateness de novo. <em>United States v. Baier, </em>60 M.J. 382, 383-84 (C.A.A.F.2005); <em>United States v. Hutchison, </em>57 M.J. 231, 234 (C.A.A.F.2002); <em>United States v. Baker, </em>28 M.J. 121, 122 (C.M.A.1989). Although we generally consider appropriateness without reference to other sentences, we are required to examine sentence disparities in closely related cases, and permitted\u2014but not required\u2014to do so in other cases. <em>United States v. Wacha, </em>55 M.J. 266, 267-68 (C.A.A.F.2001) (citing <em>United States v. Bal</em>lard; 20 M.J. 282, 286 (C.M.A.1985)); <em>United States v. Lacy, </em>50 M.J. 286, 288 (C.A.A.F.1999); <em>United States v. Olinger, </em>12 M.J. 458, 460 (C.M.A.1982) (citing <em>United States v. Mamaluy, </em>27 C.M.R. 176, 180, 1959 WL 3587 (C.M.A.1959)).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-10\">The appellant asks us to consider other cases in which military members who committed other crimes\u2014some similar to his own, some not\u2014were treated more leniently than he. We are neither persuaded that these cases require sentence comparison, nor convinced that the appellant suffered a miscarriage of justice merely because some other offender received a lesser punishment. <em>See United States v. Durant, </em>55 M.J. 258, 261 (C.A.A.F.2001) (the military justice system \u201cmust be prepared to accept some disparity\u201d even in the sentence of codefendants, provided each is sentenced as an individual). We therefore examine the appellant\u2019s sentence in light of the facts specific to his case. <em>Peoples, </em>29 M.J. at 427; <em>United States v. Snelling, </em>14 M.J. 267, 268 (C.M.A.1982). We note in particular the nature of the appellant\u2019s misconduct; that he committed offenses against two victims; and that he received punishment under Article 15, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 815, for additional misconduct committed just weeks prior to his general court-martial. Taking these factors into account, we find nothing inappropriately severe in his punishment. <em>See United States v. Healy, </em>26 M.J. 394, 395 (C.M.A.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-11\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b763-12\">The findings and sentence, as reassessed, are correct in law and fact, and no error prejudicial to the substantial rights of the appellant occurred. Article 66(e), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 866(c); <em>United States v. Reed, </em>54 M.J. 37, 41 (C.A.A.F.2000). Accordingly, the findings and sentence, as reassessed, are</p>\n<p id=\"b763-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-14\">Judge SMITH participated in this opinion prior to his reassignment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b762-7\">.
