We find appellant\u2019s assertions that: (1) his 3 January 2002 written statement provided to SA Phillips was involuntary (because SA Phillips did not inform appellant of his Article 31(b), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 831(b), rights), and (2) his 7 January 2002 written statement to SA Phillips was \"fruit of the poisonous tree,\u201d to be without merit. Initially, appellant was not specifically informed of his Article 31(b) rights. However, prior to taking the 3 January 2002 written statement, Detective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>Larsen informed appellant he was being questioned because his daughter had made allegations of sexual misconduct, and further notified appellant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>See, Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602. The rights warnings and notice regarding the nature of the accusations Detective Larsen gave appellant satisfy the requirements of Article 31(b), UCMJ, and <em>Miranda. See, United States v. Seay, </em>60 M.J. 73, 77 (C.A.A.F.2004) (reaffirming the applicability of <em>Miranda </em>to military law as stated in <em>United States v.

Furthermore, prior to rendering his 7 January 2002 statement, SA Phillips specifically advised appellant of his Article 31(b), UCMJ, rights, which appellant waived.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b582-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b582-4\">SCHENCK, Senior Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">A military judge sitting as a general court-martial convicted appellant, contrary to his pleas, of indecent acts with a child under sixteen years of age and indecent liberties with a child under sixteen years of age, in violation of Article 134, Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 934 [hereinafter UCMJ]. The convening authority approved the adjudged sentence to a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for three years, and reduction to Private El. This case is before the court for review under Article 66, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 866.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">In their original pleadings, appellate defense counsel asserted, <em>inter alia, </em>the military judge erred by finding the victim unavailable to testify under Military Rule of Evidence [hereinafter Mil. R. Evid.] 804 in violation of appellant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confrontation. We then specified the following issues: (1) whether, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), appellant was denied his Sixth Amendment right to confront a witness against him where the military judge ruled that Ms. KG was unavailable to testify against him at his trial by court-martial; (2) assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the military judge erred in admitting the videotaped interview of Ms. KG, whether the error was harmless; and (3) whether, in light of <em>Crawford, </em>the videotaped interview of Ms. KG constitutes testimonial hearsay requiring that the declar-ant be subject to cross-examination as required by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">We agree with appellate defense counsel that the military judge erred in his finding of unavailability and, therefore, need not determine whether the videotaped interview of KG should be considered testimonial under <em>Crawford. </em>Nevertheless, we find the military judge\u2019s error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and affirm the findings of guilty and the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">The military judge found appellant guilty of committing an indecent act upon KG (appellant\u2019s five-year-old biological daughter) by placing his hands on her vagina with intent to gratify his sexual desires between on or about September 1999 and December 1999 (Specification 4 of the Charge). He also found appellant guilty of taking indecent liberties with KG by exposing himself, having her touch his penis, then shaking his own penis until he ejaculated, with intent to gratify his sexual desires, on or about 29 December 2001 (Specification 1 of the Charge). The military judge found appellant not guilty of a second indecent acts specification (Specification 3 of the Charge) that alleged appellant touched KG\u2019s vagina on another occasion during the same period alleged in Specification 4. He also found appellant not guilty of a second indecent liberties specification (Specification 2 of the Charge) that alleged appellant exposed his penis and ejaculated in KG\u2019s presence between December 2000 and March 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-11\">These offenses came to light when, on 29 December 2001, Mrs. Gardinier went to a friend\u2019s house and left her five-year-old daughter, KG, and one-year-old son with appellant, her husband. When Mrs. Gardinier returned home, KG excitedly ran up to her mother and told her appellant was \u201claying naked.\u201d Mrs. Gardinier then walked KG into KG\u2019s room and asked her if anybody had ever \u201ctouched her in her private part.\u201d In response, KG \u201copened her underwear to the side,\u201d showed her mother her \u201cprivate areas,\u201d and said, \u201cDaddy does.\u201d Mrs. Gardinier confronted appellant who denied the allegation and told her, \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, you can get the fuck out.\u201d KG then told her mother \u201cDaddy\u2019s a liar.\u201d Mrs. Gardinier took KG back to Mrs. Gardinier\u2019s room, asked KG when her father inappropriately touched her, and KG said, \u201c[E]very time [her mother] left\u201d the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-12\">That same night, Mrs. Gardinier took KG to Evans Army Community Hospital at Fort Carson where a doctor gave KG a regular physical examination. Upon completion of the examination, Mrs. Gardinier spoke with a social worker, and with two El Paso County police officers who took her statement. Thereafter, the police escorted Mrs. Gardini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>er and KG home and removed appellant from the Gardinier household.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">After the investigation began, KG attempted to talk to her mother about what Mrs. Gardinier referred to as \u201cDad\u2019s cooter,\u201d but Mrs. Gardinier changed the subject. Mrs. Gardinier also testified that after KG was interviewed regarding appellant\u2019s conduct, KG\u2019s behavior worsened. Specifically, KG became violent towards her mother and younger brother; KG also bit herself. At trial, Mrs. Gardinier denied KG was developmentally slow for a five-year-old child but said KG had never been tested.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Detective Larsen of the El Paso County Sheriffs Office and Ms. Cheney of the Colorado Department of Human Services interviewed KG at the Children\u2019s Advocacy Center in Colorado Springs on 2 January 2002. KG made several statements indicating appellant had sexually abused her. This interview was videotaped and admitted into evidence as Prosecution Exhibit 3 over defense objection. During the interview, KG told Detective Larsen that appellant \u201cwas naked and he was sitting on the couch,\u201d and he does \u201cthat all the time.\u201d KG also indicated appellant touched her in her groin area with his hand\u2014by pointing there several times\u2014after he helped her take a bath. When Detective Larsen asked KG whether appellant was wearing any clothes while bathing, she answered, \u201cNope.\u201d Furthermore, KG stated her father touched her in her groin area on other occasions, including when her mother was home. Ms. Cheney asked KG whether her father ever made her touch him, and KG responded affirmatively; however, she would not respond orally to the question, \u201cWhere do you have to touch him at?\u201d After Detective Larsen drew a picture of a person and asked KG to show him where her father made her touch him, KG pointed to the groin area which she said looked like \u201cpee.\u201d KG stated \u201c[i]t gets bigger\u201d when she touches her father\u2019s penis. KG also drew on Detective Larsen\u2019s picture her interpretation of \u201c[i]t gets bigger.\u201d Detective Larsen then asked, \u2018What happens after that?\u201d Ms. Cheney interjected by asking, \u201cWhat comes out of it?\u201d KG\u2019s response was that \u201cpee pee\u201d comes out of her father\u2019s penis after she touches it.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Ms. Sievers, a registered nurse, clinical forensic specialist, and sexual assault nurse examiner at the Children\u2019s Advocacy Center, testified at trial that she also interviewed KG on 2 January 2002. While she was taking KG\u2019s medical history, KG stated she saw appellant naked. KG also told Ms. Sievers that she wanted to tell her mother \u201cthat Daddy was naked and that she touched Daddy\u2019s cooter.\u201d KG spread her legs, pointed to her genital area, and stated that is where the \u201ccooter\u201d is located. KG told Ms. Sievers \u201cher cooter was small, but sometimes she saw Daddy\u2019s cooter get bigger.\u201d Ms. Sievers completed a forensic medical examination form during the interview (admitted into evidence as Prosecution Exhibit 1) on which she annotated that KG \u201cappears small for [her] age and delayed from a developmental perspective.\u201d In addition to the information provided during her testimony, Ms. Sievers\u2019 notes on the form indicate that when KG was asked why she came to see Ms. Sievers, KG replied, \u201cDaddy was naked. I was going to tell mom. He was in Mommy\u2019s room. I was touching his \u2018cooter\u2019 with my hand.\u201d Ms. Sievers also performed a sexual assault examination on KG\u2019s vaginal and anal areas and the \u201cdetailed genital assessment was negative. It was normal ... for her age.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Ms. Freeman, a family friend since 1999, testified on the merits that she moved in with the Gardiniers on 30 December 2001 when appellant moved out. Ms. Freeman said after she moved in, her daughter and KG were drawing pictures. When Ms. Freeman asked what the pictures depicted, KG told her one represented \u201cdaddy\u2019s pee pee,\u201d and another picture was \u201cdaddy laying on the bed naked. Mom wearing underwear.\u201d The military judge stated he would only consider this information to reflect \u201cthings ... a 5-year-old female would not ordinarily have knowledge of,\u201d not for the truth of the matter asserted, and therefore, not as hearsay. Ms. Freeman also testified that KG was much more aggressive after the 29 December 2001 incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>On 3 January 2002, Detective Larsen advised appellant of his Miranda<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> rights, which appellant waived. Detective Larsen then conducted a videotaped interview of appellant. Criminal Investigation Command (CID) Special Agent (SA) Phillips was present while Detective Larsen interviewed appellant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">Immediately following the interview with Detective Larsen, SA Phillips conducted a videotaped interview of appellant that is consistent with appellant\u2019s two subsequently written statements. Afterward, appellant rendered a handwritten statement (Prosecution Exhibit 5) which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-5\">On two separate occasions sometime after Sept. 99 when we moved here [KG] has taken a shower with me. She would walk in after I was already in there so after I got done washing, I would wash her up which included her groin area. Doing this unintentionally aroused me____ [A] year ago [KG] was in the bedroom watching cartoons, I was in the living room watching tv. I aroused myself and as I was finishing she came running in looking for chocolate milk and saw me.... Approx. 29 Dec. \u201901,1 was changing into night clothes, [KG] came into [sic] watch cartoons in our bedroom, she saw me changing. In the course of trying to put my bottoms on, [my son] started crying. I ran out of the bedroom not yet fully dressed to see what happened. He just seemed to have toppled over____ [KG] came running out [and] noticed me still half-naked. She touched me which aroused me. My hand went to my penis which ejaculated a little which she noticed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">Appellant also provided a typed, sworn statement to SA Phillips on 7 January 2002 (Prosecution Exhibit 6). This second statement is generally consistent with the first, but adds further details. Appellant admits that when he showered with KG two times in September 1999, he was \u201csomewhat aroused,\u201d and his penis was \u201chalfway erect\u201d after he touched KG\u2019s vaginal area, but \u201c[i]t had nothing to do with her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-14\">Appellant further states in the 7 January 2002 statement that between January and March 2001, \u201cwhile my wife was pregnant[, KG] was in the bedroom watching cartoons, I was in the living room watching TV. I started to get aroused and quickly relieved myself. Just as I was finishing up, [KG] ran out of the bedroom and caught me. She pointed to me and commented that I was peeing.\u201d Appellant admits he was masturbating and ejaculated on himself and KG \u201cprobably did see [him] ejaculate\u201d and she \u201cprobably\u201d touched his penis.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-15\">In his 7 January statement, appellant also states that on 29 December 2001, KG came out of the tub with a towel and asked him to dry her off. He further indicates that on that night he ran out before he \u201cgot [his] pants fully on\u201d to assist his son. Appellant states, \u201c[KG] had come running out behind me and when I sat down she noticed my penis, her finger touched it as she commented on how I had a pee pee and [his son] had a pee pee____ It had gotten aroused and a drop of fluid was at the end of it.\u201d Appellant further states KG touched his penis for \u201c1-2 seconds\u201d and he became \u201csexually aroused;\u201d he touched it, and \u201csome semen came out and was on the tip of [his] penis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-18\">The military judge denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the 3 January 2002 videotaped interview between Detective Larsen, SA Phillips, and appellant, appellant\u2019s 3 January 2002 handwritten statement, and appellant\u2019s 7 January 2002 written sworn statement to CID. He then considered these exhibits during trial on the merits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>Prior to trial on the merits, the government moved <em>in </em>limine<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to determine admissibility of the victim\u2019s 2 January 2002 videotaped statement based on Mil. R. Evid. 804(a)(6) (unavailability) and Mil. R. Evid. 807 (residual hearsay). Specifically, trial counsel made several assertions: because of KG\u2019s age, she was \u201csimply unable to testify;\u201d \u201cbecause of her developmental ability, [she did not] understand and [could not] grasp the nature of the judicial proceedings, and therefore, could not testify truthfully in the judicial proceedings;\u201d and due to the \u201cgap of time,\u201d \u201cshe simply as a child [had] lost that information.\u201d Trial counsel further asserted KG could not \u201cappreciate what happened; she [could not] give relevant and probative evidence because she [was] unwilling and unable to talk about it and because it [would] do her great harm to testify.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Trial defense counsel objected to admissibility of KG\u2019s videotaped statement based upon the Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause. Trial defense counsel further argued that the victim had not yet refused to testify, and told the military judge, \u201cThe government, who has the burden, didn\u2019t call [KG]____ They could have called her in a teleconference, or something to demonstrate simply the fact that she couldn\u2019t talk about it. Now, she did talk to defense counsel. It wasn\u2019t much. It was a statement, but it was certainly an accusatory statement, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">At trial, the military judge qualified Mr. Lehman, a Colorado licensed clinical social worker, as an expert in child development and the treatment of sexually abused children. He testified during the pretrial hearing\u2014regarding the government motion <em>in limine </em>to have KG declared unavailable and her videotaped interview admitted\u2014that KG was having tantrums and was aggressive. Mr. Lehman said KG would not understand the judicial process or its seriousness, would be confused sitting in court in front of her father, and would be victimized again. However, he indicated that taking her testimony through closed-circuit television, though not beneficial or helpful to KG, would not be detrimental in the long run. Mr. Lehman said KG would probably refuse to talk, would have lost knowledge, or would be untruthful in front of her father. He stated KG was cognitively three or four years old, not her biological age of five.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-11\">Mr. Lehman testified on the merits that during one of his sessions with KG, she told him \u201cabout her father making her touch her cooter,\u201d and that \u201cDaddy made her touch his cooter.\u201d He also noted Mrs. Gardinier\u2019s concern that KG\u2019s behavior had gotten progressively worse after the incident on 29 December 2001, and KG became more aggressive. Mr. Lehman restated his opinion from the motion hearing that, if she testified, KG would not benefit from being questioned by \u201cindividuals who aren\u2019t trained as licensed psychologists or treatment providers,\u201d in a \u201cnontherapeutic environment,\u201d concerning what her father did to her; KG would be retraumatized to a certain degree depending upon the questions asked. Mr. Lehman also stated he did not necessarily agree that closed-circuit television testimony would not be harmful, but it would be \u201cthe lesser of two evils\u201d considering the other option would be live, in-court testimony in front of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-12\">The military judge asked trial counsel to show cause why the government should deprive appellant of his right to confront the victim-witness without at least trying to arrange for a method of testimony not harmful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>to the child. The military judge suggested trial counsel \u201cat least find out whether [KG is going] to be able to testify,\u201d i.e., by interviewing KG in court, before denying appellant his right to confrontation. He then told the government to prepare the courtroom for KG to testify using closed-circuit television. The military judge wanted \u201cto make absolutely sure that everybody else is correct, that we\u2019ll not get anything out of [KG].\u201d He also informed appellant that, in the alternative, he could voluntarily absent himself from the courtroom while KG testified on the stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">During Mrs. Gardinier\u2019s testimony, the military judge told her, \u201c[E]vidence in a criminal case ought to be brought out in court. So, I\u2019ve determined that I\u2019d like to hear [KG] testify, if she can testify, by closed-circuit television____ I know that\u2019s against your wishes. And I will not force her to testify if you say that you don\u2019t want me to have her testify. I shouldn\u2019t say \u2018force her to testify.\u2019 I won\u2019t have her called if you don\u2019t approve of that.\u201d Mrs. Gardinier responded, \u201cI don\u2019t want her to.\u201d The military judge further asked, \u201cAre you saying you\u2019ll not allow her to testify?\u201d Mrs. Gardinier responded, \u2018Yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">After the witness was excused, the military judge stated, \u201cI\u2019m going to have to think about that for awhile. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right that I order [KG] to testify or to appear to try to testify over the objections of her mother. Obviously, [KG] is Ms. Gardinier\u2019s child, not mine. So, I need to consider the implications of that now.\u201d Subsequently, the military judge stated, \u201cMake sure I have this issue framed correctly in my mind. I\u2019ve decided, I guess as a matter of personal conscience, that I am not going to require [KG] to testify by closed-circuit TV over ... her mother\u2019s objection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">Later, when announcing his findings with regard to the motion <em>in limine, </em>the military judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-9\">MJ: Okay. I have determined that [KG] is unavailable to testify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-10\">I watched the videotape interview of her again last evening. It\u2019s apparent to me that [KG] was even then reluctant to talk about these charged events.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-11\">Mrs. Gardinier says that she has been unable to get [KG] to talk about the events, although based upon her testimony, I don\u2019t believe that Mrs. Gardinier has pushed [KG] to discuss it with her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-12\">Mr. Lehman has had six therapy sessions with [KG], each between 40 and 60 minutes long, and in those 5 or 6 hours of sessions, [KG] has made only one brief mention of what happened, despite Mr. Lehman\u2019s attempts to get her to discuss this as part of her therapy. Mr. Lehman\u2019s expert opinion is that [KG] will not provide any useful information if called because of her reticence and because the passage of time has dimmed her recall of events. Mr. Lehman talked to [KG] just days ago when she returned to Colorado, and he got nothing from her concerning the events. If she won\u2019t relate the event to him, someone she\u2019s familiar with, there\u2019s no reason to believe that she will relate events to strangers in a judicial setting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-13\">Counsel for both sides have attempted to discuss this with [KG] in preparation for trial without success. I think I have the trial counsel\u2019s representation that the defense has been unable to get her to relate anything. I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve heard that directly from the defense counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-14\">I find that giving the defense an opportunity to cross-examine [KG] would not be productive or helpful. There are, of course, many other ways of attacking a [witness\u2019] credibility other than through cross-examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-15\">It had been my intent yesterday, of course, to attempt to get her to testify by closed-circuit television, but that was just a hope and a prayer that she would in fact cooperate, and I find that she would not. And in view of Mrs. Gardinier\u2019s objection to that attempt and because I\u2019m convinced it would not be productive, I decided not to order that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-16\">The military judge then made findings fulfilling the requirements of Mil. R. Evid. 807 (residual hearsay) and regarding the trustworthiness of the statements in accordance with <em>Idaho v. Wright, </em>497 U.S. 805, 110 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>3139, 111 L.Ed.2d 638 (1990),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and admitted KG\u2019s videotaped statement. The following colloquy then transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-4\">ADC: Sir, just to clarify the record, during my conversation with [KG], I did ask her what happened, and she said, \u201cDaddy had showed me his cooter on the couch.\u201d When I asked her again, her response was no, that that didn\u2019t happen. [Trial counsel] was there during that question and during her response, as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-5\">TC: Your Honor, just to elaborate on that. The statements made by defense counsel, of course, are true. Defense Counsel asked several questions about that, and [KG] several times said, \u201cI\u2019m done. I\u2019m not talking about it,\u201d and [KG] changed the subject. [Assistant defense counsel (ADC) ] continued to ask her questions, at which time [ADC] said, \u201cCan you tell me what you told your mother?\u201d and [KG] said, as defense counsel pointed out, \u201cDaddy showed me his cooter. I\u2019m done.\u201d And [KG] said, \u201cI\u2019m stopped talking. I\u2019m done now. I\u2019m done,\u201d and then [ADC] again said, \u201cCan you tell me what you said?\u201d and asked for more clarification questions, and [KG] refused to comply. She said \u201cNo. No.\u201d And I don\u2019t know if she meant no, it didn\u2019t happen, \u201cNo, I\u2019m done talking,\u201d [or] \u201cNo, I won\u2019t talk about it.\u201d At that point, after several more minutes of that, [ADC] and I, I think, both decided that she would not be productive to talk to and she was not going to speak with us any longer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">The military judge then asked if trial counsel had interviewed KG without the defense present. Assistant trial counsel said she talked to KG without the defense two months prior to trial and KG \u201cwouldn\u2019t give [her] any more information then.\u201d Assistant trial counsel told the military judge that when she interviewed KG \u201cjust ... the other day,\u201d she asked KG if she remembered why she was going to testify. KG replied, \u201cAbout my dad\u2019s cooter,\u201d but provided nothing further.

Evid. 803), the government must establish the declarant of the prior, out-of-court statement is legally unavailable pursuant to Mil. R. Evid. 804(a). <em>See White, </em>502 U.S. at 355, 112 S.Ct. 736; <em>Bridges, </em>55 M.J. at 63; <em>United States v. Lyons, </em>36 M.J. 183, 186 n. 2 (C.M.A.1992); <em>United States v.

Military Rule of Evidence 804(a) provided the military judge in appellant\u2019s case three potentially applicable options for finding the child-victim legally unavailable. Specifically, Mil. R. Evid. 804(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-10\">\u201cUnavailability as a witness\u201d includes situations in which the declarant\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-11\">(2) persists in refusing to testify concerning the subject matter of the declarant\u2019s statement despite an order of the military judge to do so; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-12\">(3) testifies to a lack of memory of the subject matter of the declarant\u2019s statement; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-13\">(6) is unavailable within the meaning of Article 49(d)(2)[, an article entitled \u201cDepositions\u201d].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-14\">Article 49(d)(2), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 849(d)(2), further states that a witness is unavailable if the witness, \u201cby reason of death, age, sickness, bodily infirmity, imprisonment, military necessity, nonamenability to process, or other reasonable cause, is unable or refuses to appear and testify in person at the place of tidal or hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-15\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b590-16\">We find the military judge made an insufficient attempt to obtain KG\u2019s testimony. Furthermore, he abused his discretion in finding KG legally unavailable within the meaning of Mil. R. Evid. 804(a). Therefore, we need not enter the morass of case law interpreting the distinction between \u201ctestimonial\u201d and \u201cnontestimonial\u201d hearsay statements set forth by the <em>Crawford </em>Court, and we will \u201cleave for another day any effort to spell out a comprehensive definition of \u2018testimonial.\u2019\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 68, 124 S.Ct. 1354.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>Obtaining KG\u2019s physical presence at trial or determining her whereabouts was never an issue; the record <em>seems </em>to indicate trial counsel could locate her, and she was available when the government was preparing the court for closed-circuit testimony. The military judge at one point decided to require KG to testify via closed-circuit television. He also properly gave appellant the option to absent himself from the courtroom instead of having the child-victim testily via closed-circuit television.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> However, the military judge subsequently declined to order KG to testify by closed-circuit television \u201cover ... her mother\u2019s objection\u201d and \u201cas a matter of personal conscience.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The military judge appeared to fulfill physical unavailability using the standard for legal unavailability. While in some cases this may be accomplished, in appellant\u2019s case, the record is unclear upon which Mil. R. Evid. 804(a) provision the military judge based his finding of unavailability. Nevertheless, the government\u2019s stated basis for KG\u2019s unavailability was Mil. R. Evid. 804(a)(6). Specifically, trial counsel asserted that due to KG\u2019s <em>age: </em>\u201cshe\u2019s <em>simply unable </em>to testify;\u201d <em>did not understand </em>the nature of the proceedings (due to developmental delay), and therefore, could not be truthful;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> had <em>\u201clost </em>th[e] <em>information\u201d </em>in her original disclosure regarding appellant\u2019s acts, and \u201ccouldn\u2019t give that information on the stand even if she wanted to;\u201d and, <em>could not \u201cgive relevant and probative evidence\u201d </em>because she was <em>\u201cunwilling and unable to talk\u201d </em>about the offenses and because testifying would cause her <em>\u201cgreat harm.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">The military judge\u2019s additional comments and findings reflect that he found KG unavailable because: (1) her mother asserted KG was reluctant to talk; (2) KG would not provide useful information because she had not revealed any new information to Mr. Lehman (her counselor) or assistant trial counsel, and KG would \u201crepeat what she told her mother but without amplification;\u201d (3) \u201ccross-examin[ing KG] would not be productive or helpful;\u201d and, (4) her mother \u201cobjected]\u201d to KG testifying by closed-circuit television.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>The record does not support a finding of unavailability based on 804(a)(6) (as trial counsel requested) as set forth in Article 49(d)(2), UCMJ, that due to KG\u2019s \u201cage\u201d she was unable or refused to appear and testify. Although Mr. Lehman\u2019s testimony and Ms. Sievers\u2019 annotations on the forensic medical examination form support an assertion that KG may have been developmentally slow, no evidence exists that KG \u201cwas unable\u201d to appear and testify. In fact, KG told assistant defense counsel, \u201cDaddy had showed me his cooter on the couch.\u201d Assistant trial counsel told the military judge, \u201cI just interviewed [KG] the other day again\u201d and she remembered why she was testifying; KG stated it was \u201c[a]bout my dad\u2019s cooter.\u201d Although KG stopped and refused to elaborate during her discussions with counsel, this did not amount to a witness\u2019 inability or refusal to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">Additionally, as our superior court has noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-5\">We are mindful, as are several state jurisdictions, that a child may be found to be unavailable to testify if a psychiatrist or psychologist has determined that participation in a trial would be too traumatic for the child. Nothing in the record indicates, however, that any determination of this sort was ever made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-6\"><em>Ferdinand, </em>29 M.J. at 167 (internal footnote omitted). Testimony from Mr. Lehman merely supports that discussing the offenses would not be beneficial or helpful to KG, e.g., she may experience some behavioral problems as a result. However, Mr. Lehman, the licensed clinical social worker, told the military judge, if KG testified via closed-circuit television, he did not \u201cthink in the long run it would be detrimental.\u201d As for Mrs. Gardinier\u2019s testimony, a \u201cmilitary judge is hardly bound to accept a mother\u2019s unprofessional, lay opinion that requiring a child to testify at trial would so traumatize the child as to outweigh an accused\u2019s right to confrontation.\u201d <em>Ferdinand, </em>29 M.J. at 168. Nevertheless, the military judge did not include potential trauma to the victim as a basis for his finding of unavailability. <em>Cf. Contreras v. State, </em>910 So.2d 901, 903, 907 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2005) (finding, despite psychologist\u2019s opinion that child-victim \u201cwould suffer severe \u2018emotional and psychological harm\u2019\u201d if she testified at trial, unavailability based upon \u201cgeneralized harm\u201d does not satisfy physical availability requirement of Confrontation Clause).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">Although the government moved to find KG unavailable pursuant to Mil. R. Evid. 804(a)(6) due to her age, the military judge is not bound by counsel\u2019s assertions. As with objections, \u201c[t]o require counsel for either side to identify all available [bases] in support of his or her [argument] is unnecessary in a context where the military judge is presumed to know the law and follow it.\u201d <em>Datz, </em>61 M.J. at 42. Moreover, if the military judge made specific findings regarding unavailability\u2014pursuant to other provisions within Mil. R. Evid. 804 (other than the provision on which the government requested a finding of unavailability), but his findings were still supported by the facts and law\u2014 we would uphold that decision. Therefore, we will analyze KG\u2019s unavailability based on other applicable provisions within Mil. R. Evid. 804 (i.e., Mil. R. Evid.804(a)(2) (persistent refusal to testify despite judge\u2019s order to testify) and Mil. R. Evid. 804(a)(3) (lack of memory of subject matter)).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">Military Rule of Evidence 804(a)(2), authorizes a military judge to find a witness unavailable if a witness \u201cpersists in refusing to testify ... despite an order of the military judge to do so.\u201d We reiterate our sister court\u2019s position that a military judge must:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_q\">attempt to persuade a recalcitrant witness to answer questions rather than assume an initial refusal is final. Although the judge may, in some circumstances, lack contempt power, a thorough explanation of the impact of refusal to testify on the parties to the trial and the exercise of all the moral persuasion available to the court should be attempted before a witness is declared unavailable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-10\"><em>United States v.

Furthermore, when dealing with a child witness, the more cautious approach would be to determine that the child \u201cherself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>refused to testify.\u201d <em>See Ferdinand, </em>29 M.J. at 167 (stating that \u201c[a]t a minimum, there was no determination that [the seven-year-old victim] herself refused to testify\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">In appellant\u2019s case, after KG\u2019s mother stated she would not \u201callow\u201d KG to testify, the military judge\u2014without ordering KG to testify (as required by Mil.

While we agree that a mother\u2019s refusal to produce a child \"witness could be the basis for an unavailability determination under Mil. R. Evid. 804(a)(2), the military judge must fulfill the requirement of ordering her to produce the child prior to making that determination. \u201cA military judge is hardly exercising his contempt powers under Article 48, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 848, ... when he finds that any efforts to compel a mother to produce a child to testify would be \u2018futile\u2019 simply because she threatens to disobey his order before it is even issued.\u201d <em>Ferdinand, </em>29 M.J. at 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Military Rule of Evidence 804(a)(3) allows the military judge to find a witness \u201cfunctionally unavailable\u201d when a child <em>testifies </em>that he does not remember. <em>United States v. Martindale, </em>30 M.J. 172, 173 (C.M.A.1990). For example, the <em>Martindale </em>Court upheld the military judge\u2019s finding of unavailability when a twelve-year-old, emotionally and mentally disabled boy\u2014the victim of a sex offense\u2014was \u201cfunctionally unavailable\u201d based on his \u201cclaimed lack of memory and unwillingness to testify, as well as [the doctor\u2019s] testimony regarding the traumatic effect testifying would have on the child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 175. In appellant\u2019s case, KG never testified; others merely told the military judge she might not remember what her father did to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">The military judge in appellant\u2019s case had potential options under Mil. R. Evid. 804(a) that he could have used to find KG unavailable. However, he abused his discretion when he found the child-victim unavailable because: her mother said KG was \u201creluctant to talk;\u201d KG would not provide \u201cuseful information\u201d and would \u201crepeat what she told her mother;\u201d \u201ceross-examin[ing KG] would not be productive or helpful;\u201d and her mother \u201cobjected\u201d to KG testifying even by closed-circuit television. Furthermore, this court is unaware of any authority which permits a military judge to decline to order a witness to testify simply because he does not \u201cthink it\u2019s right\u201d or \u201cas a matter of personal conscience.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-11\">The military judge\u2019s determination that KG would not provide any \u201chelpful\u201d information alone does not provide a valid basis for a finding of unavailability. \u201c[T]he Confrontation Clause guarantees only \u2018an <em>opportunity </em>for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v.

Appellant\u2019s statements (which are corroborated by the many admissible statements of the victim and other witnesses) describe several incidents of sexual contact with KG. The military judge only convicted appellant of two\u2014specifically, committing an indecent act upon KG by placing his hands on her vagina with intent to gratify his sexual desires between on or about September 1999 and December 1999, and taking indecent liberties with KG by exposing himself, having her touch his penis, then shaking his own penis until he ejaculated, with intent to gratify his sexual desires, on or about 29 December 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The few statements KG made during her videotaped interview add nothing new to the evidence properly admitted at trial. KG\u2019s interview, at best, offers cumulative evidence already elicited from other witnesses and documentary evidence. Therefore, we find that even when the five-year-old victim\u2019s videotaped statement is excluded from the evidence, the other properly-admitted evidence proves the offenses and appellant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">Appellant\u2019s admissions and the additional evidence properly admitted at trial fully support appellant\u2019s conviction of the indecent acts offense. During his interview, appellant admitted to SA Phillips that when he bathed his daughter and touched his daughter\u2019s vagina, he got sexually aroused to the point that he got an erection. This, he asserts, occurred \u201ca couple of times\u201d or \u201cabout two times.\u201d Appellant told Detective Larsen, \u201cIf I thought of anything [while touching KG\u2019s vagina] ... maybe I thought, \u201cWow, my wife will be home soon, maybe we can go play,\u2019 \u201d referring to being sexually intimate with Mrs. Gardinier. In his subsequent written statements, appellant admitted he twice showered with KG on or after September 1999, \u201cunintentionally\u201d became aroused, and his penis was \u201chalfway erect\u201d when he washed her \u201cgroin\u201d or \u201cvaginal\u201d area. Mrs. Gardinier testified that after she returned home on 29 December 2001, KG came running up to her and told her mother \u201cthat her dad was laying naked.\u201d When she asked KG if anyone \u201ctouched her in her private part,\u201d KG \u201copened her underwear to the side,\u201d showed her mother her \u201cprivate areas,\u201d and said, \u201cDaddy does.\u201d Once appellant denied any inappropriate contact with his daughter, KG told her mother, \u201cDaddy\u2019s a liar,\u201d and that her father touched her \u201cevery time [her mother] left\u201d the house.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>Moreover, the additional evidence properly admitted at trial provides \u201cindependent evidence which establishes the trustworthiness of the confession.\u201d <em>United States v. Maio, </em>34 M.J. 215, 218 (C.M.A.1992). The corroborating evidence raises \u201can inference of truth as to the essential facts admitted in the confession.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations marks and footnote omitted); <em>see </em>Mil.

During his videotaped interview with SA Phillips, appellant admitted, \u201cShe has touched [my penis] ... on one other night[, other than on 29 December 2001] ... maybe a year or so ago.\u201d In his written statements, appellant asserts he was in his living room masturbating. He stated, \u201cI aroused myself\u2019 and \u201cejaculated on me.\u201d KG saw appellant \u201cas [he] was finishing,\u201d pointed to him, and commented that he was \u201cpeeing.\u201d Appellant admits KG \u201cprobably did see [him] ejaculate\u201d and \u201cprobably\u201d touched his penis. Despite this incident with his five-year-old daughter earlier in 2001 of which appellant was found not guilty,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> on 29 December 2001, when he had not finished putting on his pants and KG ran out and \u201cnoticed [him] still half-naked,\u201d appellant \u201csat down [and] she noticed [his] penis.\u201d KG \u201cjust reached out and touched it,\u201d and appellant became \u201csexually aroused after [KG] touched [his] penis.\u201d She touched his penis for \u201c1-2 seconds.\u201d Appellant further states his \u201chand went to [his] penis which ejaculated a little which she noticed,\u201d and \u201csome semen came out and was on the tip of [his] penis.\u201d When asked if he felt he had done anything wrong pertaining to the matters being investigated, appellant responded, \u2018Yes, I got caught in situations like that. I didn\u2019t plan for it to happen that way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">These admissions are also fully corroborated by the evidence properly admitted at trial. Specifically, the victim told Ms. Sievers that she \u201ctouched daddy\u2019s cooter\u201d and pointed to her genital area when referring to the cooter. KG also told Ms. Sievers \u201cher cooter was small, but sometimes she saw daddy\u2019s cooter get bigger.\u201d Ms. Sievers\u2019 notes on the forensic medical examination form indicate KG told her, \u201cDaddy was naked. I was going to tell mom. He was in Mommy\u2019s room. I was touching his \u2018cooter\u2019 with my hand.\u201d KG further told Mr. Lehman that \u201cDaddy made [her] touch his cooter.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> KG also told her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>mother \u201cthat her dad was laying naked;\u201d her father \u201ctouched her in her private part;\u201d and her father touched her \u201cevery time [her mother] left\u201d the house. Ms. Freeman\u2019s testimony regarding the pictures the victim drew of her \u201cdaddy\u2019s pee pee,\u201d and depicting \u201cdaddy laying on the bed naked [and] [m]om wearing underwear,\u201d further provides evidence that KG had inappropriate sexual knowledge for a five-year-old child. Consequently, in this judge-alone court-martial, we are confident the erroneous admission of KG\u2019s videotaped interview was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">We have considered appellant\u2019s other assignments of error, and those matters personally raised by appellant pursuant to <em>United States v.

We agree with the military judge\u2019s findings regarding KG\u2019s statements to her mother, and do not find the military judge abused his discretion. <em>See United States v.

We also find the military judge properly admitted KG\u2019s statements to Ms. Sievers and Mr. Lehman. These statements are admissible as hearsay exceptions pursuant to Mil. R. Evid. 803(4) (statements for medical diagnosis and treatment hearsay exception; <em>availability of de-clarant immaterial). </em>Military Rule of Evidence 803(4) reads, \"Statements made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment and describing] medical history, or past or present symptoms, pain, or sensation, or the inception or general character of the cause or external source thereof insofar as reasonably pertinent to diagnosis or treatment.\" The medical diagnosis or treatment exception is also a \"firmly rooted\" exception to the hearsay rule. <em>See White, </em>502 U.S. at 355 n. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>8, 112 S.Ct. 736.

Peneaux, </em>432 F.3d 882 (8th Cir.2005) (statements made by child not a victim to the charged offense to a doctor for the purpose of ensuring his own health and protection, presumptively nontestimonial); <em>State v.
