ZACHARY AGAINST A CHARGE OF INDECENT ACTS WITH A CHILD (ARTICLE 134, UCMJ), WHICH IS CONTRARY TO THE HOLDING OF <em>UNITED STATES V. STRODE, </em>43 M.J. 29 (C.A.A.F.1995).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">At its core, this certified issue asks us to determine whether an honest and reasonable mistake of fact as to the victim\u2019s age is an available defense to the crime of indecent acts with a child.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In a published opinion, the United States Army Court of Criminal Appeals concluded that it was.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Army court further concluded that Appellee\u2019s assertion, that he mistakenly believed the alleged victim was over seventeen years of age, set forth matter inconsistent with his guilty plea.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">We agree with the Army court both as to the application of the mistake of fact defense in this factual context and as to the impact of this legal conclusion on Appellee\u2019s case. We reaffirm our decision in <em>United States v. Strode,</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which held that the defense of mistake of fact is available to a military accused who is charged with committing indecent acts with a child.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We hold in this case that Appellee\u2019s statements as to the victim\u2019s age raised the possibility of a mistake of fact defense to the crime of indecent acts with a child and, thereby, rendered Ap-pellee\u2019s guilty plea to this offense improvident. We answer the certified question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-19\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b495-20\">At his general court-martial, Appellee pleaded guilty to two offenses arising from his <em>performing </em>oral sodomy on each of his victims. These offenses are punishable under Article 134, UCMJ.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The lower court\u2019s discussion of the facts states the circumstances of Appellee\u2019s offenses as they were developed in the context of Appellee\u2019s providence inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-21\">Appellant pled guilty to one specification of committing indecent acts with a child, [BA] and one specification of committing indecent acts with another, [RL]. During the providence inquiry, appellant testified under oath about the facts and circumstances of the offenses. Appellant explained that he was in a friend\u2019s room and the situation \u201cgot sexual in nature.\u201d He admitted that he performed oral sodomy on both BA and RL, while all three [Appellee in the action before this Court, BA, and RL] were present in the room; that he was not married <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>to either [BA or RL]; and that the acts were done with the intent to arouse the lust and sexual desires of BA. He also agreed that the acts were \u201copen and notorious\u201d because a third person was present; that the acts were indecent; and that they were prejudicial to good order and discipline and service discrediting.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">Appellee further asserted that both BA and RL told him they were seventeen years old, and that they were about to turn eighteen. In fact, at the time of the offenses, RL was seventeen years old, and BA was fourteen years old. Appellee also stated he did not discover BA\u2019s true age until a Criminal Investigation Division agent told him of this case two weeks later.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Because the certified issue relates only to Appellee\u2019s offense concerning his sexual involvement with BA, we focus on record references to Appellee\u2019s apparent belief that BA was seventeen when she was in fact only fourteen. Relevant discussion of this important factual matter occurred at two points during trial: during the providence inquiry and during sentencing.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">1. <em>The Providence Inquiry</em></p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Appellee and the military judge discussed Appellee\u2019s sexual conduct with BA (Specification 1):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-8\">MJ: Now, with respect to Specification 1; and [defense counsel], your theory of liability in pleading Sergeant Zachary guilty, is that the indecency is not connected to the age of [BA], but rather the fact that the oral sodomy was performed on her by the accused in the presence of a third party. Is that it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-9\">DC: That\u2019s correct, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-10\">MJ: So even though Sergeant Zachary may have been mistaken about [BA\u2019s] age, that mistake is not a defense to this offense, because the indecency, as well as the element of prejudicial conduct and service discrediting conduct, is tied to the nature of the act itself; that is, that the act of oral sodomy was open and notorious; that is, performed in the presence of a third party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"anp-dedup-0\">DC: That\u2019s correct, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-15\">MJ: Do you understand that, Sergeant Zachary?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-16\">ACC: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-17\">MJ: Is that your understanding, [trial counsel]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-18\">TC: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-19\">Later, the military judge reexamined the mistake of fact issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-20\">MJ: And I think we alluded to this briefly, [defense counsel], but you did have a chance to do your research into a mistake of fact defense on Specification 1, as it relates to the age of [BA]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-21\">DC: That\u2019s correct, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-22\">MJ: And are you satisfied that the mistake of fact defense does not exist in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-23\">DC: That\u2019s correct, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-24\">MJ: And you had a chance to discuss this in some detail with Sergeant Zachary?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-25\">DC: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-26\">MJ: And again, that\u2019s because the indecency is tied directly to the number of participants, rather than the age of the putative victim; correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-27\">DC: That\u2019s right, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-28\">Repeatedly throughout the providence inquiry, the prosecution, defense, military judge, and Appellee agreed that the criminality of the indecent acts with a child offense was rooted only in the fact that the events occurred \u201copenly and notoriously\u201d\u2014in the presence of a third party, RL. Therefore, everyone at trial failed to recognize that the victim\u2019s minor status was a separate and essential element of the crime.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The military judge accepted Appellee\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-29\">2. <em>Sentencing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b496-30\">During sentencing, Appellee presented an unsworn statement to the panel members. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Appellee explained that prior to the acts, both BA and RL told Appellee they were seventeen years old, and about to turn eighteen. Appellee further explained that at the time the incident occurred with BA and RL, he \u201cbelieved [he] was operating with consenting adults.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Appellee also stated he assumed BA and RL were at least seventeen years old. His assumption was based on his previous experience where a staff duty person at the front desk would check the identification cards of any person entering the post. Appellee stated that he thought minors were prohibited from entering the post at night because he believed that there was a Charge of Quarters present who followed identification check procedures. Appellee further explained that he had been at this post only two weeks at the time of the alleged offenses. He later learned that there was not a procedure to ensure that underage persons were prohibited from entering the post.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">During closing arguments at sentencing, the trial counsel characterized Appellee\u2019s mistaken belief regarding BA and RL\u2019s age as \u201ca boldfaced lie,\u201d and told the panel members that Appellee \u201cknew how old [BA] was.\u201d At the close of the proceedings, the panel members sentenced Appellee to a bad-conduct discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and reduction to E-l.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">In a thorough opinion tracing the history of Article 134, UCMJ, and relying on our opinion in <em>United States v. Strode,</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Army court held that the affirmative defense of mistake of fact is available for the offense of indecent acts with a child.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In response to the certified issue, we address this question: Whether an honest and reasonable mistake of fact as to the alleged victim\u2019s age is a mitigating factor relevant to the degree of Appellee\u2019s culpability, or rather is a valid defense, because it negates an element of the Article 134, UCMJ, offense of indecent acts with a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-14\">The Army court held the answer was the latter.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We agree. We embrace not only the conclusion of the lower court but also its excellent analysis explaining the law of mistake of fact as it applies to the crime of indecent acts with a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-15\">1. <em>Article 131, UCMJ, and the Applicability of the Mistake of Fact Defense</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-16\">In analyzing offenses charged under the general article, Article 134, UCMJ, we look at both the statute and the President\u2019s explanation in <em>MCM </em>pt. IV, para. 87 to determine the elements of the offense. With respect to the alleged offense with BA, the Government charged Appellee with indecent acts with a child under Article 134, UCMJ. The statutory elements of Article 134, UCMJ are: (1) that the accused did or failed to do certain acts; and (2) that, under the circumstances, the accused\u2019s conduct was to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces or was of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The President has identified the offense of indecent acts with a child as a specific offense under Article 134, UCMJ, and set forth the following elements for this offense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-17\">(a) That the accused committed a certain act upon or with the body of a certain person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-18\">(b) <em>That the person was under 16 years of age and not the spouse of the accused;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-19\">(c) That the act of the accused was indecent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-20\">(d) That the accused committed the act with intent to arouse, appeal to, or gratify the lust, passions, or sexual desires of the accused, the victim, or both; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-21\">(e) That, under the circumstances, the conduct of the accused was to the preju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>dice of good order and discipline in the armed forces or was of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">As to possible defenses to this offense, we note that the President\u2019s discussion directly excludes only one recognized defense\u2014consent. The explanation states simply, \u201cConsent: Lack of consent by the child to the act or conduct is not essential to this offense; <em>consent is not a defense.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">It is a basic principle of criminal law that an honest and reasonable mistake of fact can negate the mens rea requirement to a general intent crime.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Incorporating this concept into military law, the President in the <em>MCM </em>has specifically stated that mistake of fact is a defense where, if the circumstances were as the accused believed them to be, \u201cthe accused would not be guilty of the offense.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We agree with the Army court\u2019s well-reasoned conclusion that neither the President nor Congress intended age to be a strict liability element as to the crime of indecent acts with a child.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">2. <em>United States v. Strode</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Indeed, this Court addressed the applicability of the mistake of fact defense under factually similar circumstances in <em>United States v. Strode.</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>Strode </em>we expressly stated, \u201cMistake of fact is available to a military accused who is charged with committing indecent acts with a child under the age of 16 if he had an honest and reasonable belief as to the age of the person <em>and </em>if the acts would otherwise be lawful were the prosecutrix age 16 or older.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The lower court identified and properly relied on the authority of <em>Strode </em>and concluded that the mistake of fact defense applied in the present case.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-17\">We note that in 1995, when we decided <em>Strode, </em>the mistake of fact of age defense was not available to the strict liability offenses of carnal knowledge and sodomy.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Soon after <em>Strode, </em>however, this law changed. In 1996, Congress amended Article 120(b), UCMJ,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> the carnal knowledge statute, to recognize a mistake of fact defense by a military member who reasonably believed the victim had attained the age of sixteen and the victim was, in fact, at least twelve years old.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The practical effect of this amendment is that mistake of fact as to age is now a clearly delineated defense for the crimes of sodomy and carnal knowledge.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>We view these legal developments after <em>Strode </em>as buttressing our conclusion and holding in that case.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Again we agree with the reasoning of the lower court that it is illogical and unjust to recognize mistake of fact as to the alleged victim\u2019s age as a complete defense to a carnal knowledge offense under Article 120(d), UCMJ, but not to recognize the same defense to the lesser included offense of indecent acts with a child.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">3. <em>The Government\u2019s Assertions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">The Government\u2019s basic argument challenging the Army court\u2019s holding is that, because the indecency of the act against BA is tied to the \u201copen and notorious\u201d nature of the act rather than to BA\u2019s minor status, the mistake of fact of age defense is not available.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">The Government makes two main points in support of this assertion. First, the Government argues that for the purposes of proving the elements of indecent acts with a child, the mistaken belief that the victim was over sixteen years old is only relevant in extenuation and mitigation. We disagree. The Army court properly concluded that the minor status of the victim is an element of the offense of indecent acts with a child. There is nothing in the plain language of the article setting out the offense of indecent acts with a child or the <em>MCM </em>explanation of this offense indicating that the minor status of the victim is merely an aggravating factor in determining the degree of Appellee\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">The Government\u2019s second point is that the Army court\u2019s holding violates this Court\u2019s narrow holding in <em>Strode.</em><footnotemark><em>31</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Specifically, the Government states that the lower court erred in interpreting the language of <em>Strode </em>to allow for the \u201cmistake of fact\u201d defense in cases where the indecency is based on something other than the victim\u2019s age. The flaw in this argument is that it focuses only on the element that the act of the accused was indecent, and it fails to take into account that the prosecution also must prove the additional element of the charged offense that the victim was under the age of sixteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-12\">We acknowledge that, as developed in the providence inquiry, the indecency in the present case was based only on the fact that Appellee\u2019s alleged sexual contact with BA was in the presence of RL. Specifically, during the providence inquiry, the military judge elicited multiple concessions on the record by Appellee and both counsel that the indecency was tied to the contemporaneous presence of the second victim, RL, rather than to the age of the putative victim, BA. Moreover, both trial and defense counsel reaffirmed this point on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-13\">Therefore, in this particular case, the age of the child was not a fact necessary to establish the indecency of Appellee\u2019s acts with BA. We observe that the additional fact of the presence of RL establishes only the offense of indecent acts with another, assuming other elements of the offense are established in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-14\">To prove the more serious offense of indecent acts with a child, the Government must also prove the additional fact and element that the child was under the age of sixteen.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The Government\u2019s argument on appeal repeats the military judge\u2019s error in concluding that a mistake of fact defense as to the age of the child was not available because the Ap-pellee\u2019s conduct was otherwise indecent. The fundamental error in the Government\u2019s argument is the assumption that because the presence of the third party would support the element of indecency, the mistake of fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>as to the age of the victim would not be available as a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Because the age of the victim remained a separate element of the charged offense of indecent acts with a child, mistake of fact remained a possible defense. We agree with the lower court that a mistake of fact defense is available as to the offense of indecent acts with a child regardless of whether other facts may establish indecency.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we agree with the Army court that the minor status of the victim is an element of the offense of indecent acts with a child, not an aggravating factor.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> We hold the Army court correctly applied our decision in <em>Strode </em>to conclude that an honest and reasonable mistake of fact defense as to the victim\u2019s age under Article 134, UCMJ, does not fall away simply because the act is indecent for reasons other than the victim\u2019s minor status.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">4. <em>Providence of the Guilty Plea</em></p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">A guilty plea is set aside upon a showing that a \u201csubstantial basis in law and fact for questioning the guilty plea\u201d exists.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> This Court has held that a military judge has a duty under Article 45, UCMJ,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> to explain to the accused the defenses that an accused raises during a providence inquiry.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> \u201cArticle 45(a) requires that, in a guilty-plea case, inconsistencies and apparent defenses must be resolved by the military judge or the guilty pleas must be rejected.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Where an accused is misinformed as to possible defenses, a guilty plea must be set aside.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-16\">When Appellee raised on the record the possibility that he had an honest and reasonable mistake as to BA\u2019s age, he set up matter inconsistent with his guilty plea.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The military judge erred in accepting the guilty plea to indecent acts with a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-17\">However, the lower court correctly concluded \u201cthat appellant\u2019s statements during the providence inquiry adequately support a finding of guilty to the lesser included offense of indecent acts with another, in violation of Article 134, UCMJ.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Accordingly, the lower court properly affirmed a modified guilty finding and properly reassessed the sentence.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-18\">\n<em>DECISION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b500-19\">The certified question is answered in the negative and the decision of the United States Army Court of Criminal Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b495-10\">. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 867(a)(2) (2000).
