At trial, appellant informed the military judge that his name in Portuguese is written as \"Wagner de Paul Dacosta,\u201d and his middle name is therefore \"Paul.\" The word \"de\" in Portuguese is synonymous with the English word \"of.\u201d The military judge and counsel discussed the charge sheet, the flyer, and the findings worksheet and appropriate changes were made on each to reflect appellant's middle initial as \"P.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b623-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"AiU\">SCHENCK, Senior Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">A general court-martial composed of officer and enlisted members convicted appellant, contrary to his pleas, of rape and unlawful entry, in violation of Articles 120 and 134, Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 920 and 934 [hereinafter UCMJ]. The convening authority approved the adjudged sentence to a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for eighteen months, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and reduction to Private El.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">This ease is before the court for review pursuant to Article 66, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 866. Appellant asserts two assignments of error; one merits discussion but no relief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, appellant contends the military judge erred when she instructed the panel members, over defense objection, regarding evidence of an uncharged sexual assault admitted pursuant to Military Rule of Evidence [hereinafter Mil. R. Evid.] 413 (\u201cEvidence of similar crimes in sexual assault cases\u201d). After considering the record as a whole, including the pleadings of the parties, and appellate counsel\u2019s oral argument,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we disagree with appellant\u2019s assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">Appellant was charged with burglary\u2014for breaking into and entering the barracks room of SPC L in the nighttime with the intent to commit rape therein\u2014and the rape of SPC L on or about 20 April 2002. The panel convicted appellant by exceptions of unlawful entry and rape on or about 20 April 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">Prior to trial on the merits, trial defense counsel moved to admit \u201cprior sexually suggestive encounters by the alleged victim\u201d pursuant to Mil. R. Evid. 412 (\u201cNonconsen-sual sexual offenses; relevance of victim\u2019s behavior or sexual predisposition\u201d). In response, trial counsel concurred with the admissibility of the subject matter in paragraph 2b. of the defense motion, which states, \u201cSPC [L] and SPC Dacosta have previously spent at least one night together and slept in the same bed.\u201d Pursuant to Mil. R. Evid. 413, trial counsel provided notice to the defense that the government intended to present evidence regarding this incident at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-12\">As part of her findings of fact on the motion, the military judge found appellant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aql-dedup-0\">spent at least one night in [SPC L\u2019s] bed in her barracks room, during which time he sexually touched her and put her hand on his penis, but during which time they did not engage in sexual intercourse. This one time occurred in January 2002, on a weekend, but the exact date is not known. There may be evidence of other nights that [appellant] slept in [SPC L\u2019s] room in her bed during which there was never sexual intercourse between the two.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-13\">The military judge concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AmW\">evidence that the accused slept in [SPC L\u2019s] bed on at least one occasion and perhaps more between January and April 2002 is also admissible. The evidence that the accused engaged in sexual acts and/or assaults on at least one occasion while lying in [SPC L\u2019s] bed is admissible under [Mil. R. Evid.] 413. Further, to the extent that there may be evidence that those acts were consensual, they are admissible under [Mil. R. Evid.] 412(b)(1)(B). Both the prosecution and defense are permitted to question [SPC L] regarding that incident or those incidents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>Specialist L\u2019s testimony on the merits was consistent with the description set forth in the military judge\u2019s findings on the motion regarding this evidence. Specifically, prior to the night of the charged offenses, appellant slept with SPC L in her twin bed in her barracks room when her roommate was not present. During the second evening appellant stayed over, SPC L woke up with appellant \u201cfeeling all over [her].\u201d Appellant tried to \u201cget into [her] bra\u201d and \u201cpull down [her] underwear\u201d and she would \u201cjust roll over and pull them back up.\u201d Specialist L testified that she pretended to be sleeping and appellant took \u201chis penis out\u201d and \u201ctried to make [her] touch it and [she] pulled [her] hand away.\u201d She stated, \u201c[H]e then got on top of me and proceeded to try to have sex with me through my clothes. That\u2019s when I pushed him all the way off and I just went back to sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">Subsequently, during a hearing pursuant to Article 39(a), UCMJ, (without panel members present) regarding potential panel instructions, the following colloquy ensued between the military judge and assistant defense counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-5\">MJ: All right. And, similarly, on the uncharged misconduct instruction regarding the evidence regarding the indecent assault that may or may not have occurred one night when [appellant] spent the night in [SPC L\u2019s] room prior to the 20th, do you want me to instruct on that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-6\">ADC: No, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-7\">MJ: All right. I will instruct on the past sexual behavior of a non-consensual sex victim, and I will give the spillover instruction. Although, I have to look at that, because given that you\u2019ve charged entry at night with the intent to commit rape, it may be that the spillover instruction is not applicable here. I\u2019ll take a look at that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">After recessing the proceedings for the evening and during another Article 39(a) hearing the next morning, the military judge stated, \u201c[U]pon research I\u2019ve determined that [the uncharged sexual misconduct instruction] should be given if raised by the evidence, and in this case, it has indeed been raised by the evidence, and so I intend to mention it briefly in my instructions.\u201d Counsel concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">The military judge then instructed the panel members regarding the January 2002 uncharged sexual assault as part of her instruction on: (1) mistake of fact, and (2) the similar, uncharged sexual assault evidence (Mil. R. Evid.413). The military judge told the panel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-11\">In deciding whether the accused was under the mistaken belief that [SPC L] consented ... you should also consider the accused\u2019s prior contact with [SPC L], the nature of any conversations between the accused and [SPC L], the fact that they had a consensual kiss approximately 3 months before the alleged incident which is the subject of these charges, the fact that during January 2002, the accused apparently slept in [SPC L]\u2019s room, but that no sexual intercourse occurred on those occasions, and any other evidence you recall bearing on the issue of whether the accused had an honest and reasonable belief that on 20 April 2002, [SPC L] was consenting to the act of sexual intercourse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-12\">You have heard evidence that the accused may have previously committed another uncharged offense of sexual assault when he slept overnight in [SPC L]\u2019s bed during January 2002. You may consider the evidence of such other act of sexual assault for its tendency, if any, to show the accused\u2019s propensity to engage in sexual assault, as well as its tendency, if any, to identify the accused as the person who committed the offenses alleged, to prove a plan or design of the accused to have sexual intercourse with [SPC L], to prove knowledge on the part of the accused that [SPC L] did not consent to sexual acts, or to prove that the accused intended to have sexual intercourse by force and without consent at the time that he entered [SPC L]\u2019s room.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-13\">You may not, however, convict the accused merely because you believe he committed this other offense or merely because you believe he has a propensity to engage in sexual assault. The prosecution\u2019s burden of proof to establish the ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>cused\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt remains as to each and every element of each offense charged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">After the military judge charged the panel members, the members heard counsel\u2019s argument on the merits. Because the government declined to argue first and chose only to close, trial defense counsel argued first and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-6\">Specialist [L] told you yesterday that on a previous occasion when [appellant] spent the night, as they had done in the past, in a room that was usually occupied by two people, but it\u2019s the weekend, the roommate, [SPC A], is out of town. \u201cHey, why not come over? Let\u2019s watch a movie. Let\u2019s hang out.\u201d She tells you here yesterday that she was shocked to find [appellant] touching her. The fact is she enjoyed it. When the panties came down, she was rolling\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-7\">When the panties came down, she would pull them back up. She would roll back and forth, all while awake and very well aware of what was going on. Hey, they were lying in the same bed in an empty room together. [Appellant] could have slept in the other bed. Specialist [A] wasn\u2019t there. No, they spent the night in that same little twin bed together. And when she felt him touching her breasts, kissing her face, she\u2019s claiming that she didn\u2019t move her lips, touching her, even moving her hand toward his penis, she just acted like her hand was limp. She didn\u2019t get out of bed and say, \u201cOh, stop. What are you doing? This is crazy.\u201d She just laid there and went along with it. And she told you she was awake. She knew what was going on. And when she didn\u2019t feel like it anymore, what did she do? She took that blanket and she put it in-between the two of them. That\u2019s how she ended that and then they went back to sleep, still in the same bed, twin bed. That sounds like making out to me. Like I asked, why didn\u2019t she make him sleep in that other bed? Why didn\u2019t she kick him out?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">Trial counsel argued after the defense and did not discuss, or allude to, any prior sexual assault committed by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">We agree with appellate counsel that we review a military judge\u2019s non-mandatory panel instruction for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Forbes, </em>61 M.J. 354, 358 (C.A.A.F.2005). Essentially, our court cannot set aside a judicial action taken in a discretionary matter unless we have \u201ca definite and firm conviction that the [military judge] committed a clear error of judgment in the conclusion [she] reached upon a weighing of the relevant factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Houser, </em>36 M.J. 392, 397 (C.M.A.1993). Furthermore, in our abuse-of-discretion review we must consider that a military judge \u201c \u2018has a range of choice, and that [her] decision will not be disturbed <em>as long as it stays within that range </em>and is not influenced by any mistake of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Dockery, </em>955 F.2d 50, 54 (D.C.Cir.1992) (quoting <em>Kern v. TXO Production Corp., </em>738 F.2d 968, 970 (8th Cir.1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-11\">If we find the military judge abused her discretion by providing a limiting instruction, we may affirm the findings of guilty if we determine the error was harmless. <em>See </em>UCMJ art. 59(a), 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 859(a). However, if we find error of a Constitutional dimension, we may only affirm the findings of guilty if we determine the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967) (holding that before a Constitutional error can be held harmless, an appellate court must find the error was \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d); <em>United States v. Kreutzer, </em>61 M.J. 293, 298-99 (C.A.A.F.2005). To find instructional error of a Constitutional dimension, our court would have to find \u201c \u2018a reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the challenged instruction in a way1 that violates the Constitution.\u201d <em>Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 72, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991) (quoting <em>Boyde v. California, </em>494 U.S. 370, 380, 110 S.Ct. 1190, 108 L.Ed.2d 316 (1990)). Nevertheless, we will review a particular panel instruction not in isolation, but within the context of the other instructions given as a whole, and \u201cin the context of the overall charge[s].\u201d <em>United States v. Dixon, </em>201 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>1223, 1230 (9th Cir.2000) (citing <em>United States v. Harrison, </em>34 F.3d 886, 889 (9th Cir.1994)). In evaluating nonconstitutional harmless error, we must determine \u201cwhether the instructional error had \u2018substantial influence\u2019 on the findings.\u201d <em>United States v. Gibson, </em>58 M.J. 1, 7 (C.A.A.F.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">In sexual assault cases, Mil. R. Evid. 413(a) allows evidence of similar sexual assault crimes to be \u201cconsidered for its bearing on any matter to which it is relevant.\u201d As reflected in the legislative history of Mil. R. Evid. 413, Congress clearly created an exception to Mil. R. Evid. 404(b)\u2019s<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cprohibition against the use of a defendant\u2019s propensity to commit crimes ... subject to Rule 403 [ (\u2018Exclusion of relevant evidence on grounds of prejudice, confusion, or waste of time\u2019)].\u201d <em>United States v. Wright, </em>53 M.J. 476, 480 (C.A.A.F.2000). In particular, panel members may consider such evidence for its bearing on the accused\u2019s \u201cpropensity to commit sexual assault ... and [during their] assessment of the probability or improbability that the [accused] has been falsely or mistakenly accused of such an offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 140 Cong. Rec. H8991 (daily ed. Aug. 21, 1994) (statement of Rep. Susan Molinari)). Furthermore, \u201c[t]he presumption is in favor of admission.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The military judge must make three threshold findings before admitting Rule 413 evidence. She must find: (1) the accused is charged with a sexual assault offense under Mil. R. Evid. 413(a); (2) the evidence involves the accused\u2019s commission of another sexual assault offense; and (3) the evidence is relevant. <em>Wright, </em>53 M.J. at 482 (citing <em>United States v. Guardia, </em>135 F.3d 1326, 1328 (10th Cir.1998)). The military judge must also conduct a Mil. R. Evid. 403 balancing test, and should consider the following, inexhaustive list of factors: (1) the \u201c[strength of proof of prior act\u2014conviction versus gossip;\u201d (2) the \u201cprobative weight of evidence;\u201d (3) \u201cpotential for less prejudicial evidence;\u201d (4) \u201cdistraction of factfinder;\u201d (5) \u201ctime needed for proof of prior conduct;\u201d (6) \u201ctemporal proximity\u201d to the charged offense; (7) \u201cfrequency of the acts;\u201d (8) \u201cintervening circumstances\u201d or lack thereof; and (9) \u201crelationship between the parties.\u201d <em>Wright, </em>53 M.J. at 482 (citing <em>Guardia, </em>135 F.3d at 1331; <em>United States v. Enjady, </em>134 F.3d 1427, 1433 (10th Cir.1998), <em>cert. denied, </em>525 U.S. 887, 119 S.Ct. 202, 142 L.Ed.2d 165 (1998)).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">As our superior court has stated, rules regarding admissibility of Rule 413 evidence contain prophylactic procedures to provide for the accused\u2019s protection. Specifically, protection is provided by the following: (1) the military judge must apply the Rule 403 balancing test prior to admitting such evidence; (2) Rule 413 limits the \u201cuncharged misconduct to serious offenses\u201d as defined in Rule 413(d)(l)-(5); (3) Rule 401 (\u201cDefinition of \u2018relevant evidence\u2019 \u201d) and Rule 402 (\u201cRelevant evidence generality] admissible; irrelevant evidence inadmissible\u201d) relevancy requirements must be met and the military judge must enforce them through Rule 104(b) (\u201cPreliminary questions ... <em>Relevancy conditioned on fact\u201d); </em>(4) the military judge must conclude the panel \u201ccould find by [a] preponderance of the evidence\u201d that the Rule 413 offenses occurred; and (5) the Rule 413(b) notice requirement ensures admitting the evidence \u201cdoes not threaten the presumption of innocence\u201d because it allows an accused time and the opportunity to gather, prepare, and present evidence on the merits or in rebuttal. <em>Wright, </em>53 M.J. at 483 (holding Rule 413 is Constitutional).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">With those predicate safeguards in place, once a military judge property admits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>Rule 413 evidence of other sexual assaults, she should provide panel members with findings instructions to guide them regarding the issues in the case, and explain legal standards and procedural requirements which members must use to determine findings. <em>See </em>Rule for Courts-Martial [hereinafter R.C.M.] 920(a) discussion. Rule for Courts-Martial 920(e)(7) authorizes the military-judge to present the panel with \u201cexplanations, descriptions, or directions as may be necessary and which are properly requested by a party or which the military judge determines, <em>sua sponte, </em>should be given.\u201d The discussion to that Rule also provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-5\">[t]he military judge may summarize and comment upon evidence in the case in instructions. In doing so, the military judge should present an accurate, fair, and dispassionate statement of what the evidence shows; not depart from an impartial role; not assume as true the existence or nonexistence of a fact in issue when the evidence is conflicting or disputed, or when there is no evidence to support the matter; and make clear that the members must exercise their independent judgment as to the facts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">R.C.M. 920(e) discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Military Rule of Evidence 105 (\u201cLimited admissibility\u201d) further states the military judge will, upon request, limit the use of evidence to its proper scope and shall instruct the panel accordingly. Moreover, if counsel at trial do not object to, or make a request for, an instruction, we will provide relief only upon finding plain error. <em>See United States v. Brewer, </em>61 M.J. 425, 430 (C.A.A.F.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">Appellant\u2019s case involves a military judge not only providing a <em>limiting </em>instruction sua sponte over defense objection,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but, also, informing panel members as to <em>appropriate uses </em>of Rule 413 evidence. Appellate defense counsel concede, <em>\u201c[I]f </em>the [Mil. R. Evid.] 413 instruction was warranted, then the correct instruction was given.\u201d They, however, contend the military judge erred by instructing the panel members because \u201cthe instruction was not warranted under the facts of this case.\u201d Moreover, without a request from trial counsel or argument regarding \u201cpropensity,\u201d the military judge sua sponte informed panel members they could use the evidence of the prior sexual assault:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVL\">for its tendency, if any, to show the accused\u2019s <em>propensity </em>to engage in sexual assault ... to <em>identify </em>the accused as the person who committed the offenses alleged, to prove a <em>plan or design </em>of the accused to have sexual intercourse with [SPC L], to prove <em>knowledge </em>on the part of the accused that [SPC L] did not consent to sexual acts, or to prove that the accused <em>intended </em>to have sexual intercourse by force and without consent at the time that he entered [SPC L]\u2019s room.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-12\">(emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b627-13\">Additionally, appellate counsel agree, no issue exists regarding the description of the prior sexual assault or its admissibility as evidence pursuant to Rule 413. Furthermore, the parties do not challenge the military judge\u2019s findings of law and fact on the defense motion <em>in limine. </em>The parties at trial agreed panel members should hear the evidence of the prior sexual assault; neither party contested at trial, or now disputes, this incident occurred as the victim described.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-14\">We disagree with appellate defense counsel\u2019s assertion that the military judge\u2019s mere mention that Rule 413 evidence could be used to show appellant\u2019s \u201cpropensity to engage in sexual assault\u201d rises to an abuse of discretion. The use of Mil. R. Evid. 413 evidence is set forth in the Rule itself and clarified by ease law and legislative history.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The military judge in appellant\u2019s case informed the panel members of those proper uses for the evidence admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-15\">A military judge\u2019s decision to provide panel instructions regarding evidentiary matters is somewhat different than her sua sponte duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>to advise panel members regarding affirmative defenses.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Military Rule of Evidence 105 states the military judge will limit use of evidence and provide instructions <em>upon request; </em>thus, placing the responsibility on counsel to request the military judge give evidentiary instructions to the panel. <em>See </em>Stephen A. Saltzburg et al., Military Rules of Evidence Manual 1-120 (5th ed.2003) (suggesting Mil. R. Evid. 103(a) further requires counsel to specify the limiting instructions they request).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Nevertheless, our superior court\u2019s jurisprudence places a sua sponte duty on the military judge to provide limiting instructions to court members regarding uncharged misconduct evidence admitted pursuant to Mil. R. Evid. 404(b) when such evidence lacks a nexus in time and place to the offenses charged. <em>See United States v. Thompson, </em>30 M.J. 99, 101-02 (C.M.A.1990) (advocating instruction to preempt prejudice where nexus lacking); <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>11 M.J. 388, 392 (C.M.A.1981) (noting obligation to give instruction where nexus lacking); <em>United States v. James, </em>5 M.J. 382, 383 (C.M.A.1978) (instruction required absent \u201cimmediate relation\u201d to charged offenses); <em>see also United States v. Anderson, </em>36 M.J. 963, 982 (A.F.C.M.R.1993) (requiring limiting instruction absent nexus).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">No such sua sponte duty has been specifically established for Mil. R. Evid. 413 evidence. Because Rule 413 is a Congressionally-authorized, broad <em>exception </em>to Rule 404(b)\u2019s prohibition against the use of propensity evidence \u201cto show action in conformity therewith,\u201d we will not adopt the Rule 404(b) uncharged misconduct nexus test.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Although evidence admitted under Rule 413 is also in the nature of uncharged misconduct, it comprises \u201coffenses of sexual assault\u201d as that term is defined in Mil. R. Evid. 413(d)(l)-(5). Unlike Rule 404(b) evidence, Rule 413 \u201cspecifically allows court members to use the extrinsic misconduct as evidence of the accused\u2019s propensity to commit the charged sexual assault.\u201d Saltzburg et al., <em>supra, </em>at 4-205; <em>see Wright, </em>53 M.J. at 480. Furthermore, Rule 413 evidence \u201cmay be considered for its bearing on <em>any matter to which it is relevant.\u201d </em>Mil. R. Evid. 413(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">Today, we place a limited sua sponte duty on military judges when Rule 413 evidence is admitted. Without guidance regarding the proper use of Rule 413 evidence of other sexual assaults, panel members would be left to guess how that evidence should impact their decision regarding findings on the offenses charged. Moreover, a misunderstanding of the appropriate use of that evidence may create error when none may otherwise exist.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> An appellate court would also be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>unable to determine upon which evidence (e.g., \u201cpropensity\u201d) a panel based its findings of guilty. We find the duty to provide this guidance is included in the role of a military judge who \u201cis more than a mere referee, and as such [she] is required to assure that the accused receives a fair trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Graves, </em>1 M.J. 50, 53 (C.M.A.1975); <em>see </em>R.C.M. 801 (military judge\u2019s responsibilities).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Therefore, for all cases tried on or after ninety days from the date of this opinion, where a military judge properly admits Mil. R. Evid. 413 evidence, she shall inform panel members of the following: (1) the accused is not charged with this other sexual assault offense; (2) the Rule 413 evidence should have no bearing on their deliberations unless they determine the other offense occurred; <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (3) if they make that determination, they may consider the evidence for its bearing on any matter to which it is relevant in relation to* the sexual assault offenses charged; (4) the Rule 413 evidence has no bearing on any other offense charged; (5) they may not convict the accused solely because they may believe the accused committed other sexual assault offenses or has a propensity or predisposition to commit sexual assault offenses; (6) they may not use Rule 413 evidence as substitute evidence to support findings of guilty or to overcome a failure of proof in the government\u2019s case, if any; (7) each offense must stand on its own and they must keep the evidence of each offense separate; and (8) the burden is on the prosecution to prove the accused\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt as to each and every element of the offenses charged.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">We further hold that military judges should not unnecessarily highlight to panel members\u2014absent a specific request from counsel\u2014that Rule 413 evidence may be properly used to show a \u201cpropensity to engage in sexual assault.\u201d However, the military judge\u2019s instruction in this case does not rise to the level of an abuse of discretion; she accurately, fairly, and dispassionately described the evidence and its uses while remaining impartial. <em>See </em>R.C.M. 920(e) discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">Even if the military judge abused her discretion by instructing members on the uses of Rule 413 evidence, any resulting error was nonconstitutional and harmless because it did not have a substantial influence on the findings. <em>See Gibson, </em>58 M.J. at 7. The government\u2019s case was strong even absent evidence of the prior sexual assault. Specialist L testified that when she awoke, appellant was on top of her and \u201cinside\u201d her; she \u201cfelt his penis inside [her] vagina\u201d and \u201cit hurt [her] vagina ... really bad.\u201d Specialist CH and SPC BH testified that SPC L told them about this incident the night after it happened. Furthermore, appellant admitted in a sworn statement he did not know if he had sex with SPC L, \u201cbut [they] must have if she said [they] did.\u201d Appellant also admitted he thought he had sex with SPC L \u201cbecause [he did not] think she would make this up.\u201d Specialist BH testified that appellant \u201cdidn\u2019t outright say\u201d he had sex with SPC L, but while in SPC BH\u2019s room, appellant told SPC L \u201cthat they could go to the clinic and get tested for [sexually transmitted diseases] the next week.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-11\">Furthermore, the Rule 413 prior sexual assault evidence at issue consisted of SPC L\u2019s apparently unemotional description of appellant\u2019s acts comprising only fourteen lines in the trial transcript. The defense exploited this evidence to its own advantage to attack SPC L\u2019s credibility on cross-examination. Moreover, the government did not mention the prior sexual assault evidence in its opening statement or closing argument on findings. The military judge provided a perfectly correct statement of the law, her instruction did not rise to an abuse of discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>tion, and if her instruction was erroneous, the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">We have reviewed the matters personally raised by appellant under <em>United States v. Grostefon, </em>12 M.J. 431 (C.M.A.1982), and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The findings of guilty and the sentence are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Senior Judge JOHNSON and Judge WALBURN concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">In a contested case with panel members in which the accused is charged with a sexual assault offense and evidence of the accused\u2019s commission of other sexual assault offenses is properly admitted under Military Rule of Evidence 413 prior to findings\u2014as an exception to the general rule excluding such evidence\u2014the military judge should give appropriately tailored instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">(NOTE: Those portions in bold lettering are required instructions when such evidence is admitted into evidence. The other portions are discretionary instructions and should be given when requested by counsel and when otherwise raised by the evidence.)</p>\n<p id=\"b630-11\">You have heard evidence concerning allegations that the accused may have committed (another) (other) uncharged offense(s) of sexual assault. The accused is not charged with (this) (these) other offense(s) involving (this) (these) individual(s). This evidence should have no bearing on your deliberations unless you determine (this) (these) event(s) occurred. If you determine by a preponderance of the evidence that the other uncharged offense(s) occurred, you may consider the evidence for its bearing on any matter to which it is relevant in relation to the _ charged offense(s). (It has no bearing on any of the other offenses charged.)</p>\n<p id=\"b630-14\">You may also consider the evidence of such other act(s) of sexual assault for (its) (their) tendency, if any, to show the accused\u2019s propensity to engage in sexual assault, as well as (its) (their) tendency, if any, to (-):</p>\n<p id=\"b630-17\">(NOTE: The military judge should only include the following additional factors when requested by counsel and when they are supported by the evidence and facts in the case at bar.

In other words, you cannot use this evidence to overcome a failure of proof in the government\u2019s case, if you perceive any to exist, as the accused may be convicted of an offense only if you are satisfied the government has proven every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>element of each charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Each offense must stand on its own and you must keep the evidence of each offense separate. The burden is on the prosecution to prove the accused\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt as to each and every element of (each) (the) offense(s) charged.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b623-10\">.
