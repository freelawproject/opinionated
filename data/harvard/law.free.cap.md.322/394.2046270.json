The stop led to his arrest. The arrest led to a search of his person and car. The search led to the recovery of contraband in his possession. The contraband in his possession led to his conviction at a court trial in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. The conviction led to the imposi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>tion of a sentence of imprisonment for a term of ten years.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Benbow attempted to interrupt the domino effect of the stop at the point of his arrest. He claimed that his warrant-less arrest was illegal and, therefore, the searches and seizures of the contraband were unreasonable, offending the constitutional guarantees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He filed a motion to suppress the evidence seized by the police. We look to the hearing on the motion for the details of how the stop for speeding burgeoned into a ten year term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Maryland State Police Trooper Kevin Welkner testified that on 26 November 1988, he \u201cwas working radar assignment on [route] 795 southbound ... just south of McDonogh Road\u201d in Baltimore County. He stopped a black BMW car which was going 93 miles an hour in a 55 miles-an-hour zone. Welkner informed the driver why he was stopped and asked for the driver\u2019s operator\u2019s license and registration card. The driver said that he did not have his operator\u2019s license with him.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At Welkner\u2019s request, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>driver accompanied Welkner to the trooper\u2019s car so the trooper could obtain further information and run <em>\u201ca </em>license check.\u201d The driver \u201cidentified himself as Reginald Gregory Benbow\u201d and supplied his date of birth. Welkner \u201cran a check on him through Maryland and Virginia\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> by the name and date of birth the driver gave. \u201cAt that time it was indicated that he was suspended in Virginia.\u201d Welkner immediately \u201cinformed Benbow that he was under arrest for driving while suspended.\u201d The trooper searched Ben-bow on the scene and later Benbow\u2019s car at the police barracks. He found cocaine and a large sum of money on Benbow\u2019s person and cocaine and a \u201ctrace\u201d of marijuana in the car. On cross-examination, defense counsel made no inquiry about the events leading to the arrest except to ask the year, model, and color of Benbow\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Benbow testified in his own behalf. We summarize his testimony. He was driving a black BMW on 26 November 1988 and was stopped by the police. The trooper asked for his operator\u2019s license and registration card. He told the trooper that he had a valid Maryland driver\u2019s license, but had lost the license card. A certified copy of his Maryland Department of Transportation, Motor Vehicle Administration, driving record was admitted in evidence without objection. <em>See </em>Appendix A, <em>infra. </em>Benbow was sitting in the police car when Welkner \u201cran a check on him through Maryland and Virginia.\u201d Benbow said that he heard the operator who called back report that the Maryland driver\u2019s license was valid. Benbow insisted that he also had a Virginia operator\u2019s license in good standing at the time he was stopped. He claimed that the information the trooper received over the radio that the Virginia license was suspended was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>On cross-examination, Benbow verified that he did not have any operator\u2019s license in his possession when he was stopped \u2014 \u201cI had lost them.\u201d A certified copy of Benbow\u2019s Virginia driving record was admitted in evidence upon proffer by the State to counter Benbow\u2019s assertion that his Virginia license was not suspended. <em>See </em>Appendix B, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">\n<em>The Maryland License</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">Benbow\u2019s Maryland driving record shows that he enjoyed a valid Maryland operator\u2019s license at the time of his arrest. Thus, the information that Benbow alleged he heard the dispatcher impart to the trooper was, in fact, correct. At the hearing, the trooper made no mention of any information he had received concerning the status of Benbow\u2019s Maryland driving privilege nor was he asked about it. If the State had wished to rebut Benbow\u2019s assertion that the trooper had been told that Benbow had a valid Maryland license, it could have recalled the trooper to the stand to say, if he could, that the dispatcher did not inform him that Benbow had a valid Maryland license or that, if the dispatcher did say it, the trooper did not hear it. In that event, the judge need not have believed Benbow, but, as the record stands here, Benbow\u2019s testimony was totally unrebutted and unrefuted. Benbow\u2019s version was not inconsistent with what the trooper said and was consistent with the Motor Vehicle Administration\u2019s record received in evidence. The judge neither expressly nor impliedly rejected Benbow\u2019s testimony on the matter; the judge simply did not address it. On this state of the record, we believe that we must treat Benbow\u2019s version as being accepted, that is, that the trooper had been informed before the arrest that Benbow was the holder of a valid Maryland license. As we read the arguments of the prosecutor, the State proceeded on the basis that Benbow\u2019s version was true.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">\n<em>The Virginia License</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The State interprets the Virginia record as establishing that Benbow did not have a valid operator\u2019s license in that state at the time of his arrest. Certainly, it sets out that as of 2 March 1989 Benbow\u2019s driver license status was \u201cnot licensed \u2014 eligible.\u201d It also shows that on 7 October 1987 there was a \u201csuspension\u201d for a \u201cterm\u201d ending either 14 or 15 April 1988 for failure to pay a fine. But then it indicates that Benbow had not paid the fine until 8 February 1989, at which time \u201ccontl\u201d ended by compliance with an order which had been mailed to him. Benbow averred that his license had been reinstated on 14 April 1988 when the term of suspension expired. He stated that an officer who arrived on the scene of his arrest knew this because that officer advised him how to pay the outstanding fine and get back his license, and that he had paid it before his arrest. That officer did not testify on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">As we have stated, the trial judge did not resolve the question of the status of Benbow\u2019s license at the time of the arrest. The judge declared that the issue was not whether Benbow\u2019s operator\u2019s license was suspended. \u201cThat really,\u201d the judge asserted, \u201cis not the crucial element.\u201d It was the judge\u2019s view that \u201c[t]he crucial fact is whether or not the trooper had probable cause to arrest. The trooper may be wrong ultimately but the question is, was there probable cause to arrest.\u201d The judge observed the circumstances facing the trooper were that he has</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Axj\">got a guy going 93 in a 55, guy who says I do not have my license. He calls and Virginia says this guy is suspended, is it probable, reasonable for that Trooper to ... think that the man is breaking the law in Maryland? I think he has probable cause to believe that the man is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>breaking the law, whether or not [the] man is or is not[,] so, therefore, the arrest is legal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The judge denied the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">As we construe the judge\u2019s ruling, he did not question that the trooper was told that Benbow had a valid Maryland license. Despite that, however, the judge believed that, because the trooper had been informed that Benbow\u2019s license to drive in Virginia had been suspended, even though that information may have been incorrect, the arrest was legal as based on probable cause. Thus, the judge reasoned, the search and seizure incident to the arrest was reasonable, and the contraband and evidence recovered was admissible. The judge was wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">Lacking a factual finding by the trial judge as to the status of Benbow\u2019s privilege to operate a motor vehicle under the authority of Virginia, we assume, for the purpose of decision, a scenario which is most against Benbow\u2019s interests, namely, that the information received by the trooper was correct \u2014 his Virginia license was not in good standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">Of course, as the trial judge stated, the trooper had \u201cprobable cause to believe that [Benbow] was breaking the law.\u201d Benbow was clearly in violation of the law \u2014 he was driving 93 miles an hour in a 55 miles-per-hour zone. Maryland Code (1977, 1987 RepLVol.) \u00a7 21-801(a) and \u00a7 21-801.1 of the Transportation Article (TR) proscribe such conduct, and TR 27-101 makes a violation a crime.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trooper had the duty, as well as the authority, to stop Benbow when the radar screening disclosed that he was driving in excess of the maximum allowable speed. But Benbow\u2019s speeding did not give the trooper the authority to arrest, either under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>common law or by statute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The validity <em>vel non </em>of Ben-bow\u2019s arrest is the heart of this appeal, for on it depended the legality of the search and and the admissibility of the items seized. We said in <em>Ricks v. State, </em>322 Md. 183, 188, 586 A.2d 740 (1991):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-5\">The Fourth Amendment protects individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures. A warrantless search or seizure is <em>per se </em>unreasonable, unless the police can show that it falls within one of a carefully defined set of exceptions. <em>Gamble v. State, </em>318 Md. 120, 123, 567 A.2d 95 (1989); <em>Stackhouse v. State, </em>298 Md. 203, 209, 468 A.2d 333 (1983); <em>Howell v. State, </em>271 Md. 378, 379, 318 A.2d 189 (1974). A search incident to a valid arrest is one of the limited exceptions to the warrant requirement. <em>Chimel v. California, supra </em>[395 U.S. 752, 89 S.Ct. 2034, 23 L.Ed.2d 685 (1969) ]; <em>Colvin v. State, </em>299 Md. 88, 98, 472 A.2d 953, <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 873 [105 S.Ct. 226, 83 L.Ed.2d 155] (1984).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">The power of a police officer to make a warrantless arrest for a violation of the Maryland Vehicle Law is precisely spelled out in \u00a7 26-202 of the Transportation Article. <em>See </em>Appendix C, <em>infra. </em>Speeding is not an arrestable offense. For speeding, the power of a police officer does not extend beyond the issuance of a citation. Section 26-201(a)(l) gives a police officer the authority to <em>charge </em>a person with a violation of the Maryland Vehicle Law \u201cif the officer has probable cause to believe that the person has committed or is committing the violation.\u201d Subsection (b), however, commands, \u201cA police officer who charges a person under this section shall issue a written traffic citation to the person charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Benbow was also in violation of the Maryland Vehicle Law in that he did not have his license with him contrary to \u00a7 16-112(b). And, of course, he was unable to display his license upon demand by the trooper as required by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>\u00a7 16-112(a), (b), and (c). But, these violations do not carry the power to arrest. In any event, as we have seen, the trooper did not arrest Benbow for these violations. Benbow was immediately placed under arrest when the trooper received information that Benbow\u2019s Virginia license was suspended. The arrest, the trooper told Benbow, was \u201cfor driving while suspended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">At the time Benbow was arrested, \u00a7 16-303 prohibited a person from driving in this State while \u201chis license or privilege to drive is refused in this State or any other state,\u201d subsection (a); or while the status of his license in any other state is \u201ccanceled,\u201d subsection (e); or \u201csuspended,\u201d subsection (f); or \u201crevoked,\u201d subsection (g). We have indicated that we shall proceed to decision on the assumption, <em>arguendo, </em>that any driving privilege Virginia may have issued Benbow was not in good standing at the time of his arrest. The State suggests that an arrest for violation of the provisions of \u00a7 16-303 is authorized by \u00a7 26-202(a)(3)(iv), which empowers a police officer to arrest a person when the officer has probable cause to believe that the person is \u201cdriving ... a motor vehicle while the driver\u2019s license or privilege to drive is suspended or revoked.\u201d The flaw in this notion is that Benbow had a Maryland license in good standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">When issued and signed, a driver\u2019s license authorizes the licensee to drive any vehicle of the type or class specified on it, subject to any restrictions endorsed on the license.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Section 16-lll(d)(2). There is no suggestion that Benbow\u2019s license had not been issued pursuant to \u00a7 16-111 and signed by him, or that it did not cover the type of vehicle he was driving or that it was subject to any restrictions. We do not construe the laws of Maryland as prohibiting a person from driving on Maryland\u2019s roads under color of a valid Maryland license because a license in another state had been refused, canceled, suspended, or revoked. We believe, under the circumstances here, that the prohibitions of \u00a7 16-303 are applicable in the event the driver\u2019s privilege to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>operate a motor vehicle is dependent only on a license issued by another state and the license had been rendered invalid by that state. When a driver holds a Maryland license in good standing, \u00a7 16-lll(d)(2) prevails, regardless of the status of a license issued to him in another state. We have discovered nothing in the language or the legislative history of the Maryland Vehicle Act to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">We note that \u00a7 16-lll(e)(2) prescribed, \u201cBefore issuing a license, the [Motor Vehicle] Administration <em>may </em>require the applicant to surrender any other license issued to him by any jurisdiction.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The record before us does not disclose the history of the issuance of Benbow\u2019s Maryland license. In any event, it appears that if, in fact, Benbow held a Virginia license at the time he was issued a license by Maryland, he had not been required to surrender the Virginia license.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In the circumstances, even if Benbow possessed a license in Maryland and a license in Virginia at the same time, that would not furnish proper reason to arrest him.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">The State also suggests that Benbow\u2019s arrest was legal as authorized by \u00a7 26-202(a)(2)(i), which grants a police officer the power to arrest a person for a violation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>Maryland Vehicle Law if the person has committed or is committing the violation within the view or presence of the officer and \u201cdoes not furnish satisfactory evidence of identity____\u201d The State links this provision to the failure of Benbow to display his Maryland license upon the officer\u2019s command pursuant to \u00a7 16-112(a), (b), and (c). The State posits, as we understand its position, .that \u201csatisfactory evidence of identity\u201d cannot be achieved in the absence of the display of a license when commanded by a police officer. This argument is indeed strained. There is nothing in the plain language of the section to support such a notion, nor is there any basis to find that such was the intent of the Legislature. The fact is that Benbow\u2019s identity was never in question. He gave what proved to be his correct name and date of birth, and Benbow\u2019s assertion that a trooper who arrived on the scene knew him personally was never challenged. It is obvious that the State cannot hang the legality of the arrest on the lack of satisfactory proof of Benbow\u2019s identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">The inevitable conclusion is that Benbow\u2019s warrantless arrest was illegal. Therefore, the arrest did not justify the search, and the search offended the Fourth Amendment as unreasonable. The exclusionary rule then came into play to bar the fruits of the search. Thus, the trial court erred in denying the motion to suppress the contraband and evidence seized, and the Court of Special Appeals erred in affirming the judgment of the trial court, which was based upon convictions dependent on the items seized. <em>Benbow v. State, </em>No. 1867, September Term, 1989, filed 24 April 1990, unreported. On our review of the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, which is before us upon our grant of Benbow\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari, and the State\u2019s conditional cross-petition, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED;</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">CASE REMANDED TO THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS WITH DIRECTION TO REVERSE THE JUDG<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>MENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY AND TO REMAND THE CASE TO THAT COURT FOR A NEW TRIAL;</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">COSTS IN THIS COURT AND THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY BALTIMORE COUNTY.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b466-33\">APPENDIX C</p>\n<p id=\"b466-34\">Maryland Code (1977, 1987 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 26-202 of the Transportation Article, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-35\">(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 A police officer may arrest without a warrant a person for a violation of the Maryland Vehicle Law, including any rule or regulation adopted under it, or for a violation of any traffic law or ordinance of any local authority of this State, if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-36\">(1) The person has committed or is committing the violation within the view or presence of the officer, and the violation is any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-37\">(i) A violation of \u00a7 21-1411 or \u00a7 22-409 of this article, relating to vehicles transporting hazardous materials;

It was borrowed (although not verbatim) from the federal regulation that the statute implements, The Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986, 49 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 2701 et seq., \u00a7 12002 et seq., \"Limitation on Number of Driver\u2019s Licenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AZU\">Making the surrender of all other licenses mandatory is one way in which licensing and testing standards were strengthened, in accord with one of the primary purposes of both the federal regulations and the Maryland statute. Until this change, drivers could obtain a second or subsequent license from another jurisdiction to circumvent a bad driving record in the home state. Unless the stopping officer had a specific reason to suspect that the driver was licensed in another state, the bad record or the suspension would go unnoticed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
