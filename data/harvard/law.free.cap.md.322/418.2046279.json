ORTH, Jr., Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"APz\">Specially Assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">The two cases covered by this opinion, <em>Sandra Ann Craig v. State of Maryland, </em>No. 110, September Term, 1988, and <em>James T. Gilbert v. State of Maryland, </em>No. 63, September Term, 1990, concern the testimony of the victim in a child abuse case by means of closed circuit television. Craig and Gilbert were each charged with child abuse as defined in Maryland Code (1957, 1987 Repl.Vol.), Article 27, \u00a7 35A, and related offenses. At each trial the victim was permitted to testify, over objection, by means of closed circuit television. Craig and Gilbert each challenge the propriety of that procedure. Inasmuch as the two cases share that common issue, we called for them to be argued on the same day, and we decide them both in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">Some six years ago, in Acts 1985, ch. 499 (H.B. 1346) and ch. 495 (S.B. 555), the General Assembly of Maryland evinced its deep concern about \u201cthe psychological harm to a child victim testifying in a child abuse case____\u201d The chapters enacted identical provisions which were codified in the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article of the Maryland Code (1973, 1989 Repl.Vol.) as \u00a7 9-102. The legislation fashioned a comprehensive scheme which authorized a pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>cedure for the receipt of testimony of the victim in a child abuse case by means of closed circuit television. One of the detailed conditions for the invocation of the procedure called for the trial judge to determine that testimony by the child victim in the courtroom will result in the child suffering serious emotional distress such that the child cannot reasonably communicate. \u00a7 9-102(a)(l)(ii). The statute has been the subject of opinions in <em>Wildermuth v. State, </em>310 Md. 496, 530 A.2d 275 (1987); <em>Craig v. State, </em>76 Md.App. 250, 544 A.2d 784 (1988); <em>Craig v. State, </em>316 Md. 551, 560 A.2d 1120 (1989) <em>(Craig I); </em>and <em>Maryland v. Craig, </em>497 U.S. -, 110 S.Ct. 3157, 111 L.Ed.2d 666 (1990). <em>Coy v. Iowa, </em>487 U.S. 1012, 108 S.Ct. 2798, 101 L.Ed.2d 857 (1988), although not directly concerned with \u00a7 9-102, influenced our holdings in <em>Craig I </em>and played a part in the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Craig. </em>Our opinion delivered today provides the latest word on the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">\n<em>The Sandra Ann Craig Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Asbr\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">On 16 October 1986, a Howard County grand jury returned an indictment charging Sandra Ann Craig with child abuse, first and second degree sexual offense, perverted practice, assault, and battery. A jury in the Circuit Court for Howard County convicted her on all counts, and she was sentenced to terms of imprisonment totalling 10 years. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgments on direct appeal. <em>Craig v. State, </em>76 Md.App. 250, 544 A.2d 784. We reversed the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals on grant of her petition for a writ of certiorari. <em>Craig v. State, </em>316 Md. 551, 560 A.2d 1120 <em>(Craig I). </em>The Supreme Court of the United States vacated our judgment on grant of the State\u2019s petition for certiorari, and remanded the case to us for consideration in the light of its opinion. <em>Maryland v. Craig, </em>110 S.Ct. 3157. In compliance with the direction of the Supreme Court, we ordered the case to be re-briefed and re-argued, and it is now again before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">Craig owned and operated a kindergarten and prekindergarten center. The center was the site of the offenses of which she was convicted, and the alleged victim was a child six years of age who was entrusted to her care at the center.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">When the case was about to go to trial, the State sought to invoke \u00a7 9-102. The section\u2019s protection was desired not only with respect to the victim named in the indictment, seven years old at the time of the trial, but also as to other children who had, according to the State, been abused by Craig. Despite Craig\u2019s confrontation-based objections, the named victim and three other children testified via one-way closed circuit television. The young witnesses, of course, could not see Craig while so testifying.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">In <em>Maryland v. Craig, </em>110 S.Ct. 3157, the Supreme Court reviewed our opinion in <em>Craig I. </em>It looked at \u00a7 9-102 in the light of federal constitutional dictates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-8\">This case requires us to decide whether the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment categorically prohibits a child witness in a child abuse case from testifying against a defendant at trial, outside the defendant\u2019s physical presence, by one-way closed circuit television.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 3160. The Supreme Court summarized our holdings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0I\">The Maryland Court of Appeals held, as we do today, that although face-to-face confrontation is not an absolute constitutional requirement, it may be abridged only where there is a \u201c \u2018case-specific finding of necessity.\u2019 \u201d 316 Md., at 564, 560 A.2d, at 1126 (quoting <em>Coy, supra, </em>487 U.S., at 1025, 108 S.Ct., at 2805 (concurring opinion)). Given this latter requirement, the Court of Appeals reasoned that \u201c[t]he question of whether a child is unavailable to testify ... should not be asked in terms of inability to testify in the ordinary courtroom setting, but in the much narrower terms of the witness\u2019s inability to testify in the presence of the accused.\u201d 316 Md., at 564, 560 A.2d, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>1126 (footnote omitted). \u201c[T]he determinative inquiry-required to preclude face-to-face confrontation is the effect of the presence of the defendant on the witness or the witness\u2019s testimony.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 565, 560 A.2d, at 1127. The Court of Appeals accordingly concluded that, as a prerequisite to use of the \u00a7 9-102 procedure, the Confrontation Clause requires the trial court to make a specific finding that testimony by the child in the courtroom <em>in the presence of the defendant </em>would result in the child suffering serious emotional distress such that the child could not reasonably communicate. <em>Id., </em>at 566, 560 A.2d, at 1127. This conclusion, of course, is consistent with our holding today.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-5\"><em>Maryland v. Craig, </em>110 S.Ct. at 3170 (emphasis in original). The Supreme Court went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-7\">In addition, however, the Court of Appeals interpreted our decision in <em>Coy </em>to impose two subsidiary requirements. First, the [C]ourt [of Appeals] held that \u201c\u00a7 9-102 ordinarily cannot be invoked unless the child witness initially is questioned (either in or outside the courtroom) in the defendant\u2019s presence.\u201d [316 Md.] at 566, 560 A.2d, at 1127; see also <em>Wildermuth, </em>310 Md., at 523-524, 530 A.2d, at 289 (personal observation by the judge should be the rule rather than the exception). Second, the court asserted that, before using the one-way television procedure, a trial judge must determine whether a child would suffer \u201csevere emotional distress\u201d if he or she were to testify by two-way closed circuit television. 316 Md., at 567, 560 A.2d, at 1128.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">110 S.Ct. at 3170 (emphasis in original). The Supreme Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-10\">Reviewing the evidence presented to the trial court in support of the finding required under \u00a7 9-102(a)(l)(ii), the Court of Appeals determined that \u201cthe finding of necessity required to limit the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation through invocation of \u00a7 9-102 ... was not made here.\u201d [316 Md.] at 570-571, 560 A.2d, at 1129. The Court of Appeals noted that the trial judge \u201chad the benefit only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>of expert testimony on the ability of the children to communicate; he did not question any of the children himself, nor did he observe any child\u2019s behavior on the witness stand before making his ruling. He did not explore any alternatives to the use of one-way closed circuit television.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 568, 560 A.2d, at 1128 (footnote omitted). The Court of Appeals also observed that \u201cthe testimony in this case was not sharply focused on the effect of the defendant\u2019s presence on the child witnesses.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 569, 560 A.2d, at 1129. Thus, the Court of Appeals concluded:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-4\">\u201cUnable to supplement the expert testimony by responses to questions put by him, or by his own observations of the children\u2019s behavior in Craig\u2019s presence, the judge made his \u00a7 9-102 finding in terms of what the experts had said. He ruled that \u2018the testimony of each of these children <em>in a courtroom </em>will [result] in each child suffering serious emotional distress ... such that each of these children cannot reasonably communicate.\u2019 He failed to find \u2014 indeed, on the evidence before him, <em>could not have found </em>\u2014 that this result would be the product of testimony in a courtroom in the defendant\u2019s presence or outside the courtroom but in the defendant\u2019s televised presence. That, however, is the finding of necessity required to limit the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation through invocation of \u00a7 9-102. Since that finding was not made here, and since the procedures we deem requisite to the valid use of \u00a7 9-102 were not followed, the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals must be reversed and the case remanded for a new trial.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 570-571, 560 A.2d, at 1129 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-5\"><em>Maryland v. Craig, </em>110 S.Ct. at 3070-3071. The Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">The Court of Appeals appears to have rested its conclusion at least in part on the trial court\u2019s failure to observe the children\u2019s behavior in the defendant\u2019s presence and its failure to explore less restrictive alternatives to the use of the one-way closed circuit television procedure. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>[316 Md.] at 568-571, 560 A.2d, at 1128-1129. Although we think such evidentiary requirements could strengthen the grounds for use of protective measures, we decline to establish, as a matter of federal constitutional law, any such categorical evidentiary prerequisites for the use of the one-way television procedure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">110 S.Ct. at 3171. The Court commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-6\">The trial court in this case, for example, could well have found, on the basis of the expert testimony before it, that testimony by the child witnesses in the courtroom in the defendant\u2019s presence \u201cwill result in [each] child suffering serious emotional distress such that the child cannot reasonably communicate,\u201d \u00a7 9-102(a)(l)(ii). See [316 Md.] at 568-569, 560 A.2d, at 1128-1129; see also App. 22-25, 39, 41, 43, 44-45, 54-57. So long as a trial court makes such a case-specific finding of necessity, the Confrontation Clause does not prohibit a State from using a one-way closed circuit television procedure for the receipt of testimony by a child witness in a child abuse case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">110 S.Ct. at 3171. But, the Court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-8\">Because the Court of Appeals held that the trial court had not made the requisite finding of necessity under its interpretation of \u201cthe high threshold required by <em>[Coy </em>] before \u00a7 9-102 may be invoked,\u201d 316 Md., at 554-555, 560 A.2d, at 1121 (footnote omitted), we cannot be certain whether the Court of Appeals would reach the same conclusion in light of the legal standard we establish today.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">110 S.Ct. at 3171. This led to the vacating of our judgment and the remand. As ordered by the Supreme Court, we have now assessed our opinion in <em>Craig I </em>in light of its <em>Maryland v. Craig.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b486-10\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b486-11\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b486-12\">The key to the <em>Craig </em>case is <em>Wildermuth v. State, </em>310 Md. 496, 530 A.2d 275. It was in <em>Wildermuth </em>that we first determined that face-to-face confrontation is not an abso<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>lute constitutional requirement. <em>Id. </em>at 518, 530 A.2d 275. We pointed out in that case that the type of confrontation permitted by \u00a7 9-102 can be constitutionally justified only upon a showing of witness unavailability- \u2014 -\u201cthat is, a degree of necessity that supports use of a procedure ... that would otherwise not satisfy the confrontation requirements.\u201d 310 Md. at 520, 530 A.2d 275. We were content that if testimony in open court will result in the child witness\u2019s suffering serious emotional distress, there is sufficient unavailability to satisfy the constitutional confrontation requirement. <em>Id. </em>at 519, 530 A.2d 275. We turned to the statute, and particularly \u00a7 9-102(a)(l)(ii), to determine the legislative intent. We were , satisfied that the standard set by that subsection was that \u201cordinarily the judge should observe and question the child.\u201d 310 Md. at 524, 530 A.2d 275. We opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-5\">While personal observation by the judge may not be a <em>sine qua non </em>under \u00a7 9-102, it should be the rule rather than the exception.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 523-524, 530 A.2d 275. We added that the statute calls for testimony about the likely impact on the particular child which shows \u201cmuch more than mere nervousness or excitement or some reluctance to testify.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 524, 530 A.2d 275. We were of the view that there must be a case-specific finding upon a particularized examination of all the circumstances concerning the impact of public testimony in the presence of the defendant upon the emotional health of the child. <em>Id. </em>at 525, 530 A.2d 275. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9h\">While the testimony need not be given in the precise words of the statute it must be clear that the statutory requirements are met in substance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 524, 530 A.2d 275. We warned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-8\">Testimony about the likely impact on the child testifying must be definite, related to the statutory standard and specific to the potential child witness him or herself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aygj\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">We concluded in <em>Wildermuth </em>that the statutory requirements were not met in substance. The trial judge \u201cnever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>questioned or even observed the child witness before he made his ruling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 523, 530 A.2d 275. He heard only-testimony from experts, and their testimony did not sufficiently relate to the requirement of \u00a7 9-102(a)(l)(ii) that testimony in the courtroom \u201cwill result in the child suffering serious emotional distress such that the child cannot reasonably communicate.\u201d The testimony of one expert, we discovered, \u201crelated chiefly to young children in general, and at the most suggested that the child (or any child) would find it \u2018hard to respond at all in the courtroom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cBut \u2018hard to respond,\u2019 \u201d we noted, \u201cdoes not come close to \u2018serious emotional distress such that the child cannot reasonably communicate.\u2019 \u201d <em>-Id. </em>The testimony of the other expert was more specific, \u201c[b]ut she, too, spoke to some extent in terms of all children as a group.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We warned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-5\">[A] judge\u2019s subjective and self-justifying recollections of a child\u2019s demeanor, absent support in the record, will not be enough to justify a finding that limits the right of confrontations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 524, 530 A.2d 275. We held that the evidence in Wildermuth\u2019s case was not enough. We reversed and remanded for further proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 525, 530 A.2d 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">Craig\u2019s trial followed a scenario like that of Wildermuth. The Circuit Court for Howard County heard only expert testimony as to whether \u00a7 9-102(a)(l)(ii)\u2019s threshold had been crossed. The judge did not question or interview any of the child witnesses, nor were any of them called to the witness stand in Craig\u2019s presence, in an attempt to produce testimony in that fashion. <em>See Craig I </em>[316 Md.] at 555, 560 A.2d 1120. The judge ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-9\">There\u2019s been evidence presented and based upon the evidence presented I find that the testimony of each of these children in a courtroom will [result] in each child suffering serious emotional distress and such that each of these children cannot reasonably communicate and ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>cordingly I believe there\u2019s a need and it\u2019s appropriate to direct that the testimony of these children be provided by way of closed circuit television consistent with the provisions of Section 9-102____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-4\"><em>See id. </em>at 555-556, 560 A.2d 1120.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Our focus in <em>Craig I, </em>as it was in <em>Wildermuth, </em>was on \u201c \u2018[t]he only reliability function not substantially provided by one-way closed-circuit television\u2019 \u2014 the truth-enhancing trial procedure of face-to-face confrontation.\u201d 316 Md. at 563, 560 A.2d 1120. We pointed out that we held in <em>Wildermuth </em>that \u201c \u2018[t]he degree of confrontation allowed by \u00a7 9-102 ... satisfies the constitutional requirements if there is compliance with subsection (a)(l)(ii) as a condition precedent to application of the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Craig I </em>at 563, 560 A.2d 1120, quoting <em>Wildermuth </em>[310 Md.] at 520, 530 A.2d 275. The evidence at Craig\u2019s trial was no more sufficient to show compliance with subsection (a)(l)(ii) than it was in Wildermuth\u2019s trial. As was the case in <em>Wildermuth, </em>at Craig\u2019s trial \u201c[w]hen the trial judge made his \u00a7 9-102 determination, the finding that authorized the use of closed circuit television, he had the benefit only of expert testimony on the ability of the children to communicate; he did not question any of the children himself, nor did he observe any child\u2019s behavior on the witness stand before making his ruling.\u201d <em>Craig I, </em>316 Md. at 568, 560 A.2d 1120. We pointed out that in <em>Wildermuth </em>we said that \u201ctestimony about the likely impact on the particular child must be specific and must show more than mere nervousness or excitement or some reluctance to testify.\u201d 316 Md. at 569, 560 A.2d 1120, quoting <em>Wildermuth, </em>310 Md. at 524, 560 A.2d 1120. We posited that it was even more critical that the particularized examination of all the circumstances must focus on the impact of public testimony in the presence of the defendant upon the emotional health of the child. 316 Md. at 569, 560 A.2d 1120. Thus, the testimony at Craig\u2019s trial, like the testimony at Wildermuth\u2019s trial, did not, in substance, meet the standards of \u00a7 9-102(a)(l)(ii). It is for that reason that we again reverse the judgment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Court of Special Appeals and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Craig implores us not to be bound by the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the federal constitution in our interpretation of that clause in Article 21 of Maryland\u2019s Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She urges that, as to Article 21, we follow Justice Scalia\u2019s interpretation of the clause in his dissent in <em>Maryland v. Craig. </em>Justice Scalia posited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-7\">[T]hat the defendant should be confronted by the witnesses who appear at trial is not a preference \u201creflected\u201d by the Confrontation Clause; it is a constitutional right unqualifiedly guaranteed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">110 S.Ct. at 3173 (Scalia, J., dissenting). The two Confrontation Clauses are in <em>pari materia. Moon v. State, </em>300 Md. 354, 359, 478 A.2d 695 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 1207, 105 S.Ct. 1170, 84 L.Ed.2d 321 (1985). <em>See Crawford v.

With regard to the issue before us, we decline to construe the Confrontation Clause of Article 21 differently from the Supreme Court\u2019s construction of the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">We have seen that in <em>Wildermuth </em>and <em>Craig I </em>we held that to invoke \u00a7 9-102 there must be a case-specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>finding that testimony by the child in the courtroom in the presence of the defendant would result in the child suffering serious emotional distress such that the child could not reasonably communicate. 316 Md. at 564-565, 560 A.2d 1120. We thought that this was required by the statute and the Confrontation Clauses. The Supreme Court agreed that it was constitutionally required. <em>Maryland v. Craig, </em>110 S.Ct. at 3170. But then, in <em>Craig I, </em>we added two subsidiary requirements: (1) \u00a7 9-102 ordinarily cannot be invoked unless the child witness initially is questioned (either inside or outside the courtroom) in the defendant\u2019s presence, 316 Md. at 566, 560 A.2d 1120; and (2) before using a one-way closed circuit television procedure, the judge must determine whether a child would suffer \u201csevere emotional distress,\u201d if the child were to testify by a two-way closed circuit television procedure, <em>id. </em>at 567, 560 A.2d 1120. The first subsidiary requirement had two parts: (a) the initial questioning of the child by the judge; and (b) the presence of the defendant at the questioning. We found in <em>Wildermuth </em>that (a) was required by \u00a7 9-102, but we did not focus on (b). In <em>Craig I </em>we focused on (b) as being constitutionally required under <em>Coy. </em>The Supreme Court did not indicate that the child need never be preliminarily observed and questioned by the judge, but it \u201cdecline[d] to establish as a matter of federal constitutional law, any such categorical evidentiary prerequisites for the use of the one-way television procedure.\u201d 110 S.Ct. at 3171. The Supreme Court recognized, however, that \u201csuch evidentiary requirements could strengthen the grounds for use of protective measures____\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">We do not think that the two subsidiary requirements should be jettisoned. We think that they should be preserved, not as commands, but as an aid to the trial judge, in appropriate circumstances, in the determination of the condition precedent prescribed by \u00a7 9 \u2014 102(a)(l)(ii). We believe that it is proper that they be so preserved as within the legislative intendment of \u00a7 9-102. Again we look to <em>Wildermuth. </em>Once more we call attention to our observation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>made before <em>Coy </em>was decided, that \u201cordinarily the judge should observe and question the child,\u201d and that this \u201cshould be the rule rather than the exception.\u201d 310 Md. at 524. This holding was announced in the light of the Maryland statute. The same is true of the second subsidiary requirement. It reflects the legislative scheme implemented by the statute. We noted in <em>Craig I, </em>\u201cNothing in \u00a7 9-102 precludes [a two-way closed circuit television] procedure.\u201d 316 Md. at 567, 560 A.2d 1120. And we observed, \u201cThe use of such a procedure is consistent with a trial judge\u2019s broad discretion in conducting a criminal trial.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">We venture a word about expert testimony. We said in <em>Wildermuth </em>that \u201cexpert testimony may not be necessary to establish the necessary predicate [to invoke \u00a7 9-102].\u201d 310 Md. at 524, 530 A.2d 275. \u201cFor example,\u201d we noted, \u201cthe testimony of a parent may be sufficient, when combined with the child\u2019s own testimony and judicial observation of the child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On the other hand, the Supreme Court in <em>Maryland v. Craig, </em>110 S.Ct. at 3171, suggested that \u201c[t]he trial court in this case ... could well have found, on the basis of expert testimony before it, that testimony by the child witnesses in the courtroom in the defendant\u2019s presence\u201d would fulfill the requirement of \u00a7 9-102(a)(l)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">The steps to be taken by a trial judge when the State seeks to invoke the \u00a7 9-102 procedure over objection emerge clearly in the light of the statute and the holdings in <em>Wildermuth, Craig I, </em>and the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Maryland v. Craig.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">(1) The trial judge shall make a case-specific finding of necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">(a) Given this requirement, the question whether the child is available to testify shall be asked, not in terms of inability to testify in the ordinary courtroom setting, but in the much narrower terms of the witness\u2019s inability to testify in the presence of the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">(2) The question of the availability of the child to testify in the presence of the accused shall be determined, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>ordinarily, by the judge personally observing and interviewing the child, on the record, either in or outside the courtroom. Although the personal observation and interview of the child is not a <em>sine qua non </em>under \u00a7 9-102, it should be the rule rather than the exception,</p>\n<p id=\"A8O\">(a) The presence of the defendant at the judge\u2019s observation and interview of the child is within the discretion of the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">(i) In exercising that discretion, the trial judge should consider that the presence of the defendant may well aid in determining whether to invoke the statutory procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">(ii) If during an interview in which the judge has permitted the presence of the defendant, it appears that the defendant\u2019s presence is adversely affecting the child and the child\u2019s ability to communicate, the judge should have the defendant removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">(3) In appropriate circumstances, expert testimony may not be essential to establish the necessary predicate for permitting the child to testify over closed circuit television.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">(a) We believe it probable, however, that the prudent trial judge will, at least, consider expert testimony, when it is offered, as an aid in determining whether to invoke \u00a7 9-102.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">(4) If the judge determines that the criteria of \u00a7 9-102 have been met, the means by which the procedure shall be effected is within the discretion of the trial judge. We believe that the prudent judge will consider the reasonable availability of measures which would be the least restrictive of the right of confrontation, yet serve the purpose of \u00a7 9-102, and seek to utilize such measures, if that can be accomplished without undue delay or inconvenience.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>We think that this lead-in to the invocation of the \u00a7 9-102 procedure is not only consistent with the legislative scheme, but enhances it. We are content that the procedure satisfies the Legislature\u2019s intendment, even though it may not, in some part, be constitutionally compelled. <em>See Maryland v. Craig, </em>110 S.Ct. at 3171.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">\n<em>The James T Gilbert Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">On 6 January 1989, a grand jury in Baltimore City returned three true bills against James T. Gilbert, charging him with child abuse and a variety of other offenses against the person of his stepdaughter. The crimes were alleged to cover the period from 1 September 1987 to 1 December 1987.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The guilt stage of the trial began on 10 July 1989 before a jury in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. On 13 July the jury returned verdicts of guilty as to child abuse, assault with intent to rape, third degree sexual offense, and assault. A motion for a new trial was heard and denied. Gilbert was sentenced to terms of imprisonment totaling 15 years. He appealed. Briefs were filed in the Court of Special Appeals, and the case was argued before a panel of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>that court. Before the intermediate appellate court rendered a decision, however, we ordered, on our own motion, the issuance of a writ of certiorari and directed that the parties file supplemental briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">In the trial court, the State filed a pretrial motion to invoke \u00a7 9-102. Gilbert objected. The hearing on the motion began with a colloquy in open court in which the judge, the prosecutor, and defense counsel participated. It was decided that the judge would question the child witness in chambers in the presence of only the prosecutor, defense counsel, and a stenographer. The defendant was to be excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">In chambers, after the name and age of the witness were ascertained, the judge asked the child, \u201cHow do you feel about testifying?\u201d The child answered, \u201cScared.\u201d The judge fully explored the child\u2019s background. Upon persistent probing, the judge ascertained from the child that she was in the eighth grade of the Woodlawn Middle School, that she liked to study \u201cmath\u201d and was good at it, that she had no hobbies \u2014 -when she was not in school she would \u201cgo to sleep.\u201d The judge learned that for the past two weeks the child was living with an aunt. Before that she was in a foster home for about eight months. The prosecutor explained that the child had lived with her mother and her stepfather. \u201cThen when the disclosure came [about the abuse] she was placed into foster care and she has been in foster care until about two and a half weeks ago when the authorities allowed her [to stay with an aunt].\u201d In answer to the judge\u2019s questions, the child said she had seen her stepfather, but had not talked to him, since he had been arrested. \u201c[H]e was riding around my [aunt\u2019s] house. He kept riding around my house.\u201d She was scared of her stepfather. He would \u201c[t]ry to hurt me.\u201d The prosecutor informed the judge that the child was \u201cseeing a therapist\u201d at the Kennedy Institute. The child said she saw the therapist every Thursday. She told the therapist that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>was scared of her stepfather. The therapist told her \u201cdon\u2019t worry,\u201d but she did not believe that because \u201cmy stepfather got ways of doing things.\u201d The judge asked the child, \u201cDo you see your mother?\u201d The child responded, \u201cNo.\u201d The prosecutor explained that the mother \u201cis basically siding with her stepfather.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">As a preliminary to inquiring what the stepfather had done to her, the judge elicited from the child that she knew what it was to tell the truth, that if you do not tell the truth you go to jail, and that she planned to tell the truth. The judge then drew from the child the details of the stepfather\u2019s sexual abuse of her, which began when she was nine years of age. She told her mother about it, but her mother said she did not believe her and beat her. \u201cShe just kept beating me.\u201d The prosecutor explained that the stepfather\u2019s alleged conduct became known upon a report \u201cby a teacher that [the child] was acting out sexually in drawing pictures in school, [and the teacher] called Protective Services and started an investigation.\u201d She was sent to a camp for sex abused children to receive group counseling. She told her aunt and the therapist about what her stepfather had done to her. The stepfather threatened to \u201ccut my head off and send it to my father [if I told].\u201d The prosecutor told the judge that the child did not now see her natural father, although for a short time she had lived with him and his girl friend. Her mother called her while she was in foster care and told her not to testify. Asked what she said to her mother, the child responded, \u201cI didn\u2019t say nothing. I just hung up.\u201d The session ended on this note:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-6\">THE COURT: Do you think you could get on the witness stand and talk?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-7\">[THE CHILD]: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">The judge ruled on the motion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-9\">I am impressed that she is a very repressed young woman, that she finds it very difficult to express herself and I had to ask her to repeat things repeatedly. She is quite obviously frightened and expresses verbally and physically fear of almost everybody connected with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>case. I think she even has apprehensions about her therapist, the Court, the State\u2019s Attorney and people who are clearly friendly to her. I think that she will have problems in communicating \u2014 serious problems in communicating \u2014 because of emotional distress if she is required to undertake the formality of the Courtroom and <em>be confronted by her stepfather, the Defendant, </em>of whom she has very obvious, severe fears.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-4\">I\u2019m also advised that her mother \u2014 she accused her own mother as being on his side, taking his side of the proceedings and, therefore, doesn\u2019t receive any support from that direction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-5\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-6\">I do feel ... she suffers serious emotional distress and would be unable to reasonably communicate if required to testify from the witness stand and <em>in front of her father </em>at that time. So, I will allow the State to present her testimony through video.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">(Emphasis added). The judge heard from counsel on the matter. The prosecutor had available two expert witnesses with respect to the inability of the child to testify in the courtroom in the presence of the defendant. The prosecutor proffered the testimony of one of them, the therapist from the Kennedy Institute. The judge did not care to hear from them, preferring to rely, in the circumstances, on her \u201cown appraisal of witnesses from seeing [witnesses] in court all the time.\u201d The judge proclaimed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-8\">[H]aving interviewed her this morning I\u2019m utterly convinced that we are not just going to proceed to hear from her as we usually do from witnesses. They\u2019re all apprehensive, but this little girl is obviously in tremendous fear of her [stepfather] in particular but almost anybody and everybody else as well____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">The judge\u2019s final determination was that she was \u201cgoing to permit\u201d the \u00a7 9-102 procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">It so happened that two-way closed circuit television was available in another courtroom. Trial proceeded in that courtroom with the child testifying over that television circuit. Before the child took the stand, the judge fully explained to the jury the circumstances under which the child would testify. At the motion for a new trial, the prosecutor described the procedure that was followed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABh\">[T]he victim was ... in the same courtroom area as the defendant, but off in another room. Present in that room was the court clerk, myself, and defense counsel____ [T]he victim had the opportunity to observe the defendant on a monitor which was seated next to her____ [Tjhere was a monitor, a telephone monitor of sorts in the courtroom where the defendant was able to communicate with his attorney during the course of the entire direct and cross-examination of the victim. There was no way that anyone in the courtroom or myself or the court clerk or anyone else could hear what was being said between the defendant and his attorney, and at all times they were maintaining contact, talking by way of the telephone. In addition, we had in the .courtroom and also in chambers a method by which the Judge could hear everything going on in chambers and we could hear everything that was going on in the courtroom. That is the way the microphone setup was. In the courtroom there was a big screen TV where everyone in the courtroom could observe the victim in color at the same time, the jury, the Judge and any spectators as well as the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">Gilbert\u2019s challenges to the judgments entered against him have boiled down to two claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-12\">(1) the trial court did not find that the victim\u2019s inability to reasonably communicate would be caused by Gilbert\u2019s presence; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>(2) the decision by the judge to permit the use of the \u00a7 9-102 procedure was made without a preliminary confrontation between the victim and Gilbert conducted by the judge.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">The first claim is devoid of merit. Even a casual scanning of the transcript of the proceedings is enough to lay that claim to rest. The questions put to the child, the child\u2019s responses, and the judge\u2019s comments show clearly that there was a sharp focus on the effect the presence of the defendant would have on the child when the child was called upon to testify. It is perfectly plain that an essential consideration in the judge\u2019s finding concerned the adverse reaction of the child upon an \u201ceyeball-to-eyeball\u201d confrontation with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">As to Gilbert\u2019s second claim, the judge was without the benefit of <em>Craig I </em>when she was faced at the guilt stage of the trial with the question of invoking \u00a7 9-102. She did have that opinion before her when she heard Gilbert\u2019s motion for a new trial (which she accepted belatedly because of the intervention of <em>Craig I) </em>and was troubled by one of its teachings. She observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>There is one thing that disturbs me____ [W]hen I read <em>[Craig </em>/] last week, I recall that the idea was expressed that the defendant and the victim should confront one another in this preliminary determination____ [T]he Court seems to indicate that that should be attempted or done.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">The prosecutor admitted, \u201cWe did not do that as the court knows.\u201d The judge responded, \u201cI know the victim never did have to look at the defendant ... [e]xcept on the monitor, but not in the flesh.\u201d That \u201cdisturb[ed the judge] some.\u201d She stated, correctly, \u201cIt is too late for me to try it [ (the preliminary confrontation) ] in this case.\u201d She hoped that \u201cthe appellate court is going to clear it up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">Counsel argued the matter. Neither the judge nor defense counsel nor the prosecutor had the benefit of the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Maryland v. Craig </em>at the time. During the course of the argument, the judge reminded counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac0\">I held a hearing in which I made a determination that the child\u2019s emotional state ... would make it impossible for her to communicate____ [A]fter hearing from her, observing her, talking to her in the presence of counsel in chambers, I came to that conclusion____ [0]f course, I never heard of any confrontation immediately before the trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-14\">The judge summed up:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-15\">We had a preliminary hearing. The one possible problem I have reading what the Court says in <em>[Craig I] </em>is that the defendant was not present there. His lawyer was and the witness was and the State and I were. It was on the record, but I am a little disturbed about that____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-16\">The judge took the position:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-17\">If what we did in this case doesn\u2019t meet the <em>[Craig </em>/] standard, I think it is something that the higher courts are going to have to address.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-18\">The judge denied the motion for a new trial. We have resolved the judge\u2019s quandary today.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">The judge made a case-specific finding of the necessity for the child to testify out of the physical presence of the defendant. She personally observed, and carefully and fully interviewed, the child on the record. It is perfectly clear from the child\u2019s reaction to and responses to the judge\u2019s questions that the presence of the defendant at the interview was not desirable because it would be harmful to the child. We hold that, in the circumstances here, the judge did not abuse her discretion in conducting the interview out of the presence of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">We do not believe that, here, expert testimony was required as an aid for the judge to determine whether to invoke \u00a7 9-102. We see no abuse of discretion in the judge\u2019s refusal to consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Of course, with two-way closed circuit television readily available, there was no need for the judge to explore other possible means which might be utilized to obtain the child\u2019s testimony out of the presence of the defendant. Defense counsel has not suggested that two-way closed circuit television was objectionable and, on the contrary, has indicated that it was proper. <em>See </em>note 4, <em>supra. </em>And <em>see </em>note 2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">In short, the judge met all the requirements necessary under the Confrontation Clauses and the statute for the invocation of \u00a7 9-102. Her decision to invoke it was not erroneous. We affirm the judgments of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">AS TO CRAIG v.

This challenge was based on the mistaken belief that one-way closed circuit television was utilized to obtain the victim\u2019s testimony.
