The circuit court held that the wife would not be excused from her waiver of any interest in, and of the right to administer, the deceased husband\u2019s estate, even if the husband had breached his covenant to continue the wife as beneficiary on a certain insurance policy. As explained below, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">Appellant, Joy R. Brees (Joy), and Earl Roland Brees (Earl) were married in 1967. Earl had three children by a prior marriage, including the appellee, Linda Cramer (Cram-er). One child, Michael Brees, was born in April 1970 of the marriage of Earl and Joy. In July 1982 the couple voluntarily separated, and in September 1983 Earl and Joy completed execution of a written separation agreement (the Agreement).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>The Agreement included provisions relating to the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">- \u2014 no further cohabitation between the parties (\u00b6 1);</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">\u2014custody of Michael to Earl (\u00b6 2);</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">\u2014use, rental and sale of the family home in Adelphi, Maryland, and disposition of the proceeds (\u00b6\u00b6 3 and 4); \u2014mutual waivers of alimony and maintenance (\u00b6 5);</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">\u2014mutual waivers of claims to child support (\u00b6 6);</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">\u2014income tax use of the personal exemption for Michael and of interest and real estate tax deductions generated by the family home (\u00cdI1\u00cd 7 and 8);</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">\u2014medical insurance for Michael at Earl\u2019s expense (\u00b6 9);</p>\n<p id=\"AI9\">\u2014mutual forbearances to pledge the other party\u2019s credit (It 13);</p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">\u2014assumption by Earl of responsibility for the balance of a bank loan and on a retail credit account (U 14a);</p>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">\u2014division of furniture, other personalty, and cemetery plots (\u00b6 14b);</p>\n<p id=\"b277-13\">\u2014transfer by Earl to Joy of a lot in Virginia and of an automobile (\u00b6 14c and d);</p>\n<p id=\"b277-14\">\u2014mutual releases of obligations for alimony, support and maintenance (\u00b6 15);</p>\n<p id=\"b277-15\">\u2014mutual releases from all \u201crights, claims, demands or obligations arising out of or by virtue of the marital relation of the parties, including ... right of election regarding the estate of the other, or to take against the Will of the other, [and the] right to act as executor or administrator of the estate of the other\u201d (\u00b6 17); and</p>\n<p id=\"ALb\">\u2014promises by each party to insure that party\u2019s life for not less than $83,000 (the amount of the debt secured by the family home) with policy proceeds payable to the other party until sale of the family home, and then, optionally, to Michael (\u00b6\u00b6 10 and 11).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-16\">Included among the life insurance covenants were Earl\u2019s promise \u201cto leave the Wife as the beneficiary of at least <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>$34,000.00 in Federal Employees Government Life Insurance\u201d and Joy\u2019s promise to \u201cleave the Husband as the beneficiary of at least $25,000.00 in Federal Employees Government Life Insurance....\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">The Agreement contains an integration clause. It further provides that \u201c[i]f any provision of this Agreement is held to be void or unenforceable, all the other provisions shall nevertheless continue in full force and effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Earl and Joy were never divorced. Earl moved to Ocean City, Maryland where he died, intestate, in June 1987. Michael lived with his father until Earl\u2019s death and, thereafter, with Cramer. In August 1987 Joy learned that Earl, by a designation executed in February 1984, had changed the beneficiary from her to Michael on the policy with Federal Employees Group Life Insurance on which $44,000 in death benefits were payable.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">Joy petitioned for probate of Earl\u2019s estate and was appointed personal representative under letters issued by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>Register of Wills for Worcester County. Thereafter Cram-er, and the other children of Earl, petitioned the Orphans\u2019 Court for Worcester County to remove Joy as personal representative. That court did so and appointed Cramer. Joy appealed to the Circuit Court for Worcester County pursuant to Maryland Code (1974, 1989 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 12-502 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (CJ) which provides for a de novo appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">The circuit court, after conducting an evidentiary hearing, affirmed with a written opinion. The court noted that there was no allegation that the Agreement had been obtained by fraud, misrepresentation or illegality, that Joy had been represented by counsel in the negotiations, and that she admitted executing the Agreement against the advice of counsel. Based on its review of the Agreement the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-6\">\u201cIn summary this Agreement is one that has been already substantially performed by both parties. Mr. Brees\u2019 failure to keep in force the Thirty-Four Thousand [Dollar] ($34,000.00) policy at issue is, if anything, a partial failure of consideration not resulting in the nullification of the Agreement. If any remedy is warranted, the Respondent, Mrs. Brees, must seek that relief in an action for breach (if such an action is maintainable).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Joy appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. We issued the writ of certiorari on our own motion prior to consideration of the case by the intermediate appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">In her brief Joy frankly admits that this appeal involves not only her right to administer Earl\u2019s estate but also, \u201cindirectly[,] the right to share in the estate\u201d of the intestate decedent. Brief of Appellant at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Joy\u2019s position is that her relinquishment of any interest in, and of the right to administer, Earl\u2019s estate was conditioned on Earl\u2019s performance of his promise to \u201cleave\u201d Joy as beneficiary of at least $34,000 of life insurance. Joy does not press a contention that the Agreement by its terms, either in its direct language or tyy proper interpretation, creates an express or true condition precedent to her performance. Compare J. Calamari &amp; J. Perillo, <em>The Law of Contracts </em>\u00a7\u00a7 11-6 and 11-7 (2d ed. 1977) (describing and illustrating express conditions). The substance of Joy\u2019s argument is that her waivers remained subject to a constructive condition, implied in or imposed by law, that Earl would substantially perform his promise concerning insurance. Failure of this constructive condition \u201cconfers rights on the aggrieved party not to perform unexecuted, mutually dependent provisions of the Agreement, and imposes liabilities on the defaulting party.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Reply Brief at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 237 (1981) expresses the same concept in this fashion: \u201c[I]t is a condition of each party\u2019s remaining duties to render performances to be exchanged under an exchange of promises that there be no uncured material failure by the other party to render any such performance due at an earlier time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Joy\u2019s waivers with respect to Earl\u2019s probate estate and Earl\u2019s promise concerning insurance for Joy\u2019s benefit are not apportioned equivalents under the Agreement. Joy argues that the interdependency of the provisions is supported by her testimony that she would not have signed the Agreement were it not for the promise of life insurance for her benefit. But the trial court was not obliged to accept that conclusion, and it did not do so. The circuit court observed in <em>dicta </em>that Joy\u2019s promise to insure her life for Earl\u2019s benefit might have been dependent on Earl\u2019s promise to insure his life for Joy\u2019s benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">In any event, we do not construe the Agreement to make Joy\u2019s waivers of rights in Earl\u2019s probate estate dependent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>on the performance of Earl\u2019s promise to insure for Joy\u2019s benefit. A number of reasons support this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">First, breach of a covenant in a prenuptial or separation agreement does not, <em>ipso facto, </em>excuse performance of another covenant by the other party. <em>See Schnepfe v. Schnepfe, </em>124 Md. 330, 92 A. 891 (1914) (wife\u2019s breach of prenuptial agreement, by deserting husband, does not relieve husband\u2019s estate of liability under husband\u2019s promise to bequeath a specific sum of money to wife). And <em>see </em>D. Thomas, <em>Maryland Divorce and Separation Law, </em>at 4-25 (MICPEL 4th ed. 1987) (\u201cWhere one breaches a provision in a marital settlement agreement which is not dependent upon other provisions, enforcement of the other provisions is unaffected\u201d). Thus, a clearer expression of the intent of the parties than appears in this instrument is required before concluding that the parties to the Agreement intended the waiver of rights in Earl\u2019s probate estate to be dependent on insurance for Joy\u2019s benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Reinforcing this conclusion is the express severability provision quoted above. Joy argues that the severability clause applies only if a provision \u201cis held to be void or unenforceable,\u201d an event which has not occurred here. Dependency of Joy\u2019s waiver on the performance of Earl\u2019s promise to insure is inconsistent with the provision that, in effect, Joy\u2019s waiver would be operative despite the invalidity or unenforceability of Earl\u2019s promise.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Significant here is Md.Code (1974), \u00a7 3-205 of the Estates and Trusts Article. Section 3-205 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-7\">\u201cThe right of election of a surviving spouse may be waived before or after marriage by a written contract, agreement, or waiver signed by the party waiving the right of election. Unless it provides to the contrary, a waiver of \u2018all rights\u2019 in the property or estate of a present or prospective spouse, or a complete property settlement entered into after or in anticipation of separation or divorce, is a waiver of any right to his family allowance as well as to his elective share by each spouse in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>property of the spouse, his right to letters under \u00a7 5-104, and is an irrevocable renunciation of any benefit which would pass to him from the other by intestate succession, by statutory share, or by virtue of the provisions of a will executed before the waiver or property settlement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ae9\">This statute contemplates that the waiver of the right to letters and to intestate succession is effective when made and, indeed, is declared to be \u201can irrevocable renunciation.\u201d Paragraph 17 of the Agreement is couched in similar terms (\u201ceach party hereby releases and forever discharges the other\u201d). On that reading of the Agreement and of \u00a7 3-205, there is no unexecuted performance on Joy\u2019s part with respect to administration and a share in intestacy. Joy\u2019s covenant was not to forbear exercising the right to letters and to share in intestacy; rather, it was a waiver effective when made.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">More important is the effect of public policy on whether to construe covenants as interdependent. Where the welfare of children would be adversely affected if specific covenants in a separation agreement were held to be interdependent, we have refused so to construe the agreement. <em>See Stancill v. Stancill, </em>286 Md. 530, 408 A.2d 1030 (1979) (obligation to pay non-modifiable wife maintenance not excused by wife\u2019s refusal to honor child visitation arrangements); <em>Seltzer v. Seltzer, </em>251 Md. 44, 246 A.2d 264 (1968) (per curiam) (obligation to pay child support not excused by custodial parent\u2019s refusal to honor visitation arrangements); <em>Frank v. Frank, </em>203 Md. 361, 101 A.2d 224 (1953), <em>on appeal after remand, </em>207 Md. 124, 113 A.2d 411 (1955) (wife\u2019s waiver of alimony not dependent on husband\u2019s performance of promise to pay child\u2019s medical expenses); <em>Hughes v. Burke, </em>167 Md. 472, 175 A. 335 (1934) (wife\u2019s breach of covenant not to molest husband does not excuse husband\u2019s obligation to pay spousal and child support).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Here, underlying \u00a7 3-205 as a matter of policy is the need to rely on the text of waivers in prenuptial and separation agreements in order to promote the efficient and reasonably swift administration of decedents\u2019 estates. Thus, we need <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>not in the instant matter delineate the full reach of the words \u201cirrevocable renunciation,\u201d as used in \u00a7 3-205. The legislative policy underlying that statute would be violated were we to imply in law a constructive condition which made the continued validity of Joy\u2019s waiver specifically dependent on Earl\u2019s performance of the promise to insure. Hence we do not impose the constructive condition that Joy seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The absence of interdependency between the covenants to insure and the waiver means that the materiality of the assumed breach by Earl must be measured against the whole of his promises in the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">The circuit court found nineteen considerations given by Earl, excluding that pertaining to the $34,000 life insurance benefits. Among these are Earl\u2019s fulfilled promises to live apart from Joy and to act as sole custodian of Michael. Aspects of these performances are not quantifiable in monetary terms. Clearly they are not insignificant performances in the couple\u2019s \u201cAgreement for Settlement of Marriage, Custody of Child, and Property.\u201d Moreover, it was uncontested that Earl performed his obligation to name Michael as the beneficiary of at least $17,000 of life insurance. In fact he provided even more than the additional $83,000 benefits to Michael included as an option in the Agreement. This is also consideration moving to Joy. <em>See McClellan v. McClellan, </em>52 Md.App. 525, 534-35, 451 A.2d 334, 340 (1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>295 Md. 283, <em>cert. denied, </em>462 U.S. 1135, 103 S.Ct. 3119, 77 L.Ed.2d 1372 (1983). On the other hand, breach of a covenant to maintain life insurance in a specific amount of money ordinarily can be remedied by a money judgment. It is not necessary, in order to give Joy adequate relief from the assumed breach, to strike down waivers valid when made. Thus, the circuit court did not err in finding that the nature of Earl\u2019s assumed breach, weighed against Earl\u2019s performance of other agreed considerations, did not produce a material breach of a constructive condition of substantial performance of the Agreement as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>Joy contends that the circuit court did not make the required determination of materiality because it viewed materiality as bearing on rescission of the contract. The circuit court concluded that the violation, if any, of the covenant to insure was only a partial, and not a total, \u201cfailure of consideration.\u201d The terminology \u201cfailure of consideration\u201d describes the same legal doctrine which more currently is described as the constructive condition of substantial performance. <em>See </em>3A A. Corbin, <em>Corbin on Contracts </em>\u00a7 658 (1960); 6 S. Williston, <em>Law of Contracts </em>\u00a7 814 (Jaeger 3d ed. 1962); Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 237, comment <em>a </em>(1981). Accordingly, the trial court applied the operative legal principle in its decision, and it applied that principle correctly to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR WORCESTER COUNTY AFFIRMED.
