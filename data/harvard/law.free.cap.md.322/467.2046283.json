The Court of Special Appeals reversed, concluding, over a dissent (Bishop, J.), that the plaintiff had failed to prove the claim. <em>Peoples Security Life Ins. Co. v. Watson, </em>81 Md.App. 420, 568 A.2d 835 (1990). The evidence most favorable to the plaintiff is that the discharge was in retaliation for the plaintiffs having sued a co-worker for a sexual harassment assault and battery, a joined claim on which the jury also found for the plaintiff. As explained below, an abusive discharge action lies.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Petitioner, Patricia A. Watson (Watson), was an at will employee of the respondent, Peoples Security Life Insurance Company (Peoples). Watson was a sales agent in Peoples\u2019 Hagerstown office. Another employee in that office was John Strausser (Strausser), the manager of a staff of agents other than the staff to which Watson was assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The operative facts were set forth by the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-7\">\u201cSoon after Strausser began his employment at the Hagerstown office in October or November of 1985, he suggested to [Watson] that he would like to have her on his staff. Becoming more insistent, he said things such as \u2018You\u2019re going to work for me whether you like it or not. I\u2019m going to show you how to make real money.\u2019 Not only did Strausser continue this importuning during working hours, but also he began telephoning [Watson] at night at her home, saying such things as T want you to come in here. I have to sleep on the floor in the office. And doll face you can make a lot of money if you do this.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq9\">\u201cWhen [Watson] informed her sales manager, Michael Leidhecker (Leidhecker), about Strausser\u2019s advances, Leidhecker indicated that he would bring this matter to the attention of Harold Shoemaker (Shoemaker), the agency manager who was Strausser\u2019s direct supervisor. Relating the incidents to Shoemaker herself, [Watson] got <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>only a laughing response from Shoemaker who told [Watson] not to worry about it. Then, on the evening of January 29, 1986, [Watson] came into the office with Leidhecker. Strausser and one of his sales agents, Bill Bowman (Bowman), were already in the office. Approaching [Watson] from behind, Strausser placed his hands on her shoulders, and made a biting motion toward her chest, bringing his mouth within an inch of [Watson\u2019s] breast. Even though [Watson] protested, Strausser repeated this maneuver.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">81 Md.App. at 424-25, 568 A.2d at 837.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Watson was at that time attired in a sweat shirt, advertising \u201cRocky\u2019s Pizza\u201d on the front, and in a pair of slacks. She testified that \u201cMr. Strausser come up behind me and said something about he was going to take a bite of pizza and was trying to bite me in my chest.\u201d She further testified that Strausser \u201ctried to take a bite of my breast.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASyR\">\u201cLeidhecker immediately brought the January 29 incident to the attention of Shoemaker. Shoemaker met with Strausser' and told him \u2018to stay absolutely away from her [Watson] and do not speak unless you are spoken to.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayj\">\u201cIn February 1986, [Watson] attended a training session at Hagerstown Junior College. Strausser attempted to grab [Watson] as she came out of the bathroom, asking \u2018Doll face what\u2019s the matter with you.\u2019 Besides attempting to grab [Watson] on that occasion, [Strausser] also verbally abused [Watson] at the training session on that day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-6\">\u201cWithout any prior notice to Strausser or to any representative of [Peoples], the initial complaint in the instant case was filed in the Circuit Court [for Washington County] on March 13, 1986. [Peoples\u2019] representatives were made aware of the fact that this action had been filed on March 17 or 18.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-7\">\u201cOn March 13, [Watson] requested permission from Leidhecker to be absent from work on March 14 so that she could keep a doctor\u2019s appointment. On the evening of March 14 or on March 15, [Watson] telephoned Leid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>hecker, and advised him that her physician had certified in writing that she would benefit from a two week medical leave of absence. Leidhecker approved that leave.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-4\">\u201cRobert D. Williams (Williams), a vice-president of [Peoples] and field supervisor of the area encompassing Hagerstown, learned on March 17 or 18 of the suit filed by [Watson] on March 13. He advised Shoemaker by telephone that he would come to Hagerstown from his Annapolis office on Thursday, March 20, \u2018to investigate and to try to get a clearer picture of just what the problem was\u2019 in connection with the gravemen of the complaint filed by [Watson]. Also, Williams asked Shoemaker to have the parties involved and any witnesses to the incident of January 29, 1986 present, so he could interview them on March 20.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 425-26, 568 A.2d at 837-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Williams interviewed a number of Peoples\u2019 employees on March 20, but Watson was not present. Shoemaker, and then Williams, spoke to Watson by telephone. Watson was unwilling to meet with Williams without having her lawyer present. Williams was unwilling to talk with Watson\u2019s lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Every Friday morning all of the Hagerstown sales agents met in the Peoples\u2019 office there. At those meetings the agents turned in premiums which they had collected during the preceding week. Williams testified that he advised Watson in their telephone conversation that she would be \u201cconsidered terminated\u201d if she did not appear for the regular agency meeting on Friday, March 21, 1986. Watson did not appear at that meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">Peoples, by letter signed by Shoemaker and dated March 20, 1986, gave Watson notice of termination effective March 28. The assigned reasons were failure to appear at the March 14 \u201cAgency meeting\u201d and insubordination for failure to report for work on Thursday, March 20 when requested by Williams to do so. An internal form of Peoples by which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>the agency manager reports to the home office on an employee\u2019s termination explains the reason for Watson\u2019s termination to be: \u201cUnreported absence and insubordination ... Williams discharged over phone for above reasons.\u201d Shoemaker testified that Williams had told Watson in the telephone conversation that she could \u201c \u2018take this as a notification of [her] termination.\u2019 \u201d Shoemaker also said that he had shown the termination letter, in rough draft form, to Williams on Thursday.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Williams testified that Shoemaker was to have written the letter of termination the following Monday if Watson did not attend the Friday, March 21 meeting. Williams denied telling Watson that she was terminated for not responding to his request to come to the office on March 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">The suit which Watson filed on March 13 joined Strausser and Peoples as defendants. The complaint contained three counts. Count I claimed against both for the assault and battery of January 29. Count II claimed against both for intentional infliction of emotional distress. Each of counts I and II aver that Strausser was acting in the course of his employment. The third count claimed only against Peoples on the theory that it had negligently retained or supervised Strausser. Count III alleged that the \u201csexual attacks of January 29,1986 were preceded by a series of annoying and sexually suggestive comments to [Watson] while on the premises of\u201d Peoples, that Watson had informed her supervisors of the \u201con-the-job and away from the job harassment,\u201d but that Peoples had not intervened to abate the \u201coffensive behavior\u201d of Strausser.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">After Watson was terminated by Peoples, she filed a first amended complaint. The amendment added certain new counts, of which only Count IV, claiming for abusive discharge, is relevant here. Watson alleged that her termination was motivated by the filing of the initial complaint in this action. She said that the termination violated her \u201cright to petition the court, guaranteed by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>Article 19 ... and Article 40 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">At trial Peoples moved for judgment under Maryland Rule 2-519(a) at the end of Watson\u2019s case. The motion was granted as to the assault and battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent retention counts. The circuit court concluded that the workers\u2019 compensation statute immunized Peoples from tort liability to an employee for an assault by a co-employee. Because the emotional distress to which the plaintiff was subjected had not been shown to be sufficiently severe, in the trial court\u2019s judgment, motions on count II were granted in favor of Strausser, as well as Peoples. Count III fell because the court also determined that the plaintiff had failed to demonstrate that Peoples could have prevented the January 29 assault and battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Peoples\u2019 motion for judgment on the abusive discharge claim was denied. Watson argued that the true reason for the firing violated her right to petition the court as guaranteed by constitutional privileges alleged in the amended complaint. In this respect Watson relied upon <em>Leese v. Baltimore County, </em>64 Md.App. 442, 468, 497 A.2d 159, 172, <em>cert. denied, </em>805 Md. 106, 501 A.2d 845 (1985), where the court said, \u201cWe can conceive of no clearer \u2018mandate of public policy\u2019 than the rights spelled out in the United States Constitution.\u201d Peoples pointed out that <em>Leese </em>involved public employment and that the quoted language had no application to a private employer. Peoples further cited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>certain decisions from other jurisdictions holding that the employer had not committed abusive discharge by terminating an at will employee who was suing the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">At the close of the case the defendants renewed their motions for judgment to the remaining counts for the reasons argued at the end of the plaintiffs case. The circuit court denied those motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">The case was submitted to the jury on special issues. They included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-6\">\u201cDid John Strausser commit an actionable assault or battery upon Patricia Watson?\u201d and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-7\">\u201cDid Peoples Life Insurance Company wrongfully discharge Patricia Watson\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANZ\">and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-8\">\u201cIf yes, was the discharge the result of ... retribution in contravention of a clear public policy?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">The court instructed the jury that abusive retaliatory discharge required termination of the employment relationship by the employer for a motive that \u201ccontravenes some clear mandate of public policy.\u201d The court further instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-10\">\u201cAnd it is the position of the plaintiff that her termination was motivated solely by her filing of a lawsuit against John Strausser and Peoples Life Insurance Company alleging assault and battery, intentional infliction of emotional harm and negligent supervision. You will note that neither of those last two counts are before you. But it is her position that she was discharged solely because of the filing of the law suit and therefore contravening a clear mandate of public policy by being punished for exercising her right of redress to the courts.\u201d [<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>Peoples excepted to the charge, arguing that \u201cit is the function of the ... court to determine the public policy and that [discharge for] suing an employer is simply [as] a matter of law not a violation of a clear mandate of public policy.\u201d Peoples further explained its exception by stating that the court should \u201cat least instruct the jury that ... suing an employer and the filing of any complaint, [ ]as that was what was done in this case, would not be sufficient to show a violation of a clear mandate of public policy____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">The jury returned a verdict against Strausser, finding \u201cassault or battery,\u201d and awarded $300 compensatory damages. The jury found that Peoples had wrongfully discharged Watson and awarded $15,000 compensatory and $20,000 punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Peoples appealed to the Court of Special Appeals.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There the employer argued, <em>inter alia, </em>error in the denial of its motion for judgment. Watson did not cross appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">\u201cViewing the evidence in a light most favorable to [Watson],\u201d the Court of Special Appeals concluded that Peoples\u2019 \u201cmotivation for discharging [Watson] might have been based on a desire to sever its relationship with an employee who was actively pursuing litigation against it.\u201d 81 Md. App. at 429, 568 A.2d at 839. On that basis the court looked to decisions in other jurisdictions involving claims of abusive discharge against an employer whose motive was retaliation against an employee who was suing the employer over a salary dispute. Those cases held that there was no tort of abusive discharge, and the Court of Special Appeals held accordingly. In dissent Judge Bishop pointed out that \u201c[t]he cases cited by the majority are distinguish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>able because they do not concern such an intensely personal affront to the employee as in the case <em>sub judice, </em>where the employee was sexually harassed to the point of an assault and battery.\u201d 81 Md.App. at 434, 568 A.2d at 842.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">We granted Watson\u2019s petition for certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">This Court has recognized \u201ca cause of action for abusive discharge by an employer of an at will employee when the motivation for the discharge contravenes some clear mandate of public policy[.]\u201d <em>Adler v. American Standard Corp., </em>291 Md. 81, 47, 432 A.2d 464, 473 (1981). In holding that the tort could lie on behalf of a worker who had a remedy for a wrongful discharge under a collective bargaining agreement, we said that \u201cthe public policy component of the tort is significant, and recognition of the availability of this cause of action to all employees, at will and contractual, will foster the State\u2019s interest in deterring particularly reprehensible conduct.\u201d <em>Ewing v. Koppers Co., </em>312 Md. 45, 49, 537 A.2d 1173, 1175 (1988). Here, Watson\u2019s first amended complaint, the instructions to the jury, and the way the case was tried and argued in the circuit court make plain that the jury found that the motive for the discharge arose out of Watson\u2019s filing of the initial complaint in this action. Under the instructions the jury could have found that discharge for filing any kind of suit was abusive. The jury also could have found that a discharge motivated by some one or more of the claims actually asserted by Watson was abusive. We shall consider whether there is liability under these various possibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">The trial court\u2019s instruction adopted the theory that discharge in retaliation for an employee\u2019s exercising that em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>ployee\u2019s right of redress in the courts is abusive. We do not understand the trial court to have adopted the notion that constitutional rights of free speech and due process restricted the freedom of action of the private employer, Peoples.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">To the extent that the instruction actually given permitted the jury to consider legal redress in the abstract as the relevant public policy, the instruction was erroneous. <em>Adler </em>held that allegations of discharge in retaliation for refusing to conceal \u201c \u2018commercial bribery\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018falsification of corporate documents\u2019 \u201d were too general to state a cause of action. 291 Md. at 46, 432 A.2d at 472. The same deficiency infects an abstract \u201cright of redress.\u201d The particular claim asserted which motivates the retaliatory discharge must be considered. <em>See, e.g., Ewing v. Koppers, </em>312 Md. 45, 537 A.2d 1173 (workers\u2019 compensation claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">But we need not decide whether Peoples\u2019 requested instruction waived the error (see n. 2, <em>supra), or </em>whether Peoples otherwise has failed to preserve the point. That is because there is reversible error by the trial court on the ground described below.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">The jury\u2019s verdict, finding abusive discharge, could also have been based upon a finding that Peoples\u2019 termination of Watson\u2019s employment was motivated exclusively by Watson\u2019s claim of: (1) assault and battery against Strausser, or (2) assault and battery against Peoples, or (3) intentional infliction against Strausser, or (4) intentional infliction against Peoples, or (5) negligent supervision against Peoples, or (6) some combination of these claims. Peoples\u2019 motion for judgment focused on Watson\u2019s suit against her employer. In that respect Peoples requested that the court instruct the jury that a discharge motivated by the suit against Peoples under the facts of this case was not abusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>We agree with Peoples\u2019 contention, made to the circuit court, that it is for the court to determine, on any state of facts generated by the evidence, whether the relevant public policy considerations constitute the \u201cclear mandate\u201d referred to in <em>Adler. </em>\u201cAs cases arise before this Court presenting various public policies as potential bases for invoking abusive discharge, this Court must perform a function much like that of determining whether to recognize a new tort.\u201d <em>Makovi v. Sherwin-Williams Co., </em>316 Md. 603, 623, 561 A.2d 179, 189 (1989). The trial court\u2019s task is similar to determining whether the absence of probable cause has been established to maintain a malicious prosecution claim. See <em>Palmer Ford, Inc. v. Wood, </em>298 Md. 484, 471 A.2d 297 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">If a discharge motivated by the claims made by Watson against Peoples implicated no \u201cclear mandate of public policy,\u201d then it was error to deny Peoples\u2019 motion for judgment as to that aspect of the case. On the same assumption it was also error to deny Peoples\u2019 exception to the court\u2019s failure to exclude Watson\u2019s claims against Peoples from jury consideration of possible motivations for abusive discharge. On the same hypothesis, the error would be a reversible one because we are not able to determine whether the jury predicated its verdict against Peoples\u2019 upon a legally insufficient theory as to which the claim of error has been preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">We agree with the view of the Court of Special Appeals in this case that, absent a statute expressing a clear mandate of public policy, there ordinarily is no violation of public policy by an employer\u2019s discharging an at will employee in retaliation for that employee\u2019s suing the employer. Where the at will employee\u2019s claim involves disputed compensation or other benefits the employer is not required either to retain a discontented employee or to risk an abusive discharge suit. Rather, the at will employee is required to. forego suit or risk discharge. <em>See Kavanagh v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number><em>KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, </em>566 F.Supp. 242 (N.D.Ill.1983); <em>Meredith v. C.E. Walther, Inc., </em>422 So.2d 761 (Ala.1982); <em>Becket v. Welton Becket &amp; Assocs., </em>39 Cal.App.3d 815, 114 Cal.Rptr. 531 (1974); <em>Alexander v. Kay Finlay Jewelers, </em>208 N.J.Super. 503, 506 A.2d 379, <em>cert. denied, </em>104 N.J. 466, 517 A.2d 449 (1986). The tort of abusive discharge also has been denied where the discharge was in retaliation for a personal injury suit involving a non-work related injury, see <em>Daniel v. Magma Copper Co., </em>127 Ariz. 320, 620 P.2d 699 (Ariz.App.1980) or involving the employees\u2019 minor child, see <em>DeMarco v. Publix Super Markets, Inc., </em>360 So.2d 134 (Fla.App.1978), <em>aff'd, </em>384 So.2d 1253 (1980) (per curiam). <em>But see Smith v. Atlas Off-Shore Boat Serv., Inc., </em>653 F.2d 1057 (5th Cir.1981) (tort lies, for compensatory damages only, for retaliation against Jones Act suit).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">There is no clear mandate of public policy which would make actionable Peoples\u2019 discharge of Watson if that discharge were motivated solely by Watson\u2019s initial claims against Peoples. Accordingly, Peoples is entitled, at a minimum, to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Watson did not plead, or argue that she had proved, that Peoples in fact authorized, condoned, encouraged, or ratified Strausser\u2019s sexual assault on Watson. Nevertheless, even if the evidence were sufficient to support a finding that Peoples was responsible for \u201chostile environment\u201d sexual discrimination based on Strausser\u2019s conduct, and even if the jury were to find that Watson\u2019s claim of liability for negligent supervision amounted to \u201chostile environment\u201d sexual discrimination, Peoples would not be liable for abusive discharge for retaliating against Watson\u2019s suit against Peoples.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">The United States Supreme Court has held that \u201chostile environment\u201d sex discrimination, <em>inter alia, </em>is actionable under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq. </em>(1988). <em>See Meritor Sav. Bank, F.S.B. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number><em>Vinson, </em>477 U.S. 57, 106 S.Ct. 2899, 91 L.Ed.2d 49 (1986). Applying portions of the guidelines issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in interpreting Title VII, the Court noted that sexual harassment actionable under Title VII included \u201c \u2018[u]nwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature.\u2019 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1604.11(a) (1985).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 65, 106 S.Ct. at 2404. Hostile environment sexual harassment need not be \u201cdirectly linked to the grant or denial of an economic <em>quid pro quo </em>where \u2018such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual\u2019s work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.\u2019 \u00a7 1604.11(a)(3).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 65, 106 S.Ct. at 2404-05. Inasmuch as Title VII prohibits retaliatory discharges for complaints about any violations of its prohibitions, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a), Title VII would prohibit discharge in retaliation for a complaint of hostile environment sexual harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">The source of the policy against hostile environment sexual discrimination is statutory, and exclusively statutory. Those statutes provide the remedies for their violation. Thus the abusive discharge tort would not reach Peoples\u2019 retaliation even if Watson\u2019s suit against it is interpreted to be based on Peoples\u2019 permitting a \u201chostile environment\u201d in which Strausser committed the assault. <em>See Chappell v. Southern Maryland Hosp., Inc., </em>320 Md. 483, 578 A.2d 766 (1990); <em>Makovi v.

We hold that it is contrary to a clear mandate of public policy to discharge an employee for seeking legal redress against a co-worker for workplace <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>sexual harassment culminating in assault and battery.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, Peoples was not entitled to a motion for judgment entirely dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Although \u201cdeclaration of public policy is normally the function of the legislative branch,\u201d <em>Adler, </em>291 Md. at 45, 432 A.2d at 472, <em>Adler </em>also pointed out that this \u201cCourt has not confined itself to legislative enactments, prior judicial decisions or administrative regulations when determining the public policy of this State.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The clear mandate of public policy which Watson\u2019s discharge could be found to have violated was the individual\u2019s interest in preserving bodily integrity and personality, reinforced by the state\u2019s interest in preventing breaches of the peace, and reinforced by statutory policies intended to assure protection from workplace sexual harassment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-6\">\u201cAn assault is any unlawful attempt to cause a harmful or offensive contact with the person of another or to cause an apprehension of such a contact. A battery is its consummation. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7\u00a7 13, 21 (1965); Prosser, <em>Law of Torts, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 9, 10 (4th ed. 1971).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A97\"><em>Continental Casualty Co. v.

In the case before us the evidence supports finding a battery as well as an assault because Strausser placed his hands on Watson\u2019s shoulders in both of his attempts to bite her on the breast. \u201c \u2018Since the right protected is that of the person attacked, [any] secret intention of the wrongdoer not to perform the threatened act ... is not a legal excuse in a civil action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dixon v. State, </em>302 Md. 447, 458, 488 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>962, 967 (1985) (quoting <em>Hayes v. State, </em>211 Md. 111, 115, 126 A.2d 576, 578 (1956)).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">The right to bring a civil action based on the apprehension of an offensive bodily contact has been traced in the common law to 1348 or 1349. <em>See </em>Carpenter, <em>Intentional Invasion of Interest of Personality, </em>13 Or.L.Rev. 227, 237 n. 57 (1934). \u201cThe explanation ... of this early recognition of the right to be free from apprehension of violence is found in the fact that the excitement of such an apprehension was likely to result in breaches of the peace, and if the law gave a remedy it would thus tend to discourage them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">We have also said that assault \u201c \u2018has substantially (if not exactly) the same meaning in our law of torts as in our criminal law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dixon v. State, </em>302 Md. at 458, 488 A.2d at 967 (quoting <em>Kellum v. State, </em>223 Md. 80, 84-85, 162 A.2d 473, 476 (1960)). Watson\u2019s testimony supports an inference that Strausser\u2019s actual intent was to bite her on the breast. In a criminal proceeding, were the trier of fact persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that Strausser did so intend for sexual gratification, he would be guilty of attempted fourth degree sex offense. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1957, 1987 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 464C; <em>Gray v. State, </em>43 Md.App. 238, 403 A.2d 853, <em>cert. denied, </em>286 Md. 747 (1979).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Watson also proved that the assault and battery were part of a pattern of sexual harassment by Strausser both at the workplace and elsewhere. We have seen, <em>supra, </em>Part III B, that hostile environment sexual discrimination violates Title VII. This Court has held that the Maryland Fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Employment Practices Law, Md.Code (1957, 1986 Repl.Vol.), Art. 49B, \u00a7\u00a7 14-18 (the Act), not only prohibits retaliatory discharges for complaints about sexual harassment in the workplace, but also that those prohibitions apply even if the complainant is not the direct victim of that harassment. <em>See Chappell, </em>820 Md. 483, 578 A.2d 766.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">The public policy manifested in Title VII and in the Act prohibits, and provides statutory remedies against, retaliatory discharge for seeking legal redress for sexual harassment which need not amount to assault and battery. <em>A fortiori, </em>where, as here, a retaliatory discharge is in response to an employee\u2019s seeking legal redress against a co-worker because of sexual harassment which does amount to assault and battery, <em>Adler\u2019s </em>requirement of a clear mandate of public policy is satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Peoples submits that Watson\u2019s \u201cfailure to raise unlawful sex discrimination as a \u2018clear mandate of public policy\u2019 at trial constitutes a waiver of such issues in an appeal.\u201d Respondent\u2019s Brief at 23. The <em>issue </em>in this case with respect to count IV has always included whether Peoples\u2019 discharge of Watson violated a clear mandate of public policy. In the trial court Watson <em>argued </em>general concepts of access to the courts and due process. Now, in this Court, Watson, inspired by the dissent in the Court of Special Appeals, also emphasizes the sexual harassment aspects of the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">This contention by Peoples is analogous to that which we rejected in <em>Crown Oil &amp; Wax Co. v. Glen Constr. Co., </em>320 Md. 546, 578 A.2d 1184 (1990). There the issue was whether a partnership which had acquired the assets of a corporate real estate developer could arbitrate directly with a construction contractor who agreed to arbitrate with the corporation. Although the partnership had argued a third-party beneficiary theory in the trial court, we considered and accepted an argument that the corporation was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>successor-in-interest to the corporation. <em>Id. </em>at 560-61, 578 A.2d at 1190-91.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Further, Maryland Rule 8-131(a) provides that \u201c[ojrdinarily, the appellate court will not decide any ... issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court____\u201d Even if sexual harassment assault and battery were a new issue in this case, we exercise our discretion to consider it. There is no prejudice to Peoples. The sexual harassment aspects of this case have been patent from the beginning. In her initial complaint and in evidence at trial Watson relied on the pattern of sexual harassment in an effort to prove Peoples\u2019 negligent supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">Peoples also contends that abusive discharge is not available here in light of <em>Makovi v. Sherwin-Williams Co., </em>316 Md. 603, 561 A.2d 179. Peoples says that <em>Makovi </em>\u201cheld that the existence of a remedy under Title YII [and the Act] barred an action for wrongful discharge [in a] case which relies upon allegations of unlawful sexual discrimination as the required \u2018clear mandate of public policy.\u2019 \u201d Respondent\u2019s Brief at 21. Peoples\u2019 argument stretches the holding in <em>Makovi </em>beyond its context.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\"><em>Makovi </em>was a prenatal protection, alleged sex discrimination case. The substance of the analysis in <em>Makovi </em>can be found in this Court\u2019s presentation of the respondent employer\u2019s principal argument, with which we expressly agreed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-10\">\u201cThe respondent\u2019s principal argument is that abusive discharge does not lie where the public policy sought to be vindicated by the tort is expressed in a statute which carries its own remedy for vindicating that public policy. Sherwin-Williams does not argue that the General Assembly in 1965 or 1977 intended to preclude a tort which did not then exist and does not argue that the General Assembly intended to preclude or preempt any and all remedies arising out of facts constituting a violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>Art. 49B. In addition, Sherwin-Williams submits that the anti-discrimination goal of the allegedly applicable statutes and the remedy legislatively created to achieve that goal together make up the public policy. In the employer\u2019s view, Makovi seeks to divorce the statutory remedy from the goal and, in the name of achieving the goal, enlarge the remedy for a statutory violation to full compensatory and punitive damages in tort.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 609, 561 A.2d at 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Chief Judge Murphy, writing for the Court in <em>Chappell, </em>320 Md. 483, 578 A.2d 766, said, speaking of <em>Makovi, </em>that \u201c[w]e held that the tort of abusive discharge will not lie where the public policy sought to be vindicated by the tort is expressed in a statute which carries its own remedy for vindicating that public policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 490, 578 A.2d at 770.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Thus, in both <em>Makovi </em>and in <em>Chappell, </em>the public policy component of the abusive discharge tort was found in Title VII and in the Act, but not elsewhere. In that context,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A58X\">\u201cthe generally accepted reason for recognizing the tort, that of vindicating an otherwise civilly unremedied public policy violation, does not apply. Further, allowing full tort damages to be claimed in the name of vindicating the statutory public policy goals upsets the balance between right and remedy struck by the Legislature in establishing the very policy relied upon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-7\"><em>Makovi, </em>316 Md. at 626, 561 A.2d at 190.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\"><em>Makovi </em>did not rest its holding \u201con any legislative preemption but on the nature of the tort.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 605, 561 A.2d at 180. Essentially Peoples seeks a preemption result. But the fact that the assault and battery in the instant case arise out of sexual harassment in the workplace does not end the inquiry. Long antedating Title VII and the Act, public policy, as manifested in civil and criminal law, provided sanctions against attempted and consummated harmful and offensive touching of the person, whether or not sexually motivated. Had Title VII or the Act never been enacted, a clear mandate of public policy still supported Watson\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>recourse to legal redress against Strausser under the circumstances here. Where right and remedy are part of the same statute which is the sole source of the public policy opposing the discharge, <em>Makovi </em>and <em>Chappell </em>dictate the result that the tort of abusive discharge, by its nature, does not lie. In the instant matter there are multiple sources of public policy, some within and some without Title VII and the Act. By including prior public policy against sexual assaults, the anti-discrimination statutes reinforce that policy; they do not supersede it.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\"><em>Makovi </em>foreshadowed this approach to multiple source public policy by favorable reference to a decision sustaining the tort where the discharge was in retaliation for resisting <em>quid pro quo </em>sexual harassment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-5\">\u201cSometimes the facts underlying a discharge constitute both a violation of an anti-discrimination statute and of another, more narrowly focused, statute reflecting clear public policy but providing no civil remedy [for the discharge]. <em>Lucas v. Brown &amp; Root, Inc., </em>736 F.2d 1202 (8th Cir.1984) illustrates an analysis which utilizes the narrower ground. There the plaintiff alleged that she had been fired because she refused to sleep with her foreman. The court reasoned that \u2018[a] woman invited to trade herself for a job is in effect being asked to become a prostitute.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 1205. Prostitution was a crime denounced by Arkansas statute. The Eighth Circuit predicted the Supreme Court of Arkansas would find an abusive discharge because the plaintiff \u2018should not be penalized for refusing to do what the law forbids.\u2019 <em>Id.\"</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Av4\">316 Md. at 620, 561 A.2d at 187.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Similarly, the same clear public policy which encourages Watson\u2019s legal recourse against one who degradingly assaulted her makes tortious a discharge that retaliates against that recourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">In the Court of Special Appeals, Peoples presented additional questions which that court did not reach, in view of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>its holding. It appears that Peoples would be entitled to a judgment of dismissal, without prejudice, if it is successful on one of those open questions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Consequently, this case must be remanded to the Court of Special Appeals for consideration of at least that additional question.

Because I believe the majority\u2019s reasoning and conclusion to be fundamentally flawed, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">As established in <em>Adler v. American Standard Corp., </em>291 Md. 31, 47, 432 A.2d 464, 473 (1981), and reiterated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>today by the majority, \u201cMaryland does recognize a cause of action for abusive discharge by an employer of an at will employee when the motivation for the discharge contravenes some clear mandate of public policy.\u201d <em>Adler </em>made clear that, \u201cwhen determining the public policy of this State,\u201d this Court \u201chas not confined itself to legislative enactments, prior judicial decisions or administrative regulations.\u201d 291 Md. at 45, 432 A.2d at 472. The majority today, however, seems to hold that, absent a <em>statute </em>clearly, establishing a mandate of public policy, an employer may fire an employee for suing the employer, regardless of the basis of the complaint. In deciding that there is \u201cno clear mandate of public policy which would make actionable Peoples\u2019 discharge of Watson if that discharge were motivated solely by Watson\u2019s initial claims against Peoples,\u201d the majority misapprehends the facts of the case and disregards the principles of law enunciated in <em>Adler, </em>in <em>Makovi v.

The record supports a finding that Peoples knew of Mr. Strausser\u2019s actions but failed to take prompt or adequate remedial action. <em>See Monge v. Beebe Rubber Co., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>114 N.H. 130, 132-134, 316 A.2d 549, 551-552 (1974) (plaintiff wrongfully discharged where she was terminated, in part, for refusing foreman\u2019s advances and manager of company \u201cknew her foreman used his position to force his attentions on the female employees\u201d). <em>See also College-Town v.

Mr. Leidhecker said that he would talk to Mr. Strausser and to Mr. Shoemaker, the Agency Manager who had supervisory control over Mr. Strausser. Mr. Leidhecker also suggested that Ms. Watson speak directly with Mr. Shoemaker. Ms. Watson testified at trial that when she told Mr. Shoemaker about the harassing phone calls, he \u201ckind of laughed at me and told me not to worry about it.\u201d In fact there is no indication from the record that anyone in management at Peoples, before or after the assault and battery, took any meaningful steps to stop Mr. Strausser\u2019s harassment of Ms. Watson. Nevertheless, shortly after Ms. Watson filed suit against Mr. Strausser and Peoples because of the sexual harassment, she was fired.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According to the majority\u2019s opinion, it was consistent with public policy for Peoples to fire Ms. Watson for filing a complaint containing allega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>tions of sexual harassment on the job even though it was aware of the harassment and did nothing to stop it.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">The majority states in Part IV of its opinion, citing <em>Makovi v. Sherwin-Williams Co., supra, </em>316 Md. 603, 561 A.2d 179, that there may be \u201cmultiple sources of public policy, some within and some without Title VII and the [Maryland Fair Employment Practices Law, Code (1957, 1991 Repl.Vol.), Art. 49B, \u00a7\u00a7 14-18].\u201d But, when discussing Peoples\u2019 discharge of Ms. Watson for filing suit against it based on the same facts alleged in her complaint against Mr. Strausser, the majority ignores any alternate sources of public policy. Contrary to the majority\u2019s myopic view, whether the public policy is found in the Maryland Constitution, in other statutes, in the common law, or in the actions of Maryland governmental entities, \u201c[i]t cannot seriously be doubted that this State has an undeclared yet clearly mandated public policy\u201d proscribing workplace sexual harassment. <em>Peoples Security Life v. Watson, supra, </em>81 Md.App. at 434, 568 A.2d at 842 (Bishop, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Article 46 of The Maryland Declaration of Rights provides that \u201c[e]quality of rights under the law shall not be abridged or denied because of sex.\u201d Although this constitutional provision may not directly apply to private employers, it nonetheless establishes a public policy in Maryland that an individual should not be subjected to sex-based discrimination. <em>See James v. Marinship Corp., </em>25 Cal.2d 721, 739-740, 155 P.2d 329, 339 (1944). It is well settled that workplace sexual harassment is a form of sex-based employment discrimination. <em>See, e.g., Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, </em>477 U.S. 57, 66-67, 106 S.Ct. 2399, 2405, 91 L.Ed.2d 49, 59 (1986); <em>Katz v. Dole, </em>709 F.2d 251, 254-255 (4th Cir.1983); <em>Holien v. Sears, Roebuck and Co., </em>298 Or. 76, 87, 689 P.2d 1292, 1298 (1984). Therefore, if Peoples fired Ms. Watson for filing a complaint against it alleging ratification of sexual harassment on the job, it contravened a clear public policy mandated by the Maryland Constitution. <em>See, e.g., Rojo v. Kliger, </em>52 Cal.3d 65, 276 Cal.Rptr. 130, 145-146, 801 P.2d 373, 388-389 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>As noted by the majority today, this Court stated in <em>Makovi v. Sherwin-Williams Co., supra, </em>316 Md. at 620, 561 A.2d at 187, that \u201cthe facts underlying a discharge [may] constitute both a violation of an anti-discrimination statute and of another, more narrowly focused, statute reflecting clear public policy but providing no civil remedy. <em>Lucas v. Brown &amp; Root, Inc., </em>736 F.2d 1202 (8th Cir.1984), illustrates an analysis which utilizes the narrower ground. There the plaintiff alleged that she had been fired because she refused to sleep with her foreman. The court reasoned that \u2018[a] woman invited to trade herself for a job is in effect being asked to become a prostitute.\u2019 \u201d <em>See also, Harrison v. Edison Brothers Apparel Stores, Inc., </em>924 F.2d 530 (4th Cir.1991). Given the facts of the present case, I fail to see why this Court could not find that Peoples\u2019 discharge of Ms. Watson violated a clear mandate of public policy as set forth in Maryland\u2019s statute prohibiting pandering.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The record reflects that Mr. Strausser, although he did not directly supervise Ms. Watson, held a higher position at Peoples than Ms. Watson. In addition, the record shows that, aside from making inappropriate comments to the plaintiff at work, he called her at home in the evenings imploring, \u201cI want you to come in here. I have to sleep on the floor in the office. And doll face, you can make a lot of money if you do this.\u201d Furthermore, the plaintiff testified that Mr. Strausser threatened that if she did not come into the office with him at night he would use his position to \u201churt [her] financially.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">Even absent constitutional or statutory provisions, I believe that Peoples violated a clear mandate of public policy if it fired Ms. Watson in retaliation for her lawsuit against Peoples. <em>See </em>Maryland Special Joint Committee, <em>Gender Bias in the Courts, </em>at 80-83, 93-96 (1989) (the report generated by the committee appointed by Chief Judge Murphy condemns sexual harassment in the workplace); <em>Chamberlin v. 101 Realty, Inc., </em>626 F.Supp. 865, 867 (D.N.H. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>1985), <em>citing Monge v. Beebe Rubber Co., supra, </em>114 N.H. 130, 316 A.2d 549 (recognizing that under New Hampshire law workplace sexual harassment is against public policy). <em>See also Smith v. Atlas Off-Shore Boat Service, Inc., </em>653 F.2d 1057, 1062 (5th Cir.1981) (court finds cause of action for wrongful discharge where seaman alleged discharge in retaliation for filing personal injury suit under the Jones Act, stating \u201c[t]he employer should not be permitted to use his absolute discharge right to retaliate against a seaman for seeking to recover what is due him or to intimidate the seaman from seeking legal redress. The right to discharge at will should not be allowed to bar the courthouse door\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">Finally, the cases relied on by the majority for the proposition that, \u201cabsent a statute expressing a clear mandate of public policy, there ordinarily is no violation of public policy by an employer\u2019s discharging an at will employee in retaliation for that employee\u2019s suing the employer,\u201d are distinguishable from the present case. First, it is apparent from the cases cited by the majority from Alabama and Florida that those courts did not recognize the cause of action for abusive discharge. Second, other cases cited involve such issues as salary disputes; none involve \u201csuch an intensely personal affront to the employee as in the case <em>sub judice, </em>where the employee was sexually harassed to the point of an assault and battery\u201d. <em>Watson v. Peoples, </em>81 Md.App. at 434, 568 A.2d at 842 (Bishop, J., dissenting). <em>See also Carlson v. Crater Lake Lumber Co., </em>103 Or.App. 190, 194, 796 P.2d 1216, 1219 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">The majority in Part III B of its opinion reiterates the holding set forth in <em>Makovi v. Sherwin Williams, supra, </em>316 Md. 603, 561 A.2d 179, and <em>Chappell v. Southern Maryland Hosp., </em>320 Md. 483, 578 A.2d 766 (1990), that Title VII and the Maryland Fair Employment Practices Law, Code (1957, 1991 Repl.Vol.), Art. 49B, \u00a7\u00a7 14-18, provide the exclusive remedies against the employer for sex discrimination in employment. With regard to this part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>the majority opinion, I continue to adhere to the dissents in both of those cases.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b549-6\">. The record reflects that Ms. Watson also filed a complaint against John Strausser and Peoples with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The EEOC conducted an investigation and found no probable cause to believe that Peoples had engaged in unlawful sexual discrimination and advised her of her right to file an action under Title VII. At the time, Ms. Watson may have elected not to proceed under Title VII because it may have been assumed that federal courts had exclusive jurisdiction over Title VII claims. It has become settled since Ms. Watson\u2019s trial that Maryland courts have concurrent jurisdiction over Title VII claims. <em>Sweeney v. Hartz Mountain Corp., </em>319 Md. 440, 443, 573 A.2d 32, 33 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b551-5\">.
