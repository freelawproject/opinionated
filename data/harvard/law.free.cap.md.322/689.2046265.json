The second issue concerns the insured status of the deceased and the effect of that status on coverage for the wrongful death claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">Carol and Robin Forbes were married and had two children, George and Connie. Prior to August 4, 1984, the four resided in the home of Robin Forbes\u2019s mother in Baltimore City. On August 4, 1984, Carol Forbes left her mother-in-law\u2019s home and, along with Delbert Dean, moved into an apartment in Easton, Maryland, under a month-to-month lease. On or about August 27, 1984, Carol Forbes removed Connie and George from Baltimore to the Easton apartment. Robin Forbes did not consent to the removal of the children. In addition, the uncontradicted evidence before the trial court was that Carol Forbes at no time asked for or discussed with Robin Forbes a divorce. Carol Forbes did not change her voter registration to Easton and did not notify the Motor Vehicle Administration of any change in her address.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">On September 22, 1984, Carol Forbes was killed in an accident while riding as a passenger in Delbert Dean\u2019s uninsured motor vehicle. Connie and George Forbes were also passengers and were injured in the accident. The accident was caused by the negligence of Dean, the uninsured driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">Robin Forbes, as spouse of Carol Forbes and as next friend of George and Connie Forbes, filed an action in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County against his uninsured motorist carrier, Harleysville Mutual Insurance Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>pany, and against Delbert Dean, the tortfeasor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Counts one and two of the complaint, as amended, sought damages on behalf of Connie and George Forbes for the personal injuries which they had received in the accident. In counts three, four, and five, claims were made on behalf of Connie, George and Robin Forbes respectively for the wrongful death of Carol Forbes.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">Dean fled the jurisdiction and has never been located. An order of default was entered against Dean on all five counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Harleysville filed a motion for summary judgment, and, after a hearing, the circuit court denied the motion as to counts one and two requesting damages for the personal injuries to the children. With regard to counts three, four and five, however, summary judgment was granted in favor of Harleysville. The circuit court held that wrongful death damages could not be recovered by Robin Forbes and the children under the uninsured motorist coverage because, at the time of the wrongful death, Carol Forbes had moved out of Robin Forbes\u2019s home and, therefore, was not an \u201cinsured\u201d under the policy. On June 28, 1988, the circuit court entered judgment on counts one and two against Delbert Dean and Harleysville, and on counts three, four and five solely against Dean.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>Robin Forbes, individually and on behalf of the children and the subrogee Maryland Automobile Insurance Fund, filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. While Forbes\u2019s appeal was pending in that court, the Court of Special Appeals filed its opinion in <em>Globe American Casualty v. Chung, </em>76 Md.App. 524, 547 A.2d 654 (1988), <em>vacated, </em>322 Md. 713, 589 A.2d 956 (1991), in which the Court of Special Appeals took the position that the statutorily required uninsured motorist coverage in automobile insurance policies does not include wrongful death claims. In reaching this result, the Court of Special Appeals relied upon the language of the insurance policy involved in that case, and upon the language of Maryland Code (1957, 1991 Repl.Vol.), Art. 48A, \u00a7 541(c)(2), which refers to \u201cdamages which the <em>insured </em>is entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an uninsured vehicle because of <em>bodily injuries </em>sustained in an accident arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of such uninsured motor vehicle.\u201d (Emphasis added). The use of the phrase \u201cbodily injuries\u201d without any reference to \u201cdeath,\u201d and the use of the word \u201cinsured\u201d without any reference to \u201cthe surviving next-of-kin,\u201d led the Court of Special Appeals to conclude that wrongful death claims were not encompassed by the statutorily mandated uninsured motorist coverage. <em>Globe American Casualty v. Chung, supra, </em>76 Md.App. at 541, 547 A.2d at 662.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">After the Court of Special Appeals filed its opinion in the <em>Chung </em>case, but before the present case was briefed and argued in the Court of Special Appeals, the plaintiff-appellant Robin Forbes filed in this Court a petition for a writ of certiorari. The petition presented the following two questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-6\">1. \u201cDoes the uninsured motorist statute require coverage for wrongful death claims, contrary to the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 holding in <em>Globe American Casualty v. Boo Hyun Chung, Pers. Rep.?\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-7\">2. \u201cIs an uninsured motorist insurance carrier responsible to pay a judgment in favor of minor children for the wrongful death of their mother, where the mother was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>married to but not living with the father at the time she was killed by the negligent uninsured driver?\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASyC\">This Court granted the petition, and we shall reverse that portion of the judgment in favor of Harleysville concerning the wrongful death claims on behalf of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">The first issue is whether the uninsured motorist coverage required by statute extends to damages arising from a wrongful death caused by the negligence of an uninsured motorist.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">The General Assembly has enacted a comprehensive insurance scheme, with numerous mandatory coverages, for motor vehicles required to be registered in Maryland and for motor vehicle insurance policies issued in Maryland. <em>See </em>Code (1977, 1987 Repl.Vol., 1990 Cum.Supp.) \u00a7\u00a7 17-101 through 17-110 of the Transportation Article; Code (1957, 1991 Repl.Vol.), Art. 48A, \u00a7\u00a7 234B, 240AA through 242, 243 through 243L, and 538 through 547. <em>See, e.g., Nationwide v. USF &amp; G, </em>314 Md. 131, 133-136, 550 A.2d 69, 70-71 (1988); <em>Lee v. Wheeler, </em>310 Md. 233, 528 A.2d 912 (1987); <em>Jennings v. Government Employees Ins., </em>302 Md. 352, 357, 488 A.2d 166, 168-169 (1985). As part of this comprehensive scheme, Art. 48A, \u00a7 541(c), requires that \u201cevery policy of motor vehicle liability insurance issued, sold, or delivered in this State\u201d contain uninsured motorist coverage \u201cin at least the amounts required under Title 17 of the Transportation Article....\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>In taking the position that the uninsured motorist coverage required by Art. 48A, \u00a7 541(c), does not encompass wrongful death claims, the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Globe American Casualty Company v. Chung, supra, </em>and Harleysville in the instant case, seized upon certain words in one sentence of \u00a7 541(c)(2), without regard to the legislative purpose reflected in \u00a7 541(c) and without regard to the other language in the section.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nevertheless, in construing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>statutes in order to ascertain the legislature\u2019s intent, we do not read particular language in isolation or out of context. We construe statutory language in light of the legislature\u2019s general purpose and in the context of the statute as a whole. <em>Kaczorowski v. City of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 513-516, 525 A.2d 628, 632-633 (1987). <em>See Jones v. State, </em>311 Md. 398, 405, 535 A.2d 471, 474-475 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">Our eases have emphasized that the uninsured motorist statute \u201cembodies a public policy \u2018to assure financial compensation to the innocent victims of motor vehicle accidents who are unable to recover from financially irresponsible uninsured motorists.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lane v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>321 Md. 165, 169, 582 A.2d 501, 503 (1990), <em>quoting Pennsylvania Nat\u2019l. Mut. v. Gartelman, </em>288 Md. 151, 157, 416 A.2d 734, 737 (1980). <em>See Lee v. Wheeler, supra, </em>310 Md. at 238, 528 A.2d at 915. Also, we have consistently stated that \u201cthe purpose of uninsured motorist statutes is \u2018that each insured under such coverage have available the full statutory minimum to exactly the same extent as would have been available had the tortfeasor complied with the minimum requirements of the financial responsibility Law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Webb, </em>291 Md. 721, 737, 436 A.2d 465, 474 (1981), <em>quoting Webb v. State Farm </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number><em>Mutual Automobile Ins. Co., </em>479 S.W.2d 148, 152 (Mo.App.1972). <em>See Hoffman v. United Services Auto. Ass\u2019n, </em>309 Md. 167, 172, 522 A.2d 1320, 1322 (1987). <em>See also Lee v. Wheeler, supra, </em>310 Md. at 237, 528 A.2d at 914. Moreover, we have said that \u201c \u2018the remedial nature\u2019 of the uninsured motorist statute \u2018dictates a liberal construction in order to effectuate its purpose____\u2019\u201d <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Webb, supra, </em>291 Md. at 737, 436 A.2d at 475, <em>quoting State Farm Mut. Ins. Co. v. Maryland Auto. Ins. Fund, </em>277 Md. 602, 605, 356 A.2d 560, 562 (1976). Finally, limitations on coverage or exclusions in insurance policies, which are inconsistent with the purpose of the uninsured motorist statutory provisions, are unenforceable. <em>See, e.g., Nationwide v. USF &amp; G, supra, </em>314 Md. at 135, 141, 550 A.2d at 71, 74; <em>Gable v. Colonial Ins. Co., </em>313 Md. 701, 703-704, 548 A.2d 135, 136 (1988); <em>Lee v. Wheeler, supra, </em>310 Md. 233, 528 A.2d 912; <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Webb, supra, </em>291 Md. at 730, 436 A.2d at 471; <em>Pennsylvania Nat\u2019l. Mut. v. Gartelman, supra, </em>288 Md. 151, 416 A.2d 734; <em>Reese v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>285 Md. 548, 554-556, 403 A.2d 1229, 1233-1234 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">The liability coverage in standard automobile insurance policies, and the liability coverage mandated by Maryland financial responsibility law, encompass wrongful death claims. <em>See Daley v. United Services, </em>312 Md. 550, 541 A.2d 632 (1988); Code (1977, 1987 Repl.Vol., 1990 Cum. Supp.), \u00a7 17-103(b) of the Transportation Article (\u201cThe security required under this subtitle shall provide for at least: (1) The payment of claims for bodily injury <em>or death </em>arising from an accident ... \u201d) (emphasis added). As pointed out above, the purpose of the required uninsured motorist coverage is to make available the same coverage as would have been available had the tortfeasor complied with the liability insurance requirements of the financial responsibility law. Since the liability insurance required by the financial responsibility law includes wrongful death claims, it follows that the uninsured motorist coverage also includes wrongful death claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>The language of the uninsured motorist statutory provision, Art. 48A, \u00a7 541(c), confirms that the General Assembly contemplated coverage for wrongful death claims. Although the sentence in paragraph (2) of \u00a7 541(c) relied on by the Court of Special Appeals and by Harleysville refers only to \u201cbodily injuries sustained in an accident,\u201d paragraph (1) of \u00a7 541(c), defining the term \u201cuninsured motor vehicle,\u201d refers to \u201cbodily injury or death of an insured.\u201d Paragraph (1) also refers to the \u201cliability under ... liability insurance policies ... applicable to the bodily injury or death.\u201d In addition, paragraph (3) of \u00a7 541(c) measures the liability limit of the uninsured motorist carrier as \u201cthe amount of that [uninsured motorist] coverage less the sum of the limits under the liability insurance policies ... applicable to the bodily injury or death of the insured.\u201d This obviously reflects the General Assembly\u2019s contemplation that uninsured motorist coverage, to the same extent as liability coverage, is \u201capplicable to the ... death of the insured\u201d and, like liability coverage, embraces wrongful death claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">Moreover, \u00a7 541(c)(2) states that \u201c[i]n no case shall the uninsured motorist coverage be less than the coverage afforded a qualified person under Article 48A, \u00a7\u00a7 243H and 243-1.\u201d These sections relate to claims not covered by insurance and payable by the Maryland Automobile Insurance Fund as successor to the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund. <em>See Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Webb, supra, </em>291 Md. at 726 n. 3, 436 A.2d at 468-469 n. 3; <em>State Farm Mut. Ins. Co. v. Maryland Auto. Ins. Fund, supra, </em>277 Md. at 603 n. 1, 356 A.2d at 561 n. 1. We have held that, under this provision of \u00a7 541(c)(2), uninsured motorist coverage must be as broad as the coverage under \u00a7\u00a7 243H and 243-1; limitations on coverage which are not contemplated by \u00a7\u00a7 243H and 243-1 are not allowed under \u00a7 241(c). <em>State Farm v. Maryland Auto. Ins. Fund, supra, </em>277 Md. at 605-606, 356 A.2d at 562. <em>See Lee v. Wheeler, supra, </em>310 Md. at 236-237, 528 A.2d at 914. Section 243H states that \u201c[c]laims for the <em>death </em>of or personal injury to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>qualified person\u201d will be covered, and \u00a7 243-1 sets the maximum amount payable for the injury or death of any one person at $20,000 (emphasis added). This Court has taken the position that \u00a7\u00a7 243H and 243-1 encompass wrongful death claims. <em>Unsatisfied Claim &amp; Judgment Fund v. Hamilton, </em>256 Md. 56, 259 A.2d 303 (1969). Consequently, as the uninsured motorist coverage under \u00a7 541(c) must be as broad as the coverage under \u00a7\u00a7 243H and 243-1, and as \u00a7\u00a7 243H and 243-1 include wrongful death claims, the conclusion is inescapable that \u00a7 541(c) also includes wrongful death claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">In recent years this Court has dealt with the uninsured motorist coverage required by \u00a7 541(c) in a multitude of opinions. The General Assembly has amended \u00a7 541(c) on numerous occasions. Neither the opinions of this Court nor the actions of the General Assembly, including the underlying legislative history, have even intimated that wrongful death claims might not be embraced within \u00a7 541(c). On the contrary, we have, although without any discussion of the issue, treated wrongful death claims as covered by \u00a7 541(c). <em>See Hoffman v. United Services Auto. Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>309 Md. 167, 522 A.2d 1320; <em>Yarmuth v. Gov\u2019t Employees Ins. Co., </em>286 Md. 256, 407 A.2d 315 (1979). Furthermore, the cases throughout the country which have considered the issue have held that wrongful death claims are within uninsured motorist coverage. <em>See, e.g., Williams v. Williams, </em>23 Ariz.App. 191, 531 P.2d 924 (1975); <em>Zeagler v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>166 So.2d 616 (Fla.App.1964), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>172 So.2d 450 (Fla.1965); <em>Pearthree v. Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co., </em>373 So.2d 267, 271 (Miss.1979); <em>Ashcraft v. Ashcraft, </em>689 S.W.2d 693, 695 (Mo.App.1985); <em>Sterns v. M.F.A. Mutual Insurance Company, </em>401 S.W.2d 510 (Mo.App.1966); <em>Satzinger v. Satzinger, </em>156 N.J.Super. 215, 383 A.2d 753 (1978); <em>Wood v. Shepard, </em>38 Ohio St.3d 86, 89-90, 526 N.E.2d 1089, 1092 (1988); <em>In re Estate of Reeck, </em>21 Ohio St.3d 126, 488 N.E.2d 195 (1986); <em>Brummett v. Grange Ins. Assoc., </em>4 Wash.App. 979, 485 P.2d 88 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>We hold, therefore, that Art. 48A, \u00a7 541(c), encompasses wrongful death claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">Harleysville next argues that if wrongful death claims are covered by Art. 48A, \u00a7 541(c), there nevertheless can be no recovery in this case because of Carol Forbes\u2019s status at the time of the accident resulting in her death. Harleysville contends that under the language of the insurance policy issued on Robin and Carol Forbes\u2019s station wagon, uninsured motorist benefits are payable only if the person sustaining bodily injury or death in an accident was an \u201cinsured\u201d at the time of the accident. While conceding that the two children were \u201cinsureds\u201d within the meaning of the policy, Harleysville maintains that Carol Forbes was not an \u201cinsured\u201d at that time. According to the insurance company, she was not an \u201cinsured\u201d because she was not designated as a \u201cnamed insured\u201d in the policy and did not reside in the household of the named insured. Therefore, the argument continues, the language of the insurance policy precludes the recovery of uninsured motorist benefits on behalf of the insured children.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>Harleysville recognizes that if the insurance policy contains a limitation on coverage which is inconsistent with Art. 48A, \u00a7 541(c), such limitation is unenforceable. Harleysville asserts, however, that \u00a7 541(c) does not require the payment of wrongful death benefits to the insured children if their parent, who was killed by the negligence of an uninsured motorist, was not an \u201cinsured\u201d when the accident occurred. It is also Harleysville\u2019s position that nothing in the statutory language requires that Carol Forbes be deemed an \u201cinsured\u201d under the Harleysville policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">While not accepting Harleysville\u2019s interpretation of the insurance policy, the thrust of petitioner Robin Forbes\u2019s argument is that the statutory provisions require coverage of the claims on behalf of the children regardless of Carol Forbes\u2019s status under the language of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">We disagree with Harleysville\u2019s' constructions of both the insurance policy and the statute. In our view, under the particular circumstances of this case, Carol Forbes was an \u201cinsured\u201d or \u201ccovered person\u201d at the time of the accident. Alternatively, even if she were not deemed an \u201cinsured\u201d under the policy, Art. 48A, \u00a7 541(c), as applied to the fact situation here, requires that the children\u2019s wrongful death claims be covered by the uninsured motorist provisions of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">Preliminarily, a strong argument could be made that Carol Forbes was a \u201cnamed insured\u201d for purposes of uninsured motorist coverage regardless of the definitions in the insurance policy. Art. 48A, \u00a7 538, containing the definitions for the required motor vehicle insurance coverage subtitle of the Maryland Insurance Code, defines a \u201cnamed insured\u201d in subsection (c) as \u201cthe person denominated in the declarations in a policy of motor vehicle liability insurance.\u201d Section 538(c) does not require that the person be denominated \u201cas a \u2018named insured\u2019 \u201d or specifically designated as such. As previously noted, both Robin and Carol Forbes were co-owners of the insured vehicle, were both designated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>in the policy as the two operators, and both names were listed on the declaration page of the policy. Only Robin Forbes, however, was expressly designated as \u201cnamed insured.\u201d Harleysville acknowledged in the circuit court that, in the situation where the husband and wife were co-owners and co-operators of the insured vehicle, the insurance premium would have been the same regardless of whether both spouses or one spouse was designated as \u201cnamed insured.\u201d Harleysville further stated that sometimes its policies designated both spouses as named insureds and sometimes only one; the insurer indicated that there was no particular reason for the difference in designations. Under these circumstances, it could be persuasively argued that Carol Forbes was a \u201cnamed insured\u201d under the definition in Art. 48A, \u00a7 538(c). Nonetheless, for purposes of this case, we shall assume that Carol Forbes was not a \u201cnamed insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">The endorsement to the Harleysville insurance policy relating to uninsured motorist coverage states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-5\">\u201cWe will pay damages which a covered person is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle because of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-6\">1. Bodily injury sustained by a covered person and caused by an accident____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">The uninsured motorist endorsement contained its own section of definitions. The definition of \u201ccovered person\u201d was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-8\">\u201c \u2018Covered person\u2019 as used in this endorsement means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-9\">1.

Any person for damages that person is entitled to recover because of bodily injury to which this coverage applies sustained by a person described in 1 or 2 above.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-12\">The term \u201cfamily member,\u201d although used in several provisions set forth in the uninsured motorist endorsement, is not further defined or limited in the definition section or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>elsewhere in the endorsement. The definition section at the beginning of the main policy, however, defines the term as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-4\">\u201c \u2018Family member\u2019 means a person related to you by blood, marriage or adoption who is a resident of your household. This includes a ward or foster child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">The parties have proceeded upon the assumption that this general definition of \u201cfamily member\u201d is applicable to the uninsured motorist endorsement, and we shall do likewise.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">Therefore, the critical issue under the language of the insurance policy is whether Robin Forbes\u2019s wife, who was co-owner and co-operator of the insured vehicle, was \u201ca resident of [Robin Forbes\u2019s] household\u201d at the time of the accident. Harleysville\u2019s position seems to be that whenever one spouse stops physically residing in the household where both spouses have resided, and begins physically residing at another place, that spouse is no longer \u201ca resident\u201d of the other spouse\u2019s household for purposes of being covered under the family car policy, regardless of how temporary the separation may be and regardless of the reason for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">Married couples often may experience marital difficulties which result in one of the spouses leaving the home for a period of time. The employment situations of spouses may require them to maintain separate households in different areas for varying lengths of time. It would be an unreasonable construction of the \u201chousehold residence\u201d language in automobile insurance policies, as well as similar language in the Maryland Insurance Code,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to hold that during every such period of separation, no matter how brief, the spouse who leaves the marital home automatically becomes uninsured with regard to the family car. It would be a particularly unreasonable construction where the spouse leaving the household is co-owner and co-operator of the family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>car.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Even though her car is covered by a policy containing the mandatory insurance coverages, such spouse would not be a \u201ccovered person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">Adoption of Harleysville\u2019s theory would result in the creation of a large class of uninsureds who obtained such status simply by leaving the residence of the named insured, even for a temporary period. This would be inconsistent with Maryland\u2019s public policy of mandatory motor vehicle insurance coverage. <em>See, e.g., Larimore v. American Ins. Co., </em>314 Md. 617, 625, 552 A.2d 889, 892 (1989) (\u201cTo uphold the ... exclusion in motor vehicle insurance policies could result in a large class of ... uninsured motorists\u201d); <em>Jennings v. Government Employees Ins., supra, </em>302 Md. at 360, 488 A.2d at 170.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">It is almost certain that the intent of Carol and Robin Forbes in obtaining the Harleysville policy on the family station wagon was that both of them as co-owners and co-operators would be insured with respect to their vehicle. Acceptance of Harleysville\u2019s theory would frustrate this intent. Moreover, under Harleysville\u2019s construction of the policy, whenever a married couple in the position of Carol and Robin Forbes separated, even temporarily, one of them would have to obtain a second policy on the family car if he or she were going to be fully insured with regard to the vehicle. It is highly unlikely that the parties intended this when contracting for the insurance policy on the station wagon.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Many courts, including this Court, have considered whether a spouse who has left the family home is still a \u201cresident of the same household\u201d for purposes of motor vehicle insurance. It is generally stated that residence under \u201c \u2018[a] common roof is not the controlling element.\u2019 It is rather a conclusion based on the aggregate details of the living <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>arrangements of the parties.\u201d <em>Davenport v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>144 Ga.App. 474, 475, 241 S.E.2d 593, 594 (1978); <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co. v. Carrera, </em>577 A.2d 980, 985 (R.I.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">This Court considered the issue in <em>American Casualty Co. v. Walzl, </em>238 Md. 322, 208 A.2d 597 (1965). In that case the husband, Wallace Baker, had procured insurance, as the named insured, on two automobiles both of which were titled in his wife\u2019s name. The Bakers had a stormy marriage and occasionally separated for short periods. The separation at issue began on May 26, 1962. On June 26, 1962, Mrs. Baker filed a complaint for a divorce <em>a mensa et thoro, </em>and her husband filed a cross-complaint for the same relief. On July 2, 1962, while riding as a passenger in one of the Bakers\u2019 automobiles which was being driven by a friend\u2019s husband, Frank Walzl, Mrs. Baker was injured in an accident. She sued Walzl and his insurer, and the insurer in turn filed a declaratory judgment action against the Bakers\u2019 liability insurer, American Casualty, claiming that American Casualty had primary coverage. American Casualty refused coverage on the ground that Mrs. Baker was not a resident of Mr. Baker\u2019s household at the time of the accident. The trial court held that Mrs. Baker was a resident of her husband\u2019s household, and this Court affirmed, stating that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-5\">\u201ctemporary absences are quite frequent in a normal household due to emergencies or other reasons, and if narrow interpretations were applied, then there would be no coverage during these temporary separations____ Where marital difficulties existed, it could not be assumed that the separation was irreconcilable and the difficulties existing could not be resolved____ The facts presented before us show the insurer\u2019s risk was no greater under the circumstances than was originally contemplated at the time of the issuance of the policy.\u201d 238 Md. at 326, 208 A.2d at 599.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number><em>See Zurich Co. v.

In the case before us, it cannot be concluded that the separation between Robin and Carol Forbes was permanent. As previously mentioned, the uncontradicted evidence before the circuit court was that at no time prior to her death had Carol Forbes ever requested a divorce or even discussed a divorce with Robin Forbes. The parties had only been separated for approximately IV2 months before Mrs. Forbes\u2019s death. When she left the residence in Baltimore, Mrs. Forbes did not have the address of her driver\u2019s license changed or her voter registration changed to reflect the Easton address. Furthermore, the lease Mrs. Forbes entered into in Easton was only on a month-to-month basis, rather than one for a longer term. Carol Forbes remained as a co-owner of the insured vehicle, and she remained listed on the declaration page of the insurance policy. Harleysville acknowledged that if Carol Forbes had been specifically designated as a \u201cnamed insured\u201d along with Robin Forbes, the premium would have been the same and Carol would have remained covered when she moved to Easton.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">Under the circumstances, we hold that Carol Forbes was an \u201cinsured\u201d and a \u201ccovered person\u201d at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">As an alternate holding, we agree with the petitioner\u2019s argument that the minor children\u2019s wrongful death claims were within the mandatory uninsured motorist coverage of Art. 48A, \u00a7 541(c), regardless of Carol Forbes\u2019s status under the language of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">It is true that certain language in Art. 48A, \u00a7 541(c)(1) and (3), refers to \u201cdeath of the insured.\u201d As discussed in Part II of this opinion, however, this language merely reflects the General Assembly\u2019s contemplation that wrongful death claims are covered by the uninsured motor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>ist provisions and that, when an insured is killed in a motor vehicle accident with an uninsured tortfeasor, the statutory beneficiaries are entitled to wrongful death benefits under the mandatory uninsured motorist coverage. <em>See, e.g., Williams v. Williams, supra, </em>23 Ariz.App. at 193-194, 531 P.2d at 926-927; <em>Zeagler v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., supra, </em>166 So.2d at 617-618; <em>Sterns v. M.F.A. Mutual Insurance Company, supra, </em>401 S.W.2d at 517-520; <em>Satzinger v. Satzinger, supra, </em>156 N.J.Super. at 222-223, 383 A.2d at 756-757; <em>In re Estate of Reeck, supra, </em>21 Ohio St.3d at 128-129, 488 N.E.2d at 197-198. We do not believe, however, that the language of \u00a7 541(c)(1) and (3) means that the deceased must always be an \u201cinsured\u201d under the particular language of the insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">The basic coverage language of \u00a7 541(c) is set forth in paragraph (2) and requires coverage \u201cfor damages which the insured is entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle because of bodily injuries [including death] sustained in an accident arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of such uninsured motor vehicle.\u201d The Forbes children\u2019s wrongful death claims squarely fall within this statutory language even if their mother at the time of the accident was not an \u201cinsured\u201d under the language of Harleysville\u2019s policy. The children are \u201cinsureds\u201d under the Harleysville policy. Under Maryland\u2019s wrongful death statute, the children are legally entitled to damages from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle because of the death of their mother sustained in an accident arising out of the operation of the uninsured vehicle. In fact, a judgment against the owner and operator of the uninsured vehicle has been recovered on their behalf. The claims of the insured children clearly are embraced by the critical coverage language of \u00a7 541(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">Moreover, the purpose of the uninsured motorist statute supports coverage of the children\u2019s wrongful death claims without regard to Carol Forbes\u2019s status under the language of the insurance policy. As discussed earlier, the purpose of the statutorily mandated uninsured motorist coverage is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>to put the insured'(including the insured children) in the same position as they would have been if the tortfeasor had maintained liability insurance. <em>See Lee v. Wheeler, supra, </em>310 Md. at 237, 528 A.2d at 914; <em>Hoffman v. United Services Auto. Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>309 Md. at 171-172, 522 A.2d at 1322; <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Webb, supra, </em>291 Md. at 737, 436 A.2d at 474. If the tortfeasor in this case had maintained liability insurance, the children\u2019s wrongful death claims would have been paid up to the limits of that liability coverage. Since the tortfeasor failed to have liability insurance, and since the children did have uninsured motorist coverage, their claims should similarly be covered up to the limits of the uninsured motorist insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">Furthermore, it is clear that the children\u2019s wrongful death claims are payable, up to certain statutory limits,- by the Maryland Automobile Insurance Fund as successor to the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund under Art. 48A, \u00a7\u00a7 243H-243L, if those claims are not covered by Harleysville. Nevertheless, the purpose of these sections is to cover claims against uninsured tortfeasors where the claimant has no uninsured motorist insurance. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 243H (heading of section), 243H(a)(3)(v), 541(c)(2), 541(c)(3). It was not the purpose of \u00a7\u00a7 243H-243L to cover claims where the claimant has uninsured motorist coverage but the insurer has placed an exclusion or limitation on coverage in the policy. Instead, the statutory scheme indicates that the uninsured motorist carrier should pay such claims. <em>See Lee v. Wheeler, supra, </em>310 Md. at 238-243, 528 A.2d at 915-917.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Under circumstances like those presented here, numerous cases have held that uninsured motorist claims by insureds are covered by language similar to that in \u00a7 541(c) even though the victim of the accident may not have been an \u201cinsured\u201d- under the language of the policy. For example, in <em>Auto Club Ins. Ass\u2019n v. DeLaGarza, </em>433 Mich. 208, 444 N.W.2d 803 (1989), a wife and husband had lived apart for many years. The wife maintained a motor vehicle insurance policy on her automobile, but the husband was not an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>insured under the policy because he did not reside in the wife\u2019s household and was not using the insured vehicle. The husband, while changing a tire on an uninsured vehicle on a highway shoulder, was struck and killed by another uninsured vehicle. In holding that the wife could recover wrongful death benefits under her uninsured motorist endorsement, despite the fact that the husband was not an insured under the policy, the Supreme Court of Michigan relied on policy language virtually identical to the language in Art. 48A, \u00a7 541(c)(2). The court pointed out that \u201cMary DeLaGarza is an \u2018insured person\u2019 under the terms of the policy\u201d and that \u201cthe policy does not explicitly limit recovery for bodily injury [including death] to those injuries sustained by insured persons.\u201d <em>Auto Club Ass\u2019n v. DeLaGarza, supra, </em>433 Mich. at 213, 444 N.W.2d at 805.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">In <em>Sexton v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>69 Ohio St.2d 431, 433 N.E.2d 555 (1982), the plaintiff and his wife were divorced and lived apart; the plaintiff\u2019s minor daughter lived with his wife who had custody of her. The plaintiff maintained an automobile insured by State Farm, with the statutorily required uninsured motorist coverage. The daughter was a passenger in an uninsured motor vehicle and was killed in an accident due to the fault of the driver of the uninsured vehicle. It was clear from the language of the plaintiff\u2019s insurance policy with State Farm that the daughter was not an insured under the policy and that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover his wrongful death claim under the wording of the policy\u2019s uninsured motorist endorsement. Nevertheless, relying on statutory language essentially the same as Maryland\u2019s \u00a7 541(c)(2), the Supreme Court of Ohio held that the policy exclusion was void and that the uninsured motorist statute required coverage of the plaintiff\u2019s wrongful death claim. The court observed that, \u201c[although the statute does not indicate who must have sustained the bodily injury, it does not specify that it be the insured.\u201d <em>Sexton v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., supra, </em>69 Ohio St.2d at 434, 433 N.E.2d at 558-559. The court went on to state that \u201c[t]he pertinent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>language of the [uninsured motorist] statute requires that the insured be legally entitled to recover damages because of bodily injury.\u201d 69 Ohio St.2d at 434-435, 433 N.E.2d at 559. As the plaintiff was entitled to recover damages because of the wrongful death of his daughter under the Ohio wrongful death statutory provisions, the court \u201cconclude[d] that Sexton is entitled to recover damages under his uninsured motorist coverage.\u201d 69 Ohio St.2d at 435, 433 N.E.2d at 559.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">To the same effect are several other cases. <em>See, e.g., Hinners v.
