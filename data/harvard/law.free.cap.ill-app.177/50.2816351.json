That the premiums upon the said policy were paid to the 23rd day of December, A. D. 1909.</p><p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-14\" pgmap=\"71\">3. That the said Bridget M. Kennedy died on July 2, 1909.</p><p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-15\" pgmap=\"71\">4. That due proof of the death of Bridget M. Kennedy was made to the defendant.</p><p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-16\" pgmap=\"71\">5. That the said Bridget M. Kennedy was admitted as a patient to St. Anthony\u2019s Hospital in Chicago, Illinois, on November 17, 1908; that on November 18, 1908, a surgical operation was performed on the said Bridget M. Kennedy in the said hospital for appendicitis, from which she had been suffering for some time before she entered the said hospital, and that after the operation the said Bridget M. Kennedy remained in the said hospital as a patient until December 8,1908.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-19\" pgmap=\"71\">Testimony given at the trial also showed that Bridget M. Kennedy had been a few days previous to the operation examined by the physician and surgeon who afterward operated on her; that he had diagnosed her ailment as appendicitis, and that from the history she gave him, he supposed that she had it ten days or two weeks.</p><p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-20\" pgmap=\"71(76) 72(57)\">The company having refused to pay the beneficiary the amount of the policy, she brought this suit. The cause was submitted to a jury. At the close of the evidence the defendant moved the court for a peremptory instruction. It was refused, and the court of its own motion instructed the jury that the defense made being that the assured made false statements and representations, the burden was on the defendant to prove that she made them in her application for the policy, that she knew they were false when she made them, that the fact concealed or falsity expressed was material to the risk and that its failure to prove any one of these propositions would compel the jury to find a verdict for the plaintiff. He then proceeded:</p><p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-4\" pgmap=\"72\">\u201cThe court instructs the jury that if they believe from the evidence that Bridget M. Kennedy, the party named in the insurance policy introduced in evidence, represented to the medical examiner of the defendant in her application for said insurance that she had never prior to the date of such representations undergone any surgical operation, and falsely and fraudulently concealed such fact from the medical examiner of the defendant, then in that case you will find the issues for the defendant, if you further find from the evidence such false representation, if any was made, was material to the risk, and that the said Bridget M. Kennedy knew they were false when made.</p><p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-5\" pgmap=\"72\">\u201cThe court instructs the jury that if you believe from the evidence in this case that the deceased Bridget M. Kennedy made truthful answers to the questions propounded to her for insurance in this case, and to the best of her knowledge and belief, that was all she was required to do, and if you so find, your verdict should be for the plaintiff.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-6\" pgmap=\"72\">The defendant, by his attorney, requested the court further to instruct the jury as to the meaning of the term \u201cmaterial to the risk\u201d used by the court in the foregoing instruction, and also requested the court to instruct the jury that it was immaterial of what disease the insured died. The court refused to instruct the jury further.</p><p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-7\" pgmap=\"72\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff for $525.21, on which, after a motion for a new trial and one in arrest of judgment had been overruled, the judgment before mentioned was entered.</p><p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-8\" pgmap=\"72(19) 73(43)\">In this court it is contended that the verdict and judgment are against the law and the evidence; that the court below erred in refusing to instruct the jury peremptorily for the defendant, and that it erred in the instructions which it did give to the jury, and in refusing further to instruct the jury as requested by the defendant\u2019s counsel.</p><attorneys data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b73-4\" pgmap=\"73\">Hoyne, O\u2019Connor, Hoyne &amp; Irwin, for plaintiff in error; Carl J. Appell, of counsel.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b73-5\" pgmap=\"73\">Thomas C. Kennedy, for defendant in error.</attorneys> <opinion data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b73-6\" pgmap=\"73\">Mr. Justice Brown</author> <p id=\"AUZ\" pgmap=\"73\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p> <p id=\"b73-7\" pgmap=\"73\">This judgment must be reversed. To uphold it we should be obliged to ignore well settled principles of the law of insurance.</p> <p id=\"b73-8\" pgmap=\"73\">The policy was not incontestable on account of false representations in the application. It only became so by its terms after the lapse of a year from its issuance. That year had not passed. The provision that \u201cno such statement shall * * * be used as a defense to a claim\u201d under the policy, plainly refers by all rules of construction to the \u201cstatements\u201d just before described, that is \u201cstatements made by the insured in the absence of fraud\u201d and \u201cdeemed representations and not warranties.\u201d \u2022 If a statement of the assured was made fraudulently as an inducement to procure the issuance of the policy to her, it was not \u201ca statement made by the insured in the absence of fraud. \u2019 \u2019</p> <p id=\"b73-9\" pgmap=\"73(95) 74(287)\">Under these circumstances it was plainly proper to admit the evidence of the answers made by the insured to questions of the medical examiner made when he examined her following her application, when those answers in connection with the stipulated facts showed a wilful misstatement of mat\u00e9rial matters affecting the risk. Considering the application alone, however, it is inconceivable that a person who on November 18, 1908, underwent a capital operation, with its resultant risks, an operation which is resorted to in the natural order of things, only on account of the imminent presence or threatened recurrence of a dangerous and painful ailment, and who for twenty days thereafter remained in the hospital where the operation took place, should in ten days thereafter have answered in the negative the question, \u201cHave you so far as you know ever had any serious illness or disease\u201d without an intentional and intelligent purpose to deceive. This was the question put to the insured and thus answered in the application itself, which was a part of the policy. The falsity of the answer is, in onr opinion, undeniable, and admitted by the stipulation on the facts; its materiality is a matter of law. As the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania said in Murphy v. Prudential Ins. Co., 205 Pa. St. 444, \u201cIt has always been held that a court must declare as material a false statement to a request that the insured give full particulars of any illness that he might have had;\u201d and we do not think that in the Illinois cases cited by defendant in error to us this is controverted. It is true that questions concerning the construction of the term \u201cserious illness\u201d have been discussed by Illinois courts; but as we have before said, we do not regard it open to debate that appendicitis followed by a capital operation and a considerable hospital sojourn, is a serious illness; and neither the courts- of Illinois, nor of any other state, so far as we know, have ever said that an obviously false statement in reply to the question indicated was immaterial. The contrary doctrine is the basis of the decision in many cases, as in Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Moravec, 214 Ill. 186.</p> <p id=\"b74-5\" pgmap=\"74\">Whether the false answer is considered as a warranty (because expressly made part of the contract of insurance and fraudulent) or as a representation only, it avoids the policy, for it was material.</p> <p id=\"b74-6\" pgmap=\"74(46) 75(39)\">But in addition to these false statements in the application, the assured made categorically at - least ten more false statements to the medical examiner as am inducement to the making of the policy. They include statements made twelve days after coming out of the hospital, to the effect that she had never undergone a surgical operation, that she was last attended by a physician about four years before, that she had never had any serious illness, and that she had never had appendicitis.</p> <p id=\"b75-4\" pgmap=\"75\">The medical examiner testified that if he had known the facts and the falsity of these answers at the time he made the examination and report to the company, he should not have recommended the company to have accepted the risk, as he did.</p> <p id=\"b75-5\" pgmap=\"75\">The \u201cstatements\u201d as we have noted we regard not \u201cmade in the absence of fraud,\u201d and like any^other actually fraudulent statements made as an inducement to the issuance of a policy, are available in defense in an action on it, perhaps in any case, certainly in any case where the policy is not on its face incontestable at the time of death. Welch v. Union Cent. Life Ins. Co., 108 Iowa 224; Reagan v. Union Mut. Life Ins. Co., 189 Mass. 555.</p> <p id=\"b75-6\" pgmap=\"75\">The instructions to the jury we regard as based on a wrong view of the law applied to the facts of this case, and misleading. They left to the jury questions properly for the court. They were questions too, the answers to which by the court in the only admissible manner would have required it to peremptorily instruct the jury for the defendant.</p> <p id=\"b75-7\" pgmap=\"75\">The judgment is reversed, and as our view of the law applied to the admitted and uncontradicted facts of this case would prevent any recovery on this policy, we do not remand the cause.</p> <p id=\"b75-8\" pgmap=\"75\">Reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
