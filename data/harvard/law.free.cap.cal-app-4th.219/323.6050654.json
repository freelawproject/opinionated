We hold the complaint states a cause of action for retaliatory eviction under Civil Code section 1942.5 and that this cause of action is not barred by the litigation privilege of Civil Code section 47, subdivision (b). We affirm the judgment as to the remaining causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\"><em>Background: </em>Banuelos I.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">In 2008, Banuelos brought an action against the owners and managers of Park Granada, a mobilehome park in the City of Carson. Banuelos alleged that he was the owner of a mobilehome located on space 23 at Park Granada and that defendants refused to accept his application for tenancy of the space in violation of Civil Code section 798.74, which limits the right of a mobilehome park owner to refuse tenancy to a \u201cpurchaser\u201d of a mobilehome in the park.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According to Banuelos\u2019s complaint, defendants refused to accept his rent applications for the space in order to force him to sell them his mobilehome for little or no consideration since it would be practically impossible for him to move it from the space. Banuelos sued the defendants for violation of section 798.74 and various torts.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">The trial court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment as to each cause of action and we affirmed the judgment in an unreported opinion <em>(Banuelos I).</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We held that Banuelos could not state a cause of action under section 798.74 for failure to approve his tenancy because he had received the mobilehome as a gift and therefore he was not a \u201cpurchaser.\u201d Similarly, we held that he could not state a cause of action for negligence against the defendants because they owed him no duty under section 798.74. We further held that Banuelos could not state a cause of action for landlord retaliation under section 1942.5 because there was no landlord-tenant relationship between Banuelos and the park at the time of the alleged retaliatory actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number><em>Background: </em>Banuelos II.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">In May 2009 a new owner of Park Granada rejected Banuelos\u2019s application for tenancy. Notwithstanding that rejection, Banuelos tendered monthly space rental checks to the owner. The owner returned each check. In May 2010, Banuelos sent a check for $4,200 to the owner\u2019s attorney, accompanied by a letter stating that the check was for 14 months\u2019 space rent commencing April 2009. The owner\u2019s attorney did not return this check but deposited it in his client trust account. The following month, however, the owner filed an unlawful detainer action against Banuelos seeking possession of space 23. The case was tried to a jury, which returned a general verdict with special findings in favor of Banuelos. Banuelos maintains his tenancy commenced in May 2010 when defendants accepted his rent check.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\"><em>Background: </em>Banuelos III.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Prior to the verdict in <em>Banuelos II, </em>Banuelos filed this action against 218 Properties and LA Investment, LLC, which he alleged to be the joint owners of Park Granada. Banuelos also sued the managers of the property. The third amended complaint, filed in August 2011, following the verdict in <em>Banuelos II, </em>charges defendants with statutory and common law retaliation, bad faith, intentional and negligent interference with economic advantage and negligence. Defendants demurred to each count of the complaint on the ground that it failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The trial court sustained the demurrers without leave to amend and dismissed the action as to all defendants except 218 Properties, which had a pending cross-complaint against Banuelos.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">Banuelos filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">I. THE COMPLAINT STATES A CAUSE OF ACTION FOR RETALIATION UNDER SECTION 1942.5 BUT NOT UNDER THE COMMON LAW.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">A. <em>Retaliation Under Section 1942.5</em></p>\n<p id=\"b245-12\">Under section 1942.5 it is unlawful for a lessor to \u201cbring an action\u201d against a lessee to \u201crecover possession ... for the purpose of retaliating against the lessee because he or she . . . has lawfully and peaceably exercised any rights under the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>In his first cause of action, Banuelos alleged that he was a tenant of Park Granada as of May 2010. Defendants served him with a five-day notice to vacate on or about June 1, 2010, and soon after filed an eviction action against him. He alleged that these acts violate section 1942.5 and the common law of California because they were done in retaliation for, among other things, complaining orally and in writing to the City of Carson and the courts about the defendants\u2019 alleged unlawful acts and omissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">The complaint states a cause of action for retaliation under section 1942.5. Banuelos\u2019s right to complain to the city about defendants\u2019 alleged wrongful acts and to file a lawsuit are both protected under the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">B. <em>Retaliation Under the Common Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Banuelos cannot state a common law cause of action for retaliatory eviction because that cause of action applies only to conduct that causes the tenant to involuntarily vacate the premises. <em>(Glaser </em>v. <em>Meyers </em>(1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 770, <em>111 </em>[187 Cal.Rptr. 242].) Banuelos does not allege that he vacated space 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">II. THE LITIGATION PRIVILEGE DOES NOT BAR BANUELOS\u2019S SUIT UNDER SECTION 1942.5 FOR RETALIATORY EVICTION BASED ON THE DEFENDANTS\u2019 ACTION TO RECOVER POSSESSION OF THE PREMISES.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">Section 1942.5, subdivision (c) creates a cause of action against a landlord who \u201cbring[s] an action to recover possession ... for the purpose of retaliating against the lessee because he or she has lawfully organized or participated in a lessees\u2019 association or an organization advocating lessees\u2019 rights or has lawfully and peaceably exercised any rights under the law.\u201d Subdivision (f) of the statute states, \u201cAny lessor or agent of a lessor who violates this section shall be liable to the lessee in a civil action for all of the following: [\u00b6] (1) The actual damages sustained by the lessee, [\u00b6] (2) Punitive damages in an amount of not less than one hundred dollars ($100) nor more than two thousand dollars ($2,000) for each retaliatory act where the lessor or agent has been guilty of fraud, oppression, or malice with respect to that act.\u201d The landlord can defend against an action for retaliatory eviction by showing that it acted for \u201cany lawful cause\u201d (\u00a7 1942.5, subd. (d)) or \u201cin good faith\u201d <em>(id., </em>subd. (e)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>Tenants\u2019 protection from retaliation by their landlords for exercising their rights under California law developed simultaneously from legislation, section 1942.5, subdivision (a) (Stats. 1970, ch. 1280, p. 2314), and the decision by the California Supreme Court in <em>Schweiger </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 507, 513 [90 Cal.Rptr. 729, 476 P.2d 97] (Schweiger), as an affirmative defense to an eviction action.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Schweiger </em>arose from a tenant\u2019s use of the \u201crepair and deduct\u201d remedy afforded him under sections 1941 and 1942 to repair two broken windows and a broken back door. The landlord retaliated against the tenant the next month by more than doubling the tenant\u2019s rent and, when the tenant failed to pay the increased amount, brought an unlawful detainer action to evict the tenant. In upholding the tenant\u2019s right to assert an equitable defense of retaliation to the landlord\u2019s eviction action, Justice Mosk stated that, \u201c[i]f we fail to recognize a reasonable limitation on the punitive power of landlords to increase rents and evict tenants, the salutary purposes sought to be achieved by the Legislature in enacting Civil Code sections 1941 and 1942 will be frustrated.\u201d (3 Cal.3d at p. 513.)</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Less than a year after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Schweiger, </em>the same landlord was before the court in <em>Aweeka v. Bonds </em>(1971) 20 Cal.App.3d 278 [97 Cal.Rptr. 650]. Again the tenants petitioned the landlord to repair unsafe conditions in their apartment and again the landlord responded by raising the tenant\u2019s rent\u2014this time from $75 a month to $145 a month. Instead of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>waiting to be sued in an unlawful detainer action, the tenants sued the landlord for retaliatory eviction claiming that the rent increase constituted an actual eviction and seeking an injunction to prevent the landlord from enforcing the rent increase or instituting an action for unlawful detainer. The trial court denied a preliminary injunction and sustained the landlord\u2019s demurrer to the complaint without leave to amend. Relying on <em>Schweiger, </em>the Court of Appeal reversed. The court reasoned: \u201cWe can discern no rational basis for allowing ... a substantive defense while denying an affirmative cause of action. It would be unfair and unreasonable to require a tenant, subjected to a retaliatory rent increase by the landlord, to wait and raise the matter as a defense only, after he is confronted with an unlawful detainer action and a possible lien on his personal property .... Accordingly, we conclude on the authority of <em>Schweiger </em>that the complaint stated a cause of action for retaliatory eviction.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 281, citation omitted.) The Supreme Court denied review.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">In 1979 the Legislature affirmed the right of a tenant to sue a landlord for retaliatory eviction by repealing and reenacting section 1942.5 (Stats. 1979, ch. 652, \u00a7 2, p. 2005). As part of that reenactment, the Legislature specifically provided that \u201c[i]t shall be unlawful for a lessor to . . . bring an action to recover possession ... for the purpose of retaliating against the lessee because he or she has . . . lawfully and peaceably exercised any rights under the law\u201d and that \u201c[a]ny lessor or agent of a lessor who violates this section shall be liable to the lessee in a civil action ....\u201d (Former \u00a7 1942.5, subds. (c) &amp;(f).)</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Our Supreme Court has described section 1942.5 as reenacted in 1979 as \u201ca remedial statute aimed at protecting tenants from certain types of abuses. It is to be \u2018liberally construed to effect its objectives and to suppress, not encourage, the mischief at which it was directed. [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Barela v. Superior Court </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 244, 251 [178 Cal.Rptr. 618, 636 P.2d 582].)</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">In <em>Rich v. Schwab </em>(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 803, 812 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 170], the appellate court held that the cause of action for retaliation recognized by section 1942.5 applies to tenants of a mobilehome park. The court reasoned: \u201cBy their terms, subdivisions (c) and (f) of section 1942.5 give a right of action to any <em>lessee </em>who has been subjected to an act of unlawful retaliation. Thus, on its face the statute provides protection to mobilehome park tenants who own their own dwellings and merely rent space from their landlord.\u201d (63 Cal.App.4th at p. 812.)</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Defendants maintain that insofar as section 1942.5 purports to allow a tenant to sue a landlord for \u201cbring[ing] an action to recover possession\u201d it is trumped by the \u201clitigation privilege\u201d provision of section 47, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>\u201cThe usual formulation\u201d of the litigation privilege is that it \u201capplies to any communication (1) made in judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings; (2) by litigants or other participants authorized by law; (3) to achieve the objects of the litigation; and (4) that have some connection or logical relation to the action.\u201d <em>(Silberg v. Anderson </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 205, 212 [266 Cal.Rptr. 638, 786 P.2d 365].) The privilege applies without regard to the defendant\u2019s \u201cmotives, morals, ethics or intent.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 220.)</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Despite its broad scope, our high court has recognized that \u201cthe Legislature remains free to create exceptions to the litigation privilege . . . .\u201d <em>(Action Apartment Assn., Inc. v. City of Santa Monica </em>(2007) 41 Cal.4th 1232, 1247 [63 Cal.Rptr.3d 398, 163 P.3d 89] <em>(Action </em>Apartment).) The question is whether the Legislature did so in enacting section 1942.5, subdivisions (c) and (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">In <em>Action Apartment, </em>the Supreme Court considered a challenge under the litigation privilege to a city ordinance that penalized a landlord who brought an action to recover possession of a rental unit \u201cwithout a reasonable factual or legal basis.\u201d <em>(Action Apartment, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at p. 1239.) The court held that this provision of the city ordinance was \u201cinimical to the important purposes of the litigation privilege\u201d including \u201c \u2018affording] litigants and witnesses ... the utmost freedom of access to the courts without fear of being harassed subsequently by derivative tort actions.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1243, citation omitted.) Therefore, the litigation privilege \u201cconflicts with and thus preempts\u201d that portion of the city ordinance \u201cregarding filing an action to recover possession of a rental unit.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1237.)</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">The holding in <em>Action Apartment </em>is not controlling here because the conflict in that case was between a statute and a city ordinance while our case involves a conflict between two coequal statutes. Nevertheless, much of the court\u2019s analysis in <em>Action Apartment </em>is applicable to the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">The court began its analysis by noting that it has given the litigation privilege \u201ca broad interpretation\u201d in order to achieve its \u201c \u2018principal purpose\u2019 \u201d to afford litigants and witnesses \u201c \u2018the utmost freedom of access to the courts without fear of being harassed subsequently by derivative tort actions.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Action Apartment, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at p. 1241.) Recognizing that invocation of the privilege \u201chas its costs,\u201d the court observed that \u201c \u2018avoiding an unending roundelay of litigation [justifies] an occasional unfair result.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1244.)</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">The court acknowledged, however, that although the litigation privilege has been described as \u201cabsolute,\u201d the privilege \u201cis not without limit\u201d and cited the examples of private actions for malicious prosecution and government actions, including criminal prosecutions and regulatory actions brought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>pursuant to state statutes. <em>(Action Apartment, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at pp. 1242, 1245; see <em>Komarova </em>v. <em>National Credit Acceptance, Inc. </em>(2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 324, 330 [95 Cal.Rptr.3d 880] [debt collector\u2019s unlawful conduct under the Rosenthal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\u00a7 1788 et seq.) is not shielded by the litigation privilege].) \u201c[T]hese exceptions,\u201d the court pointed out, \u201chave all involved suits brought under state laws, each of which makes clear that the Legislature did not intend its enforcement to be barred by the litigation privilege.\u201d <em>(Action Apartment, </em>at p. 1245.)</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">The Legislature \u201cmakes clear\u201d that it does not intend the enforcement of a statute to be barred by the litigation privilege when the statute \u201cis more specific than the litigation privilege and would be significantly or wholly inoperable if its enforcement were barred when in conflict with the privilege.\u201d <em>(Action Apartment, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at p. 1246.) The cause of action for retaliatory eviction authorized by section 1942.5, subdivisions (c) and (f) meets both prongs of this test.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Subdivision (c) of section 1942.5 specifically makes it \u201cunlawful\u201d for a lessor to \u201cbring an action to recover possession\u201d in retaliation for a tenant\u2019s exercise of \u201crights under the law.\u201d Subdivision (f) of the statute states that \u201c[a]ny lessor or agent of a lessor who violates this section shall be liable to the lessee in a civil action ...\u201d Additionally, subdivision (e) gives the landlord a defense of \u201cgood faith\u201d to an action under subdivision (c), which, if controverted by the lessee, \u201cthe lessor shall establish ... at the trial or other hearing.\u201d The statute\u2019s reference to a landlord\u2019s liability \u201cin a civil action\u201d for bringing \u201can action to recover possession\u201d in retaliation for a tenant\u2019s exercise of rights coupled with the provision recognizing a good faith defense \u201cat the trial or other hearing\u201d demonstrates that the Legislature intended to create a cause of action for retaliatory eviction that is not barred by the litigation privilege. If the litigation privilege trumped a suit for retaliatory eviction under section 1942.5 the privilege would \u201c \u2018effectively immunize conduct that the [statute] prohibits\u2019 \u201d <em>(Komarova </em>v. <em>National Credit Acceptance, Inc., supra, </em>175 Cal.App.4th at p. 338) thereby encouraging, rather than suppressing, \u201c \u2018the mischief at which it was directed. [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Barela v. Superior Court, supra, </em>30 Cal.3d at p. 251.)</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Moreover, the right of tenants to be free from eviction actions brought by their landlords because the tenants \u201clawfully and peaceably exercised [their] rights under the law\u201d (\u00a7 1942.5, subd. (c)) would be \u201csignificantly or wholly inoperable if its enforcement were barred [by the litigation privilege].\u201d <em>(Action Apartment, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at p. 1246.)</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>The Legislature made the judgment that raising retaliation as a defense to an unlawful detainer action and a suit for malicious prosecution are not adequate remedies for retaliatory eviction. Section 1942.5, subdivision (h) states that \u201c[t]he remedies provided by this section shall be in addition to any other remedies provided by statutory or decisional law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Two Court of Appeal opinions, purporting to follow <em>Action Apartment, </em>have held that the litigation privilege bars a tenant from suing a landlord under section1942.5, subdivisions (c) and (f) for bringing a retaliatory action to recover possession. We decline to follow them.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">In <em>Feldman v. 1100 Park Lane Associates </em>(2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 1467 [74 Cal.Rptr.3d 1] <em>(Feldman), </em>the landlord brought an unlawful detainer action against the tenants and the tenants cross-complained for retaliatory eviction under section 1942.5 based on the landlord\u2019s alleged violation of the city\u2019s rent control ordinances. The Court of Appeal held that the landlord\u2019s \u201cfiling of the unlawful detainer action clearly fell within the litigation privilege. The Supreme Court in <em>[Action </em>Apartment] held the litigation privilege of Civil Code section 47 preempted the provision of the Santa Monica tenant harassment ordinance that authorized civil and criminal penalties against a landlord bringing any action to recover possession of a rental unit without a reasonable factual or legal basis.\u201d <em>(Feldman, </em>at p. 1486.) The appellate court did not discuss the distinction between a tenant suing under a city ordinance, as in <em>Action Apartment, </em>and a tenant suing under the authority of a coequal state statute, nor did it analyze section 1942.5 to determine whether it \u201cmakes clear\u201d that it is not barred by the litigation privilege. <em>(Action Apartment, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at p. 1246.)</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">In <em>Wallace v. McCubbin </em>(2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1169, 1213 [128 Cal.Rptr.3d 205], the appellate court held that \u201cas a matter of law\u201d the tenant-plaintiffs had no cause of action under section 1942.5 \u201cfor wrongful eviction based on the unlawful detainer action or three-day notice, in light of the litigation privilege of Civil Code section 47, subdivision (b).\u201d Like <em>Feldman, </em>the court cited but did not discuss or analyze <em>Action Apartment </em>and the litigation privilege nor did it distinguish between a city ordinance and a state statute when resolving the conflict issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Defendants cite two Supreme Court opinions in which the court found that the plaintiffs\u2019 statutory causes of action were barred by the litigation privilege. Both opinions are distinguishable from our case.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>In <em>Rubin </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th 1187 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 828, 847 P.2d 1044], residents of a mobilehome park sent a written complaint to the owner listing 23 alleged defects in the operation of the park. The owner sued the park residents and their attorney for unfair business practices under the Business and Professions Code. The Supreme Court held the owner\u2019s suit was barred by the litigation privilege. <em>Rubin </em>involved a conflict between section 47, subdivision (b), the litigation privilege, which applies to any \u201cpublication or broadcast\u201d made as part of a \u201cjudicial proceeding,\u201d and Business and Professions Code section 17200, which defines \u201cunfair competition\u201d to include \u201cany unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court held that it would violate the principal purpose of the litigation privilege\u2014to afford litigants utmost freedom of access to the courts\u2014if the park owner were allowed to \u201c \u2018plead around\u2019 \u201d the privilege by simply relabeling his common law suit for interference with contractual relations as a statutory suit for unfair competition. (4 Cal.4th at pp. 1191, 1201-1203.) Permitting the owner\u2019s claim, the court explained, \u201cwould upset the carefully constructed balance between \u2018the freedom of an individual to seek redress in the courts and the interest of a potential defendant in being free from unjustified litigation\u2019 [citation] by effectively destroying the availability of the privilege\u201d in any case in which a party to litigation was prompted to claim that his opponent was engaging in an unfair business practice. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1203-1204.) The court concluded by noting its.analysis \u201cis reinforced by the fact that the policy underlying the unfair competition statute can be vindicated by multiple parties other than plaintiff\u2019 including the Attorney General, district attorneys and certain city attorneys. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1204.)</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\"><em>Rubin </em>was preceded by <em>Ribas v. Clark </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 355 [212 Cal.Rptr. 143, 696 P.2d 637] in which the plaintiff sued a person who had admitted during an arbitration hearing that she eavesdropped on a telephone conversation between plaintiff and his former wife. Plaintiff based his suit, in part, on Penal Code section 637.2, which provides for a private cause of action by any person \u201cinjured\u201d by another\u2019s violation of the Privacy Act, which prohibits eavesdropping, wiretapping and unauthorized recording of communications under a multitude of circumstances. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 630-637.9.) The defendant relied on the litigation privilege as her defense. The Supreme Court held the defense had merit. \u201c[N]othing indicates that in enacting Penal Code section 637.2 the Legislature intended to immunize causes of action under that statute from the [litigation privilege].\u201d <em>(Ribas, </em>at p. 365.) Thus, the court concluded, to the extent the plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleged that he suffered injury solely as a result of the defendant\u2019s testimony at the arbitration hearing, it was barred by the litigation privilege. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number><em>Rubin </em>and <em>Ribas </em>both addressed statutes that cover a broad spectrum of conduct, none of which specifically relates to litigation. It was only because the facts that gave rise to the causes of action in those cases happened to involve litigation activities that the privilege was implicated. Neither statute \u201cwould be significantly or wholly inoperable if its enforcement were barred when in conflict with the privilege.\u201d <em>(Action Apartment, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at p. 1246.) On the contrary, in <em>Rubin </em>the court observed that the policy underlying the unfair competition statute could be vindicated by parties other than the plaintiff, including the Attorney General, district attorneys and certain city attorneys. <em>(Rubin v. Green, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1204.)</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Section 1942.5, unlike the unfair competition and privacy statutes, specifically creates a cause of action for, among other things, bringing a certain kind of lawsuit. Subdivision (c) of section 1942.5 makes it \u201cunlawful\u201d for a lessor to \u201cbring an action to recover possession\u201d in retaliation for a tenant\u2019s exercise of \u201crights under the law.\u201d Subdivision (f) of the statute states that \u201c[a]ny lessor or agent of a lessor who violates this section shall be liable to the lessee in a civil action . . . .\u201d The Legislature presumably would not have included these protections in section 1942.5 if it intended that they be nullified by the litigation privilege. We do not believe the Legislature intended to do a useless act.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">III., IV.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">V.
