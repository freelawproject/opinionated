The issues raised on appeal from the order are brought up for review and have been considered on the appeal from the judgment (CPLR 5501 [a] [1]).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">Contrary to the defendants\u2019 contention, the Supreme Court properly granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment. The plaintiffs sustained their initial burden of demonstrating their entitlement to judgment as a matter of law by submitting proof of the existence of the promissory note and the defendants\u2019 default in payment <em>(see, European Am. Bank v Syosset Autorama, </em>204 AD2d 266; <em>North Fork Bank &amp; Trust Co. v Bernstein &amp; Gershman, </em>201 AD2d 472). Moreover, the defendants\u2019 conclusory and unsubstantiated allegations of usury were insufficient to raise a triable issue of fact regarding the validity of the loan agreement <em>(see, Alvarez v Prospect Hosp., </em>68 NY2d 320; <em>New York Natl. Bank v Harris, </em>182 AD2d 680). In this regard, we note that although the interest rate charged by the plaintiffs was in excess of 16%, which is the maximum rate of interest which can be charged to an individual borrower <em>(see, </em>General Obligations Law \u00a7 5-501 [1]; Banking Law \u00a7 14-a [1]; <em>First Natl. Bank v Mountain Food Enters., </em>159 AD2d 900), the 16% ceiling on interest rates is inapplicable \u201cto any loan or forbearance in the amount of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more, other than a loan or forbearance secured primarily by an interest in real property improved by a one or two family residence\u201d (General Obliga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>tions Law \u00a75-501 [6] [a]). In any event, the defendants are barred from raising usury as a defense to this action because they could have asserted the defense in a prior foreclosure action, in which they defaulted <em>(see, Bank of N. Y. v Route 312 Dev. Corp., </em>185 AD2d 582; <em>Tantillo v Giglio, </em>156 AD2d 664, 665; <em>see also, Wainco Funding v Logiudice, </em>199 AD2d 950; <em>Valdez v Garcia, </em>151 AD2d 471; <em>Farmers\u2019 Prod. Credit Assn. v Feinen Bros., </em>144 AD2d 955; <em>Gray v Bankers Trust Co., </em>82 AD2d 168, 170-171). Thompson, J.
