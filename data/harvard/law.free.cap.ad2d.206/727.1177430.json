While claimant\u2019s psychiatrist did testify that claimant could proba<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>bly work after he participated in vocational rehabilitation, it was noted that claimant had yet to enter such a program and the \"steps claimant has already taken in registering with a referral agency [do not] demonstrate that he can work\u201d. Under the circumstances, the Board\u2019s conclusion that claimant is ineligible to receive benefits has a rational basis in the record and must be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-3\">Mikoll, J.
