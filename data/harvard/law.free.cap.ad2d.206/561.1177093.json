We also reject defendant\u2019s contention that his 2- to 6-year prison sentence was harsh and excessive. When defendant entered his guilty plea, which was in satisfaction of a two-count indictment, he did so knowing that he would receive the sentence ultimately imposed by County Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-13\">Cardona, P. J., Mercure, Casey, Yesawich Jr. and Peters, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
