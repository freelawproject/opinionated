Furthermore, Liberty contends that if they are not required to defend or indemnify Peacemaker that the Defendants' counterclaims must also fail. For the following reasons, the Court finds that Liberty has no duty to defend or indemnify Peacemaker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Coverage A of the Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Coverage A of the Policy provides that if a claim is made against an insured for damages because of \" 'bodily injury' or 'property damage' that is caused by an 'occurrence' \" then Liberty will pay up to its limit in liability, including providing a defense to the insured. ECF No. 46-3 at 15. The Court must determine what the parties' understanding of \"bodily injury\" and \"property damage\" include to determine if there is potential coverage under Coverage A of the Policy. Furthermore, if the Court determines the Goldsteins alleged \"bodily injury\" or \"property damage\" as defined under the Policy, then the Court must determine if it was caused by an \"occurrence,\" and if it is the type of damages covered under the Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

'Bodily injury' shall also include disability, shock, mental anguish or mental injury, provided that such disability, shock, mental anguish or mental injury is a direct result of bodily injury, sickness, disease or death sustained by a person.\" ECF No. 46-3 at 30. Peacemaker argues that the Goldsteins alleged bodily injury in the underlying lawsuits because they alleged deprivation of their \"physical, mental and emotional well-being.\" ECF No. 48 at 8. However, the definition in the Policy is clear that \"mental anguish or mental injury\" is only included in the definition of bodily injury if it is a \"direct result of bodily injury, sickness, disease or death.\" Nothing about the underlying lawsuits contain allegations that can be considered \"bodily injury, sickness, disease or death.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Furthermore, West Virginia law supports the conclusion that the underlying lawsuits do not allege \"bodily injury.\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   In West Virginia, it is well-settled that \"purely mental or emotional harm that ... lacks physical manifestation does not fall within a definition of 'bodily injury,' ... which is limited to 'bodily injury, sickness, or disease.' \"\n   <em>\n    Cherrington [v.

Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9392206\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/184/527/\">\n    184 F.Supp.2d 527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 533 n.4 (S.D.W. Va. 2002) (finding that deprivation of the \"quiet use, control and enjoyment of [Retail Designs'] property\" is merely a \"burden[ ] ... on its property but not actual damages to its property\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Peacemaker argues that the Goldsteins' allegations meet the definition of \"property damage\" under the Policy because \"[a] loss of use occurs whenever there is an interruption of normal use o[f] property.\" ECF No. 48 at 7. However, Peacemaker states this blanket definition without any support from case law. Peacemaker cited a circuit court case analyzing Florida law to support the conclusion that physical discomfort can count as loss of use.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mid-Continent Cas. Co. v. Adams Homes of Nw Fla., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=725%20Fed.%20Appx.%20777\">\n    725 Fed.Appx. 777\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 781 (11th Cir. 2018) (\"Physical discomfort in the use of property, like insecurity and unsafety in the use of property, raises the specter of loss of use.\") A case interpreting Florida law, when the law to be applied is West Virginia law, has no direct bearing on the Court's analysis. Furthermore, the Court in\n   <em>\n    Mid-Continent Cas. Co.\n   </em>\n   considered the severity of the physical discomfort, specifically if there was insecurity and unsafety in the use of property. The Court does not find the flooding in\n   <em>\n    Mid-Continent Cas. Co.\n   </em>\n   analogous to the noise the Goldsteins are experiencing. Therefore, because the noise nuisance is merely a \"burden\" and does not amount to \"property damage\", the underlying lawsuits do not trigger coverage under Coverage A of the Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Occurrence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   While the underlying lawsuits do not allege \"bodily injury\" or \"property damage\" the Court will nevertheless briefly review the parties' arguments regarding an \"occurrence\" and \"damages.\" An occurrence is defined by the Policy as \"an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\" ECF No. 46-3 at 33. \"The common and every day meaning of 'accident' is a chance event or event arising from unknown causes.\"\n   <em>\n    Amer.

An accident has also been defined as, \"an unusual, unexpected and unforeseen event.... An accident is never present when a deliberate act is performed unless some additional unexpected, independent and unforeseen happening occurs which produces the damage....To be an accident, both the means and the result must be unforeseen, involuntary, unexpected, and unusual.\"\n   <em>\n    Erie Ins.

However, Peacemaker knew that noise from operating the shooting range and the operating hours were a concern for the community. Peacemaker made representations to the Planning Commission about the noise level, specifically the decibels and the hours of operation when seeking approval. Peacemaker at the very least, should have known it was exceeding the decibel level. Additionally, Peacemaker knew it was operating earlier and later than it represented it would operate when concerns were raised. The Court finds that the damages alleged in this case are not caused by an accident, and therefore, not caused by an \"occurrence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Lastly, while what is considered damages under the policy is not expressly defined in the Policy itself, courts interpreting West Virginia law have found the duty to defend and the duty to indemnify do not arise when the relief sought is injunctive relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    One Gateway Assocs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9392206\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/184/527/\">\n    184 F.Supp.2d at 533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the underlying lawsuits, the Goldsteins seek equitable relief, specifically temporary and permanent injunctive relief regarding the hours of operation and maximum noise levels. If the Circuit Court of Berkeley County, West Virginia or the Circuit Court of Frederick County, Virginia order for Peacemaker to comply with an injunction and Peacemaker fails to comply with such injunction, only then do the Goldsteins wish to seek further relief. Therefore, in the underlying lawsuits, the Goldsteins do not currently seek damages against Peacemaker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Coverage B of the Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   While Peacemaker makes no argument regarding Coverage B of the Policy, the Court will review Coverage B of the Policy for potential coverage. Coverage B of the Policy provides that if a claim is made against an insured for damages because of \" 'personal or advertising injury' to which this insurance applies\" then Liberty will pay up to its limit in liability, including providing a defense to the insured. ECF No. 46-3 at 20. The Court must determine if the underlying lawsuits allege a \"personal or advertising injury.\" The Policies define \"personal or advertising injury\" as \"injury, including consequential 'bodily injury', arising out of one or more of the following offenses ... \"[t]he wrongful eviction from, wrongful entry into, or invasion or the right of private occupancy of a room, dwelling or premises that a person occupies, committed by or on behalf of its owner, landlord or lessor.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF No. 46-3 at 33. This provision of the Policy is \"clear and unambiguous\" and the Court will give full effect to the \"plain meaning intended.\"\n   <em>\n    Keffer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8581978\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/153/813/#p815\">\n    153 W.

It is clear from the Policy definition that Peacemaker must be the \"owner, landlord, or lessor\" of the Goldsteins' property for coverage to apply under this provision. Therefore, coverage for \"personal or advertising injury\" is not triggered under Coverage B of the Policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Defendants' Counterclaims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As stated above, coverage is not triggered in the underlying lawsuits under Coverage A or Coverage B of the Policy. Therefore, Peacemaker's counterclaims alleging bad faith, breach of contract, and unfair trade practices may be decided on summary judgment because there is no \"genuine issue of any material fact\" for a jury to decide.\n   <em>\n    Celotex\n   </em>\n   , 477 U.S. at 322,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p322\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . First, the common law bad faith claim fails because Liberty acted reasonably in seeking declaratory relief to determine if coverage applied under the Policy. Liberty made a timely investigation of the complaints in the underlying lawsuits and then made the determination that coverage did not apply. The Court has made the same determination. Therefore, Liberty did not engage in bad faith in determining to deny Peacemaker's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Second, Liberty cannot be liable for a breach of contract claim because there is no coverage for the underlying lawsuits under the Policy. Liberty has not breached the Policy by denying or failing to pay coverage where coverage is not due. For a contract to be breached, a party to the contract must not perform its required duties. Here, Liberty was not required to defend or indemnify Peacemaker, and therefore, has not breached the Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   For similar reasons, Peacemaker's unfair claim settlement practices claim fails. Peacemaker has failed to provide facts that could support this claim other than Liberty's failure to provide coverage. From the facts before the Court, Liberty has not made any misrepresentations regarding coverage, Liberty has acted reasonably promptly and investigated the claims and only after this investigation did Liberty deny coverage. Furthermore, Liberty responded to the request and conducted the investigation the same month the claim was received. ECF Nos. 46-10, 46-11. There are no facts before the Court to support a claim that Liberty has engaged in an unfair claim settlement practice under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2033-11-4\">\n    W. Va. Code \u00a7 33-11-4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9). Peacemaker's counterclaims alleging bad faith, breach of contract and unfair claim settlement practices fail as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    V.
