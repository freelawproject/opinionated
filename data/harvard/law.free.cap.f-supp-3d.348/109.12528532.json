HILLMAN, DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Arthur Burnham (\"Plaintiff\") brings a variety of claims against several Defendants. Relevant for the purposes of this motion, he brings a claim for product liability against Wyeth Pharmaceuticals LLC (erroneously identified as \"Wyeth Laboratories Inc.\") (\"Defendant Wyeth\"). Defendant Wyeth filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted (Docket No. 29). For the reasons below, Defendant Wyeth's motion is\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      granted\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Background\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts are taken from Plaintiff's complaint and assumed to be true at this stage of the litigation. (Docket No. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 7, 2012, Plaintiff suffered a seizure while in custody of the Southbridge Police Department and became incontinent. Plaintiff claims that Southbridge Police disseminated a video of the incident, which mocked Plaintiff. Subsequently, Plaintiff developed \"major depressive disorder and suicide [sic] ideation with multiple self-mutilations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 14, 2015, Plaintiff voluntarily presented himself to the University of Massachusetts's Emergency Room. He reported\n   having a \"suicidal crisis\" and contemplating \"suicide by cop.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. Plaintiff notes that he was rated as \"severe\" on a crisis rating scale and therefore required hospitalization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 16, 2015, Plaintiff alleges that Dr. Shukair prescribed him Effexor\"without being warned or even explained [sic] what type of medication it was other then [sic] it was an aint-depressant [sic].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. Later that day, Plaintiff experienced \"shaking\" chest muscles, elevated heart rate, confusion, and became \"highly upset.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. Plaintiff subsequently requested to be discharged and pushed through several hospital employees to leave. Metro Crime Prevention, who had arrived due to Plaintiff's aggressive behavior, told Plaintiff they were \"not going to fight\" him and said, \"if you want to leave just leave.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29, 88.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After Plaintiff left the hospital, he experienced suicidal ideation because he \"was so agitated at police over the video and mistreatment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30. He then went to the police station, doused a police car with gasoline, and lit the car on fire. He was subsequently arrested and sent to Bridgewater State Hospital for psychiatric treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff filed this lawsuit bringing, among several other claims, a product liability claim for defective Effexor against its manufacturer, Defendant Wyeth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Standard\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A defendant may move to dismiss, based solely on the complaint, for the plaintiff's \"failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\" Fed.
