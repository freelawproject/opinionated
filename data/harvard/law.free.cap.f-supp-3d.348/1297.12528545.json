Although this court agrees with the conclusion reached in all three of those cases that the plain meaning of the relevant scope language does not unambiguously include a multi-component anchor system, this court respectfully disagrees with those cases' further finding that the plain language unambiguously excludes anchor products. For the reasons provided above, this court finds that the scope language \"nails ... constructed of two or more pieces\" is ambiguous.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    In its moving brief, Plaintiff also argues that because antidumping duties on a product can only be assessed at the initiation of a formal scope inquiry, Commerce's retroactive instructions here are unlawful.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Br. at 20.
