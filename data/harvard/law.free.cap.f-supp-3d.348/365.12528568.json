The plaintiff, d'Amico Dry d.a.c. (\"d'Amico Dry\"), seeks to collect on a judgment of $1,766,278.54 plus attorney's fees, costs, and interest, obtained in England and entered on June 19, 2009 (the \"English Judgment\"), against defendant Primera Maritime (Hellas) Limited (\"Primera\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   d'Amico Dry contends that the Court should recognize the English Judgment and, first, enter a judgment against Primera; second, enter default judgments against nonappearing defendants Paul Coronis, Nicholas (or Nikolaos) Coronis, Primera Ocean Services S.A., and J.P.C. Investments S.A.; and, third, enter a judgment against the other appearing defendants\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   as the successors-in-interest and/or alter egos of the Coronis family and Primera. This case is a saga of the almost ten-year-long efforts d'Amico Dry has made to enforce its English Judgment against Primera and the efforts Primera and its alter egos have made to evade enforcement of that judgment. The time for payment has come.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court held a nonjury trial. Having reviewed the evidence and assessed the credibility of the witnesses, the Court now makes the following findings of fact and reaches the following conclusions of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. PROCEDURAL POSTURE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In September 2009, d'Amico Dry filed suit in this Court under this Court's admiralty jurisdiction to enforce a money judgment issued by the English High Court of Justice for breach of the Forward Freight Agreement (\"FFA\") between d'Amico Dry and Primera. Primera moved to dismiss this action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The complex procedural history of this case is detailed in this Court's August 13, 2016 Opinion,\n   <em>\n    D'Amico Dry Ltd. v. Primera Maritime (Hellas) Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12183335\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/201/399/#p401\">\n    201 F.Supp.3d 399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 401-02 (S.D.N.Y. 2016), and the Court of Appeals' opinion,\n   <em>\n    d'Amico Dry Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516425\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/216/\">\n    886 F.3d at 219-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This Court held a nonjury trial from May 9, 2016 through May 12, 2016, to determine whether this Court had subject matter jurisdiction and, if so, whether the FFA should be enforced against Primera and the other defendants. The Court of Appeals has now determined that this Court has subject matter jurisdiction. This Court now addresses the defendants' new argument that there is no personal jurisdiction over them, and then proceeds to determine whether the English Judgment should be enforced against Primera and the other defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

In addition, funds from the Facilities Agreement were to be used to pay for the construction of five new bulk carriers. Tr. at 187. Sonic, for instance, built the 57,000-ton SUNRAY using some of the funds. Ex. 17 at 4; Tr. at 186.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   56. Each of the Joint and Several Borrowers was required to post $500,000 in a retention account to secure the payment of the loan. Tr. at 187.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   57. The May 21, 2008 Facilities Agreement was guaranteed by Primera, as well as Paul Coronis and Nicholas Coronis personally. Stipulated Fact \u00b6\u00b6 43, 45. Because Primera managed the Coronis controlled vessels in any event, there does not appear to be any independent consideration for Primera to have agreed to this guarantee. The original Facilities Agreement was signed either by Paul Coronis or an attorney he authorized to sign on behalf of all of the Joint and Several Borrowers and Primera. Ex. 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   58. In the Facilities Agreement, it was agreed that Primera would be the manager of the new and existing ships identified in the Facilities Agreement while the Agreement was in effect. Ex. 17 at 2-3; Tr. at 189. It was also agreed that the \"beneficial ownership\" of the Joint and Several Borrowers and Primera would not change\n   during the pendency of the Agreement. Tr. at 189.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   59. At or about the same time, Paul Coronis helped secure contracts for the construction of various bulk carriers including Sonic's SUNRAY and Mirage's MOONRAY. Ex. 17 at 4, 13; Tr. at 183-84.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   60. In addition, Pasha was to build an unnamed Panamax bulk carrier, Movida was to build an unnamed Handysize bulk carrier, and Element was also to build a Handysize bulk carrier using funds from the Facilities Agreement. Ex. 17 at 4, 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   61. Thus, as of the time Primera entered into the FFA with d'Amico Dry, and as of the time Paul Coronis concluded that Primera was in a dire financial condition, Paul Coronis had ordered the incorporation of these Joint and Several Borrowers. Paul Coronis and Nicholas Coronis were the Officers and Directors of the Joint and Several Borrowers, and the Coronis family owned 70 percent of the shares of each. None of the Joint and Several Borrowers had offices or employees of their own but were operated by Primera which maintained and controlled their assets, including their bank accounts. Tr. at 158-61, 304-05, 339.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   62. Primera was an alter ego of the Coronis family. It disregarded its corporate formalities and was inadequately capitalized at the time it entered into the FFA at issue. It intermingled its corporate funds with Chemnav Shipmanagement and the various shipowning companies eventually owned by Bulknav or managed by Chemnav Shipmanagement. Primera operated out of 6 Roupel Street, 145 64 Kifissia, Athens, Greece along with all of the Coronis family controlled entities including Chemnav Shipmanagement, subsequently Primebulk, and all of the shipowning companies. Its ownership and management was completely dominated and controlled by Nicholas Coronis, and later by Paul Coronis. Primera exercised no business discretion of its own but was instead a tool for the Coronis family's sole use. Primera siphoned funds from FFAs away from Primera and directed the money to other Coronis controlled companies. It also guaranteed the debts of the shipowning companies, becoming collateral for and jointly and severally liable under construction contracts of new ships owned by the Coronis family. It was a tool to co-mingle and/or shelter Coronis family assets.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Findings of Fact,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at \u00b6\u00b6 41-61.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Primera Diversion of Assets\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   63. After the freight market collapsed, and parties sought to enforce FFA debt against Primera, on or about October 6, 2009, Paul Coronis and Primera used a three-way netting-off agreement to collect on Primera's earlier FFA trade with TMT Asia. Tr. at 254; Ex. 12. Despite the fact that Primera was the party to the FFA, instead of directing payment to Primera's account, Paul Coronis diverted funds that should have been paid to Primera to other Coronis controlled entities. For example, the first payment of $203,228.58 was directed to Primrose Shipping, Ltd., a Coronis controlled company. Tr. at 255-56, 259; Exs. 11, 12, 124-25. The second payment of $185,000.00 was directed to Seadance Maritime, a company related to Primrose and controlled by the Coronis family. Exs. 124-25; Tr. at 261.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   64. Primrose and Seadance were controlled directly or indirectly by the Coronis family. Tr. at 268-70; Exs. 124-25. Despite having money directed to their accounts, Primera had no written agreements of any sort with Seadance. Paul Coronis claimed to have a written agreement between Primera and Primrose, but it was never produced. Tr. at 263.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   65. For example, Primrose (whose shares were held in part by Nicholas Coronis and Annabel Charlton and then by\n   Seadance) seated as Director Christos Georgopoulos, who was at that same time the accountant at Primera. Tr. at 270; Ex. 125. Seadance Maritime became the sole owner of Primrose Shipping in 2005. Nicholas Coronis executed a Power of Attorney on behalf of the sole shareholder of Primera, Seadance Maritime, on June 30, 2005. In an effort to cover up the Coronis control of Seadance, Mr. Georgopoulos resigned as Director of Seadance six days after FFA funds were directed to the company by Paul Coronis. Thereafter, a corporation was inserted as Director of Seadance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exs. 124-25. Mr. Georgopoulos was subsequently employed by Primebulk. Tr. at 262.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   66. Also in 2008 and 2009, Paul Coronis directed other payments due to Primera to the Coronis controlled company J.P.C. Investments. Tr. at 275.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   67. J.P.C. Investments had made an interest free loan to Primera in July 2008 for working capital but Paul Coronis claims to have known nothing about the loan. Tr. at 272-73; Ex. 4. The 2008 Primera Profit and Loss and Balance Sheet makes no reference to any such loan having been made or any such obligation. Ex. 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   68. Annabel Charlton, Paul Coronis's mother, was at all material times the only known Director of J.P.C. Investments. Tr. at 272-76; Ex. 4 at 48; Ex. 30; Ex. 126 at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   69. Primera diverted funds to J.P.C. Investments, Seadance and Primrose without any consideration for the transfer having been established. Tr. at 255-76.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   70. Paul Coronis's resignation from Primera on November 15, 2008 was a sham. Tr. at 181. He continued to perform the same work he previously did at Primera before resigning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   71. For example, on January 26, 2009, Paul Coronis contacted d'Amico Dry (using his Primera email address) to offer a guarantee backed by one of the shipowning companies managed by Primera in exchange for d'Amico Dry agreeing to payment in installments by Primera. Tr. at 212-14; Ex. 33. In October, 2009, Paul Coronis negotiated and signed a netting-off agreement on behalf of Primera, communicating again through his Primera email address. Ex. 12; Tr. at 252-54. He also negotiated the changes to the Facility Agreement (discussed in further detail below).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

On January 26, 2009, (despite allegedly having resigned from Primera) Paul Coronis contacted d'Amico Dry to offer a guarantee backed by one of the shipowning companies managed by Primera in exchange for d'Amico Dry's agreeing to installment payments by Primera. Tr. at 212-14; Ex. 33. When d'Amico Dry did not respond to his satisfaction, on February 9, 2009, Paul Coronis wrote to d'Amico Dry stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   I therefore understand that this is to mean that you are not interested in a commercial solution as per the terms previously put forward and your sole interest is to pursue something aggressively and with limited or no results.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Ex. 33 at 8. Paul Coronis communicated with d'Amico Dry and its counsel using his Primera email address. Ex. 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   74. During trial, Paul Coronis testified that he offered to negotiate on behalf of Primera (where he had already resigned, Stipulated Fact \u00b6 27) a guarantee to d'Amico Dry from Moondance Maritime (a company whose Director was Paul Coronis and\n   was majority owned by the Coronis family), for the benefit of J.P.C. Investments (which was \"implied[ly]\" responsible for paying d'Amico Dry and whose Director was Annabel Charlton). Tr. at 174-75, 215, 278-80; Ex. 30 at 6-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   75. Not long after writing his February 9, 2009 email to d'Amico Dry, Paul Coronis ordered the incorporation of Primebulk. Ex. 33 at 8; Ex. 9 at 11. Primebulk was incorporated on February 25, 2009. Stipulated Fact \u00b6 46. Although Primebulk was incorporated in The Marshall Islands and had its registered address there, it did not have any employees or office in The Marshall Islands. It operated out of 6 Roupel Street in Athens, Greece. Tr. at 216-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   76. Once incorporated, Primebulk took the place of Primera for all intents and purposes. With the exception of one person (Jonathon Coronis), all of the employees of Primebulk had been employed by Primera. Stipulated Fact \u00b6 57. Panagiotis Yannoutsos, who oversaw the construction of vessels for Primera, now oversaw the construction of the same vessels for Primebulk. Tr. at 218. Primebulk took over office space, office equipment (including computers), and furniture previously used by Primera. Tr. at 219-20, 334; Stipulated Fact \u00b6 58. (Paul Coronis contends that the landlord provided the furnishings and office equipment, but nothing of that sort is found in Primebulk's lease. Tr. at 222-24.) Primebulk assumed the management of vessels previously managed by Primera. Tr. at 220; Ex. 95 at 61; Ex. 92 at 199A. No consideration was paid by Primebulk to Primera for these assets. Tr. at 222. The fee to register Primebulk as a Greek Law 89 company was paid by Chemnav Shipmanagement, another Coronis entity. Tr. at 221.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   77. Greek Law 89 required shipowners to report to the Ministry of Mercantile Marine which Greek manager was responsible for managing its ships. Tr. at 176.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   78. Paul Coronis and Nicholas Coronis signed the letters required under Law 89 to transfer the management of the MOONDANCE II (Moondance), SEAGLASS II (Nikka), MOONRAY (Mirage) and SUNRAY (Sonic) from Primera to Primebulk. Ex. 95 at 74, 75A, 76A, 77A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   79. When Primebulk was established, Paul Coronis and Anastasia Kalogirou, his grandmother, owned 70 percent of its shares through Riverside Holdings Co. Stipulated Fact \u00b6 48. The other shareholder was a \"silent partner.\" The only Officer and Director initially appointed was Anna Papanikolaou, one of the Coronis family lawyers employed by the firm G.E. Bairactaris &amp; Partners. Ex. 95 at 56; Tr. at 234-35. In April 2010, Ms. Papanikolaou resigned and Dimitrios Vitzileos took her place. Ex. 95 at 56; Tr. at 234-35. Mr. Vitzileos had been an employee of Primera from 1996 through 2009. Stipulated Fact \u00b6 59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   80. Because of the freight market collapse and the FFA losses causing the demise of Primera and the replacement of Primera with Primebulk, in 2009 Paul Coronis had to address and revise the May 21, 2008 Facilities Agreement. Once again, Paul Coronis facilitated the amendments on behalf of all of the Joint and Several Borrowers and Primebulk. Tr. at 248-50. These negotiations led to the Second and Third Supplemental Agreements dated February and September 2009. Exs. 18-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   81. As part of this negotiation, Paul Coronis negotiated changes in the vessels to be constructed. It was agreed that the bulk carrier construction contracts for Pasha and Movida would be canceled and two tankers would be built in their place. Tr. at 250; Stipulated Fact \u00b6 62. Both the M/T CAPE TALARA, owned by Pasha, and the M/T CAPE TROY, owned by Movida, were built using funds provided by the May 21, 2008 Facilities Agreement. Tr. at\n   250; Stipulated Fact \u00b6 63. Handy, Adalia and Element were removed as Joint and Several Borrowers. Tr. at 251.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   82. In addition, the guarantee from Primera was replaced by a guarantee from Primebulk without any evident consideration. Moreover, Primera Ocean Services and Bulknav were also added as guarantors. Tr. at 251. Paul Coronis and Nicholas Coronis also increased their personal guarantees. Tr. at 251; Stipulated Fact \u00b6 61.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   83. Moreover, although vessel managers approved in Facilities Agreements generally must have a proven track record as ship managers, Primebulk replaced Primera as the ship management company despite having only been in operation for fewer than six months. Ex. 17-19; Tr. at 251-52; Stipulated Fact \u00b6 60. Primebulk managed the Coronis family bulk carriers. There was no additional consideration received by Primebulk for agreeing to replace Primera as a guarantor of the Facilities Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   84. In 2010, all vessels managed by Primebulk were delivered or financed under the May 21, 2008 Facilities Agreement. Tr. at 247-48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   85. Primebulk was, at all material times, undercapitalized for the obligations it had assumed. Ex. 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   86. When it began operating vessels in the summer of 2009, Primebulk managed only ships that were majority owned by the Coronis family. Tr. at 247-48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   87. Just as with Primera, Paul Coronis handled the legal and commercial/chartering desk at Primebulk on a day-to-day basis. Tr. at 236.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   88. In the first eight months of essentially operating Primera's business, Primebulk earned net profits of $525,703. In its first full year of operation, Primebulk earned net profits of $969,936. Combined, these profits approach the sum that Primera owed d'Amico Dry but which it avoided paying by depleting its assets and emerging as Primebulk. Ex. 41 at 421, 434.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   89. Primebulk's minutes of the Board of Directors indicate that steps were taken to \"backfill\" the corporate records. Mr. Coronis could not explain why the 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 meetings of the sole Director were on \"short notice.\" He also could not explain why these minutes were nearly identical to one another. Tr. at 291-96; Ex. 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   90. During the course of 2014 and 2015, while discovery in this matter was ongoing, Primebulk's books and records from the start of its operation on April 30, 2009, including its management fee and commission revenue, overhead and general expenses were being analyzed by Moore Stephens. Various documents - including charter parties, recaps, the Memorandum of Agreement for the purchase and sale of vessels, web-banking records, and wages and expense records - were all available and reviewed by Moore Stephens. Ex. 41. Many of these same records were never produced in this litigation (as demonstrated by comparing the records enumerated in Ex. 41 with the alter ego defendants' list of exhibits wherein their entire production is identified).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   91. Primebulk is a successor-in-interest and an alter ego of the Coronis family and Primera. In complete disregard of corporate formalities, the Coronis family abused the corporate form by using Primebulk to replace the debt laden Primera as the ship manager for the Coronis family fleet of ships. Primebulk took over Primera's assets without consideration but did not take over all of its liabilities. Primebulk was grossly undercapitalized because its assets were insufficient to satisfy the obligations that it guaranteed. It intermingled funds with all of the shipowning companies. Its only Officer and Director was initially Primera's attorney and later was Dimitrios\n   Vitzileos, an employee of Primera. Primebulk's employees were almost entirely employees transferred from Primera and its controlling shares were owned by the Coronis family. Primebulk operated out of 6 Roupel Street, 145 64 Kifissia, Athens, Greece in the office space formerly occupied by Primera - in the same building as Chemnav Shipmanagement and the other shipowning companies. It exercised no degree of independent business discretion but was instead controlled by Paul Coronis. Its dealings with the other Coronis family companies were not at arm's length. Primebulk did not pay consideration for any of the business, assets or equipment that it received from Primera including Primera office space, furniture, computers, employees, ships managed and shipowning company accounts and records. Primebulk was not treated as an independent profit center in that it assumed all of Primera's work without assuming all of Primera's debt. It replaced Primera as the corporate guarantor in the loan agreement to buy new Coronis family ships and became jointly and severally liable for the other Coronis family entities' debt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Findings of Fact,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at \u00b6\u00b6 72-90.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    F.

After the CAPE TALARA was built and delivered, on July 5, 2010, Nicholas Coronis signed and submitted a letter on behalf of Pasha to the Greek Mercantile Marine stating that Primebulk was the manager of CAPE TALARA. Ex. 95 at 78A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   95. After the CAPE TROY was built and delivered, on September 20, 2011, Nicholas Coronis signed and submitted a letter on behalf of Movida to the Greek Mercantile Marine stating that Primebulk was the manager of CAPE TROY. Ex. 95 at 80A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   96. Also in and about this time, the shareholding of the Joint and Several Borrowers changed. Bulknav was incorporated at Paul Coronis's request. Tr. at 159. It became the holding company for all of the shares of the Joint and Several Borrowers,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Sonic, Mirage, Handy, Pasha, Nikka, Movida and Element. It also owns the shares of Moondance Maritime, Rocket Finance, Inc., Caldera and Adalia. Tr. at 196. No consideration was paid by Bulknav for these shares.

During 2009 and 2010, Nicholas Coronis and Paul Coronis were both Directors and the President and Treasurer, respectively, of Bulknav. Tr. at 198. Their lawyer, Evangelos Bairactaris, who incorporated Bulknav at Paul Coronis's request, was the only other Director and Secretary. Ex. 69.

Exs. 68-69).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   100. Despite the fact that Bulknav and all of the Joint and Several Borrowers were either Marshall Islands or Malta corporations, none of them had offices or employees in their places of incorporation. They operated through Primera and later Primebulk at their address in Kifissia, Athens, Greece. Tr. at 158-61.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   101. Other than occasions when the shipowning companies hired the vessel's crew, none of these Joint and Several Borrowers had employees. Tr. at 160.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   102. After the formation of Bulknav, Paul Coronis resigned from the Boards of the shipowning companies. Paul Coronis stated that, among other reasons, it was duplicative for him to be a Director of the Bulknav subsidiaries because he exercised sufficient control over them as Director of Bulknav. Tr. at 199. In fact, Paul Coronis makes decisions for Bulknav. Ex. 68; Tr. at 200.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   103. Bulknav did not have its own bank account. Tr. at 200.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   104.

During the course of these proceedings, d'Amico Dry requested that the defendants produce banking, financial and accounting records from Primebulk, Bulknav and the Bulknav owned entities from January 1, 2008 to date. No bank records were produced for Bulknav, Sonic, Handy, Element, Caldera or Adalia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   107. Bulknav is an alter ego of the Coronis family and Primera. Bulknav disregarded corporate formalities by operating as a shell company used by the Coronis family to add another layer of corporate protection for family members. It was inadequately capitalized. It had no bank account. While Bulknav had no funds, money was intermingled and moved among the shipowning entities it owned on a regular basis at the discretion of Paul Coronis to cover shortfalls in the operation of each company. While it has never had employees, Bulknav's Officers and Directors overlapped with the other Coronis family companies and included Paul Coronis and Nicholas Coronis, with Paul Coronis remaining an Officer and Director to date. The controlling Bulknav shares have always been held by the Coronis family. All of Bulknav's shipowning companies are managed out of 6 Roupel Street, 145 64 Kifissia, Athens, Greece, where both Primera and Primebulk housed their day-to-day operations. Bulknav exercised no independent business discretion. Its Director, Paul Coronis, unilaterally designated himself as the Rule 30(b)(6) witness for Bulknav and all of the shipowning companies without seeking permission from any other person. In a less than arm's length transaction, Bulknav novated a contract for the construction of a tank vessel from another Coronis family operated company without consideration for the transaction. It was not treated as its own profit center. It paid no consideration to the shipowning companies for the transfer of their shares, it guaranteed the loan agreement for the purchase of new vessels for the Coronis family, and it became jointly and severally\n   liable for the debt. It intermingled the assets of the Coronis family when two of its single-purpose shipowning companies came to own the Primebulk managed vessels CAPE TALARA and CAPE TROY, the fruits of the loan agreement guaranteed by Primera and the Coronis family.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Findings of Fact,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at \u00b6\u00b6 92-106.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <strong>\n    G.

The payment of bills by Bulknav controlled companies on behalf of Chemnav managed companies can be seen from the payment of the legal invoices in this case. For instance, Chalos &amp; Co. was counsel for Chemnav, and the shipowning entities Chemnav managed (Annamar, Seasafe and Seasatin), as well as Chemnav, Inc. Seven invoices were submitted to Chemnav Shipmanagement by Chalos &amp; Co., but these were paid by wire transfer by Primebulk Shipmanagement. Ex. 14 at 1-7, 27. Later, despite representing the \"Chemnav Defendants,\" Chalos &amp; Co. sent the next six invoices to \"Bulknav\" which, at the time was represented by Blank Rome LLP. These invoices were also paid by Primebulk. Ex. 14 at 8-13, 27. Thereafter, despite representing the Chemnav Defendants, Chalos &amp; Co. continued to bill Blank Rome's client, Bulknav, on another six invoices that were then paid by Nikka. Ex. 14 at 14-19, 27. Each of these invoices was approved for payment by Paul Coronis, who oversaw this litigation on behalf of all of the alter ego defendants. Tr. at 233-34, 236. Later, both Blank Rome and Chalos &amp; Co. billed the UK Defense Club for the legal services, despite the fact that the UK Club insured only two of the defendants, Bulknav owned Mirage and Nikka, and the other five vessels for which policies were produced were insured by other clubs. Ex. 14 at 24-26; Ex. 106.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   136. During the course of these proceedings, d'Amico Dry requested that the defendants produce banking, financial and accounting records from Chemnav Shipmanagement, Chemnav Inc., Annamar, Seasatin, Seasafe, Caldera and Primera Ocean from January 1, 2008 to date. Despite repeated requests, these entities produced bank records for only limited periods.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   Sonic et al. Ex. T. No bank records were provided for Chemnav Inc. or Primera Ocean.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   137. Moreover, no internal accounting or financial records were produced by any of the foregoing parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   138. Paul Coronis designated himself to be the 30(b)(6) witness for Chemnav Shipmanagement, Annamar, Seasatin and Seasafe. No authorization was required from anyone else. Tr. at 170.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   139. Chemnav Shipmanagement and the shipowning companies it manages are the alter egos of the Coronis family and Primera. Chemnav Shipmanagement and the shipowning companies were incorporated at the direction of Paul Coronis. Their corporate forms were disregarded by the Coronis family and Paul Coronis currently makes all decisions for all of the corporations. Chemnav Shipmanagement was inadequately capitalized - its assets were insufficient to satisfy the obligations that it assumed under the loan agreement to buy the Coronis chemical tankers. Chemnav Shipmanagement paid the debts of other Coronis companies. Its Law 89 fee was paid by Primera and it paid the Law 89 fee for Primebulk. Its sole owner, Paul Coronis, was a Director of Primera. Paul Coronis and Nicholas Coronis were Directors and Officers of the shipowning entities. They all operated out of 6 Roupel\n   Street, 145 64 Kifissia, Athens, Greece, along with Primera, Primebulk and all of the Coronis controlled companies. The companies exercised no independent business discretion. Chemnav Shipmanagement's sole shareholder, Paul Coronis, unilaterally designated himself as the Rule 30(b)(6) witness for Chemnav Shipmanagement and all of the shipowning companies without seeking permission from any other person. Funds of the shipowning companies were regularly transferred among the companies (despite having no formal relationship) to cover operational deficits at the direction of Paul Coronis. Debts were also paid for the Bulknav shipowning companies. Chemnav Shipmanagement was the corporate guarantor for the loan agreement to build the Coronis family chemical tanker fleet (the construction contracts for which were guaranteed by Primera) and became jointly and severally liable for the debt. All of these companies intermingled assets and personnel with the other Coronis family companies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Findings of Fact,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at \u00b6\u00b6 111-138.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Primera's Purported Liquidation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   140. Because of threats and action taken by Flame in England to force Primera into involuntary insolvency in 2010, Primera commenced dissolution and later liquidation proceedings in Monrovia, Liberia. None of the alter ego defendants in this case were parties directly or indirectly in the Liberian liquidation. In 2010, Liberia had no established law regarding the liquidation of corporations. Tr. at 485-86.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   141. Primera's liquidator, H. Varney Sherman, met with Linos Choo and other unidentified individuals in Athens on April 6, 2010. Mr. Sherman did nothing to verify the information which was provided to him during the April 6, 2010 meeting. He did nothing to investigate Primera's assets. Tr. at 463, 469, 480.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   142. At their meeting, Mr. Sherman was shown copies of Primera's last bank statement for 2009. Tr. at 466-68. The statement showed a balance of $510.90. Tr. at 484. Despite the fact that these documents were made available to the liquidator, they were not produced by Primera in this action, which was commenced nine months before the Athens meeting. Tr. at 484 ; Primera Ex. RR at 5-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   143. Mr. Sherman was not aware of any of Primera's pre-dissolution activities, including the transfers to Primrose, Seadance or J.P.C. Investments. Tr. at 479-80. In fact, Mr. Sherman was unaware that Primera conducted any business in 2009. Tr. at 468.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   144. Although the Primera 2008 Balance Sheet and Profit and Loss Statement showed assets of $132,862 as of December 31, 2008, Mr. Sherman made no investigation into the disposition of those assets; he testified that doing so was outside the scope of his responsibilities. Tr. at 475, 484-85.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   145. Despite being the liquidator, Mr. Sherman was unaware that Primera was a party to an English arbitration in which it was seeking to recover from two shipyards. Tr. at 483. He was also unable to specify what action, if any, Primera had taken to recover the FFA sums due from Industrial Carriers, Inc., and TMT Asia. Tr. at 471, 481-82.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   146. The liquidation was essentially dormant between 2011 and 2015. Tr. at 481.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   147. For all intents and purposes, Primera's Liberian liquidation is a sham.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Findings of Fact,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at \u00b6\u00b6 140-146.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   <strong>\n    J. Credibility of Paul Coronis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   148. Much of the testimony from Paul Coronis was not credible and his testimony cannot be relied upon. But the defendants\n   rely on the testimony of Paul Coronis in their attempt to defeat the allegations of alter ego liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   149. Paul Coronis testified that, even though he was directing money to Seadance Maritime under the TMT FFA (to be paid by Meadway under the netting-off agreement), he had no knowledge regarding the owners or Officers of Seadance. Tr. at 254, 259-62; Exs. 11-12. Annabel Charlton and Nicholas Coronis, the parents of Paul Coronis, were shareholders of Seadance and Nicholas Coronis was the proxy for the shareholding. Tr. at 267-69. Christos Georgopoulos, who was an employee of both Primera and Primebulk, was the only Director of Seadance. Tr. at 269-70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   150. Paul Coronis testified that he was not familiar with Astradance Shipping S.A. and could not recall if Primera ever managed a vessel called ASTRADANCE. Tr. at 268. Astradance Shipping S.A. was the primary shareholder, presumably in bearer shares, of Seadance. Tr. at 268. In fact, while Paul Coronis was a Director at Primera (specifically between 2004 and 2006), Primera managed ASTRADANCE for Primrose Shipping Ltd. Tr. at 171-72; Ex. 92 at 168, 174, 180.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   151. Paul Coronis testified that, even though he was directing money to J.P.C. Investments under various FFAs, he had no knowledge of the Officers, Directors or shareholders of J.P.C. Investments. Tr. at 274-76. Paul Coronis's mother, Annabel Charlton, is the only known Officer and/or Director of J.P.C. Investments. Ex. 30 at 6-7; Ex. 31. Furthermore, Paul Coronis testified that he was not aware of the $1,500,000 interest-free loan provided by J.P.C. Investments to Primera in 2008 while Paul Coronis was a Director of Primera. Tr. at 171-72, 271-73. The loan documents were signed by Annabel Charlton in 2008. Ex. 4 at 48; Tr. at 273.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   152. Paul Coronis testified that he was never a Director of Primera Ocean, which he claimed was a corporate guarantor under the Third Supplement to the May 21, 2008 Facilities Agreement. Tr. at 251, 281. However, the Law 89 documents show that Paul Coronis became an Officer and Director of Primera Ocean in December 2004. Ex. 94 at 45-47. Nicholas Coronis and Annabel Charlton were also Officers. Ex. 94 at 17-19, 45-47. The Law 89 fee for Primera Ocean was paid by Primera. Ex. 94 at 61.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   153. Paul Coronis testified that there are no overlapping shareholders between Primera and Chemnav Shipmanagement or Primera and Primebulk, although there is no time period specified in his response. Tr. at 314. However, Paul Coronis testified that he never gained an understanding as to who was the dominant shareholder of Primera. Tr. at 315. Furthermore, no documents have been produced by the defendants that indicate the identity of the beneficial owner of Primera beyond the holding company, Denton Shipping, which Paul Coronis also testified was unfamiliar to him. Tr. at 178; Primera Ex. RR at 1. According to Primera's Law 89 documents, the sole Officer and Director of Primera from December 5, 1991 to November 21, 2008 was Nicholas Coronis. Furthermore, the sole shareholder of Primera was listed as Nicholas Coronis. Ex. 92 129, 241-43; Tr. at 166-67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   154. Paul Coronis testified that the office equipment used by both Primera and Primebulk belonged to the office and the landlord. Tr. at 222. The building was owned by Paul Coronis, Chianna Coronis, and Jonathan Coronis; therefore, any equipment belonging to the landlords would have also belonged to the Coronis family. Tr. at 161. However, Primebulk's lease does not list any furniture or equipment to be provided by the landlord or the building. Tr. at 224.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   155. Throughout the trial, Paul Coronis testified that he was acting on behalf of the Board of Directors for varying companies.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Tr. at 183-84, 200-01, 213-15, 249.

The Defendants' Production of Documents was Deficient\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   156. In the course of this litigation Primera has produced only a handful of corporate documents, no banking records, and was unable to produce any witness in response to d'Amico Dry's 30(b)(6) Notice of Deposition. Tr. at 170-71.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   157. The Primera corporate records were kept in a cupboard in Primera's office at 6 Roupel Street. Tr. at 161, 169-70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   158. Paul Coronis admitted that he failed to produce documents in this proceeding because he deemed them irrelevant. Tr. at 232-33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   159. Paul Coronis testified that the alter ego defendants had Board of Directors meetings once a month or when a significant decision took place. Tr. at 339. The minutes from these meetings have not been produced in this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   160.

Primera and the alter ego defendants, excluding J.P.C.

The circumstances of the proceedings at the time the personal jurisdiction defense was first raised in the answers and subsequently pursued in April 2018 is also significant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hamilton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"633553\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/197/58/#p60\">\n    197 F.3d at 62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"By withholding its motion [to dismiss], [the defendant] gambled that it could raise the personal jurisdiction issue on the eve of trial, in case a trial occurred.\"). In this case, after initially raising the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction in their answers, the appearing defendants waited about three years to pursue that defense in their April 2018 letter. The appearing defendants asserted that defense after litigating two motions to dismiss and participating in a four-day bench trial. There is a powerful inference that those defendants were simply attempting to preserve yet another litigation tactic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   9.

Therefore, the English Judgment may be enforced against Primera. Whether the English Judgment may be enforced against the other appearing defendants depends on whether they are alter egos of Primera.

Investments S.A. The Clerk issued certificates of default against Primera Ocean and J.P.C. Investments but Paul Coronis and Nicholas Coronis successfully urged the Clerk not to enter certificates of default against them. The defendants contend that Paul Coronis and Nicholas Coronis were not properly served under the Hague Convention and therefore the Court cannot enter default judgments against them because the Court does not have jurisdiction over them. No specific argument has been made on behalf of Primera Ocean and J.P.C. Investments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   12.

Specifically, d'Amico Dry contends that the nonappearing defendants are alter egos of Primera and argues that (1) because Primera is subject to the Court's jurisdiction, so are its alter egos; and (2) because Primera and the other appearing defendants participated fully in the proceedings, any objections to service of process and personal jurisdiction by the nonappearing defendants were forfeited by the appearing defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   14.

This Court has jurisdiction over Primera, and Primera, as well as the rest of the appearing defendants, participated fully in this proceeding. Therefore, the Court has personal jurisdiction over the nonappearing defendants including Paul Coronis and Nicholas Coronis, regardless of whether Paul Coronis and Nicholas Coronis were properly served.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Passalacqua Builders\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10541661\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/933/131/#p142\">\n    933 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   142-43 ;\n   <em>\n    Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1789074\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/925/556/#p562\">\n    925 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   562 ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Totalplan Corp. of Am. v.

It would be particularly inappropriate to find that there was no personal jurisdiction over Paul Coronis and Nicholas Coronis based on the alleged insufficiency of the service of process on them. They both had actual knowledge of these proceedings. Moreover, Paul Coronis actually appeared in New York and testified at the trial on behalf of the appearing defendants, and also testified at a deposition as the Rule 30(b)(6) witness on behalf of the appearing alter ego defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   17.

However, the result in this case would not change based upon application of one versus the other. \"In the context of successor liability and the exceptions to the general rule, it is best understood that federal common law and traditional common law are virtually synonymous, and, for the most part, traditional common law and the common law of a particular state are essentially interchangeable .... In terms of cases occurring within New York, the Second Circuit held that New York's common law follows the traditional common law rules of successor liability.\"\n    <em>\n     Gallo v.
