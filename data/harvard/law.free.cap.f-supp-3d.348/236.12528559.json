Final determinations on these issues and others will be made in due course: claim construction will be conducted after the scheduled\n   <em>\n    Markman\n   </em>\n   hearing and issues of infringement will be determined after trial. It is for that reason, and the reasons that follow, that Serenity's preliminary injunction motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Because of the interrelatedness of these factual issues, detailed findings of fact will be deferred and made following the scheduled\n   <em>\n    Markman\n   </em>\n   hearing and trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Defendants' NOCTIVA has been on the market since May 1, 2018.

Movants rely on the linear relationship between doses of desmopressin and plasma/serum concentrations to support an inference of infringement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4. Infringement of Claim 1 is established, they claim, by the mathematical relationship between doses of NOCDURNA and the resulting physiological response (plasma concentration expressed as Area Under the Curve (\"AUC\") or Maximum Serum Concentration (\"Cmax\") ).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7 (\"Ferring's NDA Products contain a dose of desmopressin sufficient to maintain a maximum concentration of about .5-10 pg/ml for about four to six hours.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Ferring counters by reference to intrinsic evidence supporting a \"dose limitation\" based on Dr. Fein's inclusion in the Patents' shared common specification of the dose range \".5ng to 20 \u00b5g desmopressin.\" ECF No. 185-3 at 3; 321 Patent, ECF No. 185-8 at 2.
