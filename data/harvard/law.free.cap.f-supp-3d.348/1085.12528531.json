Judge You recommended that the Court dismiss the original complaint with leave to file an amended pleading. The Court adopted in part Judge You's F&amp;R, and Plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint (\"FAC\"). Defendant then moved to dismiss the FAC with prejudice, and Judge You issued an F&amp;R recommending that the motion be granted without leave to file a second amended complaint. Judge You concluded that the FAC did not allege facts sufficient to show that Defendant acted with discriminatory intent, which is required to state a claim under the Oregon Public Accommodations Act (\"OPAA\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Or. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 659A.403, 659A.885(7). Because Judge You concluded that Plaintiffs did not adequately allege discriminatory intent, she did not reach the question of whether Defendant's business is a place of public accommodation, which is also required to state a claim under the OPAA. Plaintiffs timely objected to the entirety of the F&amp;R concerning the FAC. After de novo review,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court ADOPTS IN PART AND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   REJECTS IN PART the F&amp;R at issue and DENIES Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' FAC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant Airbnb, Inc. (\"Airbnb\") is a Delaware corporation, headquartered in California. Charging various fees for its services, Airbnb operates an online platform that connects people looking to rent out their homes (or rooms in their homes) with people looking for accommodations for either lodging or tourism experiences. Airbnb does not own any of the properties that it lists for rent. Instead, it charges fees for processing each transaction (often to both sides of a rental relationship), as well as for providing advertising. In 2016, Airbnb's online platform (consisting of websites and mobile apps) served more than 300,000 renters in Portland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A person offering to rent out a room in his or her home (or offering to rent his or her home) through Airbnb is referred to as a \"host.\" A host must be registered with Airbnb as a \"member.\" Travelers who rent rooms or homes from a host using the Airbnb online platform are referred to as \"guests.\" Although anyone can search the Airbnb database of more than two million properties worldwide, to contact a host online and request a reservation and make a booking, a prospective guest also must be a member of Airbnb, which requires the prospective guest to have an account and profile with Airbnb. Airbnb requires each member's profile to include, among other things, a photograph of the member's face and the member's full name. When a prospective guest sends a request to a host to reserve or book an accommodation listed on the Airbnb online platform, Airbnb sends information to the host about the prospective guest, including the prospective guest's photograph and full name. Although some Airbnb hosts may elect to participate in Airbnb's \"instant booking\" feature,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   most hosts require that a prospective guest first request a booking and be approved by the host before the booking transaction may be completed by Airbnb. Many hosts elect to receive booking requests only from prospective guests whose profile includes a photograph. Airbnb would then send the booking request to the host, who reviews the prospective guest's name and photograph. After reviewing the name and photograph, along with other information, the host may confirm, reject, or simply not respond to the request. If a host does not timely respond, the request automatically expires.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Because Airbnb allows hosts to view the photograph and name of a prospective guest before deciding whether to accept or deny a booking request from that prospective guest, a host can deny a booking request for any reason, including the race or color of a prospective guest. Airbnb is aware that some hosts refuse to rent accommodations to prospective guests on the basis of race or color. Airbnb is also aware that African-Americans are less likely to be confirmed for booking as guests on Airbnb's online platform than are persons who are not African-Americans. Because some hosts refuse to rent accommodations to African-Americans, some accommodations listed on Airbnb's online platform are unavailable to African-American travelers. African-Americans, thus, do not have full and equal access to the accommodations and services offered on Airbnb's online platform.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Airbnb does not dispute that some Airbnb hosts engage in racially discriminatory conduct. Airbnb asserts that it takes\n   seriously the problem of racial discrimination on its online platform. Nonetheless, Airbnb has continued to maintain its policy of allowing hosts to wait to make a booking decision until after the host has seen the prospective guest's photograph, which discloses the race or color of the prospective guest. Airbnb explains that requiring a prospective guest to include a photograph of his or her face allows a host to learn more information about the prospective guest before deciding whether to accept a booking request from that person. Airbnb states that viewing a photograph of a prospective guest before accepting a booking allows a host to conclude that a guest is \"reliable, authentic, and committed to the spirit of Airbnb.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs in this putative class action are African-American women who reside in Oregon and wish to become members of Airbnb and use the services of Airbnb's online platform without being subject to racial discrimination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs, however, are only willing to join Airbnb if they will be able to take full advantage of the accommodations offered on the Airbnb online platform without the risk of racial discrimination based on the inclusion of a guest's photograph.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Before filing this lawsuit, Ms. Harrington wrote a letter to Airbnb requesting that it change its policies so that all accommodations on its online platform may be available to all prospective guests regardless of race or color. Ms. Harrington specifically asked Airbnb to change its policy that allows a host to wait to confirm a booking until after the host has seen the full name and photograph of a prospective guest. She expressly asked Airbnb not to provide information to hosts before accepting a reservation or confirming a booking from a prospective guest that would reveal statutorily-protected immutable characteristics, like race. Airbnb denied the request to change its policy, but offered to assist Ms. Harrington in securing alternative accommodations if she ever were discriminated against by an Airbnb host. Airbnb also promised to investigate any reported claims of racial discrimination and take appropriate action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim may be granted only when there is no cognizable legal theory to support the claim or when the complaint lacks sufficient factual allegations to state a facially plausible claim for relief.\n   <em>\n    Shroyer v.

At the motion to dismiss stage, Plaintiffs need only to show a prima facie case of discrimination.

This allegation sufficiently pleads that Airbnb intentionally makes many of the accommodations listed on its online platform unavailable to Plaintiffs and others on account of their race by maintaining policies that enable hosts to refuse service to prospective guests who are African-American. Because African-Americans do not have full and equal access to all the accommodations on the Airbnb online platform to which persons who are not African-Americans have access, Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that they are being treated differently than prospective guests who use the Airbnb online platform but are not African-Americans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have not alleged sufficient facts to show that Airbnb acted with the requisite discriminatory intent. In pleading discriminatory intent on the part of Airbnb, however, Plaintiffs also allege that Airbnb's proffered reason for maintaining its photograph policy-that it tells a host whether a prospective guest is \"reliable, authentic, and committed to the spirit of Airbnb\"-is a pretext for discriminatory motive. Plaintiffs allege that a photograph of a prospective guest's face reveals nothing meaningful about whether that person is \"reliable, authentic, and committed to the spirit of Airbnb.\" Because Airbnb's proffered race-neutral reason for the challenged policy plausibly is a sham designed to conceal discriminatory motive, Plaintiffs have adequately pleaded circumstantial evidence of discriminatory intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendant narrowly reads Plaintiffs' FAC as arguing only that Airbnb's discriminatory intent can be inferred from Airbnb's awareness that hosts are taking advantage of the photograph policy to discriminate on the basis of race. As explained by Defendant, merely knowing that a policy has discriminatory effects does not constitute discriminatory intent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wood v.

In\n   <em>\n    Wood\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the complaint on the grounds that \"knowledge of [the challenged policy's] discriminatory effects\" did not adequately allege disparate treatment (or discriminatory intent) under Title VII.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3873514\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/678/1075/#p1081\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiffs, however, allege more than just Airbnb's knowledge of the discriminatory effects of its policies and that Airbnb is aware of the racial discrimination practiced on its platform. Plaintiffs also allege that when Airbnb repeatedly reaffirmed and recommitted to its mandatory photograph policy, Airbnb made a calculated decision that it was not only willing to tolerate racial discrimination on its online platform rather than risk losing potential hosts and potential revenues, but it was also intentionally enabling, and thus furthering, racial discrimination. Airbnb knows that some of its hosts discriminate on the basis of race. Yet, with that knowledge, Airbnb has designed, imposed, and recommitted to features (specifically, its mandatory photograph policy) that, Plaintiffs allege, enables racial discrimination, in order not to lose the business of hosts who seek to discriminate on the basis of race or color.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Evidence that Airbnb's proffered reason for its challenged mandatory photograph policy is pretextual, as Plaintiffs allege, is circumstantial evidence that the underlying motivation is discriminatory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lindsey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5857506\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/447/1138/#p1140\">\n    447 F.3d at 1148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that Airbnb's mandatory photograph policy does not provide any meaningful information from which an Airbnb host can learn whether a prospective guest is \"reliable, authentic, or committed to the spirit of Airbnb.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that a photograph of a person's face does not reveal the legitimate information that Airbnb claims it does. Looking at a photograph of a person's face reveals no meaningful information about whether that person is \"reliable, authentic, or committed to the spirit of Airbnb.\" What Airbnb's mandatory photograph policy does do, however, is reveal a prospective guest's race or color, thereby giving a host the ability to deny a request from a prospective guest on account of race or color. Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that it is plausible that Airbnb's policy of allowing hosts to review a prospective guest's photograph\n   <em>\n    before booking\n   </em>\n   , rather than after, primarily serves to enable and facilitate racial discrimination. Because Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that the proffered reason for the mandatory photograph policy is a pretext designed to enable and shield discriminatory motive, Plaintiffs have alleged that Airbnb acted with discriminatory intent sufficient to state a claim under the OPAA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   At this stage of the litigation, Plaintiffs' well-pleaded allegations are presumed true and must be viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs. Defendants argue that the Court should ignore these allegations under\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   as merely conclusory and non-factual.\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678-79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs' allegation, however, that a photograph does not in fact reveal any meaningful information about whether a prospective guest is \"reliable, authentic, and committed to the spirit of Airbnb\" is not a legal conclusion or a non-factual conclusory allegation of the kind that\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   advises a court to disregard. Instead, it is a factual assertion about the kind of information that a photograph of a person's face does or does not reveal. The FAC alleges that providing hosts with a photograph of a prospective guest's face\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the host decides whether to accept the guest's booking request is a policy intended to enable and facilitate racial discrimination. At this stage of the lawsuit, Plaintiffs' allegation that the proffered reason for Airbnb's photograph policy is pretext designed to enable racial discrimination on the Airbnb online platform must be accepted\n   as true.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678-79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The facts giving rise to an inference of discriminatory intent are not significantly different from the facts alleged in\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

In\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs were African-American men who had been denied entry into a nightclub.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%201397554\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The nightclub maintained a racially-neutral \"no-baggy-pants\" policy, but Plaintiffs alleged that the policy was a pretext for discrimination against African-Americans.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2.

Denying the defendants' motion for summary judgment, the district court held that there was a triable issue of fact concerning whether the defendants acted with discriminatory intent in formulating and maintaining the \"no baggy pants\" policy, based on the fact that the defendants were fully aware of instances when the bouncers had enforced the policy in a discriminatory manner against African-Americans.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs have alleged that Airbnb's proffered reason for its pre-booking mandatory photograph policy is \"unworthy of credence\" and have sufficiently alleged the requisite discriminatory intent to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Place of Public Accommodation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Because Judge You concluded that Plaintiffs had not adequately alleged intentional discrimination, Judge You declined to reach whether Airbnb is a place of public accommodation under the OPAA. Airbnb argues that it is not. Airbnb contends that it falls within the category of \"institution, bona fide club or place of accommodation that is in its nature distinctly private.\" Or. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 659A.400(2)(e). Airbnb hosts rent out privately-owned accommodations, generally their homes or rooms in their homes. Further, because hosts allow people into their homes, they retain full discretion over which guests they choose to allow. Indeed, it is this discretion that Airbnb recognizes has allowed so many hosts to deny accommodations to African-Americans based on race or color. Because it is a host, and not Airbnb directly, that offers the accommodations or lodgings, Airbnb argues, Airbnb is not a place of public accommodation under the OPAA. Further, Airbnb argues that it is a \"distinctly private\" organization and, thus, exempt from complying with Oregon's anti-discrimination public accommodation law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Airbnb's argument rests on a narrow reading of the statute. The OPAA defines a \"place of public accommodation\" as \"[a]ny place\n   <em>\n    or service\n   </em>\n   offering to the public accommodations, advantages, facilities or privileges whether in the nature or goods, services, lodgings, amusements, transportation or otherwise.\" Or. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 659A.400(1)(a) (emphasis added). Airbnb does not own the actual homes or rooms that its member hosts rent out to guests, but whether the individual hosts themselves are distinctly private entities is a different question from whether Airbnb is a distinctly private entity for purposes of the OPAA. Airbnb is a \"service offering to the public ... [certain] services,\" namely, the service of searching for, finding, and booking an accommodation using its online platform. Further, even though users must join Airbnb as a member and create a member profile to be allowed access to Airbnb's online platform services, entities still may be open to the public \"de facto\" when they are \"so unselective in their membership criteria that they are effectively\n   public.\"\n   <em>\n    Lahmann v.

It is irrelevant that Airbnb does not itself directly rent or own the accommodations being rented out because what Airbnb provides to the public is the service of using its online platform to browse, locate, book, and pay for accommodations in private homes.
