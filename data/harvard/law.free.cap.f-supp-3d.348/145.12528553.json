Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    The Search of Passengers on Delta Flight 1583\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On February 22, 2017, Plaintiffs were passengers on Delta Airlines Flight 1583, a domestic flight from San Francisco International Airport to New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport (\"JFK\"). (Compl. \u00b6 1.) Most of the Plaintiffs reside in New York. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-12, 15, 17-19.) Plaintiffs are a diverse group of individuals, consisting of nine men and women of a variety of ages and races. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-19, 60.) Among them are several \"consultant[s],\" \"journalist[s],\" a pair of \"marketing professional[s],\" and a \"university professor.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Some of the Plaintiffs were traveling with family that day. For instance, Plaintiff Amadei was traveling with her spouse and seven-year-old son, and Plaintiffs Eric and Karen Polk are married. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60.) While diverse in background, Plaintiffs share two common experiences: they are \"frequent passengers on domestic airline flights,\" and they all allege that Defendants subjected them to an unlawful search as Plaintiffs disembarked from this particular flight. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After Plaintiffs' flight arrived at JFK, but before it parked at the gate, the flight crew announced to the passengers that as they deplaned \"they would have to show documents to [CBP] officers meeting the flight.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.) Following this initial announcement, the flight crew made \"at least two announcements regarding the requirement that the passengers produce documents.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.) A flight attendant clarified that \"documents\" meant a \"passport or government-issued ID\" and further stated that the passengers should be prepared to provide \"any additional documentation that the officers requested.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) A flight attendant also told the passengers that \"no passenger[ ] would be allowed to deplane without showing ... identification.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) At this point, many passengers and even several flight attendants \"expressed consternation or dismay\" and \"wondered aloud about the purpose of the demand for documents, who the officers were, and why all passengers would be required to show such documents after a domestic flight.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37, 39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Following these announcements, a flight attendant opened the aircraft door located between the first class and economy cabins, which was the only exit from the aircraft. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.) Outside the door and positioned in such a way as to block the exit were two \"tall and physically imposing\" Customs and Border Control (\"CBP\") agents, Officers John Doe 1 and John Doe 2 (the \"Doe Officers\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 41, 43.) Both of the Doe Officers wore bulletproof vests that read \"POLICE / U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION\" and carried guns that were visible to the passengers onboard. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 41-43.) As passengers approached the door, the Doe Officers permitted each passenger to exit only upon a complete and thorough review of the passenger's identification document. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 45, 47.) Plaintiffs observed that the demeanor of the Doe Officers during this process was \"stern and unfriendly.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs were distressed and alarmed by the situation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48-50.) Plaintiff Amadei, who was traveling with her spouse and seven-year-old son (who has darker skin than she), had to explain to the Doe Officers that her son is only seven years old and does not carry identification. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.) Plaintiff Amadei's son was noticeably frightened by this experience, at one point asking his mother if the family was in trouble. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Upon escorting her family out of the gate area, Plaintiff Amadei asked the Doe Officers why the search was happening and was told, \"it's not for you to worry about; we do it from time to time,\" or words to that effect. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that they did not consent to the identification search. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.) Instead, they understood from the circumstances that the search was mandatory and that they would not be free to exit the aircraft until they submitted their documents to the Doe Officers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs allege that CBP did not have a valid judicial warrant authorizing the alleged search and seizure of Flight 1583 passengers and further allege that CBP did not have any individualized reasonable suspicion that any passenger, \"much less all passengers,\" had engaged in criminal activity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    CBP's Explanation for the Search\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In response to media reports about the incident, CBP \"attempted to justify its actions by asserting that the officers involved were searching for a specific person subject to removal from the United States.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56.) CBP also justified the search by saying that searches like the one that occurred on Flight 1583 are \"routine,\" and that the officers acted \"pursuant to longstanding CBP policy,\" citing regulations permitting searches of passengers arriving to the United States from abroad. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) In a public statement released on February 23, 2017, CBP stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at John F. Kennedy Airport was contacted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) yesterday, February 22, 2017, to assist in locating an individual possibly aboard Delta flight 1583 from San Francisco International Airport to JFK. This individual was ordered removed by an immigration judge. To assist our law enforcement partners, two CBP officers requested identification from those on the flight in order to help identify the individual. The individual was determined not to be on the flight.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   CBP often receives requests from our law enforcement partners to assist in various ways, including identifying a person of interest. CBP will assist when able to.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.) When asked by the news media whether the search was voluntary, a spokesperson for CBP stated, \"[i]t is always best to cooperate with law enforcement, so as to expedite your exiting the airport in a timely manner.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61. (alteration in original) ) CBP subsequently followed up with a statement claiming that the Doe Officers had requested \"consensual assistance from passengers aboard the flight.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62.) Separately, a CBP spokesperson told a reporter that the identification checks are \"not a new policy\" and that it is \"not unusual for us to assist our fellow law-enforcement agencies.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63.) Another Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") official told the media that such searches and collaboration between CBP and ICE are \"routine.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In an email exchange regarding the search, Defendant Russo asserted that the search was undertaken at the request of ICE \"to identify [an] individual\" who was \"removed by an immigration judge for domestic assault and other crimes.\" (Emails between Def. Russo and Jordan Wells (\"Russo Emails\") (Dkt. 1-1) at 1.) In the same exchange, Defendant Russo stated\n   the following: \"[w]e do this every day. Someone took a picture and put it on twitter. That's what led to the hysteria.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Finally, in response to a media inquiry asking that CBP identify its statutory authority to examine the identification documents of all passengers on a domestic flight, CBP sent a link to a document on the CBP website entitled \"CBP Search Authority\" which cites\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20162.6\">\n    19 C.F.R. \u00a7 162.6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , a regulation governing CBP's authority to search passengers entering the United States from abroad. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 67-68.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On February 27, 2017, Congressman Bennie G. Thompson, the Ranking Member of the U.S. House Committee on Homeland Security, wrote to ICE and CBP, stating that \"[i]t is ... troubling that CBP officers called to assist apparently chose to require passengers, including U.S. citizens, to produce identification before disembarking, rather than confirming whether the individual was on the flight either by visual inspection, checking the passenger manifest, or confirming with ICE that the individual was aboard.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70. (alteration in original) ) Rep. Thompson asked CBP a variety of questions to which he sought written responses by March 10, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to Plaintiffs, as of the date of the filing of the complaint, Rep. Thompson has not yet received a response from CBP or ICE. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71.) On September 13, 2017, Plaintiffs' counsel asked Defendants Duke, McAleenan, Russo, Homan, Decker, and Jennings to clarify whether CBP has a policy that would permit the stopping and searching of passengers on domestic flights and, if so, the legal authority to justify such a policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72.) Plaintiffs received a letter from DHS's Office of General Counsel acknowledging receipt of the letter, but Plaintiffs have not yet received a substantive response. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiffs filed their complaint on October 12, 2017. (Compl.) Plaintiffs bring claims based on two causes of action. First, Plaintiffs allege that their Fourth Amendment rights were violated when they were required to produce identification before exiting the aircraft.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20162.6\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20162.6\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 77-88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Second, Plaintiffs allege that, to the extent that CBP officers acted pursuant to a policy in checking the passengers' respective identification, this policy violates \u00a7 706(2)(A)-(C) of the APA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20162.6\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20162.6\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 89-95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, including a declaration that \"the rule or policy pursuant to which CBP conducted the illegal search and seizure of Plaintiffs as they deplaned Flight 1583 on February 22, 2017, including, but not limited to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20162.6\">\n    19 C.F.R. \u00a7 162.6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , is unconstitutional, arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, contrary to law, and in excess of statutory authority, and is therefore invalid under the Administrative Procedure Act.\" (Compl. at p.20.) Plaintiffs also request a permanent injunction that bars Defendants and their agencies from \"seizing and conducting warrantless and/or suspicionless identification checks of passengers disembarking from domestic flights.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On February 12, 2018, the court granted Defendants leave to move to dismiss the Complaint.

Instead of asserting a facial 12(b)(1) motion, \"a defendant is permitted to make a fact-based Rule 12(b)(1) motion, proffering evidence beyond the [p]leading.\"\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055671\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/822/47/#p56\">\n    822 F.3d at 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls. Opp'n at 22-23.) Plaintiffs supplement these allegations by attaching as an exhibit an email exchange in which Defendant Russo claims that CBP conducts this sort of search \"every day.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Russo Emails.) For the reasons stated below, the court finds that Plaintiffs' allegations and exhibit are facially sufficient to establish that Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged standing at this stage of the litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Defendants attempt to controvert Plaintiffs' allegations by averring that Defendant Russo's emails did not \"express[ ] ... that there is a CBP policy or practice of checking identification of all passengers disembarking U.S. domestic flights, or all passengers disembarking a single U.S. domestic flight.\" (Russo Decl. \u00b6 4.) Russo also claims that \"[o]ther than the incident\" at issue in this case, he is \"not aware of another incident in which CBP checked the identification of all passengers disembarking a U.S. domestic flight.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.) Plaintiffs respond to the Russo Declaration by arguing that it presents \"[c]onclusory allegations\" that are \"insufficient to contradict plausible allegations\" in Plaintiffs' complaint. (Pls. Opp'n at 6.) The court agrees with Plaintiffs and finds that the Russo Declaration does not contradict Plaintiffs' facially plausible allegations. Defendant Russo's conclusory disclaimer of the existence of any CBP policy or practice of searching domestic airline passengers is itself plainly contradicted by the content and context of Defendant Russo's email exchange and the statements of other CBP officials in defense of the search.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zappia Middle E. Constr. Co. v.

The statements provided in Plaintiffs complaint acknowledged that the search was conducted pursuant to a policy or practice. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 63-65, Russo Emails.) Defendant Russo's other claim, that he is not aware of any other incident similar to the one at issue in this case, is similarly contradicted on its face by Defendant Russo's own emails and Plaintiffs' voluminous and plausible allegations showing CBP officials describing the search as part of a routine practice. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 63-65, Russo Emails.) The court therefore finds that Defendants' proffer of the Russo Declaration fails to support a fact-based 12(b)(1) motion and treats Defendants' motion as a facial motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Specifically, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that they are likely to experience a similar search in the future-a necessary showing for Plaintiffs to seek prospective relief-because Plaintiffs have not alleged that they have definitive plans to take a domestic flight in the future and have only been subjected to a search once before. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10.)

Plaintiffs assert that these allegations, in conjunction with their allegation that they are frequent domestic air travelers, establish that there is a sufficiently strong likelihood that Plaintiffs will experience a similar search in the future when they travel on another domestic flight. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls. Opp'n at 12-13.)

First, for the reasons explained below in the court's discussion of Plaintiffs' APA claim, the court finds that Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that the JFK search was conducted pursuant to a formal policy or its functional equivalent.\n   <em>\n    CompareDeshawn E.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1566994\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/156/340/#p344\">\n    156 F.3d at 344-45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]his case is distinguishable from Lyons because, in Lyons, there was no proof of a pattern of illegality as the police had discretion to decide if they were going to apply a choke hold\n   <em>\n    and there was no formal policy which sanctioned the application of the choke hold\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis added) );\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Lyons,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298204\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/95/\">\n    461 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   110 n.9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298204\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/95/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1660\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The dissent does not ... point to any written or oral pronouncement by the LAPD or any evidence showing a pattern of police behavior that would indicate that the official policy would permit the application of [chokeholds on suspects who refrained from engaging in unlawful conduct].\") Unlike the LAPD in Lyons, Defendants here openly acknowledged that the search was conducted pursuant to a policy-and \"not a new one\" at that-and have admitted that it is \"not unusual for [Defendants] to assist [their] fellow law enforcement agencies\" in this manner. (Compl. \u00b6 63.) Defendants have even noted that they \"often receive\" such requests for assistance from their law enforcement partners pursuant to this policy. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.) Thus, as opposed to the unusual circumstances where the Court in Lyons found the LAPD's chokehold policy would apply, here, Defendants' search policy appears to be enforced simply at the \"not unusual\" request of another law enforcement agency. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 57, 63.)
