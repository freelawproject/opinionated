Plaintiff alleges that Allstate improperly canceled stock awards that it previously granted Plaintiff under the plan when Plaintiff took a job at The Auto Club Group (\"AAA\") within weeks of retiring from Allstate. Plaintiff's amended complaint asserts claims for: breach of contract (Count I); implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing (Count II); negligent misrepresentation (Count III); action in equity for relief from fraud (Count IV); and common law fraud (Count V).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendant moves to dismiss all counts. [22]. Plaintiff moves to strike Defendant's affirmative defenses. [32]. For the reasons explained below, this Court grants in part and denies in part Defendant's motion to dismiss, and grants Plaintiff's motion to strike.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

For the last 9 years of her employment with Defendant, Plaintiff held the position of Senior Vice President, Field Business Conduct Officer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In May 2001, Defendant began offering its Equity Incentive Plan (the Plan).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7, 9. The primary purpose of the Plan was to \"provide a means by which employees ... can acquire and maintain stock ownership, thereby strengthening their commitment to the success of the Company and its Subsidiaries and their desire to remain employed by the Company.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Under the Plan, an employee could receive various awards, including nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, unrestricted stock, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance units, and performance stock.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. In exchange for performing under the Plan, Plaintiff received various awards, including stock option awards, restricted stock unit awards, and performance stock awards.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In February 2012, Defendant amended the Plan, and included, for the first time, a \"Non-Competition\" provision (Non-Competition Provision), which provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   17.3\n   <em>\n    Non-Competition\n   </em>\n   .

[21-3] at 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   By the time she retired in December 2016, Defendant had granted Plaintiff several awards. [21] \u00b6 32.

Pursuant to the terms of the Plan, if a Participant violates the Plan's non-competition provision, any outstanding Awards granted on or after February 21, 2012, that remain subject to a Period of Restriction or other performance or vesting condition will be cancelled.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [21-4] at 1.

Defendant contends that, when Plaintiff went to work for AAA in January 2017, she violated the Non-Competition Provision of the 2012 and 2013 versions of the Plan, and under those circumstances, Defendant had the right to cancel her awards. [23] at 6-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendant's argument, however, fails because it requires this Court to presume that Plaintiff, in fact, left Defendant to work for a company that constitutes a \"Competitive Business.\" The Non-Competition Provision provides that Plaintiff shall not \"directly or indirectly engage in, own or control an interest in or act as principal, director, officer, or employee of, or consultant to, any firm or company that is a Competitive Business.\" [21-2] at 23-24; [21-3] at 23.

[21] \u00b6 30. But whether AAA qualifies as a \"Competitive Business\" under the Plan, cannot be determined at this point in the proceedings, and this Court cannot simply draw an inference in Defendant's favor that AAA\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   a \"Competitive Business\" for the purposes of a motion to dismiss. As such, this Court cannot accept Defendant's contention that it rightfully canceled Plaintiff's awards (and therefore did not breach the Plan) because Plaintiff violated the Non-Competition Provision. And, because Defendant fails to challenge any other element of Plaintiff's breach of contract claim, this Court denies Defendant's motion to dismiss Count I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Plaintiff alleges that Defendant knew that Plaintiff's awards were not subject to the non-competition provision when they sent her the letter, but canceled the awards nonetheless.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 96.

First, as Defendant correctly argues, the amended complaint fails to adequately allege the falsity of any statement in the Harty letter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [23] at 14-16. The Harty letter provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   As we discussed, your employment with a competitor of Allstate Insurance Company ... violates the terms of [the Plan] awards referenced below.... Pursuant to the terms of the Plan, if a Participant violates the Plan's non-competition provision, any outstanding Awards granted on or after February 21, 2012, that remain subject to a Period of Restriction or other performance or vesting condition will be cancelled.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   [21-4] at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Plaintiff, however, has not alleged any facts suggesting that there is anything false about this statement, or any other statement, in the Harty letter. Accordingly, Plaintiff's amended complaint fails to allege any false statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Nor does Plaintiff plausibly allege reliance upon the truth of any statement in the Harty letter. Even assuming there was a false statement in the Harty letter, Plaintiff's own allegations make clear that she did not rely upon it as true. Indeed, Plaintiff asserts that she \"relied on the [Harty] letter ... by seeking legal representation in this cause of action to obtain the benefit of the awards she had lost.\" [21] \u00b6 98. This assertion indicates that, if anything, Plaintiff believed that the statements in the Harty letter were\n   <em>\n    untrue\n   </em>\n   , because upon receiving the letter, Plaintiff retained legal counsel to initiate this lawsuit. And, this lawsuit seeks to prove that, contrary to what the Harty letter stated, Plaintiff did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   violate the Non-Competition Provision. Accordingly, Plaintiff does not plausibly allege that she relied on any statements\n   <em>\n    as true\n   </em>\n   from the Harty letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Plaintiff fails to sufficiently plead two elements of an Illinois fraud claim.

Third Affirmative Defense: Unjust Enrichment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff moves to strike Defendant's Third Affirmative Defense, which states that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   Plaintiff's claims are barred, in whole or in part, under the doctrine of unjust enrichment. Plaintiff is currently working for a competitor of Allstate, where she is presumably receiving a significant salary and attendant benefits. To permit her to retain the benefit of the outstanding stock awards while also remaining employed by a competitor of Allstate\n   would unfairly and unjustly enrich Plaintiff to the detriment of Allstate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   [25] at 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   At the outset, this Court notes that unjust enrichment is not an affirmative defense under Illinois law,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Warrior Ins.
