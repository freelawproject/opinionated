Plaintiff's Memorandum in Opposition to Defendant's Motion (ECF No. 4333), and Defendant's Reply in Support of its Motion (ECF No. 4346). For the reasons that follow, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES IN PART\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's Motion in accordance with this Opinion and Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff David Freeman's case is scheduled for trial on May 31, 2016, and is the second bellwether case to be tried in this multidistrict litigation (\"MDL\"). Carla Marie Bartlett was the first bellwether plaintiff, and her case was tried in September 2015. It is not disputed that Mr. Freeman is a member of a class (\"\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Class\") of approximately 3,500 individuals who are permitted under a contractual agreement (\"\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement\") to file\n   claims against Defendant E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (\"DuPont\") based on six human diseases (\"Linked Diseases\") that they believe were caused by their exposure to ammonium perfluorooclanoate (\"C-8\" or \"PFOA\") discharged from DuPont's Washington Works plant. (\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement (\"S.A.\"); ECF No. 820-8.) C-8 is an organic fluorinated compound that DuPont utilized as a manufacturing aid in the production of Teflon\u2122.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   It is undisputed that since it first began using C-8 in the 1950s, DuPont has released C-8 directly into surface waters and unlined landfills. DuPont characterizes the amount released as \"relatively low\" and maintains that it had no reason to believe that C-8 was harmful to humans; mat it demonstrated sound environmental stewardship practices with respect to C-8. (DuPont's Reply in Support of Post Trial Motion at 6, Bartlett ECF No. 159.) \"DuPont [posits that it] has always acted responsibly based on the health and environmental information that was available to the industry and regulators about PFOA at the time of its usage.\" (DuPont's Position Statement on PFOA,\n   <em>\n    http://www.dupont.com/corporate-functions/our-company/insights/article/position-statements/articles/pfoa.html?src=google_search_OctDec2015\n   </em>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mr. Freeman disagrees with DuPont's characterization of the amount of C-8 it released as \"relatively low,\" citing to evidence that DuPont released the C-8 directly into surface waters and unlined landfills since the 1950s, knowing (from the scientific and medical information available) that C-8 is biopersistent and bioaccumulative such that its slow degradation in the human body and in the environment cause a small amount of the chemical to accumulate to a large amount. Mr. Freeman's position is that because DuPont knew or should have known that C-8 was harmful, it should have stopped using C-8 as a processing aid or disposed of it through incineration or in specially lined chemical landfills.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2000. Mr. Freeman was diagnosed with testicular cancer, which is a Linked Disease. (\n   <em>\n    http://www.c8sciencepanel.org/study.html\n   </em>\n   ) (\"[T]he Probable Link reports [are] presented in detail in scientific articles (follow link [on the C-8 Science Panel website to the] Study Publications.\"). Mr. Freeman's oncologic surgeon performed a \"right radical orchiectomy\" (\"surgical extraction of his right testis and teratoma\") and Mr. Freeman \"underwent a ten-year follow-up protocol which involved frequent observation via x-rays, CAT scans, and tumor markers.\" (Expert Report of Robert Bahnson, M.D., F.A.C.S. at 3, ECF No. 4311-1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Because Mr. Freeman is a member of the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Class and he suffered from a Linked Disease, the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement permits him to pursue the claims \"for personal injury and wrongful death, including but not limited to any claims for injunctive relief and special, general and punitive and any other damages whatsoever associated with such claims, that ... relate to exposure to C-8 of Class Members.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement, DuPont agreed not to contest that \"it is probable that exposure to C-8 is capable of causing a\" Linked Disease in the defined group of individuals that constitutes the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Class. (S.A. \u00a7 1.25.) Thus, DuPont concedes that C-8 is capable of causing Mr. Freeman's testicular cancer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 3.3. It is Mr. Freeman's burden to show that C-8 did in fact cause his testicular cancer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Mr. Freeman filed claims against DuPont for negligence and for punitive damages. To prove his negligence claim, Mr. Freeman must show that (1) DuPont owed him a duty of care; (2) DuPont breached its duty of care to him; and (3) he suffered\n   an injury as a proximate result of DuPont's breach of the duty of care.\n   <em>\n    Menifee v.

To prove the existence of a duty, Mr. Freeman must show that a reasonably prudent person would have foreseen that injury was likely to result to someone in Mr. Freeman's position from DuPont's conduct.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 77,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=472%20N.E.2d%20707\">\n    472 N.E.2d 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Mr. Freeman alleges that any reasonably prudent person would have foreseen that injury would likely result from the release of C-8 in the amount and for the duration of time that DuPont released the chemical directly into surface waters and unlined landfills.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In its defense, DuPont asserts,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that it owed no duty to Mr. Freeman. DuPont maintains that it \"neither knew, nor should have known, that any of the substances to which [the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Class was] exposed were hazardous or constituted a reasonable or foreseeable risk of physical harm by virtue of the prevailing state of the medical, scientific and/or industrial knowledge available to DuPont at all times relevant to the claims or causes of action asserted by [the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Class].\" (DuPont's First Amended Answer to Freeman Compl. at 4; ECF No. 124-1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The parties hotly dispute what health and environmental information that was available to the industry and regulators about PFOA, what the toxicological and epidemiological studies on C-8 showed, and whether DuPont demonstrated sound environmental stewardship practices with regard to C-8, or whether DuPont instead purposefully utilized scientific testing methods that would provide inaccurate results so that it could continue using C-8 even though it was known to be harmful. DuPont and Mr. Freeman have retained experts to opine on whether DuPont conformed to the industry standards based upon the state of the medical, scientific, and/or industrial knowledge that was available to DuPont at all times relevant to the claims or causes of action asserted by the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Class.

Dr. Redlich is an occupational and environmental health physician with more than thirty years of experience. She is currently a Professor of Medicine at the Yale University School of Medicine, working primarily at the Yale Occupational and Environmental Medicine Program where she currently serves as Program Director. Dr. Redlich received her medical degree and her master's degree in public health from Yale University School of Medicine. Dr. Redlich is board-certified in internal medicine, occupational medicine, and preventive medicine, and is licensed to practice medicine in Connecticut and Washington. She completed her post-doctoral work in preventive and occupational medicine at several different medical centers, including Yale-New Haven Hospital and Yale School of Medicine. Dr. Redlich has published extensively on the topics of occupational and environmental medicine, and has published approximately 90 articles in peer reviewed journals on a variety of subjects related to toxic exposure, occupational medicine, and environmental and preventive medicine in general.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Dr. Redlich has held numerous academic positions in this field, and has provided consultation and advisory services to numerous national and international government and government-sponsored agencies, including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the U.S. National Institute of Health, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Heath, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and\n   the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, as well as numerous private and industry-funded organizations. Dr. Redlich explained in her deposition that her training allows her to \"run the Yale Occupational and Environmental Medicine Program, and we address health effects that affect all, the whole person, all organs, all types of diseases.\" (Redlich Dep. 49-51);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   105 (\"in many of the activities I do such as editing a major textbook, I address ... occupational and environmental problems of the whole person\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   200-202.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Dr. Redlich has specifically studied and advised clients on the potential health effects of C-8 exposure and has \"been familiar with PFOAs [ ] for many years.\" (Redlich Dep. 27);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   54 (\"I had literature and have addressed ... questions related to C-8 before I was ever contacted by\" Mr. Freeman's counsel), 57-59 (\"questions about adverse health effects related to C-8 is not something new.

Moreover, even if Dr. Redlich's opinions were appropriate for expert testimony (they are not), [ (4) ] the opinions that she seeks to offer are far outside her scope of expertise, and she did not employ any reliable methodology in reaching them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   (Def's Mem. in Support of its Mot. to Exclude Redlich Opinions at 1-2,)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

DuPont further contends that the environmental medicine standard of care is a \"subjective, ethical, extra-legal standard, which is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   an appropriate subject for expert testimony, [and] is not relevant to Mr. Freeman's claims ....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. The Court groups its analysis of these arguments into two categories: (a) extra-legal opinions, and (b) subjective opinions on ethics and morality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    a. \"Extra-legal\" Opinions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   First, the Court notes that there is no dispute that the standards of conduct employed in environmental medicine are not the relevant legal standard. Indeed, both DuPont and Mr. Freeman offer experts that opine on industry standards not because they are coterminous with the legal standard, but rather to inform whether a legal duty was breached. That is, Mr. Freeman must prove that any reasonably prudent person would have foreseen that injury was likely to result to someone in his position from DuPont's conduct,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , DuPont had and breached a legal duty. DuPont maintains that it conformed to the industry standards based upon its appropriate use of the medical, scientific, and/or industrial knowledge that was available to DuPont at all times relevant to the claims or causes of action asserted by the plaintiffs in this MDL. Thus, expert testimony on the state of the medical, scientific, and/or industrial knowledge available to DuPont is not only helpful to the jury, but actually\n   <em>\n    necessary\n   </em>\n   to evaluate DuPont's defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Courts have generally permitted expert testimony regarding standards of care in situations where the testimony is \"distinctively related to a profession beyond the understanding of the average layman.\"\n   <em>\n    Betz v.

This endeavor requires an understanding of the scientific and medical data available, and of the efficacy of the studies and scholarship done in those fields. The scientific studies reflect analytical detection limits for quantification of chemicals utilizing the precision, accuracy, representativeness, completion, and comparability of the methods available and those utilized by DuPont. The historical record is enormous, containing evidence of DuPont's conduct that began over fifty years ago and involves well over a decade of complex litigation, millions of documents, hundreds of witnesses operating in dozens of different regulatory, scientific, and technical fields, including, among others, toxicology, epidemiology, risk assessment, medicine, occupational health, regulatory compliance, public health, and chemical industry practices and policies. As this Court has previously stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   Indeed, this is the very same factual record that DuPont utilizes with its own expert witnesses so that they may identify and summarize the key facts and to help the jury understand DuPont's contention that it not only complied with all applicable industrial and scientific standards of care, but that it was proactive in that regard and demonstrated exemplary conduct throughout its entire history.

(Snyder, Voltaggio, Rickard Reports) (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , it \"was much more active and diligent than the majority of companies in terms of devoting resources to understanding and furthering the available science regarding potential effects of PFOA on human health and the environment, implementing controls, and reducing exposures\"; \"DuPont has shown leadership and gone beyond the regulatory requirements and the typical conduct of most companies in efforts to develop a safe environment for its workers and the community\"; \"continuously pursuing increasingly robust, sensitive, accurate, precise, and reproducible analytical methods for measuring PFOA in media\"; and that it \"demonstrated leadership in voluntary commitments for global environmental stewardship for PFOA.\"). In other words, DuPont's experts consider the industry standards by which a company's conduct is evaluated opine on DuPont's conduct in relation to those standards,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , it devoted more resources, sought even better science, and went beyond what was required of it. The MDL plaintiffs seek to introduce testimony to dispute DuPont's position, which DuPont supports with its own experts' opinions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Dr. Redlich has specialized knowledge regarding how sophisticated manufacturers use and steward C-8 and other regulated and unregulated chemicals within the framework of the then-governing industry standards and best practices. She has specialized knowledge of,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , biopersistence, toxicity of chemicals, and how animal studies relate to harm of humans. Indeed, her opinions on each of those issues are at odds with the opinions of DuPont's expert Dr. Rickard, who interprets the historic data regarding the scientific and medical studies to conclude that DuPont had no reason to know that C-8 was a toxic chemical capable of causing harm to humans. Therefore, Dr. Redlich's testimony will be helpful to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Opinion on Ethics and Morality\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   In addition to DuPont's contentions regarding the environmental medicine standard of care's status as a non-legal standard, DuPont objects to Dr. Redlich's opinion testimony as irrelevant because it is based on \"subjective standards of ethics and morality.\" (Def.'s Mem. in Support of its Mot. to Exclude Redlich Opinions at 1.) Specifically, DuPont asserts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   Dr. Redlich's opinions derive entirely from her self-defined \"environmental medicine standard of care,\" which she acknowledges is based on the \"precautionary principle.\" This is not ... a commonly-accepted industry standard that in any way governed DuPont's actions or inactions at any relevant time. Rather,\n   Dr. Redlich would have this jury measure DuPont's conduct against quintessential extra-legal, ethical, and subjective moral standards that this Court has already found to be\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     inadmissible\n    </strong>\n    .

(Redlich Report Ex. A at 1) (referencing an \"Occupational and Environmental Medicine Program\" at Yale University), (referencing graduate-level courses at Yale University on \"Introduction to Occupational and Environmental Medicine), (referencing well-respected peer-review journal, entitled \"Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine\"), and (referencing well-known \"Textbook of Clinical Occupational and Environmental Medicine). And, the case upon which DuPont relies is one in which a single defense expert opined on environmental medicine in a deposition almost a decade ago, which is simply unpersuasive to support the proposition that environmental medicine is not generally accepted as scientifically valid by the mainstream medical community.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Second, with regard to DuPont's assertion that the environmental medicine standard of care is nothing more than the precautionary principle, DuPont further argues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   Dr. Redlich relies on her so-called, self-described \"environmental medicine standard of care\" based on the \"precautionary principle,\" which she claims \"provides that a manufacturer should resist the use and emission of chemicals the health effects of which are either disputed or unknown.\" Redlich Report at 3. Under this \"principle\"-which was not fully developed until 1992 at the earliest and has never been adopted into any applicable law-when an activity \"raises\n   threats to the environment or human health, precautionary measures should be taken and the manufacturer should not wait for proof to certainty of a scientific cause and effect relationship.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4 &amp; n.3.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   (Def.'s Mem. in Support of its Mot. to Exclude Redlich Opinions at 4.) DuPont highlights Dr. Redlich's testimony in which she indicates that \"really the standard of care from an environmental perspective is really the precautionary principle\" and that the \"precautionary principle\" is \"sort of an overarching principle of decision making\"-a \"guiding principle\" reflected in a \"whole group of information\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5 (citing Redlich Dep. at 209, 211, 293-94).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Mr. Freeman responds:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   Contrary to DuPont's spin of Dr. Redlich's report and her deposition testimony, Dr. Redlich explained that the standard of care in the field of environmental medicine dates back far before 1992, borrows from and incorporates concepts often referred to\n   <em>\n    in shorthand\n   </em>\n   as arising out of the basic \"precautionary principle,\"\n   <em>\n    including\n   </em>\n   concepts addressed in that 1992 document, and is actually a synthesis of\n   <em>\n    many\n   </em>\n   different concepts from the field of environmental medicine scattered among\n   <em>\n    many\n   </em>\n   sources and authorities. (\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Redlich Dep 208:6-212:4 (Dr. Redlich explains how the standard of care is not just one principle adopted from one document but is derived from, found within, and \"underlies so many documents\"), 290:2-6 (Dr. Redlich disputes that the standard of care \"is ... just... the precautionary principle.\" and explains that it is based \"on the whole body and practice of occupational environmental health.\") (emphasis added), 293:21-294:4 (the standard of care is not based on \"one single document\").) Dr. Redlich also has explained that she specifically considered the impact and extent of any changes to the standard of care over the time period in question in forming her opinions in this case. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   223:17-224:1.) .... Dr. Redlich looks to the \"precautionary principle\" as a single example of what the overarching standards of care aim to achieve. Dr. Redlich confirmed that the \"precautionary principle\" is essentially a basic framework for companies to follow to assist them in following the standard of care, but not that the \"precautionary principle\" is, in and of itself, the entire standard of care applicable to DuPont or others.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   (Pl.'s Mem. in Opp. to Def.'s Mot. to Exclude Redlich Opinions at 30-31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The parties' arguments directed at the precautionary principle's incorporation in or impact on the standards utilized in environmental medicine somewhat misses the mark for the present inquiry. That is, the consideration before the Court is whether Dr. Redlich's expert testimony is relevant under Rule 702 and\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   . Because Rule 702\"requires that the evidence or testimony 'assist the trier of tact to understand the evidence.' \" expert testimony \"which does not relate to any issue in the case is not relevant and ergo, nonhelpful.\"\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    509 U.S. at 590-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"In other words, there must be a 'fit' between the proposed testimony and the question(s) presented by the case at bar.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    at 591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(Redlich Dep. at 12-13, 27, 54, 57, 59-60.) She opines on whether DuPont complied with the relevant standard of conduct utilized by similarly-situated chemical companies, testifying that she has\n   \"years of experience and a whole knowledge base about occupational environmental medicine,\" including familiarity with how \"a number of other companies ... have used [PFOA], both in the United States and abroad,\" and how the manufacturer of PFOA - 3M - handled the chemical.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19, 29, 32-33;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   26-27 (confirming her work \"over many years\" with \"a number of different chemical and other companies\"). Within the \"piece[s] of information among many that informed\" her opinions, is Dr. Redlich's understanding of how other companies making or using C-8 disposed of C-8 or handled \"concerns about health effects.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   34-35. In particular, Dr. Redlich confirmed that \"the ability to dispose of [C-8] and the fact that there were different ways to dispose of it and that there was technology available to do that was something that [she] considered among many other pieces of information in coming to [her] conclusions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   DuPont replies:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   [W]hile Plaintiff claims Dr. Redlich should be allowed to assess DuPont's conduct against \"industry standards,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 19, her deposition testimony shows that she cannot identify any company that manufactured or used C-8 other than DuPont and 3M, that she has no real knowledge of what other companies were doing with respect to C-8, and that she has no understanding of how C-8 was viewed by regulatory agencies-in sum, she has no knowledge regarding the industry she purports to opine about, much less the standards applicable to that industry [highlighting her testimony].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   (Def.'s Reply in Support of its Mot. to Exclude Redlich Opinions at 14.) Review of the testimony highlighted by DuPont does not support this position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Instead, the testimony shows that Dr. Redlich was not asked to review every other company that has used or manufactured C-8, nor to know from memory the name of every other company that used or manufactured C-8. Dr. Redlich repeatedly asked to review her records so that she could respond to DuPont's counsel's questions, but was not permitted to do so. This can be seen by this example taken from Dr. Redlich's deposition, in which she was being questioned about her work on this case and whether she \"looked into the conduct of other companies that were making or using C-8.\" (Redlich Dep. at 26.) Dr. Redlich spoke of 3M and its handling of C-8, and then asked to \"look over [her] records for all of the pieces of information - ... related to 3M.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29. In response, the following occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   Q. [from defense counsel] Let me hand you what we marked as Exhibit 7. a blank sheet of paper and a pen.

That's just not the type of detail -- not detail, but that sort of information, you know, if I needed something like that, one could look that up.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-138\">\n   Q. So your answer to my question is, no, you don't know the name of any other company that used C-8 other than DuPont and 3M?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n   A. Let me clarify. I am aware that there are a number of other companies that have used it, both in the United States and abroad. If you wanted, I could look in my records and give you the specific names. That is not something I memorized.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n   Q. For your work on this case, Doctor, in arriving at your opinions, you did not make any effort to go seek out and learn what other companies were using C-8?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   A. If you would like, I am aware of other companies that have used it. I just - I don't have the memorized the names of those companies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   Q. And you never knew them; you never - it is not that you don't remember it; you never researched it; right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-143\">\n   A. In terms of you [sic] mean by \"researched\"?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   Q. Looked into what other companies were using C-8?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-145\">\n   A. I mean, as I said, I know that there are other companies. If you want, I could look in my notes and give you that information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   Q. Is it your testimony to the jury that you have notes in your records that show the other companies that use C-8?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-147\">\n   A. Yes, I do have some documents that refer to other companies that have used it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29-33 (objections omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   The mere fact that Dr. Redlich indicated that she was not asked to opine on all of the other companies that have used or manufactured C-8 does not mean that she did not compare DuPont's conduct in handling C-8 with the conduct of other companies using C-8 or other regulated and unregulated chemicals. Indeed, her testimony shows that she in fact did make such comparisons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Third, the Court is unpersuaded by DuPont's suggestion that Dr. Redlich seeks to impose a standard of conduct based upon aspirational policies that would discourage worthy efforts to promote safety. (Def.'s Mem. in Support of its Mot. to Exclude Redlich Opinions at 9, n.6.) DuPont relies upon\n   <em>\n    McGee v. Home Depot\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013-Ohio-4623\">\n    2013-Ohio-4623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , for this proposition. However, that case is inapposite. In\n   <em>\n    McGee\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff argued that a legal duty should be imposed upon a company based\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   upon its internal company policy. The situation here is quite different. The standard of conduct assessments made in the field of environmental medicine are not the same as assessing a company's conduct based on its own internal aspirational policy. Nor is the Court permitting imposition of a legal duty based only upon an aspirational policy. The expert testimony instead relates to the industry standards based upon the state of the medical, scientific, and/or industrial knowledge. These standards will be helpful to the jury in its evaluation of whether DuPont had and breached a legal duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Fourth, as to DuPont's argument that this Court has already found this type of information inadmissible, DuPont refers to EMO 2 at page 27. (Def.'s Mem. in Support of its Mot. to Exclude Redlich Opinions\n   at 1.) That testimony, however, is not of the same quality as Dr. Redlich's. In EMO 2, the Court reviewed the testimony of an expert offered by Trial Plaintiffs Bartlett and Wolf, holding:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n   The Court also excludes Dr. Siegel's opinions related to the \"general duty of care that any company would be expected to fulfill.\" Dr. Siegel's opinions as to what he \"would consider to be an exemplary company, a good corporate citizen, or a company with a strong sense of social responsibility ... the minimum level at which [he] would expect a company to act if it has a reasonable degree of concern for the health of its surrounding community\" are ones appropriate for a jury to determine.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   (EMO 2 at 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Dr. Siegel offered a vague, general opinion of what an ethical, moral, or \"good corporate citizen\" looks like, referring to it as a \"general duty of care.\" This is the type of opinion testimony contained in the cases upon which DuPont relies in its current motion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-155\">\n   Courts have repeatedly recognized that opinions based on ethical principles-and specifically opinions such as Dr. Redlich's that are based on the precautionary principle-are\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     unhelpful\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   to a fact-finder and not admissible.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Fosamax Prods.

She does not espouse some vague ethical standard of what a moral corporation should do based on her own subjective beliefs. Rather, she relies upon her specialized knowledge, skill, training, education, and years of experience in the field of environmental medicine to form her opinions. Her opinions will certainly help the jury to evaluate, from an environmental medicine standpoint, whether DuPont conformed to the industry standards based upon the state of the medical, scientific, and/or industrial knowledge, which in turn will provide the necessary information to assess how a reasonably prudent corporation in DuPont's position would act,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , to determine whether DuPont had and breached a legal duty of care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Fourth and last, the Court addresses DuPont's contention that all of Dr. Redlich's opinions should be excluded because \"all of her opinions derive from her position that DuPont breached her precautionary-principle-based standard of care.\" (Def.'s Reply in Support of its Mot. to Exclude Redlich Opinions at 8.) However, even if the Court had found inadmissible all of Dr. Redlich's opinions related to the environmental medicine standard of care,\n   her other opinions are nonetheless admissible. As can be seen from the Court's analysis\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , Dr. Redlich's opinions regarding biopersistence, toxicity, and the state of knowledge are not entirely derived from precautionary principle or the standards of conduct employed in the field of environmental medicine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Legal Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   DuPont argues that Dr. Redlich's testimony that DuPont's conduct showed a \"conscious disregard for the rights and safety of persons that had a great probability of causing substantial harm\" is an inadmissible legal conclusion. This Court agrees. \"Opinion testimony that states a legal standard or draws a legal conclusion by applying law to the facts is generally inadmissible.\"\n   <em>\n    Sanchez v.

Here, DuPont contends:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-163\">\n   Dr. Redlich repeatedly seeks to speculate about what DuPont (\"as a whole\") \"knew\" and the motives and intent behind DuPont's corporate decision-making with respect to C-8. For example, Dr. Redlich repeatedly concludes that DuPont was \"on notice\" of or \"knew\" something, when she has no evidence of actual knowledge, cannot identify exactly when DuPont \"knew\" these things,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at 218:18-24, and. at most, can only opine on what DuPont \"should have been on notice of\" or \"should have known.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Redlich Report at 2-3; 7; 9; 15-16 (\"The information which DuPont possessed put DuPont on notice C-8 could cause significant harm to humans and, therefore, that DuPont should eliminate the emissions of C-8, whether through a replacement surfactant or an active emissions elimination program through available technologies such as incineration or carbon filtration, as quickly as it could.\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-164\">\n   As a further example, Dr. Redlich speculates in her report that \"relatively minor financial concerns\" prevented \"DuPont from initiating its C-8 elimination program,\" Redlich Report at 14, but admits at her deposition that she never looked into what DuPont did to consider replacements for C-8.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Redlich Depo. at 199:14-200:11.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   (Def.'s Mem. in Support of its Mot. to Exclude Redlich Opinions at 13-14.) DuPont is correct in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   In this portion of her report, Dr. Redlich states that \"DuPont's internal documents ... repeatedly reveal that the financial cost of the C-8 emissions elimination program inhibited DuPont from realizing the elimination of C-8 in the 1980s.\" (Redlich Report at 14.) This testimony is admissible. Dr. Redlich may not, however, speculate that DuPont's motive for failing to initiate an elimination program was its \"relatively minor financial concerns.\" That testimony usurps the jury's fact-finding function by allowing an expert to testify as to a party's motives for its actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   The Court disagrees, however, with DuPont's contention that Dr. Redlich speculates as to DuPont's motive and intent when she opines on what DuPont knew or should have known. Dr. Redlich reviews a complicated historical record and, based upon her unique qualifications, opines on what she believes DuPont knew or should have known at given points in time. This is not testimony that goes to motive or intent. Of course, DuPont may question Dr. Redlich about her opinions, exploring what studies or information she relied upon to make them. But that challenge is \"to the accuracy of the expert's conclusions, not to their reliability, and bear[s] on 'the weight of the evidence rather than on its admissibility.' \"\n   <em>\n    Little Hocking Water Ass'n, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324107\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/90/746/#p757\">\n    90 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   757 (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Scrap Metal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3566796\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/527/517/#p528\">\n    527 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   529-31 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Qualifications and Methodology\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   DuPont suggests that Dr. Redlich is not qualified to give the opinions she offers and that, even if she were qualified. She failed to employ reliable methodology. This Court disagrees with DuPont's suggestion that Dr. Redlich is unqualified. Her above-mentioned qualifications support her ability to give opinions on biopersistence, toxicity, and state of the knowledge of environmental medicine. Additionally, her testimony as to her familiarity and work over many years with a number of different chemicals and other companies reflect that she is qualified to give the opinions that she offers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   As to DuPont's argument related to methodology, it contends:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-171\">\n   Even if an expert is qualified, moreover, courts frequently find testimony to be inadmissible where the expert fails to employ reliable methodology. In\n   <em>\n    Sanchez\n   </em>\n   , for instance, the court excluded expert testimony on the basis of its reliance on a limited set of reports that had been \"hand-selected\" and provided by counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sanchez\n   </em>\n   , [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204851989\">\n    2014 WL 4851989\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *21-22]\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%20137189\">\n    2014 U.S. Dist LEXIS 137189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *56-58 (excluding proffered testimony where there was no way to assess the potential rate of error or presence of bias in the selection of documents, noting that \"there [we]re no assurances that [plaintiff's' counsel] did not opportunistically choose samples while ignoring others that might have weakened or disproved [the expert's] theories\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   (Def.'s Mem. in Support of its Mot. to Exclude Redlich Opinions at 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   And in its reply, DuPont states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-174\">\n   Dr. Redlich employed an unreliable methodology in reaching her opinions in this case. For instance, while Plaintiff' claims that Dr. Redlich recites \"historic evidence\" from a \"historic record\" spanning \"over five decades\" and compares \"the historical factual record of DuPont's conduct\" against the precautionary principle,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 26, 32, 34, the precautionary principle was not formulated until 1992. Redlich Report at n.3 (identifying the 1992 Rio Convention as the foundation for the precautionary\n   principle as she uses it). Thus, Dr. Redlich- who relies primarily on documents dating back to the 1960s, 70s, and 80s- ignores the developing state of science over time, and views all of DuPont's historic conduct through the lens of a later-formed ethical principle. This is not a reliable methodology.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   (Def.'s Reply in Support of its Mot. to Exclude Redlich Opinions at 15.) DuPont's arguments are not well taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   As indicated above, Dr. Redlich testified that the standard applied in environmental medicine is a compilation of many principles, some existing before 1992. Further, even if DuPont's assessment is correct, it goes to the accuracy or import of Dr. Redlich's opinion. \"Challenges to the accuracy or import of the evidence relied upon by an expert go to the accuracy of the expert's conclusions, not to their reliability, and bear on 'the weight of the evidence rather than on its admissibility.' \"\n   <em>\n    Little Hocking Water Ass'n, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324107\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/90/746/#p757\">\n    90 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   757 (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Scrap Metal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3566796\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/527/517/#p528\">\n    527 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   529-31 ). \"Where the reliability of the evidence is in dispute, it is more appropriate for a judge to admit the evidence than to keep it from the fact-finder because '[v]igorous cross-examination, presentation of contrary evidence, and careful instruction on the burden of proof are the traditional and appropriate means of attacking shaky but admissible evidence.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3566796\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/527/517/#p528\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 752 (citing\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    509 U.S. at 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ),\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   Last, the Court disagrees with DuPont's suggestion that Dr. Redlich's opinion is unreliable because the documents she reviewed were hand-picked by counsel. In circumstances where experts are retained to review an historical record that spans decades and encompasses millions of documents, it is not uncommon for experts to rely on counsel to provide the ports of the record relevant to their areas of inquiry. Moreover, Dr. Redlich disputes that \"the plaintiff's' lawyers picked\" all the documents she reviewed, noting she reviewed \"their documents, and also literature that [she] previously had and any literature searches that [she] did.\" (Redlich Dep. at 291.) In any event, \"critiques of an expert's evidence gathering techniques ... generally go to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 764 (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

As this Court noted in\n   <em>\n    Little Hocking\n   </em>\n   , DuPont's \"charges of cherry-picking data\" do not \"undermine the reliability of [the expert's] methodology.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 758. Similar to the experts the plaintiff utilized in\n   <em>\n    Little Hocking\n   </em>\n   , Dr. Redlich offers opinions that \"rest[ ] on a complex web of interrelated and corroborating evidence in the record.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Conclusion - Rule 702 and\n    <em>\n     Daubert\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that Dr. Redlich's opinion testimony that has not been excluded will give context to the then-existing industry standards for chemical companies and will be helpful for a lay jury in its consideration of whether DuPont should have anticipated that an injury was likely to result from its release of C-8 into the surface waters and unlined landfills in the communities surrounding its Washington Works plant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   The Court next addresses DuPont's request for exclusion of Dr. Redlich's opinion testimony under Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. DuPont has also raised this issue in a motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   .

Mrs. Bartlett was injured.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-194\">\n   When I say that Mrs. Bartlett must prove that DuPont owed her a duty of care, that means essentially that she must show that DuPont did not act reasonably, that a reasonable company or person would have anticipated that injury to a person was foreseeable from their conduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   (Trial Tr. vol. 2 at 31, Bartlett ECF No. 154.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   Then again at the close of trial, the Court directed the jury in instructions that were sent with the jury to its deliberations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-197\">\n   <strong>\n    Instruction No. 14\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-198\">\n   <strong>\n    BURDEN OF PROOF\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-199\">\n   Unless I instruct you otherwise, the burden of proof in this case is on the plaintiff to prove her claims and any damages by a preponderance of the evidence, which I will define for you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-200\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-201\">\n   <strong>\n    Instruction No. 19\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-202\">\n   <strong>\n    NEGLIGENCE - GENERALLY, ORDINARY CARE\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-203\">\n   Now, I will explain the first claim brought by Mrs. Bartlett, which is a claim for negligence. \"Negligence\" is a failure to use ordinary care. \"Ordinary care\" is the care a reasonably prudent corporation would use in similar circumstances. \"Ordinary care\" is not an absolute term, but a relative one, viewed in\n   the light of all the surrounding circumstances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-204\">\n   To prove her claim for negligence, Mrs. Bartlett has the burden of proving three elements by a preponderance of the evidence:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-205\">\n   (1) DuPont owed Mrs. Bartlett a duty of care;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-206\">\n   (2) DuPont breached its duty of care to Mrs. Bartlett; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-207\">\n   (3) Mrs. Bartlett suffered an injury as a proximate result of DuPont's breach of the duty of care.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-208\">\n   I will now instruct you on each of these three elements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-209\">\n   <strong>\n    Instruction No. 20\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-210\">\n   <strong>\n    NEGLIGENCE - DUTY\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-211\">\n   To prove the existence of a duty, Mrs. Bartlett must show by a preponderance of the evidence that a reasonably prudent person would have foreseen that injury was likely to result to someone in Mrs. Bartlett's position from DuPont's conduct. In deciding whether reasonable prudence was used, you will consider whether DuPont should have foreseen, under the circumstances, that the likely result of an act or failure to act would cause injuries. The test for foreseeability is not whether DuPont should have foreseen the injuries exactly as it happened to Mrs. Bartlett. The test is whether under the circumstances a reasonably prudent corporation would have anticipated that an act or failure to act would likely cause injuries.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   (Final Jury Instructions at 15, 20, 21, Bartlett ECF No. 139.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   The Court will do the same with regard to instructions in the\n   <em>\n    Freeman\n   </em>\n   trial. The parties and the Court can \"expect juries to follow instructions and decide multiple [claims] accurately and independently.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=74%20F.3d%201241\">\n    74 F.3d 1241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 1996).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   Additionally, at the\n   <em>\n    Bartlett\n   </em>\n   trial, the parties questioned the expert witnesses as to the differences between the legal standards and the standards utilized in the scientific, environmental, and medical fields relevant to DuPont's stewardship over C-8. The parties are encouraged to do the same in the\n   <em>\n    Freeman\n   </em>\n   trial. An example is shown in the following exchange with one of Mrs. Bartlett's experts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-215\">\n   Q. [To Dr. Siegel] You realize that the standards of the public health field, which is informed by a whole host of things, can be different than the standards in a court of law?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-216\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-217\">\n   Q. And the public health field is focused on minimizing risks?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-218\">\n   A. [E]liminating - well, sometimes it's elimination, but sometimes it's minimization.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-219\">\n   Q. And that's different than determining whether a substance actually caused a disease in a specific individual or whether something was likely to happen?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-220\">\n   A. Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   (Trial. Tr. vol. 4 at 217, Bartlett ECF No. 156-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   Moreover, the Court finds no support for the proposition that introduction of this type of evidence will result in mini-trials regarding the different standards. This is the same type of evidence the parties offered in the\n   <em>\n    Bartlett\n   </em>\n   trial, and there it did not result in mini-trials regarding different standards. The same process will be followed in Mr. Freeman's trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   Finally, the Court explained in detail above why this testimony is helpful, and indeed, necessary. The Court does, however, offer the following to help alleviate DuPont's concern regarding any potential for confusion. As discussed at the May 6, 2016, Motions\n   <em>\n    in Limine\n   </em>\n   Hearing, the Court reaffirmed its prior rulings prohibiting\n   the parties from utilizing any terms that have a specialized legal meaning, such as \"breach\" or \"negligence.\" The Court includes in this group the word \"duty.\" The parties may refer only to the then-existing medical, environmental, or scientific standards of care, standards of conduct, and best or usual practices, but may not refer to any standard or common practice as a \"duty of care.\" The expert may give his or her opinion that DuPont's conduct met, fell below, or rose above, those standards or common or best practices. The experts may not state that DuPont met or failed to meet its duty with regard to any of the standards or practices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   As with all\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   decisions, this ruling is subject to modification should the facts or circumstances at trial differ from those which have been presented in the pre-trial motions and memoranda.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   In accordance with this Opinion and Order, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES IN PART\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's Motion to Exclude the Opinions and Testimony of Carrie Redlich Based on Extra-Legal Standards of Care, Her Improper Legal Conclusions, and DuPont's State of Mind.
