Commerce continued to include ocean and inland freight delivery charges and added import duty and VAT payments into the benchmark prices, despite Guizhou's position that these duties should not be included because it does not pay import duties or VAT on imported inputs. I &amp; D Mem. at 9. As a result, the Department found a 34.46 percent\n   <em>\n    ad valorem\n   </em>\n   countervailable subsidy rate for Guizhou, and a 46.01 percent subsidy rate for Xugong.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2018%2C285\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Later, the Department issued a memorandum, amending the\n   <em>\n    Final Results\n   </em>\n   to include quarterly\n   <em>\n    synthetic\n   </em>\n   rubber benchmark data, as submitted by petitioners, following the Department's initial error in using figures for\n   <em>\n    natural\n   </em>\n   rubber benchmarks.

The court sustains Commerce's decision to countervail the VAT and Import Duty Exemption for Imported Raw Materials Program. For the remaining issues raised by plaintiffs, the court remands in part, pursuant to the below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    I. China Export Import Bank Buyer's Credit Program\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In its review, Commerce examined whether Plaintiffs potentially benefited from China's Export Buyer's Credit Program (the \"Program\"), which provides loans to foreign companies to promote the export of Chinese goods.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Administrative Reviews\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2069%2C193\">\n    80 Fed. Reg. 69,193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Dep't Commerce Nov. 9, 2015) (initiation). Commerce issued two questionnaires to the respondents, both seeking information regarding the Program. Commerce NSA Questionnaire to Xugong, J.A. Tab 9 (July 26, 2016); Commerce NSA Questionnaire to GOC, J.A. Tab 10 (July 26, 2016); Commerce NSA Questionnaire to Guizhou, J.A. Tab 12 (July 26, 2016). Plaintiffs each responded that none of their relevant customers used the Program. GOC NSA Questionnaire Resp. at 22; GTC NSA Questionnaire Resp. at 14. For its part, the GOC declined to provide questionnaire responses concerning the operation of the Program. As a result of the GOC's failure to cooperate, Commerce determined that Xugong and Guizhou benefitted from the Program. I &amp; D Mem. at 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e, the U.S. Department of Commerce (\"Commerce\") may select from facts otherwise available when a party to a proceeding: (A) withholds information that is requested; (B) fails to provide such information in the\n   form and manner requested; (C) significantly impedes a proceeding; or (D) provides information which cannot be verified.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(a)(2). Further, Commerce may select from the facts available in a manner adverse to the respondent if the gap in the record was caused by the failure of the respondent to cooperate to the best of its ability. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(b). Compliance with the \"best of its ability\" standard is determined by assessing whether the respondent puts forth its maximum effort to provide Commerce with full and complete answers to all inquiries in an investigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nippon Steel Corp. v. United States,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9109445\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/337/1373/#p1382\">\n    337 F.3d 1373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2003). Therefore, Commerce can apply adverse facts available (\"AFA\") only when it has first made a supported finding under \u00a7 1677e(a) that information is missing from the record for an enumerated reason, followed by a separate finding under \u00a7 1677e(b) that there has been a failure to cooperate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The court finds that Commerce applied AFA without substantial evidence to support the requisite threshold finding that there was a gap in the record warranting the use of facts available. Commerce determined that the GOC failed to comply, to the best of its ability, with Commerce's request for information regarding an amendment to the operation of the Program and thus, the use of an adverse inference was warranted under 19 U.S.C \u00a7 1677e(b)(1). Crucially missing from this assessment is an initial finding by Commerce that material information was missing from the record. While the Department did note that information as to the functioning of the Program was missing, this finding was rendered immaterial by responses from both Guizhou and the GOC as to the Program's use. This defect proves fatal to Commerce's imposition of AFA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Generally, while respondent companies will have \"information pertaining to the existence and amount of the benefit conferred by the program,\" \"foreign governments are in the best position to provide information regarding the administration of their alleged subsidy programs.\"\n   <em>\n    Archer Daniels Midland Co. v.

When a foreign government fails to respond to the best of its ability, Commerce will typically find that the government provided a financial contribution to a specific industry.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4304516\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/917/1331/#p1342\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   When the application of AFA under such circumstances may adversely impact a cooperating party, however, Commerce should seek to avoid such impact if, as is the case here, relevant information exists elsewhere on the record.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4304516\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/917/1331/#p1342\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   To apply AFA in circumstances where relevant information exists elsewhere on the record-that is, solely to deter non-cooperation or \"simply to punish\"-would make the agency's determination based on an incomplete (and therefore, inaccurate) account of the record; that is a fate this court should sidestep.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Changzhou Trina Solar Energy Co. v. United States\n   </em>\n   , 41 CIT ----, ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275115\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/255/1312/#p1319\">\n    255 F.Supp.3d 1312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1319 (2017) (sustaining Commerce's decision to refrain from using AFA where information existed elsewhere on the record because to do otherwise would \"apply AFA for no reason other than to deter the GOC's non-cooperation in future proceedings ....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Although GOC failed to fully respond to Commerce's requests for information, this failure did not create the requisite gap needed to make an adverse inference. Regardless of GOC's questionnaire responses to several questions posed by Commerce,\n   GOC unequivocally stated that the respondents' customers did not use the Export Buyers Credit Program. There is no ambiguity or uncertainty surrounding the use of the Program by Plaintiffs or their customers, as this information consisted of signed declarations from Plaintiffs' U.S. customers certifying non-use, and is corroborated by GOC's statements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   GTC NSA Questionnaire Resp. at 13-14. Therefore, the only gap of information on the record are facts regarding certain aspects of the\n   <em>\n    operation\n   </em>\n   of the Program. In turn, the only factual issues potentially appropriate for facts otherwise available, \u00a7 1677e(a), and adverse inferences, \u00a7 1677e(b), are those that concern the operation of the Program, factors entirely irrelevant to Guizhou's apparent non-use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Although Commerce possessed declarations covering Plaintiffs' affiliated and unaffiliated customers in the United States, Commerce declined to consider these declarations, thereby abandoning its long-standing practice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Certain In-shell Roasted Pistachios from the Islamic Republic of Iran\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20Fed.%20Reg.%209993\">\n    73 Fed. Reg. 9993\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Feb. 25, 2008) (final results) and accompanying Issues &amp; Decision Mem. cmt. 2 (explaining that in instances where the foreign government fails to adequately respond to Commerce's questionnaires, Commerce must \"calculate[ ] the benefit by relying, to the extent possible, on information supplied by the respondent firm.\"). Commerce's argument that because it lacked a \"complete and verifiable understanding of the program's operation, especially with regard to the involvement of third-party banks, the information provided by [the] respondents is [ ] unverifiable,\" I &amp; D Mem. at 24, is without merit, because Commerce improperly conflates the program's operation with its use. Plaintiffs have knowledge of their own usage of this program, however it operates, and certified its non-use by its customers. Commerce's obligation when drawing an adverse inference based on a lack of cooperation by a foreign government is to avoid collaterally impacting respondents to the extent practicable by examining the record for replacement information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In sum, Commerce had a clear path to find non-use by either accepting the declarations submitted by Plaintiffs and their U.S. customers or by verifying these declarations. Instead, Commerce has chosen a more convoluted route in substituting facts derived from the record with its own unsupported conclusions. Such a determination cannot be sustained by the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The AFA Rate for the Buyer's Credit Program\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Having concluded that Commerce inappropriately applied AFA without substantial evidence to support the requisite threshold finding that there was a gap in the record warranting the use of AFA, the Department's application of an adverse countervailing subsidy rate of 10.54 percent\n   <em>\n    ad valorem\n   </em>\n   is rendered moot.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In any event, the court notes that the Department\n   improperly applied its regulatory hierarchy for the selection of rates for the Buyer's Credit Program. As it stands, the Department's explanation of its application of the rate hierarchy is lacking. Commerce has explained its AFA rate selection hierarchy as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Consistent with section 776(d) of the Act and our established practice, we selected the highest calculated rate for the same or similar program as AFA. When selecting rates in an administrative review, we first determine if there is an identical program from any segment of the proceeding and use the highest calculated rate for the identical program (excluding\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   rates). If no such identical program exists, we then determine if there is a similar/comparable program (based on the treatment of the benefit) within the same proceeding and apply the highest calculated rate for the similar/comparable program, excluding\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   rates. Where there is no comparable program, we apply the highest calculated rate from any non-company specific program in any CVD case involving the same country, but we do not use a rate from a program if the industry in the proceeding cannot use that program.

Calculation of Tier 2 Benchmarks\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiffs raise several challenges to the Department's calculation of benchmarks measuring whether adequate remuneration was paid for synthetic rubber, carbon black, and nylon cord. Specifically, Xugong argues that Commerce's use of quarterly-rather than monthly-data to measure synthetic rubber benchmark prices was in error, Xugong Br. at 10; and Guizhou argues that neither VAT nor ocean freight inputs should have been added to the benchmark calculations, Pls.' Br. at 40. Because Commerce used a Tier 2 benchmark for synthetic rubber and carbon black, the Department's decision to include VAT and import duties in its benchmark analyses-based on quarterly data-was reasonable and supported by substantial evidence. However, the court cannot support\n   the Department's decision to include ocean freight charges in its Tier 1 benchmark calculation for nylon cord. On remand for further consideration, the court orders Commerce to carefully-and in its totality-review the evidence submitted by the plaintiffs to determine whether Chinese import statistics are already freight inclusive, thereby rendering the inclusion of ocean freight data in its benchmark calculation entirely duplicative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

After its review, Commerce found that the GOC did not have an effective system in place to qualify for a valid exception, based on the fact that the GOC failed to explain \"how it determined the quantity of material ... consumed in the production process and to provide sample documentation or reports to support its explanation.\" I &amp; D Mem. at 19. Indeed, the GOC provided generic responses to Commerce's questions concerning consumed materials in the OTR tires production, and referred generally to Customs Measures and the Processing Trade Goods handbook, while utterly neglecting to provide specific details on\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   the GOC determined the quantity of rubber, nylon cord, and carbon black consumed in the production process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   GOC Initial Questionnaire Resp. at 59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Guizhou's argument that Commerce failed to consider GTC's responses-in lieu of the GOC's-when reviewing the record fares no better. First, Commerce is entitled to focus on the GOC's responses in light of the fact that its regulations specifically require that the Department determine that the \"\n   <em>\n    government\n   </em>\n   in question has in place and applies\" the appropriate procedure confirming which inputs are consumed in the production and in what amounts.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.519\">\n    19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(i) (emphasis added). Moreover, GTC's responses still fail to show that the Department's determination that the program provided countervailable benefits and failed to meet the exception requirements under \u00a7 351.519(a)(4) was either unreasonable or unsupported by substantial evidence. Responding to the Department's question about how the quantity of the material was consumed in the production, GTC similarly described the basic material consumption process but neglected to detail specifically how it initially determined the quantity of rubber, nylon cord, or carbon black consumed in the production of tires by Guizhou. GTC Initial Questionnaire Resp. at 12; GTC First Supp. Resp. at 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Department calls attention to this flaw, evident in both the GOC's and GTC's questionnaire responses, when it concluded that the GOC failed to show that \"it\n   <em>\n    applied\n   </em>\n   the process outlined in the Customs Measures and Measures of Unit Consumption,\" a step necessary to determine the quantity of rubber, nylon cord, and carbon black actually consumed in the production. I &amp; D Mem. at 20 (emphasis supplied). Therefore, the Department concluded, the GOC failed to provide a sufficient basis for non-countervailability under the regulation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.519\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The court agrees. To its credit, GTC does provide a cursory reference to the standard procedure it must undergo in order to verify input consumption to the GOC; however, the analysis and corresponding documentation fall short of demonstrating that the GOC maintains a process\n   to verify GTC's actual consumption of rubber, nylon cord, or carbon black for the production of tires by Guizhou or other tire producers. GTC Initial Questionnaire Resp. at 12, 16, Exs. II.E.1, II.E.2; GTC First Supp. Resp. at 27. For example, in response to a supplemental questionnaire requesting a \"\n   <em>\n    detailed\n   </em>\n   explanation of\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   the documents provided at Exhibit II.E.1 establish the quantity of imported material consumed in the production process and in the production of exports in particular\"-that is, the core of a\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.519\">\n    19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   analysis-Guizhou responded merely that \"[t]he quantity and value of imported material listed in Exhibit II.E.1] ]\" were GTC estimates, and that the \"actual quantity of imported material can be determined based on Exhibit II.E.2.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   GTC First Supp. Resp. at 27. Devoting little airtime to any semblance of a detailed explanation of the government system in place, Guizhou directs Commerce instead to Exhibit II.E.2, a VAT and Import Tariff Exemptions Table detailing the imported materials during the POR. Though that may be part of the regulatory analysis, the underlying concern is whether the government maintains and applies a consistent procedure in order to confirm the inputs consumed in the production. The results-provided by Guizhou in Exhibit II.E.2-are just business records listing the outputs of the system in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   All in all, Commerce's review of the record evidence was reasonable and its decision to countervail the VAT and the Import Duty Exemption for Imported Raw Materials Program is supported by substantial evidence that the court will not now disturb.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    V.

Def.'s Br. at 45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Court finds no evidence of frivolousness in the Department's request for a voluntary remand on this issue. Indeed, there are two limited and compelling grounds for a remand that both Guizhou and Commerce have recognized. First, the Department notes that the VAT export rebate rate should have been reduced by 9 percent-bringing the VAT export rebate rate down to 8 percent instead of the originally identified 17 percent-to account for the rebate of VAT for OTR tires.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11092549\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/254/1022/#p1029\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Second, the Department requests reconsideration of the proper sales denominator used to calculate the\n   <em>\n    ad valorem\n   </em>\n   rate for the program.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46. Guizhou argues-and Commerce agrees-that the \"export sales only denominator\" that was used to calculate the\n   <em>\n    ad valorem\n   </em>\n   rate in Commerce's\n   <em>\n    Final Results\n   </em>\n   is in error because Commerce has already previously found that the benefit for this program is used for\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   export and domestic sales. Pls.' Br. at 38; Def.'s Br. at 45. Commerce acknowledges that it \"did not fully address the[se] arguments raised by Guizhou in its brief\" and requests a remand, without admitting error, in order to \"obviate the need for the Court to rule on an issue that Commerce itself wishes to reconsider.\" Def.'s Br. at 46. Furthermore, the interest in protecting the administrative proceeding from material inaccuracies is not outweighed by a need for finality because the court has already concluded that several issues are in need of reconsideration by the Department, thereby mooting any concerns over finality. Because Commerce presented undisputed and compelling justifications for remand that are not outweighed by the (now moot) need for finality, Commerce's request for a voluntary remand to reconsider its determinations regarding the VAT program is granted. On remand, Commerce is to review its decision to issue a 17 percent VAT export rebate rate in light of the fact that there is generally a 9 percent rate of VAT for OTR tires; and Commerce may reconsider its calculations when attributing the subsidy benefit only to export sales.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The court sustains the Department's decision to countervail the Import Duty Exemption for Imported Raw Materials Program, but grants the Department's request for voluntary remand to reconsider the VAT export rebate rate and the\n   <em>\n    ad valorem\n   </em>\n   rate for the Program. The court also sustains the Department's selection of quarterly benchmark data in its LTAR calculations, and finds that the Department did not act unreasonably when it included VAT and import duties in the benchmark calculations for synthetic rubber and carbon black.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   However, the Department's decision to apply AFA regarding China's Export-Import Bank Buyer's Credit Program was unreasonable because material information was not missing from the record. The GOC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   had provided sufficient responses to the Department's questionnaires reflecting non-use of the Program, and the Department's AFA determination to the contrary was not supported by substantial evidence. The court also finds that the Department's decision to include ocean freight costs in its nylon cord Tier 1 benchmark calculations was not supported by substantial evidence because the Department failed to consider evidence demonstrating that Chinese imports are already freight inclusive; on remand, the court orders the Department to consider the evidence submitted by the parties to determine whether ocean freight costs would be duplicative to its benchmark calculations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, after careful review of all papers, it is hereby\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the Department reconsider its decision to apply AFA as to China's Export Import Bank Buyer's Credit Program, taking into account the GOC's evidence of non-use, as in accordance with the Opinion and Order; it is further\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the Department consider the evidence submitted by GTC as to the ocean freight costs for the nylon cord benchmarks and apply its analysis to the Department's redetermination as in accordance with the Opinion and Order; and it is further\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the Department review on remand its VAT export rebate rate calculation as well as the proper sales denominator used to calculate the\n   <em>\n    ad valorem\n   </em>\n   rate for the VAT and Import Duty Exemption for Imported Raw Materials Program; it is further\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that all other challenged determinations of Commerce are sustained; and it is further;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Commerce shall have ninety (90) days from the date of this Opinion and Order in which to file its redetermination, which shall comply with all directives in this Opinion and Order; that the Plaintiff shall have thirty (30) days from the filing of the redetermination in which to file comments thereon; and that the Defendant shall have thirty (30) days from the filing of Plaintiff's comments to file comments.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    The Department also argues that Guizhou failed to exhaust its administrative remedies with respect to the adverse rate of 10.54 percent applied to the Export Buyer's Credit Program. Def.'s Resp. to Pls.' Mot. for J. on Agency R. 25, ECF No. 71 (May 25, 2018). This argument is also rendered moot by the court's remanding the Department's use of AFA for the Buyer's Credit Program. However, despite failing to specifically rebut the 10.54 percent adverse rate ultimately applied by Commerce, Guizhou implicitly raised objections to the AFA rate when it raised evidence of non-use on the record and disputed the application of an AFA rate generally.

Br. at 30. This characterization of the record also misses the mark. Contrary to GTC's contention, Commerce did not find a gap in neither the GTC's nor the GOC's responses. Rather, the Department considered the evidence presented on the record and concluded that the parties failed to demonstrate that\n    <em>\n     the GOC\n    </em>\n    maintained (and applied) a specific procedure to determine the quantity of rubber, nylon cord, or carbon black consumed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
