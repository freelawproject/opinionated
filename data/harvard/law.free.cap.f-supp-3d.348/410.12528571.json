INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case arises out of the cancellation of a construction contract awarded to plaintiff, Richard E. Pierson Construction Co., Inc., (\"Pierson\") by defendant, Philadelphia Regional Port Authority (\"PhilaPort\"). After Pierson was awarded the contract, the second-lowest bidder, South State, Inc., protested the award on the ground that Pierson did not meet the contract bidding requirements, and started suit in the Commonwealth Court. The Commonwealth Court issued a temporary stay enjoining work on the contract. Thereafter, PhilaPort sent a letter to Pierson cancelling the contract and stating it would reopen bidding. As a consequence, South State filed a praecipe to discontinue its appeal with the Commonwealth Court, and the Commonwealth Court issued a notice of discontinuance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Pierson filed the instant action, seeking an injunction prohibiting PhilaPort from cancelling and rebidding the contract and a declaratory judgment (1) that Pierson was the lowest responsible bidder on the contract, (2) that the contract was valid and binding and thus that Pierson can begin work on the project at any time, and (3) that PhilaPort's letter cancelling the contract is null and void. Pending before the Court are Pierson's Motion for Preliminary Injunction and proposed intervenor-defendant South State, Inc.'s Motion to Intervene. For the reasons set forth below, the Court concludes that PhilaPort enjoys sovereign immunity and dismisses the case,\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   , for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In May 2018, defendant, PhilaPort, submitted a request for bids on a public contract to perform construction work on Packer Avenue Marine Terminal Berths 1 to 3. Plt. Mem. in Supp. Mot. Prelim. Inj. 3. The project bidding requirements included, inter alia, a condition that the contractor certify that it is participating \"in an approved Apprenticeship Program\" registered with the Pennsylvania Apprenticeship and Training Council.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. Plaintiff Pierson, proposed intervenor-defendant South State, and other contractors submitted written bids on the contract. On bid day, PhilaPort selected Pierson as the \"lowest responsive and responsible bidder\" and awarded Pierson the contract.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. South State was the second lowest bidder.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   South State filed a formal protest with PhilaPort, seeking to disqualify Pierson's bid on the grounds that it failed to meet the bidding requirements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Specifically, South State alleged that Pierson was not engaged in an \"approved Apprenticeship Program\" and that Pierson falsely certified that, as of bid day, it participated in an \"Apprenticeship Program\" registered with the Pennsylvania Apprenticeship and Training Council.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   PhilaPort's Chief Executive Officer and Executive Director denied South State's protest and upheld Pierson's contract with PhilaPort.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. The contract became fully executed on August 28, 2018, after representatives from Pierson, PhilaPort, the Pennsylvania Office of Attorney General, and the Office of the Budget of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania signed the contract.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Meanwhile, on August 20, 2018, South State filed a Petition for Review with the\n   Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court, appealing PhilaPort's decision.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. The following day, South State filed an application for a stay of work on the contract pending the Commonwealth Court's determination and a request to expedite the court's review.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7. On September 21, 2018, the Commonwealth Court concluded South State had shown a likelihood of success on the merits and granted South State's application for a stay and request to expedite review.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. As a result, that day, PhilaPort sent a letter to Pierson cancelling the contract and stating that the project would be rebid.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. Because PhilaPort cancelled the contract, South State filed a praecipe to discontinue the appeal to the Commonwealth Court, and the Commonwealth Court issued a notice of discontinuance of the appeal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. Shortly thereafter, Pierson filed an emergency petition to intervene and to stay and/or enjoin the contract's termination and award to a new bidder.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. The Commonwealth Court denied Pierson's petition. Def.'s Resp. Mot. Prelim. Inj. 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Pierson filed a Complaint (Document No. 1, filed October 3, 2018) in this Court, seeking injunctive and declaratory relief, and a Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Document No. 3, filed October 4, 2018). Thereafter, South State filed a Motion to Intervene as a defendant (Document No. 8, filed October 17, 2018) and a response to Pierson's Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Document No. 12, filed October 18, 2018). PhilaPort also filed a response (Document No. 14, October 19, 2018). Pierson filed a reply in support of its Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Document No. 17, filed October 24, 2018), specifically focused on the issues of sovereign immunity and jurisdiction. On October 26, 2018, the Court conducted a telephone conference to discuss these issues. Following the conference, Pierson filed an additional reply in support of its Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Document No. 21, filed October 31, 2018). The Court now raises the issue of its subject-matter jurisdiction over this case\n   <em>\n    sua sponte.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Plaintiff fails to cite, and this Court is not aware of, any cases decided after the Third Circuit's \"co-equal\" holding in\n   <em>\n    Benn\n   </em>\n   in which the court concluded that one factor so strongly favored or disfavored sovereign immunity that it outweighed the other two factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   For this Court to conclude that PhilaPort does not enjoy sovereign immunity would be to ignore\n   <em>\n    Benn\n   </em>\n   and conclude that the evidence supporting the first factor-the disclaimer of PhilaPort's debts by the Commonwealth-by itself is determinative. The Court rejects that reading of Third Circuit precedent. Although this conclusion may result in \"limited and unsatisfying avenues to obtain relief\" for plaintiff, state sovereignty is a \"constitutional precept[ ] and lynchpin[ ] of our federalist system of government.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Maliandi v.

The Court thus dismisses Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Document No. 3, filed October 4, 2018) and Motion of South State, Inc. to Intervene as Defendant and Memorandum in Support (Document No. 8, filed October 17, 2018) for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.
