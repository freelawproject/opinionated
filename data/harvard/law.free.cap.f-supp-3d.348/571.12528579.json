The treatment takes place at FCI-Butner and has four phases, and each phase builds on the earlier phase. Phase one is an orientation and assessment phase where psychologists gather information from and about the person and formulate an assessment. Phase two involves individual and group therapy and focuses on helping the person to acquire cognitive skills associated with conflict resolution, moral reasoning, and self control and seeks to decriminalize the person. Phase three is the core of the sex offender treatment. Phase three involves both individual and group therapy and focuses on increasing the cognitive and self-regulatory skills learned in phase two. For example, in phase three, the person will dismantle his sex offending behaviors, one event at a time. Phase three also requires the person to identify high-risk situations and triggers. Phase three is critical to constructing a relapse prevention plan. Phase four involves relapse prevention planning and release planning and builds on phase three. Phase four also focuses on integrating and internalizing the person's knowledge, emotional understanding, and emotional insight. Phase four also focuses on housing, employment, financial management, and relationships. As with phases two and three, phase four\n   involves individual and group therapy.

As mentioned, the first element of the Adam Walsh Act requires the factfinder to uncover the truth concerning whether respondent has attempted to engage in or engaged in sexually violent conduct or child molestation. Where a respondent lacks a criminal conviction for actual or attempted sexually violent conduct or child molestation, the factfinder must examine rigorously the reliability of conflicting evidence presented and engage in extensive factfinding. The Adam Walsh Act provides respondent a statutory right to counsel, to testify, to present evidence, to subpoena witnesses, and to confront and cross-examine witnesses who appear at the hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"234\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204247\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).

Simply put, an incompetent respondent who contests the first element in an Adam Walsh Act case effectively loses these statutory rights because he lacks the ability to rationally understand\n   the proceeding against him or communicate with his counsel about the factual allegations at the heart of the first element's factual inquiry. Likewise, an incompetent respondent who contests the first element in an Adam Walsh Act case effectively loses the ability to testify, to advise counsel which witnesses to subpoena in his defense, and to advise counsel about potentially fruitful lines of cross-examination. Moreover, appointing a guardian ad litem does not cure these problems.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   [D.E. 101] 6 (suggesting that appointing a guardian ad litem for an incompetent respondent who contests all three elements in an Adam Walsh Act case provides a sufficient procedural safeguard to satisfy procedural due process). After all, a guardian ad litem is not effectively able to assist counsel in contesting the first element.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   If the Adam Walsh Act permits the trial and commitment of an incompetent person who contests all three elements, then the risk of erroneous deprivation of that persons's liberty is extraordinary. Moreover, requiring a person who contests all three elements in a section 4248 proceeding to be competent would add substantial value to the procedural safeguards in the Adam Walsh Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"237\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204247\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) (providing right to counsel, to testify, to present evidence, to subpoena witnesses, and to confront and cross-examine witnesses);\n   <extracted-citation index=\"238\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204248\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) (requiring the government to prove the three elements by clear and convincing evidence).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Next, the court considers the government's \"interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.\"\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"239\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p335\">\n    424 U.S. at 335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"240\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p335\">\n    96 S.Ct. 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First, as the history of the Adam Walsh Act cases in the Eastern District of North Carolina reflects, the issue of competence rarely arises in section 4248 cases. Moreover, the issue of competency coupled with a respondent who lacks a conviction for attempted or actual sexually violent conduct or child molestation arises even less frequently. Indeed, to this court's knowledge, the issues presented in this Adams Walsh Act case have never arisen in the 183 other Adam Walsh Act cases in the Eastern District of North Carolina. Second, if the issue of competency does arise, the case will involve a person who faced federal criminal charges, received a competency evaluation under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"245\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204241\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and was found incompetent to face criminal charges. The person will then be evaluated for commitment under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204246\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If committed under section 4246, the person will receive treatment under section 4246 and the United States will not seek commitment under section 4248.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   If not committed under section 4246, and the government seeks commitment under section 4248, and the person contests all three elements, and the person arguably is not competent to proceed in the section 4248 case, the court can receive a psychiatric or psychological report concerning the person's competence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"247\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204247\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 48. The court can then hold a competency hearing. If the person\n   is found competent, the section 4248 case proceeds. If the person is found not competent, the court can notify the responsible state authorities about the procedural history of the case and permit responsible state authorities to decide whether to commit the person under applicable state law. For example, many states have their own versions of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"248\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204246\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , including statutes that permit the civil commitment of seriously mentally ill persons or seriously developmentally disabled persons.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"249\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mont.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2053-20-121\">\n    Mont.

Code Ann. \u00a7 53-21-121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq. (2017) (commitment of seriously mentally ill individuals). Thus, the government's interest in delivering mental health care to an allegedly sexually dangerous person in its custody is substantial, but requiring that a person who contests all three elements be competent imposes little additional costs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"251\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p335\">\n    424 U.S. at 335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"252\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p335\">\n    96 S.Ct. 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Furthermore, in analyzing the third\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   factor, the court cannot presuppose that the person is a sexually dangerous person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Balancing the factors, the private interest that is affected by commitment under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"253\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204248\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   is extraordinary. Moreover, the government's interest in committing an incompetent person who contests all three elements is slight. Finally, the risk of erroneous deprivation of liberty is great when the government seeks to commit an incompetent person who contests all three elements under the Adam Walsh Act. Thus, if (as the United States asserts) the Adam Walsh Act permits the trial and commitment of an incompetent person who contests all three elements, then the Adam Walsh Act as applied to that incompetent person would violate procedural due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In sum, the government's motion for reconsideration [D.E. 98] is DENIED.
