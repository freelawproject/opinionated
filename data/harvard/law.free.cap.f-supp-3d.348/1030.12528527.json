The Court has considered the parties' papers, relevant legal authority, and the record in this case, and GRANTS Mr. Ramos-Urias's motion to dismiss. The hearing for this motion, set for January 29, 2019, is HEREBY CONVERTED to a status conference. The government should be prepared to discuss its intent to appeal this Order, and the defense should be prepared to discuss whether Mr. Ramos-Urias will seek to be released.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mr. Ramos-Urias is a Mexican citizen who came to the United States as a child. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt No. 37-1 (Declaration of Hanni Fakhoury in Support of Motion to Dismiss Indictment (\"Fakhoury Decl.\") ), Ex.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.) In 2003, Mr. Ramos-Urias was arrested after police officers recovered twenty grams of methamphetamine and other drug paraphernalia from his vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.) In 2004, he was sentenced to five years of probation after spending one day in jail. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In June of 2005, police found methamphetamine and drug paraphernalia in Mr. Ramos-Urias's car and a firearm and additional drug paraphernalia in his house. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.) His probation was revoked, and he was sentenced to serve sixteen months in state prison. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30, 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 31, 2006, while Mr. Ramos-Urias was in the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") officials, he was served a putative notice to appear (\"NTA\"), alleging he was removable for having committed an aggravated felony. (Fakhoury Decl., Ex. C (Notice to Appear); Declaration of Samantha Schott (\"Schott Decl.\"), Ex. 1.) The NTA specified the removal hearing would occur on a \"date to be set\" and a \"time to be set.\" (Fakhoury Decl., Ex. C (Notice to Appear).) Mr. Ramos-Urias appears to have requested an immediate hearing in order to expedite a determination of his case, but indicated that he did not waive his right to a ten-day period before appearing before\n   an immigration judge. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) The certificate of service on the NTA notes that he received oral notice in English of the time and place of his hearing and of the consequences of the failure to appear at the scheduled hearing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 15, 2006, Mr. Ramos-Urias received personal service of a Notice of Hearing in Removal Proceedings from Immigration Court. (Schott Decl., Ex. 2.) This document indicated that Mr. Ramos-Urias's hearing would take place on July 10, 2006, at 8:30 a.m. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On this scheduled date, Mr. Ramos-Urias appeared before an immigration judge in Eloy, Arizona. (Fakhoury Decl., Ex. D (July 10, 2006 Immigration Judge Order).) The immigration judge ordered him deported to Mexico. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mr. Ramos-Urias waived his right to appeal and was removed from the United States on July 10, 2006. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Fakhoury Decl., Ex. E (Warrant of Removal).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mr. Ramon-Urias returned to the United States; in 2007 and was arrested on state charges and subsequently prosecuted for illegal re-entry. (\n   <em>\n    United States v. Ramos-Urias\n   </em>\n   , 07-cr-567-SBA (N.D. Cal.), Dkt. Nos. 1 (Complaint), 6 (Indictment).) He pled guilty to illegal reentry following deportation in the Northern District of California and was sentenced to fifty months in federal prison. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 16, 20.) Mr. Martin-Urias's 2006 removal order was reinstated: he completed his federal sentence and was again deported on May 27, 2011. (Fakhoury Decl., Ex. F (Notice of Intent/Decision to Reinstate Prior Order and Warrant of Removal).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Mr. Ramos-Urias evidently re-entered the United States thereafter. He was again arrested on state charges on October 25, 2017. (Dkt. No. 1 (Indictment in Above-Captioned Case, 18-cr-76-JSW).) He pled no contest, his probation was revoked, and he was resentenced to 365 days of jail time. (Schott Decl., Ex. 4 (Alameda County Clerks Dockets and Minutes.) During this incarceration, Immigration and Customs Enforcement became aware of his presence in the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On February 22, 2018, he was charged with being a deported alien found in the United States, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Mr. Ramos-Urias had not yet been sentenced in the instant matter, and on August 1, 2018, he filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea. (Dkt. No. 17.) On October 30, 2018, this Court granted the motion to withdraw. (Dkt. No. 33.) On November 13, 2018, Mr. Ramos-Urias filed a motion to dismiss the indictment. (Dkt.

No. 41 at 10 n.1. Accordingly,\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   has occasioned a flurry of motion practice regarding putative notices to appear. District courts are divided over the precise impact of\n   <em>\n    Pereira.\n   </em>\n   Some courts have concluded that the\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   holding applies only to circumstances involving the calculation of the stop-time rule.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Tex. Dec. 21, 2018) (\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   should be narrowly applied only in stop-time rule cases). Others have applied\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   's holding to all putative notices to appear, regardless of whether the case at hand implicated the stop-time rule.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Wash. 2018). After careful examination of\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   , this Court concludes that the definition of \"notice to appear\" within this statutory scheme is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   limited to the application of the stop-time rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   There is no statutory evidence to support any argument that \"notice to appear\" means anything other than the explicit definition in \u00a7 1229(a). Multiple mechanisms within this statute, not just the stop-time rule, implicate or rely upon a \"notice to appear\" as defined by \u00a7 1229(a).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii) (noncitizen may seek to reopen removal proceeding to challenge order issued in absentia if he shows he did not receive a notice \"in accordance with paragraph (1) or (2) of section 1229(a).\") Therefore, to conclude that\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   's holding applies only to the application of the stop-time rule is to entertain the idea, without textual support, that a defined statutory term may carry two (or more) meanings within one statutory scheme. Interpreting and applying a statute this way defies common sense, not to mention basic tenets of statutory construction.\n   <em>\n    In re Perroton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6511521,10521647\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/958/889/\">\n    958 F.2d 889\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 893 (9th Cir. 1992) (\"... in statutes that contain statutory definition sections, it is commonly understood that such definitions establish meaning where the terms appear in that same\n   Act.\").

The Supreme Court considered and rejected a similar argument in\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 2111, 2118-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This Court need not decide whether the \u00a7 1326(d) analysis is or is not necessary in the context of a void notice to appear, because the Court concludes that Mr. Ramos-Urias makes the requisite showing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The 2006 removal order was fundamentally unfair under \u00a7 1326(d)(3). First, the removal order violated Mr. Ramos-Urias's due process rights because jurisdiction did not vest in the issuing immigration court.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Ariz. Dec. 4, 2018). As discussed above, a valid notice to appear is a jurisdictional prerequisite. Neither Mr. Ramos-Urias's receipt of subsequent information regarding the date and time of his hearing nor his subsequent appearance at the hearing cure this jurisdictional deficiency. Second, Mr. Ramos-Urias was prejudiced because he was \"removed when he should not have been.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.
