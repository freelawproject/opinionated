(\"AAF\") plans to construct and operate an express passenger railway connecting Orlando and Miami, Florida. The initial segment of the line between Miami and West Palm Beach is currently operational. The extension of the line to Orlando is still in the planning stages. To help AAF finance the extension, the U.S. Department of Transportation has allocated $1.15 billion in federally tax-exempt bonds to be issued by a Florida economic development agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The planned extension of the railway will run through Indian River County on Florida's Treasure Coast. The County and its Emergency Services District (together, \"Indian River County\" or \"Plaintiff\") have long objected to the project. In this, its second lawsuit challenging the project, Indian River County seeks summary judgment on two grounds. First, it contends that the Department of Transportation exceeded its authority in allocating the bonds because the project is not eligible to receive tax-exempt funding under two separate provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Second, the County maintains that the Federal Railway Administration (\"FRA\") violated the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\") and the National Environmental Policy Act (\"NEPA\") by conducting a flawed and incomplete review of the public health and safety consequences of the project. Defendants the Department of Transportation, its component FRA,\n   and several of its officers (together, \"federal Defendants,\" \"the Department,\" or \"FRA\") filed a cross motion for summary judgment, as did AAF, which has intervened as a defendant. Because the Department's allocation met the tax code's requirements and the FRA's review complied with NEPA, the Court will deny Indian River County's motion for summary judgment and grant the federal Defendants' and AAF's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Factual Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    1. The proposed project\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   AAF is in the process of constructing a private passenger train service that will ultimately provide service between Miami and Orlando. Phase I of the project currently operates from Miami to West Palm Beach. AR 65115-16. Phase II will run from West Palm Beach north along Florida's east coast to Cocoa and then west and inland to Orlando.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   AAF plans to lay a second track along a 128.5 mile stretch of single-track train corridor owned by the Florida East Coast Railway (\"FECR\") from West Palm Beach north to Cocoa. AR 65115. This track is currently used only by freight trains, some of which carry hazardous materials, but historically was used by both freight and passenger trains. AR 73914. This corridor is referred to in the record and by the parties as either the FECR Corridor or the N-S Corridor. AR 65115. The N-S Corridor bisects Indian River County. AR 73572. AAF also proposes constructing a new 40-mile track that would connect Cocoa and Orlando. This stretch of track is referred to as the E-W Corridor. AR 65115.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   AAF plans to operate thirty-two passenger trains per day in addition to the FECR freight trains that now run along the N-S Corridor. AR 65116. These trains would run through Indian River County for twenty-one miles. AR 73753. There are thirty \"grade crossings\" in the County.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   A grade crossing is an intersection where the railway crosses a road or path at the same level or grade, rather than an intersection where trains cross over or under the road using an overpass or tunnel. In addition to these grade crossings, the trains will traverse bridges that are either fixed or moveable (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , draw bridges). Two of these moveable bridges are at issue in this case: the St. Lucie River Bridge and the Loxahatchee River Bridge. AR 73915. When these bridges are in the \"down\" position, trains can cross over but boats on the river cannot cross under.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    2. The Secretary's bond allocation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   AAF is partially financing the railway project through private activity bonds (\"PABs\") issued by the Florida Development Finance Corporation (\"FDFC\"), an agency of the State of Florida. Congress has authorized the United States Department of Transportation to allocate tax-exempt authority to PABs used to finance specific types of transportation projects.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20142\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (m)(2)(C). AAF initially applied for a PAB allocation in August 2014. In December 2014, the Department of Transportation approved that application and provisionally allocated $1.75 billion in tax-exempt PABs for the project.\n   <em>\n    SeeIndian River Cty. v. Rogoff (\"Indian River Cty. I\n   </em>\n   \"),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4365389\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/110/59/#p65\">\n    110 F.Supp.3d 59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 65 (D.D.C. 2015). AAF planned to use these PABs to finance both phases of the railway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In November 2016, the Department, at AAF's request, withdrew the provisional allocation and replaced it with a $600 million allocation of PAB authority to finance only Phase I of the project.\n   <em>\n    SeeIndian River Cty. v. Rogoff(\"Indian River Cty. III\n   </em>\n   \"),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273545\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/254/15/#p17\">\n    254 F.Supp.3d 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 17-18 (D.D.C. 2017). Then, in December 2017, AAF applied for a new allocation of $1.15 billion in PAB authority to finance Phase II of the\n   project.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 74220-62. As part of its application, AAF represented that the project had received $9 million in Title 23 federal funds, disbursed by Florida's Department of Transportation for highway-rail crossings along the rail corridor. AR 74235. AAF included in its application a resolution by FDFC approving the issue of bonds to finance the project. AR 74240-53. That resolution concluded that the bond issue had received requisite public approval for tax-exempt status because a designee of the State's Governor had approved their issue after a properly noticed public hearing. AR 74242-44. AAF's application highlighted that the bonds had already received this public approval. AR 74221. Further, AAF included in its application a bond counsel validity opinion, by the law firm Greenberg Traurig, which concluded that \"interest on the Bonds ... is excludable from gross income for purposes of federal income taxation under existing laws as enacted and construed[.]\" AR 74256.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Department approved the application and provisionally allocated $1.15 billion in PAB authority on December 20, 2017. AR 74324-26. Its provisional allocation letter conditioned final allocation on several requirements, including compliance with all applicable federal laws, as well as \"a final bond counsel tax and validity opinion ... issued at the time of the closing of the bond issue in substantially the form provided with the application.\" AR 74324. While FDFC will issue the bonds, AAF is responsible for marketing and selling them to investors. The parties have represented that the bonds will be marketed in the next several weeks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    3. The environmental review process\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   AAF originally sought federal loan funding for the project through the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing (\"RRIF\") program. RRIF loans are subject to NEPA review.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20260.35\">\n    49 C.F.R. \u00a7 260.35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . FRA reviewed the potential environmental impacts of the project under NEPA. AR 73636. With respect to Phase I, FRA issued a Finding of No Significant Impact in 2013. AR 73570. FRA then began preparing an Environmental Impact Statement (\"EIS\") for Phase II. AR 73571. It held five public scoping meetings in May 2013 and received 248 comments in response to those meetings and more than 160 comments in the subsequent seventeen months. AR 74155-56. As required, FRA coordinated with federal, state, local, and tribal governments, including Indian River County. AR 74157-59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   FRA completed a draft EIS in September 2014. AR 74164. The draft attracted some 15,400 public comments.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20260.35\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   During the comment period, FRA also held eight public meetings,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20260.35\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20260.35\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   which were attended by over 2,500 people, AR 74165. FRA issued a Final Environmental Impact Statement (\"FEIS\") in August 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 73568. FRA subsequently received additional comments on the FEIS, including from Plaintiff. AR 65154. When AAF withdrew its RRIF loan application in 2015, FRA decided to not issue a Record of Decision (\"ROD\"). AR 65118. After AAF re-filed an RRIF application in 2017, FRA resumed the NEPA process and published the ROD in December 2017. AR 65109-65. Appendix C to the ROD provides responses to the comments on the FEIS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 65154; AR 65266-300.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The FEIS selects AAF's preferred route as the best alternative for the project and determines that no further environmental review is necessary. AR 73578. The FEIS itself is 646 pages long and separately includes numerous appendices including maps and analyses of noise impacts, navigation patterns, and more. The FEIS and ROD outline the purpose of and need for the project, the alternatives considered, the affected environment, the potential environmental\n   consequences of the project and reasonable alternatives, and the historic properties affected by the project. The FEIS also includes a chapter on measures that would avoid, minimize, or mitigate impacts that would result from the project. AAF has committed to implementing a series of mitigation measures during both the construction and operation phases of the project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As part of the NEPA process, AAF retained the environmental consulting firm Vanasse Hangen Brustlin (\"VHB\") as a third-party advisor to FRA. This arrangement was memorialized in an agreement between FRA, VHB, and AAF.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 1045-62. Under that agreement, VHB's \"scope of work, approach, and activities shall be under the sole supervision, direction, and control of the FRA.\" AR 1046. AAF also hired its own consultant, Amec Foster Wheeler (\"Amec\"). In general, Amec conducted initial technical work, which it then submitted to VHB and FRA for review and comment. AR 897-98;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   AR 1062. The record includes a series of technical memoranda produced by Amec on issues like noise and vibration.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , AR 61081-238 (Amec's \"Technical Memorandum No. 5 Noise and Vibration for AAF Passenger Rail Project\"). The record also reflects significant back-and-forth regarding those memoranda between VHB and FRA on the one hand and Amec and AAF on the other.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , AR 1083-87, 1305-43, 1561-62, 7302-06, 7349-51 (charts setting forth VHB/FRA comments on Amec technical memoranda and Amec/AAF responses).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Procedural Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   As noted above, this is the second time Indian River County has sued in this Court to prevent or delay the Secretary of Transportation's allocation of tax-exempt bond issuance authority to finance the AAF project. In 2015, both Indian River County and nearby Martin County, through which the proposed railway would also run, sought (among other relief) a preliminary injunction vacating the Secretary's authorization of the tax exemption, which allocated PAB authority for both phases of the project.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Indian River Cty. I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4365389\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/110/59/#p65\">\n    110 F.Supp.3d at 66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Both counties alleged violations of NEPA, the National Historic Preservation Act (\"NHPA\"), and the Department of Transportation Act (\"DTA\"), each of which sets forth certain procedural requirements for major federal actions. Martin County also alleged a violation of \u00a7 142 of the Internal Revenue Code. There, as here, AAF intervened as a defendant. Initially, the Court concluded that the counties had failed to show that their asserted injuries-public-safety hazards and harms to environmental and historic sites from the construction and operation of the railway-were traceable to the Secretary's action or redressable by the Court. Specifically, while the counties had shown that the cost of financing the project would increase without the Secretary's allocation of tax-exemptions, they were unable to show \"that these costs would\n   <em>\n    significantly\n   </em>\n   increase the likelihood that AAF would abandon the project[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4365389\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/110/59/#p65\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4365389\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/110/59/#p65\">\n    at 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In short, the plaintiffs had failed to show that if the Court were to grant them precisely what they asked for, the project would cease and their harms would be remedied. The Court also held that the counties' alleged procedural injury-stemming from the purported failure to conduct an appropriate environmental review-was insufficient to confer standing absent some tethering to a substantive injury sufficient for standing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4365389\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/110/59/#p65\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4365389\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/110/59/#p65\">\n    at 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court thus denied the counties' motions because they had not established standing to sue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4365389\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/110/59/#p65\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Following\n   <em>\n    Indian River County I\n   </em>\n   , the Court granted the counties permission to conduct jurisdictional discovery to demonstrate that, but for the PAB allocation, AAF would not complete the railway. Subsequently,\n   the Department of Transportation moved to dismiss the counties' suits. The Court concluded that through jurisdictional discovery, the counties had shown \"that invalidating [the Department's] decision to authorize ... PABs would significantly increase the likelihood that AAF would not complete ... the project.\"\n   <em>\n    Indian River Cty. v. Rogoff\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    Indian River Cty. II\n   </em>\n   \"),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12181869\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/201/1/#p4\">\n    201 F.Supp.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 4 (D.D.C. 2016). Further, the Court found that the plaintiffs had alleged sufficient facts to demonstrate that the AAF project qualified as \"major federal action\" triggering certain requirements under NEPA, NHPA, and DTA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12181869\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/201/1/#p4\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12181869\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/201/1/#p4\">\n    at 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Consequently, it denied the motion to dismiss those claims. It did, however, dismiss Martin County's claim that the PAB allocation violated \u00a7 142 of the Internal Revenue Code, concluding that the County's asserted injuries fell outside the zone of interests that Congress sought to protect in \u00a7 142.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12181869\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/201/1/#p4\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12181869\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/201/1/#p4\">\n    at 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Following the Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Indian River County II\n   </em>\n   that the counties had stated valid claims, AAF withdrew its application for a PAB allocation. It replaced that application, which had sought to use the bonds to finance both phases of the project, with an application for a smaller allocation to be used only for Phase I. Because Phase I dealt only with a portion of the proposed railway that did not run through the plaintiff counties, the Court dismissed the cases at moot.\n   <em>\n    Indian River Cty. III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273545\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/254/15/#p17\">\n    254 F.Supp.3d at 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Since then, AAF applied for an allocation to help finance Phase II, which the Department of Transportation provisionally approved. Indian River County, initially joined by Martin County and a group of concerned citizens, has again sued. They contend that the PAB allocation violated two provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and that FRA did not comply with its requirements under NEPA. AAF again intervened as a defendant. The parties all moved for summary judgment. The Court held a hearing on these motions on November 27, 2018. Shortly before this hearing, Martin County and the citizens group reached a settlement with the federal Defendants and AAF and, therefore, are no longer plaintiffs in the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

As the Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Indian River County II\n   </em>\n   : \"Congress enacted\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20142\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   in general, and Sections 142(a)(1) and 142(m) in particular, to create a tax benefit to support the development and construction of certain kinds of projects with significant public benefits and a demonstrated need for financial assistance.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12181869\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/201/1/#p4\">\n    201 F.Supp.3d at 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When Congress added \u00a7 142(m) to the Internal Revenue Code in 2005, it did so against the backdrop of \u00a7 147(f), which it had first added to the Code in 1982 in a clear effort to ensure public benefit from tax-exempt bonds. As the Senate Finance Committee Report explained at the time:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   The committee believes that new restrictions are needed on [bonds] to help eliminate inappropriate uses and to help restore the benefit of tax-exempt financing for traditional governmental purposes. However, the committee believes that, in general, state and local governments are best suited to determine the appropriate uses of [bonds]. The committee believes that providing tax exemptions for the interest on certain [bonds] may serve legitimate purposes in some instances provided that the elected representatives of the state or local governmental unit determine after public input that there will be substantial public benefit from issuance of the obligations[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   S. Rep. No. 97-494(I), at 168 (1982).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   This suggests a common purpose: \u00a7 142 reflects congressional judgment about the types of projects that benefit the public enough to warrant tax-exempt financing, and \u00a7 147(f) creates a mechanism of democratic accountability by which the public can confirm that a particular project does indeed confer public benefit.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Petrochemical &amp; Refiners Ass'n v.

Indian River\n   County has properly focused its attention not on SAFETEA as a whole, but on \u00a7 142 itself and its purpose of \"support[ing] the development and construction of certain kinds of projects with significant public benefits[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Indian River Cty.

By demonstrating that \u00a7 142 and \u00a7 147(f) bear an integral relationship, the County has illuminated \u00a7 142 in a way that suggests Congress's intent was indeed to allow State and local governments to ensure public benefit would accrue from projects financed by tax-exempt bonds. And because it appears from the legislative history that Congress gave some deference to State and local governments' assessment of public benefit, Indian River County's asserted interests at least arguably fall within the zone of interests protected by \u00a7 142. Accordingly, the Court concludes that Indian River County has plausibly stated a claim under that provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    The merits of the County's Section 142(m) claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Moving to the merits of Indian River County's \u00a7 142 claim, the County contends that the Secretary's allocation is inconsistent with the statute because Phase II is not a \"qualified highway or surface freight transfer facilit[y],\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20142\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(15), and thus is ineligible for an allocation of PAB authority. The Court concludes that the Secretary's allocation conformed to the statutory requirements and was a reasonable exercise of her discretion. It will therefore grant summary judgment on this issue to the Department and AAF.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Section 142 defines \"qualified highway or surface freight transfer facilities\" to include \"any surface transportation project which receives Federal assistance under title 23, United States Code[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20142\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 142(m)(1)(A). The Secretary allocated PAB authority after concluding that the project fell within this definition. Indian River County challenges that allocation, contending that \u00a7 142(m)(1)(A) does not encompass the project and it was thus ineligible for an allocation. Specifically, the County contends that, when read in proper context, a \"surface transportation project\" means only a highway project, which necessarily precludes an allocation to any rail project. It also maintains that if the term \"any surface transportation project\" did encompass rail projects, the AAF project has not received Title 23 federal assistance. The Court addresses each point in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    i.

The dictionary definition of \"surface transport\" is \"the movement of people or goods by road, train, or ship, rather than by plane.\" Cambridge Business English Dictionary (2011). This plainly includes rail projects. Defining \"surface transportation\" to include rail comports with its use elsewhere in federal law. For example, in SAFTEA, the legislation through which Congress enacted \u00a7 142(m), a provision in another portion of the bill defined \"surface transportation system\" to include \"freight and intercity passenger bus and rail infrastructure and facilities.\" SAFETEA \u00a7 1909(b)(14), Pub.

There is no need to belabor the point with more examples: the dictionary definition of \"surface transportation,\" the phrase's meaning in other areas of law, and its ordinary usage all indicate that \u00a7 142(m)(1)(A) includes rail projects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Congress's use of \"any\" further indicates as much: \"Read naturally, the word 'any' has an expansive meaning, that is, 'one or some indiscriminately of whatever kind.' \"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The same principle applies here: Congress's use of \"any\" to modify \"surface transportation project\" is most naturally read to mean surface transportation projects of whatever kind-including rail projects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Indian River County nonetheless insists that the plain text of \u00a7 142(m)(1)(A) cannot be read in isolation and that its context indicates that it refers only to highway projects. Relying on the principle of\n   <em>\n    noscitur a sociis\n   </em>\n   -a word is known by the company it keeps-the County highlights several contextual clues to contend that when Congress said \"any surface transportation project,\" it was actually referring only to highways.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   First, the County notes that \u00a7 142(m)(1)(A) must be read in light of the word \"highway\" in the phrase that it is defining: \"qualified\n   <em>\n    highway\n   </em>\n   or surface freight transfer facilities.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20142\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (m)(1) (emphasis added). Because another portion of \u00a7 142(m)(1) deals with surface freight transfer facilities,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20142\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (m)(1)(C), Plaintiff contends, \u00a7 142(m)(1)(A) must deal with the \"highway ... facilities.\" But that argument is unavailing in the face of Congress's chosen definition. In interpreting a statute, courts defer to Congress's definition of a statutory provision, even if that definition is at odds with the ordinary meaning.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Digital Realty Trust, Inc. v. Somers\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616856\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/767/#p776\">\n    138 S.Ct. 767\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 776-77,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616856\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/767/#p776\">\n    200 L.Ed.2d 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018). Thus, even accepting Plaintiff's premise, it was Congress's prerogative to define \"highway ... facilities\" as encompassing more than highways. And, as discussed, that is plainly what it did when it defined the term to include \"\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   surface transportation project.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Second, Indian River County notes that when Congress added \"qualified highway or surface freight transfer facilities\" to \u00a7 142, the statute already listed fourteen other types of facilities eligible for PABs financing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20142\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Plaintiff insists that the fact that this list already included railway facilities-in the form of \"high-speed intercity rail facilities,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20142\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 142(a)(11), and \"mass commuting facilities,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20142\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 142(a)(3) -Congress's inclusion of \"qualified highway ... facilities\" must be understood to preclude passenger rail projects. As an initial matter, the original list did not encompass all rail projects. \"[M]ass commuting facilities\" do not encompass longer passenger rail services that connect distant cities to one another. Likewise, \"high-speed intercity rail facilities\" include only passenger trains capable of 150 mile-per-hour maximum speeds,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20142\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 142(i)(1), which excludes slower trains (including those AAF is using). In other words, the list to which Congress added \"qualified highway or surface freight transfer facilities\" encompassed some types of passenger rail projects, but not\n   all. It would make perfect sense and would not be duplicative for Congress to add a provision covering other types of rail projects. Nor would it supplant those provisions. While the types of railways encompassed by \"mass commuting facilities\" and \"high-speed intercity rail facilities\" fall into the ambit of \"any surface transportation project,\" they do not necessarily also receive Title 23 funds as \u00a7 142(m)(1)(A) requires.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Third, Indian River County points to the fact that \u00a7 142(m)(1)(A)'s limiting provision references Title 23-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that a surface transportation project constitutes a \"qualified highway or surface freight transfer facilit[y]\" only if it \"receives Federal assistance under title 23, United States Code[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20142\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 142(m)(1)(A). Title 23 is a portion of the U.S. Code entitled \"Highways.\" This detail, Plaintiff insists, further demonstrates that \"any surface transportation project\" must refer only to highways-especially since later in the provision, Congress included in its definition of \"qualified highway or surface freight transfer facilities\" certain types of facilities that receive funding under either Title 23 or Title 49, which addresses railroads.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20142\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 142(m)(1)(C). According to Plaintiff, the exclusion of a reference to Title 49 in \u00a7 142(m)(1)(A), when it was included in \u00a7 142(m)(1)(C), means that \u00a7 142(m)(1)(A)'s reference to Title 23 indicates that it extends only to highway projects. But while Title 23 does deal generally with highways, it also contains provisions authorizing funds for non-highway transport, including passenger rail.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20601\">\n    23 U.S.C. \u00a7 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(12). Consequently, the reference to Title 23 is not as strong a contextual clue as Plaintiff suggests and is insufficient to supplant Congress's capacious definition, notwithstanding the fact that the Title 23 is called \"Highways.\"\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In other words, the County contends that FECR, not AAF, received the Title 23 funding and AAF merely benefitted from it. As an initial matter, \u00a7 142(m)(1)(A) requires that PABs be allocated to a \"\n   <em>\n    project\n   </em>\n   which receives Federal assistance under title 23, United States Code[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20142\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (m)(1)(A) (emphasis added). Nothing in this provision requires that the project\n   <em>\n    proponent\n   </em>\n   -here, AAF-receive Title 23 funds. Nor does anything require the bond-financed project to be the\n   <em>\n    exclusive\n   </em>\n   beneficiary of those funds. The Department has long interpreted the statute to allow for PAB allocation to projects based on direct benefits from Title 23 spending. It highlights examples in which it has allocated PAB authority to a light rail project based on Title 23 funding to upgrade an adjoining trail, and to freight transfer facilities based on Title 23 funding to upgrade nearby highways and bridges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

Thus, the Department's long-standing interpretation of\n   \u00a7 142(m)(1)(A) is consistent with the Secretary's allocation of PAB authority to AAF's project. And nothing in the statutory text precludes that interpretation, notwithstanding the facts that Title 23 funding went to FECR rather than AAF and that FECR, in addition to AAF, benefited from the funding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   But at the same time, as the Department has tacitly acknowledged,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. at 64:9-23, the statutory requirement that a project receive Title 23 funding cannot be construed so broadly as to allow the Department to bootstrap a project into PAB eligibility based solely on an incidental and unintentional benefit from the funds. In other words, the record must support the conclusion that the funds were disbursed to benefit the project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The record here supports the Secretary's conclusion that the project received Title 23 funding. Florida's Department of Transportation disbursed approximately $9 million to account for increased rail traffic on the FECR railway\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   AAF commenced planning its project. AR 74235, 73549-62. To be sure, there were planned increases in FECR freight traffic as well, but the record indicates that a disproportionate amount of the Title 23 funding was disbursed only after the AAF project began. Over the ten-year period from 2005 through 2014, the railway received approximately $21 million dollars in Title 23 funding, approximately 43% of which came in the three years following the commencement of AAF's planning. AR 73549-62. Given that the AAF project received substantial attention in Florida, the Court is skeptical that the State's Department of Transportation disbursed (and increased) this Title 23 funding without the knowledge-if not purpose-of benefitting the project. In short, the record indicates that this is not an instance in which the AAF project was such an ancillary or unintended beneficiary of the funds as to prevent the Secretary from concluding that it had \"receive[d] Federal assistance under title 23[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20142\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (m)(1)(A). Between these facts and the deferential nature of its review, the Court cannot accept Indian River County's contentions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Indian River County also alleges that the Department inappropriately interpreted \u00a7 142(m)(1)(A) to allow PAB authority to finance the entire railway corridor based on the expenditure of Title 23 funds for discrete highway-rail crossings along that corridor. The Secretary's conclusion-that the highway-rail crossings sufficed to render the whole corridor eligible for PAB allocation-is consistent with longstanding Department interpretation of what constitutes a \"project\" for purposes of \u00a7 142(m)(1)(A). Immediately following SAFETEA's passage, the Federal Highway Administration (\"FHA\") wrote to the IRS to indicate its view that \"the most reasonable reading ... permits the proceeds of [PABs] authorized by this provision to be used on the\n   <em>\n    entire\n   </em>\n   transportation facility that is being financed and constructed even though only a portion of that facility receives Federal assistance under title 23.\" AR 73546. FHA explained that a narrower reading of \"project\" would cause States, which disburse Title 23 funds, to sprinkle the funds along whole facilities in order to make them eligible for PAB allocation, rather than continuing the practice of using them at discrete portions of facilities. AR 73546-47. Concluding that Congress did not intend \u00a7 142(m)(1)(A) to change disbursement practices, FHA interpreted the provision to reflect a broader definition of \"project\" than just the specific portion of a facility financed by Title 23 funding. FHA's analysis reflects a reasonable assessment of congressional intent and the statutory text, and the Secretary's interpretation of \u00a7 142(m)(1)(A) in this case conforms to it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The Court therefore concludes that Phase II of the AAF railway is a project that received Title 23 funding. Because it is also a surface transportation project, the Court will grant summary judgment to the federal Defendants and Intervenor-Defendant on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <em>\n    2.

The County insists that unless and until it approves the PABs, they do not constitute qualified bonds. The Department of Transportation asks the Court to dismiss this claim as improperly presented. AAF, for its part, contends that Indian River County's claim fails on the merits because the State of Florida approved issuance of the bonds in accordance with \u00a7 147(f)'s requirements, which obviated the need for approval by all counties through which the railway runs. The Court will address each argument in turn, reaching the merits of the Plaintiff's claim and granting summary judgment to the federal Defendants and Intervenor-Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Failure to state a claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The Department asks the Court to dismiss Indian River County's \u00a7 147(f) claim because the Secretary \"is not required to investigate whether Section 147's requirements have been met before [she] makes a PAB allocation.\" Fed. Defs.' MSJ at 27. It explains the Secretary's responsibilities under the statutory scheme begin and end with \u00a7 142 : she must determine only whether a project is a \"qualified highway or surface freight transfer facility\" and, if so, whether to allocate to that project a portion of the $15 billion in tax-exempt PABs authorized by Congress. Section 147, the Department contends, presents a wholly distinct requirement for PABs to qualify for tax-exempt status into which the Secretary need not inquire before allocating PABs. Consequently, according to the Department, even if Indian River County's allegations regarding \u00a7 147(f) were true, they would have no bearing on the legality of the allocation but would concern only an assessment of the future tax liability of bondholders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   While it does not appear that the statutory scheme imposes any obligation on the Secretary to police \u00a7 147(f) compliance, the record indicates that the Secretary did consider such compliance in this particular instance. AAF's application for a PAB allocation highlighted its view that \u00a7 147(f)'s requirements had been met by Florida's approval. AR 74221 (\"AAF has already successfully completed the necessary hearings and approvals required under\" \u00a7 147(f).). As part of the application, AAF submitted two documents indicating as much. First, it provided a resolution by the FDFC, the Florida governmental entity responsible for issuing the bonds, approving their planned issue. AR 74240-53. The resolution included FDFC's finding that \u00a7 147(f) requirements were satisfied by a properly noticed public hearing held in Tallahassee and subsequent approval by a Florida official delegated powers by the State's Governor. AR 74242-44. Second, AAF submitted a proposed bond counsel tax and validity opinion by the law firm Greenberg Traurig, based on its review of the record and applicable laws. AR 74254-57. That opinion determined that \"interest on the Bonds ... is excludable from gross income for purposes of federal income taxation under existing laws as enacted and construed[.]\" AR 74256. The Department invited submission of both documents. While there are no formal requirements for PAB allocation applications, the Department has indicated that \"to facilitate [its] consideration of [an] application,\" applicants \"may wish\" to include, among other information, \"a copy of a resolution ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   authorizing the issuance of a specific issue of obligations,\" and a \"Form of Bond Counsel Opinion or date by which a draft letter will be provided.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=71%20Fed.%20Reg.%20642\">\n    71 Fed. Reg. 642\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 643 (Jan. 5, 2006). Put simply, applicants wishing to receive serious consideration for an allocation would be wise to provide documentation that would analyze and support the tax-exempt nature of the bonds, should allocation be provided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Importantly, the Department's provisional PAB allocation in this case\n   <em>\n    conditioned\n   </em>\n   final allocation on the bond counsel's opinion. It explained that final allocation was based on several requirements, the first of which was \"a final bond counsel tax and validity opinion ... issued at the time of the closing of the bond issue in substantially the form provided with the application.\" AR 74324. That condition indicates that the Department sought assurances that the allocation it made would involve bonds otherwise compliant with tax-exemption requirements. It also indicates that the Department was satisfied with bond counsel's analysis, which assumes \u00a7 147(f) compliance by virtue of its conclusion that the bonds are tax exempt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The Court's analysis here is informed by the nature of the allocation. Even accepting the Department's contention that it is not responsible for policing compliance with \u00a7 147(f), the fact remains that it is responsible for allocating highly-sought-after tax-benefits from a finite pool. In this case, the Department has used $1.15 billion of the $15 billion in that pool to support Phase II of the project. The Court is skeptical that the Department would formally allocate $1.15 billion in bond authority absent some confidence that the bonds would indeed be tax-exempt. Otherwise, the Department would be wasting nearly ten percent of the finite resource Congress empowered it to administer. The bonds here will be issued and offered for sale imminently, and the Department has given no indication that they are legally infirm. It has not questioned the bond counsel opinion that the bonds will be properly tax-exempt. It has not suggested that the bonds fail to comply with any \"applicable Federal law,\" a further condition of the final allocation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 74325. In short, it appears that the Department has implicitly concluded that the State-level public approval satisfied \u00a7 147(f) requirements. Moreover, in this litigation, the Department has embraced AAF's view that the State-level public approval satisfied those requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. Defs.' Reply at 10 (\"Thus, here, the State of Florida's approval is sufficient to satisfy Section 147(f).\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   It bears emphasizing that the Court's holding on this issue is fact bound. The Court's conclusion is not that the statutory scheme requires the Department of Transportation to police compliance with \u00a7 147(f) or any other requirement for tax exemption. Nor can the Court conclude that the Department makes assessments of \u00a7 147(f) compliance for every allocation. Rather, it concludes only that, in this particular case, the Department has interpreted \u00a7 147(f) as satisfied-an assessment rooted in AAF's application and supporting materials, the Department's provisional allocation letter and the conditions it enumerated, the fact that the bonds will be issued imminently and the Department has not raised any \u00a7 147(f) concerns, and the Department's position in this litigation that AAF's arguments on the merits are correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Under these circumstances, then, the Court finds it appropriate to reach the merits of the County's \u00a7 147(f) claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Section 147(f) merits\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   While Indian River County has stated a valid claim under \u00a7 147(f), the claim is not meritorious, and the Court will grant summary\n   judgment to the federal Defendants and AAF.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   For PABs to be \"qualified\" and thus tax-exempt, \u00a7 147(f) requires public approval by:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   (i) the governmental unit-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   (I) which issued such bond, or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   (II) on behalf of which such bond was issued, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   (ii) each governmental unit having jurisdiction over the area in which any facility, with respect to which financing is to be provided from the net proceeds of such issue, is located (except that if more than 1 governmental unit within a State has jurisdiction over the entire area within such State in which such facility is located, only 1 such unit need approve such issue).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20147\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(2)(A).

In this case, FDFC, a State-level agency, issued the bonds after concluding that \u00a7 147(f)'s requirements had been met. Specifically, it cited a noticed public hearing held in Tallahassee, followed by approval by a Florida State official who was \"the designee of the Governor of the State of Florida, the applicable elected representative to approve the [bond] issuance.\" AR 74243-44;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20147\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(2)(B) (requiring \"a public hearing following reasonable public notice\"); AAF's MSJ, Ex. 1 (memorandum from Florida Governor authorizing approval on his behalf).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Indian River County does not dispute that the issuer approval complied with \u00a7 147(f)(i).

It maintains that because it is a \"governmental unit having jurisdiction over the area in which\" the railway \"is located,\" its approval is necessary unless the parenthetical exception applies. And the exception does not apply, the County argues, because Phase II runs through five counties, so this is not an instance in which \"more than 1 governmental unit ... has jurisdiction over the entire area ... in which [the] facility is located.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20147\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(2)(A)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   But even without the parenthetical exception, \u00a7 147(f)(2)(A)(ii) is ambiguous in its requirement that \"each governmental unit having jurisdiction\" over the relevant area approve the bond issue. Congress did not define the term \"governmental unit\" beyond indicating that it excludes the federal government.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20150\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). So, the term \"governmental unit\" could conceivably encompass everything from the State to its counties to school boards and dogcatchers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Hoping to sidestep ambiguity in the term \"governmental unit,\" Plaintiff urges the Court to apply a limiting principle implicit in \u00a7 147(f), noting that approval requirements are satisfied by approval \"by the applicable elected representative\" of a government unit, which includes \"an elected legislative body of such unit\" or \"the chief elected executive officer.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20147\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(2)(E).

But those provisions go to the mechanisms by which a governmental unit may approve, not to the definition of \"governmental unit\" itself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20147\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(2)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Section 147(f) also anticipates situations in which a governmental unit may not have an \"applicable elected representative,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20147\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 147(f)(2)(E)(ii), which betrays the contention that Congress defined the term \"governmental unit\" to include only governmental entities with elected legislative bodies or chief executives. Further, even if the Court were to accept Plaintiff's contention, it would not render the statutory text unambiguous: local school boards, sheriffs, and other entities are often elected to exercise legislative or executive authority, and each would constitute a \"governmental unit\" absent further clarification.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   26 C.F.R. \u00a7 5f.103-2(e) (clarifying that \"[i]f multiple elected legislative bodies of a governmental unit have independent legislative authority, ... the body with the more specific authority relating to the issue is the only legislative body\" whose approval suffices);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20147\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5f.103-2(h)(7) (discussing example implicating elected school board).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Even setting aside these types of entities, Indian River County's position would mean that every single city and town through which Phase II runs would have to approve the bonds' issuance in order for them to be tax exempt, even if all of the counties encompassing those jurisdictions approved the issue. Congress passed \u00a7 147(f) to promote democratic accountability and safeguard State and local governments' input on projects as a means of ensuring tax exemptions benefit the public.\n   <em>\n    Affordable Hous.

But it is hard to imagine that its chosen mechanism would yield a result in which a single town could pocket veto a significant public infrastructure project notwithstanding the assent of the State and county governments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The absurdity of Plaintiff's view is further revealed by its interpretation of \u00a7 147(f)(2)(A)(ii)'s parenthetical exception \"that if more than 1 governmental unit within a State has jurisdiction over the entire area within such State in which such facility is located, only 1 such unit need approve such issue.\" Plaintiff reads this to mean that State approval alone suffices\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   in such a situation. But that would mean a State could approve a facility over local government objections only if the local government had jurisdiction over the entire facility. Under Plaintiff's view, if, for example, the facility were entirely within Indian River County, Florida's approval\n   <em>\n    would\n   </em>\n   suffice, even if Indian River County opposed it, because both Florida and the County would share jurisdiction over the entire area. But, because Phase II spans four other counties within the State, Florida's approval is insufficient. It would be a bizarre outcome, to say the least, if a State could approve financing of a facility over a political subdivision's objection if the facility were located entirely within that subdivision but could not do so when the facility traverses multiple subdivisions. Why would Congress empower a county to override its State's desire to finance a facility in every instance\n   <em>\n    except\n   </em>\n   those in which it is uniquely affected? This only compounds the absurdity of Plaintiff's reading of the non-parenthetical portion of \u00a7 147(f) to require assent from every single local government through which Phase II runs. The Court cannot accept this reading.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Griffin v.

In the face of such ambiguity, the Court considers whether the Department's implicit interpretation-that\n   the State's approval alone satisfied \u00a7 147(f)(2)(A)(ii) -\"is based on a permissible construction of the statute in light of its language, structure, and purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Treasury Emps.

There are several indications that it was a permissible construction of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   First, the legislative history indicates that, notwithstanding ambiguous statutory language, Congress intended State approval to suffice in situations like this. The Conference Committee reports included language \"intend[ed] to clarify the application of the rule requiring a public hearing and approval by an elected official or legislative body in order to issue [PABs].\" The reports explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   Where the facilities are located entirely within the geographic jurisdiction of the issuing governmental unit, only one public hearing and approval are required even though the facilities may be located in several different subdivisions of the issuing governmental unit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   For example, where a governor of a state is to approve the issuance of bonds for facilities located in that state (even though located in several counties), only the state is required to have a public hearing on the bond issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   H.R. Rep. No. 97-760, at 517 (1982) (Conf. Rep.); S. Rep. No. 97-530, at 517 (1982) (Conf. Rep.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The example is precisely on point. Here, Florida's Governor, through his representative, approved the issuance of bonds for the facilities. Per the Conference Committee reports, that approval suffices and the fact that the facilities run through several political subdivisions of the State does not undermine its sufficiency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Second, the Department's implicit acceptance of the sufficiency of the State's approval is consistent with IRS regulations implementing \u00a7 147(f). Those regulations define \"governmental unit\" to mean \"a State, territory, a possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, or any political subdivision thereof.\" 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 5f.103-2(g)(1). Plugging the relevant part of that definition into \u00a7 147(f) yields a requirement of approval by \"each State or political subdivision thereof having jurisdiction\" over the relevant area. This phrase by itself doesn't answer the key question one way or the other, because it is not immediately clear what work the word \"or\" does in this context. It could signify that every unit with jurisdiction-whether a State\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   its political subdivision-must approve the issue; it could also signify that each State with jurisdiction,\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   each political subdivision with jurisdiction, must approve the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Fortunately, the same IRS regulations provide examples that answer any lingering questions and confirm that it is the latter. Example 5 is particularly instructive:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   County M proposes to issue an industrial development bond to finance a project located partly within the geographic jurisdiction of County M and partly within the geographic jurisdiction of County N. Both counties are located in State X. The part of the project in County N is also located partly within the geographic jurisdiction of City O and partly within the geographic jurisdiction of City P. Under the provisions [implementing issuer approval], County M must give issuer approval. Additionally, under the provisions [implementing host approval], either State X, County N, or both Cities O and P, must give host approval.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8954474,3440204\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/409/377/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5f.103-2(h)(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   This example removes any doubt that a higher-level government unit's approval suffices to satisfy \u00a7 147(f)(2)(A)(ii), whether or not its political subdivisions approve. That is why County N's approval obviates\n   the need for Cities O and P to give their own approval, and why State X's approval obviates the need for County N's approval.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Given clear legislative intent and the long-standing regulations interpreting the statute, the Court concludes that it is reasonable to interpret \u00a7 147(f)(2)(A)(ii) as satisfied by State-level approval in this instance. This is also consistent with Congress's purpose, which was to build in some level of democratic accountability to ensure that tax-exempt bonds finance only those projects that actually benefit the public. That goal is achieved if every area in which a facility is located falls within the constituency of an approver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   This reading of the statute is not inconsistent with \u00a7 147(f)(2)(A)(ii)'s parenthetical exception, on which Plaintiff heavily relies as the sole exception where State approval suffices. The regulatory examples help clarify that this exception is designed to permit approval by a lower-level government without the need for higher-level approval. In one of the examples, \"State X proposes to issue an industrial development bond to finance a facility located partly within the geographic jurisdiction of State X and partly within the geographic jurisdiction of State Y,\" with the \"portion of the facility located in State Y ... entirely within the geographic jurisdiction of City Z.\" 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 5f.103-2(h)(7). In this instance, \"either State Y or City Z must give host approval as that part of the facility to be located outside State X will be entirely within the geographic jurisdiction of each unit.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8954474,3440204\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/409/377/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In other words, the lower-level government need not wait for higher-level authority to\n   <em>\n    approve\n   </em>\n   such a project but does not possess veto power if the two share jurisdiction. This is consistent with the view that the statute means each State with jurisdiction,\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   its political subdivision with jurisdiction, must approve the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   To avoid doubt and facilitate this understanding, the IRS's regulations further provide that \"if property to be financed ... is located within two or more governmental units but not entirely within either of such units, each portion of the property which is located entirely within the smallest respective governmental units may be treated as a separate facility.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8954474,3440204\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/409/377/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5f.103-2(c)(3). This clarifies why, in Example 5, once County M gave issuer approval (which doubled as host approval), County N's approval sufficed absent State X's approval, even though it did not have jurisdiction over the entire area. Each portion could be treated as a discrete facility so the portion in County N was entirely within the jurisdiction of both State X and County N, allowing County N alone to give host approval. Likewise, it clarifies why Cities O and P could both give host approval without waiting for either County N or State X. Either the State,\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   its political subdivision with jurisdiction, must approve the bond issue\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   In sum, reading \u00a7 147(f)(2)(A)(ii)'s parenthetical exception to empower a local government to\n   <em>\n    approve\n   </em>\n   a facility without waiting for the State is consistent with the congressional purpose of financing facilities that benefit the public while ensuring democratic accountability. Once a local government with jurisdiction over the entire facility concludes that it is worthwhile, it would make little sense to force it to wait for the State to act. The exception is a mechanism for facilitating local government assent to a project in the face of State intransigence. Plaintiff's interpretation, on the other hand, would turn a shield into a sword and allow a local government to veto a State's approval.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Plaintiff's understanding of \u00a7 147(f) would yield absurd results and runs head first into the Conference reports in which Congress announced its intention that\n   \"where a governor of a state is to approve the issuance of bonds for facilities located in that state (even though located in several counties), only the state is required to have a public hearing on the bond issue.\" H.R. Rep. No. 97-760, at 517 (1982) (Conf. Rep.); S. Rep. No. 97-530, at 517 (1982) (Conf. Rep.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The Secretary's implicit conclusion that these PABs comply with \u00a7 147(f)'s public approval requirement is consistent with longstanding IRS regulations.

Pls.' MSJ at 11. FRA and AAF counter that the agency thoroughly examined the project's public-safety impacts using the information available, considered and responded to numerous public comments regarding safety, and incorporated mandatory mitigation requirements in the FEIS. Based on its review, FRA concluded that the project would have an overall positive effect on public health and safety because the project includes planned track improvements and safety enhancements and would result in more people using trains rather than cars,\n   leading to safer roads with fewer accidents and less pollution. AR 73589.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   The Court starts with Plaintiff's underlying concern that the agency abdicated its responsibility to conduct an independent public safety evaluation by deferring any \"hard look\" until after the NEPA process is complete and \"shuffl[ing]\" responsibility to respond to public-safety concerns \"off to AAF.\" Pls.' MSJ at 11. In support of that contention, the County relies on a response from AAF that was ultimately incorporated into the FEIS: \"Consistent with FRA safety requirements, which are not part of the NEPA process, AAF will develop a Hazard Analysis and System Safety Program Plan prior to the start of the operations.\" AR 38707, 73658. Plaintiff protests that NEPA is a \"look before you leap\" statute, requiring the agency to conduct a thorough investigation of the significant safety and environmental impacts\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   taking a major federal action. Hr'g Tr. at 13:17-14:3. In the County's view, had FRA \"looked\"-that is, conducted a safety analysis as part of the NEPA process-it would have disclosed and more specifically addressed the three specific safety issues identified above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   The trouble for the County is that FRA does not contend that the Hazard Analysis and System Safety Program Plan (\"SSP Plan\"), prepared pursuant to FRA regulations,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   replaces NEPA. Rather, these are two separate requirements. Under NEPA, FRA must take a hard look at the safety impacts of the project, and that is what FRA did. The agency considered and disclosed a wide number of safety impacts of the project based on the information available at the time and then reasonably concluded that the increased safety risks from more and faster trains could be mitigated. These mitigation measures include grade-crossing improvements; installation of Positive Train Control (\"PTC\")-a system of dynamically monitoring and controlling train movements-across both passenger and freight trains; construction of fencing in locations along the line where pedestrians are more likely to cross the tracks illegally; and coordination with local officials regarding emergency vehicles. AR 74056-58. So while the County is correct that the future SSP Plans \"do not obviate the need for the hard look and public airing that NEPA demands,\" Pls.' Reply at 8, FRA independently met its NEPA obligations in this regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   The Court now moves to Indian River County's more specific safety concerns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Pedestrian safety\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Indian River County first contends that FRA and AAF overlooked serious risks to pedestrian safety at both \"formal\" and \"informal\" crossings. Before discussing these arguments, it is helpful to define some of these train terms. Pedestrians cross train tracks at either \"formal\" or \"informal\" crossings. Formal crossings are those that pedestrians are supposed to use. We all recognize them: pathways or roads, signage, and signals indicating when a train is coming and when it is safe to cross. Informal crossings are the opposite, ones that pedestrians are not supposed to use but sometimes do. Informal crossings will be somewhere on the \"mainline\" of the railroad-that is, anywhere along the tracks other than at the formal, at-grade crossings-where a pedestrian can scamper across. Finally, pedestrians can cross tracks legally or illegally. A pedestrian crosses legally by waiting, at a formal crossing, for the \"all clear\" and complying with the signals. One crosses the tracks illegally by either jaywalking at a formal crossing or \"trespassing\" across the tracks at an informal crossing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   <em>\n    i. Formal crossings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   With respect to formal crossings, Indian River County originally contended that AAF's planned grade-crossing improvements were only voluntary and that any mitigation requirements were contingent on localities agreeing to pay for ongoing maintenance. Pls.' MSJ at 16. Both FRA and AAF have clarified, however, that despite some ambiguity in the FEIS, the grade-crossing improvements are mandatory mitigation measures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. Defs.' MSJ at 31-32; AAF MSJ at 12.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, AAF will be required to \"implement and fund initial grade crossing safety enhancements identified in the Diagnostic Team Report.\" AR 74137;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   AR 74054 (FEIS concluding that the project \"would result in enhancing public safety with improvements to grade crossing signal equipment for vehicular and pedestrian traffic\"). And it is AAF that will pay the cost of making these initial grade-crossing safety improvements. AR 73718. Based on these representations, the County's \"concern that the grade-crossing improvements will not be implemented at all has been put to rest.\" Pls.' Reply at 11.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   And these improvements are extensive. The required safety features are the result of a diagnostic safety review, a thorough study of 349 total grade crossings conducted by FRA's Office of Railroad Safety-Highway Rail Crossing and Trespasser Program Division, in which Indian River County participated. AR 73718-19. The diagnostic team made a series of crossing-related recommendations, all of which were adopted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 74137. These measures include implementing sidewalk gates in particular locations, formal pedestrian crossings wherever sidewalks exist on either side of the tracks, PTC along the entire project, and four quadrant gates (which consist of automatic flashing light signals and gates) at grade crossings. AR 73718-24;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   AR 49371-85. Thus, contrary to the County's concerns, the FEIS requires AAF to implement a variety of safety measures and improvements at formal crossings to ensure pedestrian safety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   <em>\n    ii. Informal crossings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   With respect to informal crossings, the County insists that even if FRA reviewed the safety risks at formal at-grade crossings, it completely overlooked the risk to\n   <em>\n    trespassing\n   </em>\n   pedestrians on the mainline. Pls.' MSJ at 13; Pls.' Reply at 3. Plaintiff says that these pedestrians risk being blind-sided by high-speed passenger trains, which can be hard to see and harder still to hear until too late. Pls.' MSJ at 13. It argues that \"there is no 'existing analysis' in the FEIS, or elsewhere in the record, of the safety impacts of the Project on pedestrians on the FECR corridor outside of formal grade crossings.\" Pls.' Reply at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   The record demonstrates otherwise. The FEIS expressly considers the possibility of trespassers-including pedestrians who cross on the mainline at \"informal\" crossings or against signals at formal grade-crossings-and proposes mitigation measures\n   to address the problem.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The suggested approach is two-fold: encouraging pedestrians to use formal crossings and erecting fencing to prevent them from using informal ones.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   First, encouraging pedestrians to use formal crossings. As explained above, the FEIS and ROD require AAF to implement a series of improvements to grade crossings, including pedestrian gates, paths to connect sidewalks on either side of the tracks, and flashing lights. The FEIS is clear that one reason to require these improvements is to encourage pedestrians to use formal crossings: \"The infrastructure and safety improvements that are incorporated in the Project will reduce illegal and unsafe trespass on the rail line, and improve safety for area residents by adding sidewalks at grade crossings.\" AR 73657. This statement in the FEIS is consistent with the recommendations of FRA's on-site engineering field report, which expressed concerns in 2014 that AAF was not seriously committed to implementing necessary security measures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 48371. That field report was shared with the diagnostic team which, as described above, produced a report that set forth the mitigation measures that AAF will be required to implement. The field report explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-154\">\n   Trespassing is an epidemic along this corridor. Rather than encourage it, it is recommended per my field notes at those particular locations-[\"certain locations along the corridor in which sidewalks are present on both sides of the railroad right-of-way, but do not follow through\"]-to equip sidewalk approaches with a visual and gated barrier. This is to provide safe passage of pedestrians through a very active rail line and prevents them from walking into an open railway corridor; or directing them onto the street-irrespective if there is an agreement or not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   AR 49373. In light of this discussion, it cannot be said that FRA did not analyze the underlying problem of pedestrian crossings and come up with at least one response: create formal crossings where pedestrians are most likely to cross (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , where there are sidewalks on either side of the tracks).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   FRA also adopted another response: fencing to keep pedestrians from running across the tracks at informal crossings. The FEIS explains that the FECR Corridor already has fencing in \"specific areas\" where trespassing has been a problem. AR 73858. Among other safety features-like warning signs, flashing signals, a public-awareness program coordinated with Florida Operation Lifesaver, and PTC-the project will either improve existing fencing or add fencing where it is lacking:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-157\">\n   For the E-W Corridor standard FDOT highway fencing, or its equivalent, will be added throughout the length of the corridor where the track is at-grade that will restrict and seal the railroad right-of-way from public access.... Fencing on the N-S Corridor would be upgraded based on existing public access locations and the potential for conflicts with the increased train frequency.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-158\">\n   AAF will conduct [Right of Way] Field Surveys to observe, document, and provide recommendations to minimize trespassing by employing fencing, warning\n   signage, public outreach/information, and other appropriate measures as required.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   AR 74059. The FEIS does not specify the \"specific designs\" for the fencing, explaining that fencing will be added \"where an FRA hazard analysis review determines that fencing is required for safety; this will be in populated areas where restricting access to the rail corridor is necessary for safety.\" AR 73717;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   AR 74059 (\"Fencing on the N-S Corridor would be upgraded based on existing public access locations and the potential for conflicts with increased train frequency. Specific designs for fencing will be developed as the project advances.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Conceding, perhaps, that the FEIS considers trespassing, the County nonetheless contends that FRA failed to take a hard look at the problem in two ways. Neither contention is persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   First, the County suggests that the FEIS understates the risks pedestrians face by relying on \"stale and limited data on the history of accidents involving FECR trains.\" Pls.' Reply at 3. The FEIS indicates that between 2007 and 2011-when only freight trains were running on the N-S Corridor-there were ten total fatalities \"not at grade crossings\" between Cocoa and Miami. AR 73856 (Table 4.4.4-2). These deaths could have involved \"a range of accident types, including derailments, accidents between trains, trains and humans, or between trains and objects on the tracks.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201502.22\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The County retorts that \"the reality\" of trespasser fatalities \"is starkly different\" than that presented in Table 4.4.4-2.

Relying on data pulled from the same database used to create Table 4.4.4-2, the County argues that during that same period in that same stretch of corridor, there were actually 58 fatalities. Decl. of Philip E. Karmel, ECF No. 37-1 &amp; Ex. 1 to Karmel Decl.

Plaintiff offers its data to shore up its concerns about pedestrian safety specifically on the mainline, but the data does not appear to distinguish between fatalities on the mainline and at grade-crossings. Table 4.4.4-2, by contrast, does, isolating the relevant data by presenting only mainline trespasser fatalities. Thus, Plaintiff's data is both over-inclusive and less relevant to answering the question the County poses regarding trespasser fatalities along the mainline. Accordingly, the County's data does not directly undermine that used in the FEIS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   And second, the County contends that by not identifying specific locations or designs for fencing until \"sometime\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   project approval,\" FRA again \"kicks the can down the road\" on safety issues.

When a train passes over one of these bridges, the bridges obviously must be in the \"down\" position.

Based on these reports and extensive navigation modeling analyses, the FEIS discloses that the project will increase vessel queuing time at the moveable bridges as a result of increased train traffic. AR 73934. For example, the average weekday closure time at the St. Lucie River Bridge is projected to be 6.6 hours under the 2016 No-Action Alternative\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   and 9.8 hours under the Project Alternative.

However, the FEIS found that \"the\n   <em>\n    observed\n   </em>\n   time is almost half that.\" AR 49640 (emphasis added). Second, in response to comments on the draft EIS, Amec and FRA updated their analysis in the 2015 Navigation Discipline Report to rely on data regarding summer rather than winter boat traffic. AR 49635, 73917, 74042. There is significantly more boat traffic during the summer than winter, which means that the anticipated vessel wait times will be lower for much of the year.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3514787,1197068\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/642/589/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And third, the model is run using two scenarios-one in which boats can travel through the crossings simultaneously in opposite directions and one in which they cannot. While the U.S. Coast Guard suggests that simultaneous boat crossing is not considered \"safe or prudent,\" AR 38780, FRA found that \"small and medium-sized boats have been observed traveling through the crossings simultaneously in opposite directions-only larger boats, such as commercial vessels, require one-way passage,\" AR 49638.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   The County advances three criticisms of FRA's analysis and conclusion that wait times will not be too severe. First, it suggests that the modeling should not have considered the \"passing allowed\" scenario in light of the Coast Guard's warning. Pls.' Reply at 15-16. However, as Amec emphasized in its Report, \"a system with no boats passing is not representative of observed conditions.\" AR 49645;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   AR 49638. It was reasonable for the FEIS to present the modeling results based on data consistent with observed conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   Second, the County asserts that FRA unreasonably and without explanation focused on the \"80th percentile\" volume of boat arrivals, ignoring the busiest days of boat traffic represented by the 90th percentile volume and underestimating vessel queuing and its attendant negative effects. However, the record is clear that FRA made a reasoned choice to use the 80th percentile. This value refers to \"the value that exceeds 80% of the wait times of all boats, etc. For example, if the [80th percentile]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   wait time of all boats was 11.7 minutes, this means that 80% of the boats waited 11.7 minutes or less and 20% waited longer than 11.7 minutes.\" AR 49640. In other words, the 80th percentile value represents a \"typical high volume day.\" AR 73917. FRA decided to focus on the 80th percentile rather than daily averages in response to comments that the draft EIS had \"underestimated impacts ... by using average day values.\" AR 38687. Those commenters suggested using \"a methodology similar to traffic analysis,\" such as using 80th percentile values, instead.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3514787,1197068\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/642/589/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The 2015 updated analysis bears this out: As an example, for the St. Lucie River crossing, the average wait for all boats is 5.1 minutes, the average wait for delayed boats is 8.6 minutes, and the 80th percentile wait is 14.1 minutes. AR 49645. Thus, FRA made the reasonable choice to use the 80th percentile value rather than the average value (which would underestimate wait times) or the 90th percentile value (which would exceed a \"typical high volume day\") as a more realistic measure of boat traffic. The Court has no basis to second guess that decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   And third, the County faults FRA for failing to factor in the role of \"hazardous currents.\" Pls.' MSJ at 27-28. Commenters on the draft EIS also expressed concern that the modeling did not reflect realistic boating behavior because it \"assume[s] that boats could safely hold their positions in a queue, regardless of tides, currents, vessel wake, and other factors.\" AR 73916. But FRA disclosed this assumption-\"[t]he model does not account for the complex interaction of tides, currents, vessel wake, and boater behavior\"-and explained that the model \"represents the most realistic situation of boat arrivals and bridge operations possible using modeling technology.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3514787,1197068\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/642/589/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In other words, FRA said it did the best it could with available modeling technology and conceded that it was not perfect.

Those mitigation requirements include a publicly-available set schedule for bridge closures, notification signs with countdowns to help boaters plan trips accordingly, increased communication with local authorities during holidays and special events, and a \"coordination plan\" with the U.S. Coast Guard.

The County does not contest that the relevant guidance is non-binding. In addition, the agency has explained why it prepared only a general assessment for purposes of the FEIS. According to the ROD, \"Noise and Vibration Impacts for the north-south corridor relied on the [applicable guidance] methodologies appropriate for the level of design of the alternatives evaluated in the FEIS.\" AR 65132.

And the agency took the additional step of requiring AAF to conduct the more detailed analysis once more information became available and the more comprehensive analysis was feasible. While the agency certainly could have discussed the present infeasibility of a detailed analysis in more detail, the Court concludes that it has done enough to satisfy NEPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   The County also argues that FRA unreasonably departed from agency guidance by calculating, rather than measuring, noise. Agency guidance explains that where, as here, \"the proposed high-speed rail project corridor is to be shared with an existing rail transit corridor ... noise measurements at representative locations along the corridor are essential to estimate noise accurately.\" AR 13080. This does not appear contingent on whether the agency conducts a general assessment or detailed analysis. Contrary to the guidance, Amec, the consultant that prepared the underlying technical memorandum that forms the basis of the noise information included in the FEIS, did not measure existing noise along the N-S Corridor. AR 61110. Instead, it calculated existing noise based on a variety of variables and then compared its calculations to the observed noise measurements of a 2010 Environment Assessment (\"EA\") for Amtrak along the same corridor.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3436423,9144823\" index=\"229\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/391/1267/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In response to a comment from VHB and FRA regarding the need to measure existing noise, Amec and AAF explained that \"[e]xisting noise measurements for existing rail line operations (i.e., freight) have been completed through recent, previous studies.... Calculated noise levels were compared to analogous measured noise levels as verification of accuracy, with good agreement.\" AR 1325. But again, whether an agency is required to act reasonably or also adequately account for any departures from guidance, the FRA has adequately explained why it did not separately measure noise-Amec and FRA could validate their calculations based on recent noise measurements along the same corridor. The County's two counterarguments do not undermine this conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   First, the County argues that by failing to measure existing noise, FRA omitted a key source of noise as a variable in its assessment of current noise levels: the use of warning horns along the mainline.

As explained above, the FEIS concludes that \"noise impacts [from the project] would primarily be due to the increased frequency of warning horns use at at-grade crossings.\" AR 73950. Implicit in this conclusion is that other sources of noise, including the use of warning horns along the mainline, were not significant contributors of noise. Although the agency neglected to expressly articulate why, the record suggests that the agency concluded mainline warning horns were not a significant source of noise because they would be used only rarely and randomly. In response to one of the County's noise-related comments on the FEIS, FRA explained that \"[t]rain-mounted horns may still need to be sounded at all locations along the rail corridor under emergency conditions.\" AR 65289. This implies that the agency concluded that the use of mainline warning horns was both rare (because they would be sounded only in emergencies) and difficult to measure (because emergencies are unpredictable).

The agency was not required to separately analyze the public-safety ramifications of marginally faster (by 5 mph on average) freight trains given that these safety measures would benefit both passenger and freight trains, which the agency acknowledged would be moving at increased speeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Noise and vibration impacts of faster freight trains\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   Second, FRA offers two responses to the County's argument that its noise and vibration analysis overlooked an increase in freight speed: first, quite simply, the analysis\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   take \"into account the characteristics of future passenger and freight rail operations, including speed,\" Fed.

FRA's first argument is belied by the record but its disregard for noise from faster freight trains is harmless largely because of its second argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   The record is clear that FRA's noise analysis does not consider the incremental noise increase from faster freight trains. Rather, the analysis takes into account freight trains only to establish the baseline level of noise based on calculated current freight operations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 61108. The FEIS as well focuses on freight trains only to calculate the baseline, not as a potential source of additional noise based on an incremental increase in speed.

The reason is two-fold. First, the FEIS anticipates that freight trains are to go only approximately 5 mph faster because of the Project.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 73733 (Table 3.3-16 reflecting a 4.88 mph increase in speed for freight trains traveling through Indian River County and a 5.30 mph increase in speed for freight trains traveling through Martin County). The County fails to convince the Court that this slight increase in speed would lead to a significant increase in noise. And second, the FEIS concludes that the main source of noise from the project would be the \"increased frequency of warning horn use at at-grade crossings\" rather than train-related noise. AR 73950. Indeed, the FEIS concluded that noise on the mainline would increase only marginally (by 0.2 to 0.3 dBA) from the addition of 32 high-speed passenger trains per day, AR 73953, suggesting that noise from the trains themselves pales in comparison to that of their horns at crossings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    Noise impacts of nighttime freight trains\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   Third, in response to Indian River County's comment on the FEIS that adding passenger trains \"is likely to shift freight trains to nighttime hours due to scheduling conflicts,\" FRA explained that \"[f]uture passenger and freight train operations and the period of the day they are anticipated to occur has been analyzed based on FECR's anticipated future passenger and freight demands.\" AR 65289. The County fails to provide evidence that, contrary to this response, the noise analysis ignored the anticipated train schedule. Instead, Plaintiff points to Table 5.2.2-1, a table setting forth the \"Proposed Passenger Rail Operations\" which assumes two passenger trains per night and does not discuss freight trains. AR 73944. That this specific table does not reflect the timing of freight traffic does not prove that the agency did not do so at all. In fact, the Amec report clearly demonstrates that the noise analysis contemplated at least some nighttime freight traffic. That report explains that \"[a]ccording to historical trends ..., approximately half of the freight operations occur at night (10 pm to 7 am) and half during the day (7 am to 10 pm).\" AR 61109. Table 3-1 on that same page presents the \"2016 Projected Existing Conditions Rail Operations (North-South Corridor),\" which contemplates 11 freight trains per night.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3456721,3790751\" index=\"248\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/457/78/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   d.\n   <em>\n    St. Lucie River Bridge and faster freight trains\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   And fourth, the County faults FRA for not including \"discussion of the vibration impacts to the structural stability of the St. Lucie Bridge from the increased use and train speeds.\" Pls.' MSJ at 24. But an agency need not discuss an impact that is \"merely conceivable\" and, at its worst, minimal: AAF determined that the bridge is \"structurally sound,\" AR 73727, and in any event, freight trains were projected to go just 5 mph faster over the bridge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   Agency action is rarely perfect. But NEPA does not demand perfection. Instead, it requires that an agency take a\n   \"hard look\" at the reasonably foreseeable impacts of a proposed major federal action. The extensive FEIS, appendices, comment responses, and Record of Decision together demonstrate that FRA met that requirement here. The Court will therefore grant Defendants' and Intervenor-Defendant's motions for summary judgment on Indian River's NEPA claim, and deny the County's motion for summary judgment on that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court will grant Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment, grant Intervenor-Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment, and deny Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment. A separate Order shall accompany this Memorandum Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-238\">\n    The fact that each provision specifically deals with \"facilities\" is important. Indian River County relies in part on the fact that \u00a7 142 and \u00a7 147 share a common subpart of the Internal Revenue Code, which governs PABs eligibility. Courts have often found provisions contained in a common sub\n    <em>\n     section\n    </em>\n    to be integrally related.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Int'l Union of Bricklayers &amp; Allied Craftsmen v. Meese\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"29369,3597269\" index=\"249\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/761/798/\">\n     761 F.2d 798\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 804-05 (D.C. Cir. 1985) ;\n    <em>\n     Save Jobs USA v.

But a common subpart is less instructive where, as here, the PABs subpart has multifarious purposes and covers several different types of bonds. But \u00a7 142 and \u00a7 147 each governs the use of bonds to finance facilities in particular, evincing a closer relationship than \u00a7 142 shares with, for example, the rules governing mortgage bonds that are also contained in that subpart. The Court's conclusion is not that the two bear an integral relationship simply because they share a common subpart, but because they both deal with a common activity regulated by that subpart. Thus, contrary to Defendants' contentions, the Court's conclusion that the two provisions bear an integral relationship does not license\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    plaintiff whose interests are protected by\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    provision within the subpart to challenge a \u00a7 142(m) allocation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-239\">\n    The plain text of the statute is enough to support the Secretary's action, but it bears noting that this is not the first instance in which the Department allocated PAB authority to a passenger railway.
