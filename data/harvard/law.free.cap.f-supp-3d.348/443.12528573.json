FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This action centers around Seterus' servicing of Kemp's mortgage loan and allegedly improper property inspection fees that it charged her following her default on the loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Kemp's Mortgage Loan and Subsequent Default\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In April 2007, Kemp obtained a home mortgage loan from Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., secured by a deed of trust on real property located in Glen Burnie, Maryland (the Property). Hr'g Tr. at 4:3-7; ECF No. 24-4. Although the exact date has not been provided, at some point after the origination of the loan, it was assigned to Fannie Mae, the current owner.

On April 10, 2017, Seterus, Kemp's loan servicer, declared the loan to be in default and stated that if Kemp did not \"cure the default on or before May 15, 2017, it may result in acceleration of the sums secured by the mortgage and may result in the sale of the premises.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201601\">\n    \u00b6 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Kemp again wrote Seterus on September 6, 2017, requesting information about the property inspection fees as well as an accounting as to the total due on the loan.

The next day, Seterus responded to Kemp's second inquiry asking\n   about the property inspection fees, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [T]he authority to charge fees such as property inspection fees or legal fees is contained in the Deed of trust.... Enclosed is a copy of the Deed of Trust for your reference. Due to the continued contractual delinquency of the loan, Seterus exercised its right under the terms of the signed Deed of Trust to protect the loan owner's interest in the property. Property inspections are ordered when a loan is more than 45 days contractually delinquent, and every 30 days if the contractual delinquency continues. These were drive-by inspections to see if the property was occupied in good repair. The fee for this service was billed to Seterus by an outside contractor and then assessed to the loan. As of the date of this loan, Seterus has assessed the loan [twelve] property inspection fees [at $15.00 per inspection] totaling $180.00. These fees are considered valid.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201601\">\n    \u00b6 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Kemp alleges that the assessment of these property inspections fees on the loan violated Maryland law, specifically Md.

Kemp's Trial Plan and Loan Modification\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In addition to the referenced correspondence regarding her loan, Kemp alleges that in a letter dated July 20, 2017, Seterus offered her a \"Trial Period Plan\" (TPP) in order to obtain a Fannie Mae loan modification. The plan required Kemp to make three trial payments to Seterus, on behalf of Fannie Mae, on or before September 1, October 1, and November 1, 2017. Kemp claims she accepted the TPP offer and made all the trial period payments.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201601\">\n    \u00b6 31-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On November 8, 2017, Seterus, on behalf of Fannie Mae, offered Kemp a Final Loan Modification Agreement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201601\">\n    \u00b6 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The offer stated that \"unpaid interest, real estate taxes, insurance premiums, and certain assessments\" would be added to the mortgage balance Kemp owed. ECF No. 26-5 at 3. Kemp subsequently agreed to the proposed Final Loan Modification Agreement, which she claims capitalized the property inspection fees claimed due by Seterus. ECF No. 17 \u00b6 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Since the loan modification, Kemp states that she has continued to make her modified mortgage payments and that her loan remains in effect.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201601\">\n    \u00b6 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Present Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Based on these allegations Kemp brings six causes of action on behalf of herself and on behalf of three putative classes of situated persons. These claims all stem from the alleged improper property inspection fees added to her loan and include: 1) declaratory and injunctive relief related to Kemp's and the State Law Class members' mortgage accounts against both Defendants; 2) unjust enrichment on behalf of Kemp and the State Law Class against Seterus; 3) Maryland Consumer Debt Collection Practices Act (MCDCA) and Maryland Consumer Protection Act (MCPA) claims on behalf of Kemp and the State Law Class Members against Seterus; 4) Md. Com. Law \u00a7 12-121(a)(1)(ii) claim on behalf of Kemp and Usury Class members against both Defendants; 5) Maryland Mortgage Fraud Protection Act (MMFPA) claim on behalf of State Law Class members and Kemp against Seterus; and 6) TILA violations-the one and only federal claim-on behalf of the TILA Class members and Kemp against all Defendants, or in the alternative, only against Fannie Mae. ECF No. 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Kemp originally filed this suit in Montgomery County Circuit Court on December 19, 2017, and amended her Complaint in that court on January 26, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On February 15, 2018, based on federal question jurisdiction, Defendants removed the case to this Court, accompanied by a Motion to Dismiss the First Amended Complaint.

Count VI: TILA Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In Count VI of the Second Amended Complaint, Kemp alleges three TILA violations. First, she alleges a violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1639g based on the purported payoff statement Seterus provided in September 2017, which she claims was inaccurate because it included the unlawful property inspection charges. Second, she alleges a violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201026.36\">\n    12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1026.36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), the corresponding regulation that implements 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1639g, based on the same September 2017 payoff statement. Third, she alleges a separate violation under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20226.18\">\n    12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   based on Defendants' alleged failure to provide new TILA disclosures when they added these property inspection fees to the principal amount owed by her on the loan. Hr'g Tr. at 13:19-14:12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Title 15 Section 1639g of the U.S. Code provides: \"A creditor or servicer of a home loan shall send an accurate payoff balance within a reasonable time, but in no case more than 7 business days, after the receipt of a written request for such balance.\" The corresponding regulation that implements the statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201026.36\">\n    12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1026.36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3), similarly requires that a \"creditor, assignee, or servicer\" provide an accurate payoff balance.

A \"creditor\" is defined by TILA to refer only to a person\n   who both: \"(1) regularly extends, whether in connection with loans, sales of property or services, or otherwise, consumer credit which is payable by agreement in more than four installments or for which the payment of a finance charge is or may be required, and (2) is the person to whom the debt arising from the consumer credit transaction is\n   <em>\n    initially\n   </em>\n   payable on the face of the evidence of indebtedness or, if there is no such evidence of indebtedness, by agreement.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201602\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Though TILA provides for liability ofassignees in certain circumstances, its reach is limited.

The statute in question authorizes a private right of action against an assignee in a very narrow set of circumstances, i.e.,\n   <em>\n    only if\n   </em>\n   the violation for which such action is brought is apparent on the face of the disclosure statement.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201641\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The question, then, is whether providing an inaccurate payoff statement is a violation that is \"apparent on the face of the disclosure statement.\" The Eleventh Circuit analyzed this precise issue and held that it is not.\n   <em>\n    See Evanto\n   </em>\n   , (holding that failure to provide a payoff balance is not a violation apparent on the face of the disclosure statement). The\n   <em>\n    Evanto\n   </em>\n   court reached this conclusion, reasoning that a \"disclosure statement is a document provided\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the extension of credit that sets out the terms of the loan.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201641\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Because a \"payoff balance can be provided only after a loan has been made and contains the amount yet to be repaid, .... [t]here is no way that the failure to provide a payoff balance can appear on the face of the disclosure statement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201641\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The same reasoning applies to an alleged inaccurate payoff statement provided after the loan has been made, as is the case here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Second Circuit similarly recognized the limited liability TILA places on assignees of the original creditor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vincent\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3727054,3667006\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/736/88/\">\n    736 F.3d at 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"We may think it unwise to allow an assignee to escape TILA liability when it overcharges the debtor and collects unauthorized fees, where the original creditor would otherwise be required to refund the debtor promptly.

Nor, obviously, can she do so as to these Defendants. To be sure, whether or not the property inspection fees were lawfully charged under Maryland law has yet to be determined. They may or may not be. As Fannie Mae points out, for instance, the property inspection fees were previously noted in the deed of trust agreed to by Kemp,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 24-4, so arguably they are not new credit transactions that could impose liability on Fannie Mae under TILA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In any case, Kemp's TILA claims fail as to Fannie Mae.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The Court rejects this argument. To start, the Court does not necessarily read the regulation and the statute as inconsistent with each other. While the regulation provides what assignees, creditors, and services must do, it does not itself provide a private right of action. The statute, which the regulation is intended to implement, grants a right of action only against creditors as defined within the Act. To the extent Kemp argues that the regulation directly contradicts and supersedes the statute, this argument fails.
