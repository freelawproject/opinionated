Magistrate Judge Sitarski recommended that the Petition be denied on all nine grounds raised. Petitioner conceded the R &amp; R on all but two grounds, objecting to the recommendations to deny relief for his claims that he suffered from: 1) a violation of the Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause in relation to the admission of autopsy reports and testimony of a medical examiner who did not conduct the autopsies (Ground Two); and 2) ineffective assistance of counsel in relation to trial counsel's failure to seek relief for lack of a speedy trial (Ground Four).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, the Court approves the R &amp; R as to Grounds One, Three, Five, Six, Seven, Eight, and Nine denies the Petition on those grounds. Following de novo review of Grounds Two and Four, the Court denies the Petition on those grounds. Finding no merit to any of the grounds raised, the Court denies issuing a writ of habeas corpus and denies issuing a certificate of appealability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Table of Contents\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I.

Petitioner's quote from\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   is misleading because the context and surrounding discussion were not provided. Before this quoted passage, the Supreme Court stated that \"[t]he Fourth Circuit's interpretation of the 'unreasonable application' clause of \u00a7 2254(d)(1) is\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   correct.\"\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508607\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/362/#p412\">\n    529 U.S. at 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508607\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/362/#p412\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

It has not been so much as endorsed in a majority opinion, let alone relied on as a basis for granting habeas relief. To the extent the unreasonable-refusal-to-extend rule differs from the one embraced in\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   and reiterated many times since,\n   <em>\n    we reject it\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 426,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12706994,12579839\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1697/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 1697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Ultimately, the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   explained the duty of state courts to follow clearly established Federal law, and under what circumstances it would be unreasonable for state courts to not apply the law to a given set of facts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   [S]tate courts must reasonably apply the rules\n   <em>\n    squarely established\n   </em>\n   by this Court's holdings to the facts of each case. The difference between applying a rule and extending it is not always clear, but certain principles are fundamental enough that when new factual permutations arise, the necessity to apply the earlier rule will be beyond doubt. The critical point is that relief is available under \u00a7 2254(d)(1)'s unreasonable-application clause if, and only if, it is\n   <em>\n    so obvious\n   </em>\n   that a clearly established rule applies to a given set of facts that there could be no\n   <em>\n    fairminded disagreement\n   </em>\n   on the question.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 427,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12706994,12579839\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1697/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 1697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations, quotation marks and alterations omitted; emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The foregoing exposition shows why Petitioner's unreasonable-failure-to-extend argument fails for two reasons. First, as already stated above, there is no \"clearly established Federal law\" or \"squarely established\" rules concerning autopsy reports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Second, whatever the clearly established law is, the Circuit Courts disagree about how to apply it to autopsy reports, thus it is not \"so obvious\" on how to apply existing, clearly established Federal law such that there is no \"fairminded disagreement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   In response to the R &amp; R, Petitioner argues several reasons why autopsy reports should be deemed testimonial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 39 \u00b6\u00b6 34-40. Whatever the merits of Petitioner's argument in his objection, based on entries in Black's Law Dictionary and a hypothetical example, the Court must still deny the Petition on Ground Two. Although Black's Law Dictionary is a staple item for judges, lawyers, and law students alike, that venerable lexicon is simply not the authority that this Court must look to in order to resolve the merits of a \u00a7 2254 petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The Trial Court was not required to make any factual findings about Dr. Hood's unavailability to testify because the autopsy reports were not deemed to be testimonial. Absent a determination that the autopsy reports were testimonial, and without a proper hearsay objection requiring resolution, the \"unreasonably determined facts\" argument is meritless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The Court finds that the Petition lacks merit on Ground Two, and therefore denies the Petition on this ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Before leaving this topic, the Court notes the testimony provided by Dr. Collins, and the objections and discussions at trial. There was no actual dispute that both Ms. Labance and Mr. Conner died of gunshot wounds and that Dr. Collins was competent to provide expert testimony to that effect even without the autopsy reports. First, aside from the autopsy reports, the photographs showed the wounds made by the multiple 9mm bullets in each victim, and because the victims were shot at close enough range, the photographs even showed the stippling patterns on the skin of the victims. Second, as an expert, Dr. Collins was capable of testifying about the effects of these gunshot wounds. Third, defense counsel agreed that the cause of death was not in dispute:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   Trial Court: It's clearly a shooting. It's not like it's some questionable medication or something like that. It's clearly a shooting. What's the big deal here?

Therefore, the Court may consider the merits of Petitioner's argument in support of his petition for habeas relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   The merits of Johnston's ineffectiveness claim turn solely on the state law question of whether there was any merit to bringing a motion to dismiss the case with prejudice for failing to comply with Rule 600.

ECF No. 39 \u00b6\u00b6 41-75. First, on whether the claim was properly presented to the PCRA Court, Petitioner argues that \"it would be clearly unfair and prejudicial to deny your Petitioner this claim based upon\n   PCRA counsel's incompetent bald assertion regarding Rule 600 and the Sixth Amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42. Following this description of attorney Cotter's efforts, Petitioner argues that Rule 600, the federal Speedy Trial Act (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203161\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 74 ), and the Sixth Amendment are \"co-extensive ... meaning that they are one [and] the same and a claimed violation of [ Rule 600 ] is a claimed violation of the Sixth Amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203161\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203161\">\n    \u00b6 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Blount\n   </em>\n   , the federal claim here was not presented to the PCRA Court or Superior Court for the following three reasons. ECF No. 23-6, Ex. A-1 at 7. First, Petitioner accepted representation by counsel during the PCRA proceedings. Petitioner did not object when his counsel filed the amended PCRA petition. In-so-doing, Petitioner effectively adopted the amended PCRA petition and disavowed the pro se version (the original PCRA petition). Thus, the only petition before the PCRA Court was the amended PCRA petition because the PCRA Court, like any other court in Pennsylvania, would not consider the pro se-drafted petition alone or in conjunction with the counsel-drafted petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Second, the amended PCRA petition only vaguely alludes to federal constitutional rights. The background to the case and the arguments were premised on state law ( Rule 600 ). The PCRA Court was not presented with a Sixth Amendment-based claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Third, the appeal of the PCRA Court's decision also makes only a glancing referencing to the Sixth Amendment, again in the context of Rule 600. The argument in the brief concerns Rule 600, not the Sixth Amendment. The Superior Court was not fairly notified of a Sixth Amendment-based challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Furthermore, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Blount\n   </em>\n   , neither the PCRA Court nor the Superior Court acknowledged that there even was a Sixth Amendment-based claim to consider.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Placing the matter in context, and under the circumstances of this case, it is plain to see that the state courts were not presented with an ineffective assistance of counsel claim premised on a failure to file a Sixth Amendment challenge. Accordingly, Petitioner's federal claim is unexhausted, and given the time bar, procedurally defaulted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32 at 22 n.14, 24 n.16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Under the AEDPA, the Court may not consider the merits of Petitioner's Sixth Amendment-based federal claim unless Petitioner demonstrates either: 1) cause for the default and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of federal law; or 2) failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Petitioner cannot meet either of these two tests. First, he cannot show cause for the default that stems from some external impediment preventing him or his counsel from constructing or raising the claim. Petitioner has demonstrated that he is capable of making arguments and conducting \"jailhouse lawyering.\" There is no showing that both Petitioner and his counsel were prevented from raising the claim. Second, Petitioner cannot show that there was a fundamental miscarriage of justice. Petitioner has not shown that there is any new evidence at issue that if considered would make it more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Accordingly, the Court cannot review Petitioner's Sixth Amendment-based claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The merits of the Sixth Amendment-based claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Even if the Court were to consider Petitioner's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to raise a Sixth Amendment challenge, his argument lacks merit because the underlying Sixth Amendment challenge would have lacked merit. Accordingly, relief on this ground could not be granted even if the claim was properly before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Sixth Amendment and Rule 600 are not Co-Extensive\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   To be clear on the nature of the Sixth Amendment claim now at issue, the Court rejects Petitioner's argument that Rule 600 and the Sixth Amendment are co-extensive in regard to the United States Constitution's guarantee of the right to a speedy and public trial. While Rule 600 sets a time limit, with various rules for determining how to calculate and assess delays, the Sixth Amendment has no such time limit or rules, and so facially the two are not coextensive.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wells v.
