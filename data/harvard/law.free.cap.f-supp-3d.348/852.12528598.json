Robertson in his individual capacity as well as his official capacity as Commissioner of the Indiana Department of Insurance, claiming that their constitutional rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment were violated by the Department. Plaintiffs seek a Declaratory Judgment and Permanent Injunction as well as money damages. Now pending before the Court are Defendant's Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Standing [Dkt. No. 110]; Motion in Limine (to Exclude Expert Testimony) [Dkt. No. 112]; Motion for Oral Argument on Pending Motions [Dkt. No.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   117], and Motion for Summary Judgment [Dkt. No. 120], all of which were filed on October 16, 2017. Plaintiffs responded on November 22, 2017 [Dkt. No. 129] and Defendant replied on December 13, 2017 [Dkt. No. 144]. The motions are ripe for ruling. For the reasons detailed below, we\n   <em>\n    DENY\n   </em>\n   Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' Complaint for lack of Standing,\n   <em>\n    DENY\n   </em>\n   Defendant's Motion for Oral Argument,\n   <em>\n    GRANT\n   </em>\n   Defendant's Motion in Limine, and\n   <em>\n    GRANT\n   </em>\n   Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Factual and Procedural Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The facts of this case have been set forth in detail in our ruling on Defendant's first Motion to Dismiss (Dkt. No. 69) and were summarized thereafter in our order on Defendant's second Motion to Dismiss (Dkt. No. 80). For convenience, we recount again here the relevant facts underlying our previous orders as well as the procedural history of the case, adding certain facts that have been recently advanced in the parties' current briefing.

(\"American Homeland\"), an Ohio company, performs title searches of real property and sells title insurance policies to protect purchasers against future losses resulting from defects of title. In the title insurance business for over ten years primarily in Ohio, American Homeland entered the Indiana market and began providing these services here some time prior to January 2015. The co-owners of American Homeland, Martin Rink and Josh Yonas, are both licensed attorneys who have invested many years in the insurance business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The IDOI is the Indiana government entity charged with regulating title insurance companies doing business in Indiana. To perform this function, the IDOI employs a team of examiners who conduct audits of insurers' agencies pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2027-1-3.1\">\n    Ind. Code \u00a7 27-1-3.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -10 in order to ensure compliance with Indiana statutes and regulations. Following the audit, the IDOI follows a process for determining fines and penalties for companies found to have violated Indiana law, which includes providing the company with a copy of an examination report within sixty days of the completion of an examination.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2027-1-3.1\">\n    Ind. Code \u00a7 27-1-3.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -10(b). At the time of the events leading up to this litigation, IDOI's staff included Jonathan Handsborough, a non-attorney investigator/auditor, and attorney Joshua Harrison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In or around September 2014 at the direction of Commissioner Robertson, the IDOI began using an internally produced document as guidance for its examiners in exercising its regulatory discretion and determining \"generally reasonable\" fines and penalties to impose on agencies or agents found to have committed violations of Indiana insurance law. Deposition of Joshua Harrison, Dkt. No. 118-1 (\"Harrison Dep.\") at 17-18. IDOI examiners understood that \"in every instance, specific facts and circumstances must be considered to determine an appropriate outcome.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2027-1-3.1\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2027-1-3.1\">\n    at 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As former IDOI Commissioner Randall Evans explained, in conducting an audit an IDOI examiner makes findings, determines the appropriate fines and penalties per applicable guidelines, and then brings the information to the IDOI enforcement division director. Dkt. No. 118-7, Deposition of Randall Evans (\"Evans Dep.\"). Once the agency formulates an Agreed Entry, the examiner drafts the Final Order, which goes to the director, back to the examiner, on to an attorney within the\n   Department, then back to the examiner, and finally to the Commissioner. Deposition of Jonathan Handsborough, Dkt. No. 118-8 (\"Handsborough Dep.\") at 29. Commissioner Robertson's role is to \"review and sign off on [ ] recommendations to him for fines and penalties, revocations of licenses.\" Evans Dep. at 11. Although the Commissioner is the \"final decision-maker,\" as a general matter, he \"tends to follow\" the recommendations of his staff.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2027-1-3.1\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2027-1-3.1\">\n    at 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In January 2015, the IDOI selected American Homeland for audit, pursuant to which Handsborough, then-Senior Insurance Examiner at the IDOI, after reviewing 166 incidents involving American Homeland, discovered hundreds of violations, including deficiencies such as the following: 148 files in which unlicensed employees signed HUD-1 Settlement Statements; numerous outstanding checks that were six months old or older; 145 policies in which the Title Insurance Enforcement Fund Fee was not disclosed on the HUD-1 Settlement Statement as required by law; 93 transactions with excessive lag times for policy remittance; 250 policies that were not submitted for inclusion into the Residential Real Estate Acquisition of Licensee Information and Numbers Database; 139 files in which customers were overcharged for premiums by amounts ranging from $75 and $625, amounts in some instances up to four times the underwriter listed rates; and files lacking the provision of Closing Protection Letters when required.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dkt. No. 118-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Based upon Handsborough's findings, the IDOI determined that American Homeland had engaged in conduct violative of Indiana title statutes and regulations and recommended imposition of a $70,082 fine and a requirement that the company reimburse Indiana consumers in the amount of $42,202.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On February 11, 2015, Handsborough emailed Plaintiffs Rink and Yonas a detailed list of violations along with corresponding fines and penalties. Dkt. No. 118-4 (2/20/2017 Letter). A few days later, Handsborough contacted Yonas and Rink by phone to follow up.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   During the call, Handsborough emphasized that \"the reimbursement piece [of the recommended sanctions] is a must.\" Dkt. No. 118-5 at 2 (Trans. 2/17/2015) He also encouraged Rink and Yonas to request that their internal accountants \"come up with your number then we can actually look at the two and see where we might have discrepancies, so on and so forth,\" acknowledging that he (Handsborough) himself \"is not perfect either.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2027-1-3.1\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After asking for some \"wiggle room\" regarding these penalties for unlicensed individuals signing documents, Yonas said to Handsborough, \"I'm not trying to be confrontational but if this is not negotiable, I can tell you, no Indiana consumer's going to get reimbursed 'cause we're going to close the doors.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2027-1-3.1\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2027-1-3.1\">\n    at 3-4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the response to the remark about Plaintiffs' ability to remain in business, Handsborough said:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Yeah, I mean it's definitely not our intent to put people out of Business. I mean obviously I don't want people out of work and so on and so forth and yeah you guys could go find jobs, but there\n   are people that work there in the office that probably wouldn't be as easy for them as it is for you all. But at the same time please understand if you guys aren't writing this business in Indiana[;] people in Indiana probably would be writing it, so I do see both sides of it in terms of [how] that goes but yeah you've got people there are just trying to feed their family.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2027-1-3.1\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Yonas and Rink apparently heard that comment as proof that the IDOI prefers in-state companies over out-of-state companies like theirs. When asked later about the meaning of this comment, Handsborough stated: \"[M]y intent was that if they don't write the business in Indiana, then the Indiana business will get written.\" Handsborough Dep. at 129. There is no evidence in the record before us that Commissioner Robertson endorsed, let alone knew about this comment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   During the same telephone conversation, Rink and Yonas voluntarily offered to give up their Indiana insurance licenses; Yonas remarked: \"If you guys say, hey, listen, these guys are horrible agents, we don't want them doing business in Indiana, we're willing to surrender our license. I mean, we've had our fill of Indiana. We really don't want Indiana.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2027-1-3.1\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2027-1-3.1\">\n    at 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Handsborough informed Plaintiffs that they had two options going forward: (1) to pay the fine and penalty and also reimburse the customers of Indiana for the amounts they were overcharged; or (2) engage in a hearing with an administrative law judge to review and perhaps challenge the violations uncovered during the audit examination and the corresponding penalties and fines.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2027-1-3.1\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2027-1-3.1\">\n    at 6-7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In terms of lowering the fine amount, Handsborough explained that his \"ability to be flexible\" was limited \"based on the numbers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2027-1-3.1\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2027-1-3.1\">\n    at 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

No. 118-7 at 68. Handsborough agreed with Evans, stating that in his view, \"the violations justif[ied] a higher fine and penalty, and [he] also disagree[d] with the agency determining what their\n   overcharges are going to be and then refunding based on those overcharges.\" Handsborough Dep. at 132.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Yonas alleges that he and Rink later learned that their attempt to engage in negotiations was viewed by IDOI Commissioner Robertson as insulting and that he (Robertson) regarded their hiring of an attorney as harmful to their case. Dkt. No. 118-9 Deposition of Josh Yonas (\"Yonas Dep.\") at 63-67.

Yonas and Rink also agreed to relinquish their Indiana insurance licenses because, as Harrison stated, \"they did not feel that the profits they were receiving were worth the additional burden of continuing to have their license in the state.\" Harrison Dep. at 65. Harrison mailed a proposed Agreed Entry reflecting these terms to Plaintiffs on March 4, 2015. Dkt.

On March 13, 2015, Yonas emailed Harrison, stating: \"We have decided that it is in our best interest to sign.\" Dkt. No. 118-11. The Agreed Entry set forth each type as well as the total number of violations, all of which by this point were well known to Plaintiffs. Rink Dep. at 74-76.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Yonas and Rink signed the Agreed Entry under oath, certifying that they did so \"voluntarily.\" Dkt. No. 118-10 (Agreed Entry).

Deposition of Stephen Robertson, Dkt. No. 118-13, (\"Robertson Dep.\") at 13, 78. Yonas and Rink never spoke to or otherwise communicated directly with Robertson about this agreement. Yonas Dep at 85, 89; Rink Dep. at 65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   This litigation ensued. Plaintiffs filed their Complaint (\"Compl.\") (Dkt.

Given that Plaintiffs agreed to the terms set out in the Agreed Order by \"agree[ing] to pay a fine, agree[ing] to refund customers certain sums and agree[ing] to allow the revocation\n   of their licenses,\" we were unclear as to whether they had suffered a redressible injury sufficient to satisfy constitutional standing requirements. Dkt. No. 69 at 23-24 (referencing the tripartite test to satisfy standing under Article III of the Constitution, including that the court can provide a remedy for the alleged harm). In response to our order, Plaintiffs filed a Memorandum of Law on Standing (\"Standing Memorandum\") [Dkt. No. 75], to which Defendant responded [Dkt. No. 79].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On February 8, 2017, we ruled that Plaintiffs appeared to have successfully established their standing to pursue their Equal Protection claim based on the following claim: that their settlement with the IDOI was the result of IDOI's discrimination against them and coercion, which made the Agreed Order unconscionable and void and thus unenforceable, in violation of their rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution. Dkt. No. 80 at 5. Defendant apparently agreed with this formulation, restating Plaintiffs' claim as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiffs do not dispute that if they're bound by the agreed entry then they lack standing. That point is conceded. They argue that they're not bound by the [settlement] agreement and thus the court may redress their grievance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Dkt. No. 79 at 2. Giving Plaintiffs' claim the benefit of this crafting of their claim, we held that they had established standing to assert their claim under the Equal Protection Clause. Dkt.

After a careful review, we conclude that none of Plaintiffs' factual assertions satisfies their burden to establish the three required elements of an Equal Protection claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Plaintiffs' reliance on a single statement by auditor Handsborough made during a phone conversation with Rink and Yonas (\"if you guys aren't writing this business in Indiana people in Indiana would probably be writing it.\") does not suffice as evidence of the IDOI's preferential treatment of in-state companies. This argument by Plaintiffs requires that Handsborough's statement be taken entirely out of context. As Handsborough clarified, Plaintiffs \"were talking about not needing the business in Indiana, said we don't need the business in Indiana, we have enough business in Ohio, so on and so forth, so I made the statement after they continued to hover on that that if you guys aren't writing the business in Indiana, then someone else will write the Indiana business.\" Handsborough Dep. at 127.

Plaintiffs concede that the failure to follow the Guidelines is not conclusive evidence of discrimination but provides a starting point for showing the IDOI's discriminatory intent. Plaintiffs' Guidelines-based claim hinges entirely on the analysis of Dr. Voss, their hired statistician, who concluded that the data he reviewed discloses that the IDOI has a pattern and practice of disadvantaging out-of-state companies by deviating from the IDOI's Guidelines.

The opinion rendered by Dr. Voss is that: (1) there is a perceptible discrepancy between the Guidelines fines and penalties and those actually imposed; and (2) this alleged discrepancy \"depends upon\" whether the company at issue is an in- or out-of-state entity. Voss Rpt. at 2. Defendant points out, and Plaintiff does not dispute, that Dr. Voss's report did not control for alternative causal variables in the data presented. Specifically, Voss failed to consider the compliance history of the agencies involved in the study, the severity of their conduct, the number of violations committed by the agencies,\n   whether the fines and penalties were negotiated, and he admits that these variables could be relevant in explaining the disparities that he identifies between fines and penalties assessed on in- and out-of-state agencies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Plaintiffs urge us to disregard this deficiency, arguing that the Guidelines themselves control for all relevant favors. To the extent this may be true, Plaintiffs have not shown it to be so. Rather, the conclusion is tied completely to Guidelines and it is not clear that this information is coextensive with other reasonable non-discriminatory explanations. Further, while Plaintiffs point to testimony by the IDOI that the Guidelines were rarely if ever deviated from, there is no explanation for either the causes for the deviation or their impact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People Who Care v. Rockford Board of Education\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11912889\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/111/528/#p537\">\n    111 F.3d 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 537-38 (7th Cir. 1997) (\"a statistical study that fails to correct for salient explanatory variables, or even to make the most elementary comparisons, has no value as causal explanation and is therefore inadmissible in a federal court.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The failure to take into account these significant potential causal variables renders Dr. Voss's testimony unreliable and thus excludable as tendered. It simply does not support an inference of discrimination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Radue v. Kimberly-Clark Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11195778\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/219/612/#p616\">\n    219 F.3d 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 616-617 (7th Cir. 2000) (\"Statistical evidence which fails to properly take into account nondiscriminatory explanations does not permit an inference of discrimination.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Dr. Voss's testimony is unreliable as well because his analysis is methodologically flawed and incomplete. The Court must make a preliminary assessment of an expert's methodology in terms of its scientific validity.\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    509 U.S. at 592-93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As explained in Plaintiffs' expert report: \"Voss compared the expected and actual amount of the fines and penalties imposed. The absolute value of the difference between the fines and penalties value calculated under the guidelines and the actual value of fines and penalties imposed provides a measure of discrepancy from the guidelines.\" Voss Rpt. at 2. This methodology is lacking in that it treats negative disparities as positive, comparing the degree of deviation from the Guidelines for in- versus out-of-state agencies, but without addressing which group was treated more favorably.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Plaintiffs admit that the Voss report measures only the size of the disparities, not whether they result in a prejudicial difference between the amounts of fines and penalties suggested by the Guidelines and those actually imposed. As Defendant points out, many of the deviations identified by Dr. Voss in fact favored out-of-state companies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The level of discretion exercised by the IDOI in setting sanctions is not important unless it resulted in a benefit to either in-or out-of-state companies. Dr. Voss's report would not aid a jury in determining whether any discrepancy between the fines and penalties set by the Guidelines and those actually imposed is based on the residency of the company at issue. Because Dr. Voss's report failed to address these critical factors in his analysis, it must be excluded from consideration. For all these reasons, we grant Defendant's Motion in Limine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Without Dr. Voss's conclusions to buttress their claim of discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause, Plaintiffs are left with only their theory of an entitlement to relief. Without admissible evidence to show that the IDOI discriminated against out-of-state agencies, including Plaintiffs' in violation of the Equal Protection Clause Plaintiffs' official capacity claim against the IDOI cannot survive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Individual Capacity Claim\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The same is true on Plaintiffs' claims against Defendant Robertson, personally. An individual cannot be held liable for a \u00a7 1983 violation unless he directly caused or participated in the alleged constitutional deprivation.\n   <em>\n    Zimmerman v. Tribble\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11232702\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/226/568/#p574\">\n    226 F.3d 568\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 574 (7th Cir. 2000). Defendant asserts that, despite substantial discovery, Plaintiffs have not been able to adduce any evidence to show that the Commissioner participated in the alleged constitutional deprivation by imposing fines and penalties in a discriminatory fashion on Plaintiffs' as an out-of-state company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   It is undisputed that Commissioner Robertson was not a signatory to the Agreed Entry nor was he involved in the audit or negotiations process. In fact, Yonas and Rink fully admit that they had no contact with the Commissioner during any portion of their interactions with the IDOI. Further, IDOI employees Handsborough and Harrison have both testified that the Commissioner never issued any directives or instituted any policy or practice to give preferential treatment to Indiana agencies over out-of-state agencies. Handsborough Dep. at 9; Harrison Dep. at 58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The Commissioner's only involvement in this matter was to sign the Agreed Order incorporating the terms of the Agreed Entry as a final step in the official issuance of the order. As such, he acted as the final decision maker in apparent accord with his lawful authority to accept, reject or modify fines and penalties imposed on title insurance agencies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Plaintiffs point out that in a similar situation but one involving a different procedural posture, this Court held that the authority to make a decision on a license application is sufficient to allow for the survival of a section 1983 claim.\n   <em>\n    Daley v. Grajec\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%202286132\">\n    2007 WL 2286132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *14 (S.D. Ind. 2007). That ruling is inapt in this case and does not preclude our ruling here, primarily because it involved a litigation where no discovery had been conducted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Plaintiffs' only argument in opposition to summary judgment as to this part of their claim is that the Commissioner did not explicitly deny in his deposition testimony the allegation that he discriminated against Plaintiffs as an out-of-state company. When asked if he knew whether the fines and penalties imposed on American Homeland were based on their out-of-state status, Robertson responded that he did not know. Robertson Dep. at 76, 78. Plaintiffs attach undue importance to Roberston's responses that he \"[did not] not recall,\" noting that he advanced that reply more than 35 times during his 91-page deposition. Plaintiffs construe these non-responses as evidence of Robertson's discriminatory motive and intent. That's a stretch, at best. It is more likely that the questions he was being asked dealt with matters occurring below his rank and/or by other IDOI employees outside his knowledge or direct involvement. Without knowing the specific questions that elicited this repeated response, no reliable inference as to its meaning can be drawn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Plaintiffs have now had the benefit of considerable discovery, and no evidence has surfaced to show that the Commissioner participated in the alleged constitutional deprivation. Notably, Plaintiffs continue to ignore his numerous statements under oath that he did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   discriminate against Plaintiffs and does not discriminate against\n   out-of-state actors. Robertson Dep. at 16, 51-52, 74-75, 77-78.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   None of the cases cited by Plaintiffs support their claims that the Commissioner should be held personally liable for damages. These cases do not address the issues similar to the ones before us here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doyle v.
