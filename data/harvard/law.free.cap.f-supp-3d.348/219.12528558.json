Crout (\"the decedent\"), in a tragic helicopter accident on November 15, 2012. (Dkt. 1). Defendant Haverfield International, Inc. (\"Defendant\") removed the action to the Eastern District of New York on April 7, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2). The case was transferred to this Court by Stipulation and Order on September 9, 2014. (Dkt. 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Presently before the Court is Plaintiff's motion to approve the settlement of this action, in accordance with Local Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(2). (Dkt. 156). Plaintiff also seeks resolution of a fee dispute regarding her former counsel, Cellino &amp; Barnes, P.C. (\"Cellino &amp; Barnes\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). For the reasons set forth below, the Court approves the proposed settlement and directs that Cellino &amp; Barnes be paid $7,500 in attorneys' fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On the morning of November 15, 2012, shortly before noon, a helicopter owned by Defendant and carrying the decedent took off on the second of three days of planned flights to inspect power lines in the vicinity of Corning, New York. (Dkt. 65 at 2). About 20 minutes into the flight, the vertical strut on the helicopter's right landing skid struck a wire. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4). The impact caused the helicopter to crash, killing both the pilot and the decedent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). At the time of his death, the decedent was 41 years old, and left the following next of kin: Plaintiff; son Kendale Crout, then 13 years old; daughter Courtney Flahive, then 21 years old; and daughter Erica\n   Westervelt, then 24 years old. (Dkt. 157 at \u00b6\u00b6 5-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Less than a week later, on November 21, 2012, Plaintiff contacted Cellino &amp; Barnes. (Dkt. 164 at \u00b6 4). Attorney Brian Goldstein, who manages aviation-related cases for the firm, thereafter spoke with Plaintiff and obtained background information regarding the helicopter crash, as well as discussed various potential legal issues that could arise in any litigation against Defendant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 4-19). Mr. Goldstein recommended an estate attorney to Plaintiff, and caused initial intake materials to be mailed to her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 21-22). Cellino &amp; Barnes also conducted some \"initial investigation\" related to the helicopter crash. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 23-26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On November 25, 2012, Plaintiff retained Cellino &amp; Barnes to represent both her and her husband's estate in any action for damages arising out of the helicopter crash that killed the decedent. (Dkt. 157 at \u00b6 7). Plaintiff sent Cellino &amp; Barnes additional information regarding herself, the decedent, and their family, all of which was reviewed. (Dkt. 164 at \u00b6 28). Mr. Goldstein also had a conversation with the adjuster assigned to the matter by Defendant's insurers on November 26, 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 32-34). Cellino &amp; Barnes further conducted additional internet searches and preliminary research related to the helicopter crash, as well as exchanged emails with Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 36-44).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On December 3, 2012, Mr. Goldstein spoke with Plaintiff and was advised that she had decided to retain an estate attorney who had assisted with the decedent's father's and grandfather's estates. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 45). However, Plaintiff subsequently elected to use the attorney recommended by Cellino &amp; Barnes when one of her stepdaughters refused to sign a waiver to have Plaintiff voluntarily appointed as the estate representative. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 48). Cellino &amp; Barnes drafted initial discovery requests, as well as a letter to the adjuster assigned to the matter by Defendant's insurers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 51, 53-55). Plaintiff never met anyone associated with the Cellino &amp; Barnes firm during its involvement in her case, and her primary contact was a paralegal with the firm. (Dkt. 157 at \u00b6 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Shortly after retaining Cellino &amp; Barnes, Plaintiff learned that a lifelong friend, Norman R. Colon, Esq., specialized in personal injury and wrongful death litigation, and decided that she wished to be represented by Mr. Colon. (Dkt. 157 at \u00b6 8). Mr. Colon informed Plaintiff that he would associate himself with Faraci Lange LLP (\"Faraci Lange\") in connection with the matter, and Plaintiff consented to that association. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff retained Mr. Colon and Faraci Lange on December 19, 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At Plaintiff's direction, Faraci Lange sent a letter dated December 21, 2012, to Mr. Goldstein, informing him that Mr. Colon and Faraci Lange had been retained by Plaintiff, that Plaintiff was discharging Cellino &amp; Barnes, and that Plaintiff requested that Cellino &amp; Barnes provide \"whatever papers, records and information you've acquired to [Faraci Lange], along with your list of disbursements expended, itemized statement of time and your claimed hourly rate so that the time expended and disbursements incurred may be promptly paid to you.\" (Dkt. 157-5). On December 27, 2012, Stephen E. Barnes, Esq., sent a reply letter to Faraci Lange stating that the firm \"elect[ed] to be compensated on a contingent fee basis based on the proportionate share of the work performed by each firm on the whole case\" and that it \"further elect[ed] that the fee division ... be determined at the conclusion of the case.\" (Dkt. 157-8). Mr. Barnes also stated that the firm had incurred no disbursements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On December 31, 2012, Faraci Lange sent a letter with Plaintiff's affidavit to Cellino &amp; Barnes in which, among other things, Plaintiff indicated that she was directing that Cellino &amp; Barnes provide \"an itemized statement of time expended by Cellino &amp; Barnes and its hourly rate so that the value of your services together with disbursements expended can be promptly paid.\" (Dkt. 157-9 at 2). On January 13, 2013, Mr. Barnes sent a letter to Faraci Lange stating again that the firm \"elected to be compensated on a contingency basis after the case is resolved\" and that it \"decline[d] to be compensated on an hourly basis[.]\" (Dkt. 157-10). On February 12, 2013, Faraci Lange sent a letter to Cellino &amp; Barnes reiterating that Plaintiff was electing to compensate Cellino &amp; Barnes on a\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   basis and that she did not consent to a contingent fee payment to Cellino &amp; Barnes. (Dkt. 157-11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Beginning August 28, 2013, Plaintiff has acted as \"temporary administrator or limited administrator [of the decedent's estate] for purposes of maintaining to their conclusion the actions for the wrongful death and the pain and suffering prior to death of the decedent against [Defendant].\" (Dkt. 158 at \u00b6 5). The instant action was commenced by Plaintiff on behalf of the decedent's estate over one year after retaining the Faraci Lange firm, on January 22, 2014. (Dkt. 1). Extensive litigation followed, including lengthy discovery and the filing of cross-motions for partial summary judgment (Dkt. 36; Dkt. 42), which were resolved by the Court on September 7, 2017 (Dkt. 65). The parties also participated in multiple mediations (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 158 at \u00b6 18), in addition to preparing the case for trial (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ). The case was scheduled to proceed to trial on September 5, 2018. As the trial approached, extensive motions\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   were filed by the parties, including motions addressed to complicated and unique issues as to the applicable standard of care. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 72; Dkt. 75; Dkt. 78; Dkt. 80; Dkt. 83; Dkt. 86; Dkt. 89; Dkt. 95; Dkt. 98; Dkt. 101; Dkt. 104; Dkt. 105; Dkt. 107; Dkt. 111; Dkt. 113). A lengthy pretrial conference was held on August 1, 2018, at which time the Court ruled from the bench on some of the pending motions and reserved decision on others. A further pretrial conference was scheduled to go forward on August 28, 2018, and with the consent of the parties, the Court also scheduled a settlement conference for August 8, 2018. At that settlement conference, after several hours of mediation, the parties agreed to settle the matter for $6,000,000. (Dkt. 155).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Thereafter, on October 24, 2018, Plaintiff filed the instant motion, seeking approval of the proposed settlement and resolution of the fee amount due to Cellino &amp; Barnes. (Dkt. 156). The motion was served on Cellino &amp; Barnes (Dkt. 161), which was directed to file a response by November 15, 2018 (Dkt. 162). On November 14, 2018, a Response Affirmation was filed by Mr. Goldstein, wherein he set forth the tasks allegedly performed by the firm prior to Plaintiff terminating its services. (Dkt. 164). The Response Affirmation contained no information as to the background or qualifications of the Cellino &amp; Barnes personnel who performed work on the case, nor did it contain an estimate of the hours performed on the case, the timekeepers' reasonable hourly rates, or the amount that Cellino &amp; Barnes contended it was due (other than to state the firm was entitled to \"a reasonable percentage of the fee\"). Plaintiff filed a reply on November 26, 2018. (Dkt. 165).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Oral argument was held before the undersigned on December 7, 2018, with Mr. Goldstein appearing on behalf of Cellino &amp; Barnes. (Dkt. 168). At oral argument Mr. Goldstein contended for the first time that the firm had devoted approximately 80\n   hours of time during the less than 30 days it was involved in the case. Mr. Goldstein stated that half of those hours consisted of his time (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   40 hours), which could be broken down to less than 2 hours that he spoke on the phone with the adjuster and Plaintiff, 20 hours that he contended were devoted to drafting \"discovery demands\" that were attached to his Affirmation as Exhibit T, and 18 hours of other miscellaneous tasks. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 164-20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After oral argument, at the Court's request, Faraci Lange submitted to the Court and counsel a copy of the file that was provided by Cellino &amp; Barnes in December 2012, when the firm was discharged. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 170). The \"discovery demands\" were not included in that file. In fact, the file consists primarily of Plaintiff's tax returns that she provided to Cellino &amp; Barnes, and also includes various newspaper articles and other investigatory research. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Approval of the Proposed Settlement\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Local Rule of Civil Procedure 41 provides that \"[a]ctions brought on behalf of decedents' estates shall not be settled or compromised, or voluntarily discontinued, dismissed, or terminated, without application to and leave of Court.\" L. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(2)(A). Local Rule 41 further provides any application for settlement approval must address, among other items, \"the attorney's fees and disbursements to be paid out of the settlement,\" and states that \"[u]pon approving the settlement, attorney's fees, and disbursements, the Judge shall direct the estate representative to apply to the appropriate Surrogate of the State of New York ... for an order of distribution of the net proceeds of the settlement pursuant to Section 5-4.4 of New York's Estate Powers and Trusts Law [\"EPTL\"][.]\" L. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(2)(A), (D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In deciding whether to approve a proposed settlement under Local Rule 41(a)(2), the Court must determine whether \"the proposed settlement is in the best interests of the estate and distributees.\"\n   <em>\n    Durlak v. Medtronic, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 11-CV-234S,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%202838764\">\n    2012 WL 2838764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (W.D.N. Y. July 10, 2012). In making that determination, the Court takes into account \"(1) the circumstances giving rise to the claim, (2) the nature and extent of the damages, (3) the terms of the settlement and amount of attorneys' fees and other disbursements, (4) the circumstances of any other claims or settlements arising out of this same occurrence, and (5) the plaintiff's statement of why [she] believes this settlement is in the best interest of the estate and the distributees.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%202838764\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Court is familiar with the relevant factors in this case based upon its involvement in resolving the partial summary judgment motions and preparing for trial. Here, upon consideration of those factors, the Court finds that the proposed settlement should be approved. The proposed settlement amount of $6,000,000 was negotiated by experienced counsel and with the Court's assistance. The resolution is fair and appropriate, particularly taking into account the costs and inherent risks to both sides of a jury trial and the benefits of reaching a final resolution. Moreover, and as more fully discussed below, the attorneys' fees and disbursements sought are reasonable. Accordingly, Plaintiff's request for approval of the proposed settlement is granted. In accordance with Local Rule 41(a)(2)(D) and EPTL \u00a7 5-4.4, all issues related to the distribution of the net proceeds of the settlement (including the apportionment of the proceeds between damages for wrongful death and damages for conscious pain and suffering) are left for resolution by the Schuyler County Surrogate's Court. Plaintiff is directed to apply to the Schuyler County Surrogate's\n   Court for an order of distribution promptly following entry of this Decision and Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Attorneys' Fees and Disbursements\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Fees and Disbursements to be Paid to Faraci Lange and Mr. Colon\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In connection with the proposed settlement, Faraci Lange and Mr. Colon seek $114,077.61 in disbursements and $1,961,974.13 in attorneys' fees, for a total sum of $2,076,051.74. (Dkt. 158 at \u00b6 25). The Court finds these amounts reasonable. With respect to the disbursements, Faraci Lange and Mr. Colon have provided the Court with an itemized list of such disbursements, all of which were appropriately expended in the litigation of this action. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 158-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   With respect to the issue of attorneys' fees, where Court-approval of a settlement is required pursuant to a local rule, the Court \"must ensure that the allocation of attorneys' fees from the settlement proceeds represents suitable compensation for the attorney for his services[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 159 at \u00b6 11; Dkt. 159-1). Under these circumstances and considering the complexity of this matter, the resources expended, and all other relevant case-specific factors, the Court finds the requested fee reasonable and appropriate.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wells v.

Because Plaintiff never consented to pay Cellino &amp; Barnes a contingent percentage fee after terminating the attorney-client relationship, she cannot be compelled to do so.

Sept. 30, 2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In this case, while Mr. Goldstein has submitted a sworn affirmation setting forth in detail the services Cellino &amp; Barnes performed, the affirmation contains no information regarding the time spent on these services, or the reasonable hourly rates and qualifications of the personnel who performed the work. Cellino &amp; Barnes has also not set forth any suggested value for its services, instead opting solely to incorrectly argue that it is entitled to a contingent percentage fee. The Court further notes that Cellino &amp; Barnes did not keep any contemporaneous time records with respect to the work it performed for Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Moreover, the Court finds incredible the sudden claim made by Mr. Goldstein at oral argument that the firm devoted 80 hours to the case during the less than 30 days it was involved in representing Plaintiff. It is patently unreasonable to believe that the so-called \"discovery demands,\" even with the time necessary for investigatory research, took 20 hours to draft. Many of the demands contain boilerplate language and are repetitive. Just by way\n   of example, the first three demands seek duplicative information (the pilot's \"employment application,\" \"employment file,\" and \"personnel file\"), and the entire document spans just two pages. The undersigned assesses these discovery demands based on her experience, having been in private practice over 20 years before assuming the bench with a primary focus on civil litigation (including personal injury matters). Like many civil litigators, the undersigned spent a significant portion of her practice on discovery-related tasks. Against that background, the Court can safely say that it would not have taken a first-year associate anywhere near 20 hours to draft the \"discovery demands,\" let alone an experienced practitioner allegedly specializing in aviation disasters. Perhaps even more importantly, the file provided by Cellino &amp; Barnes to Faraci Lange did not include the \"discovery demands.\" Thus, Plaintiff received no benefit from the time allegedly incurred by Cellino &amp; Barnes on these \"discovery demands,\" which apparently were memorialized in a memo to file and never disclosed until Cellino &amp; Barnes submitted the memo to the Court as part of its fee request. (Dkt. 164-20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Separate and apart from the time allegedly spent on the discovery demands, the Court is hard-pressed to credit the claims by Mr. Goldstein that he devoted another 20 hours to the file, and the firm incurred 40 additional hours of paralegal time. If those estimates were accurate, assuming rates of $100 for paralegal time and $300 for attorney time, the calculated fee for those 60 hours would amount to $10,000. However, the Court has reviewed the Cellino &amp; Barnes file for this matter (Dkt. 170), and it does not come anywhere near reflecting $10,000 worth of services. In fact, most of the work on the case appears to have been performed\n   <em>\n    by Plaintiff\n   </em>\n   in responding to requests and inquiries from Cellino &amp; Barnes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Plaintiff suggests that a fee award of $5,000 is appropriate in this case, based on an estimate of the time expended and the rates charged. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 165 at 10-11). In particular, Plaintiff argues that, given the minimal work performed in the short time that Cellino &amp; Barnes represented Plaintiff, it is implausible that Cellino &amp; Barnes expended more than 8 hours of attorney time and more than 20 hours of paralegal time, at rates of $300 and $100, respectively.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%202202587\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court does not disagree.\n   <em>\n    At most\n   </em>\n   , based on the Court's review of the file and the sworn statements by Mr. Goldstein (which again, contained no estimate of the hours worked), it is improbable that Cellino &amp; Barnes spent any more than 15 hours of attorney time and 20 hours of paralegal time on the file.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The burden was on Cellino &amp; Barnes to demonstrate the work it incurred on this file. While submitting an affirmation from Mr. Goldstein purporting to detail the work devoted to the case, the firm failed to provide any information regarding the hours worked, normal hourly rates, or background of the personnel involved with the case. The Court believes that it would be well within its discretion to award no fees to Cellino &amp; Barnes. Nonetheless, the firm did provide a minimal amount of services to Plaintiff at the initial stages of this matter. Taking into account the factors set forth above (including in particular the facts that the services rendered were minimal and routine, that the matter (at least in its initial stages) was not usually complex, that Cellino &amp; Barnes has presented no information about the qualifications of the personnel who worked on the matters, and that, based on the Court's review of the record, it is implausible that more than 15 hours of attorney time and 20 hours of paralegal time were expended in connection with this matter), and while acknowledging that Plaintiff initially agreed to pay Cellino &amp; Barnes a contingent fee but\n   terminated that agreement within weeks before any significant work was performed, the Court finds that $7,500 is a reasonable amount to be paid to Cellino &amp; Barnes on a\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   basis. Indeed, it is probably more than the firm is entitled to, but nonetheless in its discretion the Court elects to award $7,500. Accordingly, the Court orders that Cellino &amp; Barnes be paid a fee of $7,500 in full satisfaction of any claim for attorneys' fees arising out of the instant litigation. Cellino &amp; Barnes' fee shall be paid out of the $1,961.974.13 in attorneys' fees awarded to Faraci Lange and Mr. Colon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Finally, the Court notes that even if another method of compensation was mandated in this case-including even a percentage of the total recovery-the Court concludes that it would still award $7,500 to Cellino &amp; Barnes based upon the comparatively negligible value that it provided to Plaintiff in connection with this case when compared to the tremendous effort and significant time devoted to this case by Plaintiff's current attorneys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, it is hereby ordered as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   1.
