At the time of the alleged constructive eviction, Khaled Elhusseiny lived in the basement of the Chatterton Building and paid reduced rent in exchange for helping Subhi with the maintenance of the building.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Janan Dep. at 68. Elhusseiny testified that when Con Ed ultimately came to turn the Khodheirs' electricity back on, Elgahsh came and woke him up and asked him whether he had a key to open the door to the room that contained the electric breakers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Elhusseiny Dep. at 56. Elhusseiny testified that he told Elgahsh that he did not have a key and then called Subhi.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56-57. Elhusseiny stated that Subhi told him that he was in Connecticut and would be back Monday.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57.

Rather, when Subhi returned from Connecticut, he told Elhusseiny that \"the electricity company they didn't come\" and that the Khodeirs \"didn't pay the bill for the electricity.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The argument section of Subhi's brief is devoid of any explanation as to why Subhi's refusal to provide Con Edison with access to the basement would not constitute a constructive eviction. Subhi refers to the statements in Con Ed record as \"inadmissible hearsay,\" Subhi Opp. Mem. at 6, but he gives no explanation as to why this is so. Subhi does not deny that the document itself is admissible as a business record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R.

Nor does he argue that the statements of the landlord recounted in the Con Ed document would not be admissible against him as the statement of a party-opponent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2). Instead, Subhi's brief points only to Elhusseiny's deposition testimony in which Elhusseiny testified that Subhi was in Connecticut at the time Con Ed came.

Instead, there is testimony in which Subhi states that he \"do[es not] remember\" whether \"anyone from Con Edison ask[ed] for access to the basement in connection with the Khodeir family,\" that he does not recall Elgahsh ever asking him to allow Con Ed to enter the basement.

Even if a jury found that Marwan was entirely silent, and merely accepted the arrangement proposed by his father, the fact that Marwan permitted his father to do all the acts that could only be done with the authority of the owner of property-and that Marwan did not protest his father's doing so-would be enough to show that he assented to his father's acting as his agent. As is stated in the Restatement (Third) Of Agency \u00a7 1.03, \"[s]ilence may constitute a manifestation [of assent to agency] when, in light of all the circumstances, a reasonable person would express dissent to the inference that other persons will draw from silence.\n   <em>\n    Failure then to express dissent will be taken as a manifestation of affirmance.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Real%20Prop.%20Tax%20Law%20%C2%A7%20502\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   cmt. b (emphasis added).
