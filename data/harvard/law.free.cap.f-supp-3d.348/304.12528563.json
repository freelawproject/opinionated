Doc. 1, 7-12. For the trade price claims and breach of contract claims, it asks the Court to hold Arazi and Princess jointly and severally liable for \"the principal amount of $616,115.93, together with lost profit, consequential and incidental damages, interest, costs and attorneys' fees, the amount of which will be assessed at trial, but no less than $13,502 as of December 12, 2015.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.

Those six invoices appear on H.Daya's letterhead and include the parties' names and addresses, the payment terms, detailed descriptions of the goods, and the total amount of the sale. H.Daya transmitted the invoices to Arazi \"at or near the time of each sales contract.\" Doc. 34, \u00b6 9.

As a result, the Court grants H.Daya's motion for summary judgment on its goods sold and delivered claim for trade price because the parties do not dispute that a contract existed between the parties, that Arazi accepted the goods, and that Arazi failed to pay the contract price.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendants feebly counter by asserting that \"Plaintiff does not even allege that it attempted to resell any of these goods and, as such, the claim is not ripe and cannot be decided in favor of Plaintiff.\" Doc. 35, 6.

Breach of Contract Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Second, H.Daya raises a breach of contract claim. \"To state a claim in federal court for breach of contract under New York law, a complaint need only allege (1) the existence of an agreement, (2) adequate performance of the contract by the plaintiff, (3) breach of contract by the defendant, and (4) damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Harsco Corp. v.

Instead, he argues that \"Summary Judgment is not warranted because completion of the contract was impossible.\" Doc. 35, 4.

On at least 19 occasions, Arazi acknowledged the debt in communications with H.Daya. Importantly, on December 10, 2015, Arazi affirmed Defendants' indebtedness by personal guarantee wherein he asserted that he \"here by [sic] confirm[ed] that as on today we owe to H.Daya International Co LTD, $629,618.27.\" Doc. 34-16. Subsequently, on March 2 and October 26, 2016, Defendants paid a total of $15,980 to H.Daya through a corporate entity apparently controlled by Arazi.
