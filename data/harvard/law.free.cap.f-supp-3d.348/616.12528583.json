[\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.] Approximately two weeks later, Seum received a letter from Defendant Byerman advising Seum that, at the direction of Defendant Hoover, Seum was permanently banned from the third floor of the Capitol Annex due to offensive comments Seum made in front of employees of the Legislative Research Commission (LRC).

[\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   R. 1.] His four claims include a violation of his right to petition and access, a violation of his right to freedom of speech, First Amendment retaliation, and a violation of his due process rights. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Seum claims that when Defendants Hoover and Byerman, acting in their official capacities, unilaterally and arbitrarily banned Seum from the third floor of the Capitol Annex, they infringed upon Seum's rights to freedom of speech and to petition state lawmakers. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, 10.] Further, Seum alleges the permanent ban served as retaliation for the content of his speech and was \"designed to intimidate the free exercise of Plaintiff's rights.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.] Lastly, Seum argues that the ban, which was imposed arbitrarily and maliciously, violated both his substantive and procedural due process rights because the ban came without either prior notice and an opportunity to be heard on the allegations or any means of review, redress, or appeal. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7, 11-12.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At all relevant times, Defendant Jeff Hoover was the Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives and, in that capacity, served as co-chairman of the LRC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   KRS 7.090(2). Defendant David Byerman served as the LRC Director. According to state law, the LRC is an \"independent agency in the legislative branch of state government, which is exempt from control by the executive branch and from reorganization by the Governor. The Commission shall have the duties, responsibilities, and powers assigned to it or authorized it by the General Assembly, by statute, or otherwise.\" KRS \u00a7 7.090(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendants do not contest that they banned Plaintiff from the third floor of the Capitol Annex, but state the action was taken following an investigation that substantiated an LRC employee's complaint about Seum's comments. [R. 10-1 at 5.] According to Defendants, \"the investigation determined that one or more LRC employees found Plaintiff's use of racially charged language in their private workplace to be inappropriate and offensive conduct related to an individual's race and / or ethnicity.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Defendants state the sanction was imposed \"to avoid any potential future harassment of the LRC's employees by the Plaintiff.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendants move the Court to dismiss the case on a myriad of theories. First, Defendants seek dismissal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) arguing the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction because: (1) Seum lacks standing to bring this suit; (2) this case presents a nonjusticiable political question; (3) sovereign immunity protects Defendants; (4) legislative immunity protects Defendants; and (5) the Noerr-Pennington Doctrine bars Seum's claims. [R. 10-1 at 7-24.] Next, Defendants argue this case should be dismissed, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), because Seum fails to state a claim for which relief can be granted. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-36.] Lastly, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2) and (5), Defendant's maintain they have not been properly served and, therefore, the Court does not have personal jurisdiction over the Defendants.

First, Seum alleges an injury in fact that is both concrete and particularized as well as actual and imminent. Seum charges, and Defendants concede, that Seum was permanently banned from the third floor of the Capitol Annex. [\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   R. 1; R. 10-1 at 5.] This banishment, according to Seum, invaded his constitutionally protected First Amendment rights. [R. 1 at 9-10.] Next, Seum has shown that the banishment is directly tied to the acts of Defendants and, in fact, Seum attached his banishment letter to his Complaint. [R. 1-1.] Lastly, Seum argues that his injury would be redressed by a favorable ruling. [R. 15 at 11 (\"The declaratory and injunctive relief sought from this Court would remove the ban and therefore redress Seum's injury.\").] Because the threshold question of standing presents a facial attack on subject matter jurisdiction and, as such, the Court accepts all allegations in the Complaint as true, the Court finds Seum has meet the requirements to establish standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    2\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendants next argue that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction because this case presents a nonjusticiable political question. [R. 10-1 at 11-14.] Defendants seem to argue that Seum's banishment is a product of its legislatively enacted House Rule 72, which \"restricted access to the private office space on the third floor of the Capitol Annex to members, employees, and authorized guests.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.] However, Seum avers that House Rule 72 does not mandate banishment, and \"the fact that Kentucky's House of Representatives decides to restrict access to its legislators\n   and apply that restriction on an individual ad hoc basis, without process and based on a vague standard of conduct,\" does not present a nonjusticiable political question. [R. 15 at 12.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A nonjusticiable political question is presented when one of the following is \"inextricable from the case\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (1) a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department; (2) or a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it; (3) or the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion; (4) or the impossibility of a court's undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government; (5) or an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made; (6) or the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Baker v.

Importantly, Seum does not challenge the constitutionality or enactment of House Rule 72 or House Resolution 2; Seum simply challenges the imposition of an unequivocal and permanent ban. Thus, the Court is not asked to consider the constitutionality of these legislative Rules. For that reason, the instant case does not present a nonjusticiable political question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendants cite as support\n   <em>\n    Consumers Union of U.S., Inc. v.

In considering the four factors articulated above and taking all facts alleged in the Complaint as true, the Court determines that the ban is not a legislative act. First, the ban was an ad hoc decision. The decision to ban Seum allegedly was made following an investigation, but the ban was directed at and affected only Seum; it did not further the formulation of any policy. Second, the ban applies only to Seum and not to the public at large. While the House Rule, under which Defendants claim to have implemented the ban, applies to the public, Seum does not challenge the constitutionality of the Rule; he challenges the ban. Third, banning a specific individual from an area of the Capitol Annex is not formally legislative in character. And, lastly, the act of banning Seum bears no hallmarks of traditional legislation. Moreover, Defendants' reported subjective intent of protecting LRC employees from any future harassment by Seum is immaterial to this analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Canary\n   </em>\n   , 211 F.3d at 329. Provided that this 12(b)(1) motion presents a facial attack on subject-matter jurisdiction, which mandates the Court to take the facts as alleged as true, the Court finds that the act in question was not legislative in nature and, therefore, Defendants have not carried the burden of establishing legislative immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    5\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The last 12(b)(1) argument asserted by Defendants is that Seum's claims are barred by the Noerr-Pennington doctrine. [R. 10-1 at 22-24.] Defendants contend that they \"have an equal right to participate in the legislative process without liability....\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24.] They reason that \"although [Seum] has a right to petition the government, he cannot bring claims against the Speaker or any other legislator, or against the LRC, or the Director, because he fears that his advocacy will not be effective.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23.] This misinterprets Seum's claims. Seum alleges constitutional infringement of his rights to petition and access the government and his right to free speech. He makes no allegations related to the success or ineffectiveness of his advocacy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Further, the Court is unclear as to how exactly Defendants claim the Noerr-Pennington doctrine protects them. As the Sixth Circuit has stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Noerr-Pennington\n   </em>\n   Doctrine allows businesses to combine and lobby to influence legislative, executive, or judicial branches of government or administrative agencies without antitrust or \u00a7 1983 liability, because the First Amendment's right of petition protects such activities. The doctrine immunizes parties from liability under antitrust laws or \u00a7 1983 for actions taken when petitioning authorities to take official action, even where the petitioning activity has the intent or effect of depriving another of property interests, except under 'very limited circumstances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    Knology, Inc. v.

[\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26.] As a non-public forum, Defendants state, Seum's restriction need only satisfy a rational-basis test, that is the restriction must be viewpoint neutral and reasonable under the circumstances.

He meets that standard. In his Complaint, Seum states, \"The Capitol Annex is a public state government building, the third floor of which houses administrative offices and meeting rooms for legislators and members of legislative subcommittees.\" [R. 1 at 4.] He further alleges,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   The third floor of the Capitol Annex is open to the public to allow access to legislative representatives for the purpose of meeting with those representatives to present political thoughts and opinions designated to affect proposed legislation. Plaintiff Seum has a general right of access to governmental property opened and generally made available to the public for advocating political positions and ideas to government lawmakers. Plaintiff's presence on the third floor of the Capitol Annex on February 17, 2017 as well as many other occasions, was for the purpose of petitioning his government representatives, advocating a political cause, and the free communication of political thoughts and opinions on matters of public opinion and was therefore protected activity under the United States and Kentucky Constitutions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.

[R. 10-1 at 30.] To establish a claim of First\n   Amendment retaliation a plaintiff must prove \"(1) he engaged in protected conduct, (2) the defendant took an adverse action that is capable of deterring a person of 'ordinary firmness from continuing to engage in that conduct,' and (3) 'the adverse action was motivated at least in part by the [plaintiff's] protected conduct.' \"\n   <em>\n    Hill v.

If that showing is made, the burden shifts to the defendant to show that the same action would have been taken absent plaintiff's exercise of protected conduct.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11102576\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/250/1032/#p1037\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The first question is whether Seum engaged in protected conduct. Defendants' vehemently contend he did not. [R. 10-1 at 30.] However, Seum argues he was fundamentally engaged in protected, political speech. [R. 15 at 30-31.] Seum's Complaint states that as a part of his advocacy for medicinal marijuana he \"often relates information about Harry Anslinger, the first commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics,\" who is attributed with the following quote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   Most marijuana smokers are colored people, jazz musicians, and entertainers. Their satanic music is driven by marijuana, and marijuana smoking by white women makes them want to seek sexual relations with Negroes, entertainers, and others. It is a drug that causes insanity, criminality, and death-the most violence-causing drug in the history of mankind.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   [R. 1 at 4.] According to Seum, \"[a] recognized part of Anslinger's approach to advocating the criminalization of cannabis was an appeal to racism.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] The Court agrees with Seum that, in context, his speech is protected political speech.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hughes v.

Again, Defendants claim they did not. [R. 10-1 at 30-31.] Defendants' argument is that Seum's \"generalized statements of 'irreparable harm' with nothing more do not establish\" the requisite adverse action to sustain a retaliation claim. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32.] Seum disputes this claim and states, \"[p]ermanently banning Seum from the third floor of the Capitol Annex essentially prevents him from any further political advocacy there.... It is also clear that the ban would chill the First Amendment expression of an ordinary person.\" [R. 15 at 31.] Seum's Complaint states \"the ban has the effect of restricting Plaintiff's access to legislators and members of the General Assembly for the purposes of petitioning the state on matters of public and political concern....\" [R. 1 at 8.] Taking as true the facts alleged in the Complaint, Seum has sufficiently pled the requisite retaliation adverse action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The last question to be considered is whether Seum can show that the adverse action was motivated at least in part by his protected conduct. While Defendants contest even this prong of the test, Seum clearly makes that connection. Seum attached to his Complaint Defendants' letter banning him from the third floor of the Capitol Annex. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 1-1.] That letter indicates that the unequivocal and permanent\n   ban was \"in response to offensive comments that [Seum] made on February 17, 2017 in front of staff of the Legislative Research Commission.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] The letter further explains Seum's allegedly offensive language, which mirrors almost identically the language Seum attributes to Anslinger in Seum's purported advocacy for medicinal marijuana. [\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   R. 1-1,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   R. 1 at 4.] Accepting Seum's version of the facts, Seum has shown that the ban was, at least in part, motivated by his advocacy speech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Because the Court finds that Seum sufficiently plead the elements of a First Amendment retaliation claim, the burden shifts to Defendants to show they would have ban Seum absent his protected political speech. Defendants make no effort to do so. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 10-1 at 30-32.] As such, Seum's First Amendment retaliation claim will survive this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    3\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The last 12(b)(6) argument Defendants assert is that Seum failed to state a claim that his Fourteenth Amendment due process rights, as well as his state-equivalent rights, have been violated. [R. 10-1 at 32-36.] The Fourteenth Amendment prohibits states from \"depriv[ing] any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law....\" U.S. CONST. amend. XIV, \u00a7 1.

[R. 15 at 33-34.] For support, Seum looks to\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. City of Cincinnati\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11427777\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/310/484/\">\n    310 F.3d 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 2002), which he cites for the proposition \"that\n   where analysis under a particular amendment does not provide the appropriate analytical framework for fully evaluating the constitutionality of a particular claim, the more general substantive due process analysis is applied.\" [R. 15 at 34.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Seum's argument fails because his \u00a7 1983 First Amendment claims, which have already been analyzed by the Court and which will survive dismissal, do in fact provide the appropriate analytical framework for fully evaluating his claims. As\n   <em>\n    Brandenburg\n   </em>\n   counsels, \"almost all \u00a7 1983 claims rely on the substantive component of the Due Process Clause because it is through that vehicle that fundamental rights are incorporated against the states.\"\n   <em>\n    Brandenburg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1269465\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/253/891/\">\n    253 F.3d at 900\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). Nothing about Seum's First Amendment claims so shocks the conscience that the facts alleged would lend to a stand-alone substantive due process claim. As such, because the substantive arguments Seum sets forth in his First Amendment and retaliation allegations are properly asserted through a \u00a7 1983 claim, his substantive due process claim is duplicative and should be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    b\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Defendants also challenge Seum's procedural due process claim by arguing Seum did not have a liberty or property interest taken from him and, therefore, was not entitled to any specific pre-ban process. [R. 10-1 at 33-34.] \"Procedural due process imposes constraints on governmental decisions which deprive individuals of 'liberty' or 'property' interests within the meaning of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    Mathews v.

[\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   R. 1.] The unequivocal and permanent ban imposed on Seum was sufficiently individualized to trigger due process protections.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kaminski v.

Here, Defendants claim they instituted an investigation into the LRC employee's complaint that Seum used offensive language [\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 10-1 at 5], but Seum pleads facts sufficient to suggest he was never afforded notice or an opportunity to be heard on that complaint prior to his banishment [\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 1 at 7-8]. The banishment letter Seum received from Defendants suggests the act of banishing Seum was intentional. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 1-1.] Thus, Seum has sufficiently plead facts to support a claim of procedural due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    c\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Defendants' final 12(b)(6) argument opposes Seum's claim that Defendants abridged his privileges or immunities\n   under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Section 2 of the Kentucky Constitution. [R. 10-1 at 34-36.] In his Response, Seum implicitly concedes this point, but maintains his due process allegations under Section 2 of the Kentucky Constitution should survive the motion to dismiss. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 15 at 37.] Nothing in Seum's Response urges the Court to allow his privileges and immunities claims to proceed. [\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   R. 15.] Thus, the Court will dismiss these claims, to the extent they were plead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    4\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Finally, while Defendants initially moved, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2) and (5), to dismiss the case for a lack of personal jurisdiction, that argument has become moot. On November 1, 2017, five days after Defendants filed their Motion to Dismiss, Defendants were served with a copy of the summons and complaint in this case. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 12 ; R. 13.] The Court therefore finds that it has personal jurisdiction over Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    III\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In this \u00a7 1983 case, the Court finds it has subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction to hear the case. Plaintiff Seum has standing to bring his claims - which do not present a nonjusticiable political question - before the Court, and Defendants are not protected by sovereign immunity, legislative immunity, or the Noerr-Pennington doctrine. When accepting the facts in the Complaint as true, Seum has properly plead most of his claims; those claims will survive early dismissal. However, he has not plead sufficient facts to support claims of either substantive due process violations or privileges and immunities violations; those claims will be dismissed. While the Court acknowledges certain factual disputes remain regarding potentially dispositive issues, fair disposition of this case requires discovery to proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Accordingly, and the Court being otherwise sufficiently advised, it is hereby\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   1.
