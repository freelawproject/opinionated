Nevertheless, Plaintiff's pro-se status does not excuse him from complying with procedural and substantive law.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       Ahmed v.

(Docket No. 1 \u00b6 65).\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-25\">\n      Plaintiff claims that he was admitted to University of Massachusetts Memorial Medical Center pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws c. 123, \u00a7 12. Defendant notes that the law states, in relevant part: \"At any time during such period of hospitalization, the superintendent may discharge such person if he determines that such person is not in need of care and treatment.\" Mass. Gen. Laws c. 123, \u00a7 12(c). Defendant Metro's entire argument for why Plaintiff's claim should be dismissed is that \"Plaintiff states that Dr. Shukair, his treating and admitting physician, determined that Plaintiff could be released from the hospital.\" (Docket No. 22, at 3-4). According to Defendant Metro, \"Dr. Shukair's decision to voluntarily discharge Plaintiff, whether correct or not, unequivocally terminated [Defendant Metro's] obligations, if any, to restrain and prohibit Plaintiff from leaving.\"\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at 4.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-26\">\n      Defendant argues that paragraphs 74 and 79 of Plaintiff's complaint demonstrate that Plaintiff was discharged. It is not entirely clear from those paragraphs, however, that Dr. Shukair in fact discharged Plaintiff. Plaintiff argues that Dr. Shukair \"caus[ed] a discontinuation of access to programs\" (Docket No. 1 \u00b6 74) and \"declined to confirm the need for a continuation of treatment.\"\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      \u00b6 79. Further, the medical records attached to and incorporated in Plaintiff's complaint belie Defendant Metro's argument. According to Nurse Grzyb, Dr. Botsaris discharged Plaintiff approximately one hour\n      <em>\n       after\n      </em>\n      Plaintiff escaped from the hospital. (Docket 1-1, at 18).\n      <footnotemark>\n       1\n      </footnotemark>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-28\">\n      For the reasons stated above, Defendant Metro's motion to dismiss (Docket No. 21) is\n      <em>\n       <strong>\n        <em>\n         denied\n        </em>\n       </strong>\n      </em>\n      .\n     </p>\n    </p>\n   </opinion>\n  </casebody>\n </body>\n</html>\n"
