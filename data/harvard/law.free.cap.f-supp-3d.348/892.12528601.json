PETERSON, District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Steven Scott Rogers fell while skiing and suffered a serious brain injury. Scott and his wife, plaintiff Tracy Rogers, contend that Scott's helmet, made by defendant K2 Sports, was defectively designed and that the defect was a cause of his injury. They have sued K2 for negligence, strict product liability, and breach of warranty. Dkt. 32. Tracy also claims loss of consortium as a result of her husband's injuries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   K2 denies that the helmet was defective, contending instead that the helmet was the wrong size and that Scott had not properly fastened it, and that he was injured by direct contact with the ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   K2 moves for summary judgment on all of plaintiffs' claims. Dkt. 102. Plaintiffs oppose, and they move to strike defendant's experts' opinions that the helmet moved out of position when Scott fell. Dkt. 139.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At the heart of this case is a straightforward dispute about the role of the helmet in Scott's injury. The court will limit the testimony of K2's experts about how the injury occurred because some of those opinions are too speculative. But that still leaves genuine disputes about the fit of the\n   helmet and whether it was properly designed, so K2's motion for summary judgment will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   UNDISPUTED FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following facts are undisputed except where noted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Scott wore a K2 Phase 08 helmet while skiing with his stepson Coby at the Afton Alps Ski Area in Washington County, Minnesota, on New Year's Eve 2015. Around 8:40 p.m., Scott and Coby skied down a beginner's run called Nancy's Nursery. Scott fell about halfway down the hill near some small mounds called \"rollers.\" Coby was in front of Scott and did not witness the fall. Another skier did witness the fall, but he was not able to recall any details about it, except that the fall did not seem unusual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The fall left Scott unconscious and bleeding from his left ear. Scott was taken by ambulance to a hospital, where doctors conducted tests including a CT scan of Scott's head. The accident caused brain hemorrhages and fractured Scott's skull, left clavicle, and numerous ribs along Scott's left side. As a result of permanent brain damage caused by the accident, Scott now lives at a VA hospital where he receives round-the-clock care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The K2 helmet was certified as compliant with the standards of ASTM International, which is an organization that develops and publishes technical standards for a wide range of products.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Compliance with ASTM standards is voluntary. The K2 helmet has three layers. The exterior layer is a hard-plastic shell. The shell is lined with an Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) energy-attenuating layer, which is supposed to absorb and dissipate shock from a blow to the head. The third layer is a comfort liner that can be adjusted to fit on the user's head. After Scott's accident, the lower left rear of the exterior shell was cracked. And, in the same area, the shock-absorbing EPS layer was flattened, and chunks of the EPS were missing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The parties sharply dispute what happened to the helmet when Scott fell. K2 contends that the helmet was improperly fit and not properly fastened. K2's theory is that as Scott fell, his helmet shifted out of place and the left posterior region of his head was exposed and directly hit the ground. Dkt. 144, \u00b6 38. K2 contends that the helmet only partially protected Scott's head, and that the point of impact on the helmet was below the \"test line,\" which is the lower limit of the area that is supposed to be protected under ASTM standards. K2 also contends that pictures from the day of the accident show that Scott failed to tighten the helmet's chinstrap.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that the helmet did not actually meet ASTM standards. Plaintiffs' theory is that the bottom rear of the helmet was excessively tapered at the test line. As a result of the tapering, the helmet did not afford sufficient protection against a blow such as the one Scott suffered. Plaintiffs also contend that the helmet was the right size for Scott.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   K2 moves for summary judgment on the grounds that plaintiffs cannot prove that Scott's K2 helmet was defective or that it caused Scott's injuries. In connection with their opposition to K2's motion, plaintiffs move to strike parts of K2's expert evidence. The court begins with plaintiffs' challenge to the expert evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

P. David Halstead\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   P. David Halstead is the Technical Director of Southern Impact Research Center. Halstead conducted a series of drop tests to try to replicate the damage on Scott's helmet, and thereby to determine the amount of force that the helmet and Scott experienced at the time of Scott's fall. Dkt. 110, at 6. Halstead offers two main opinions: (1) that the helmet was not defective, and (2) that the helmet was out of place at the time of the accident. Plaintiffs move to strike three aspects of Halstead's report. Dkt. 137, at 6-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   First, plaintiffs move to strike Halstead's opinion that the helmet was out of position at the time of the accident. Halstead expresses that opinion in various forms:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 \"It is my opinion that Mr. Rogers' injuries were caused by complex fall kinematics that resulted while his helmet was out of position (rotated slightly to the left and possibly higher on the right) exposing his temporal bone in the area he sustained the mastoid fracture.\" Dkt. 110, at 7.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 \"Mr. Rogers sustained his injuries when his partially helmeted head, with the mastoid area of the temporal bone exposed, made contact with a somewhat compliant surface such as snow substantially similar to the snow measured at Afton Alps.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 \"The skull fracture is a result of functionally direct contact with the impact surface to the mastoid area.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \u2022 \"Given the test results had the helmet been in position the skull fracture almost certainly would not have occurred.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The court agrees with plaintiff that Halstead has not shown that this opinion is rationally connected to underlying data.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Halstead conducted a series of drop tests using K2 Phase 08 helmets, the same model as Scott's helmet.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. Under the ASTM standards, a helmet must keep the user's head from accelerating more\n   than 300 g, meaning that the force of impact on the skull is equivalent to 300 times the force of gravity or less. Dkt. 124-13, at 3. Although these drop tests were not testing for ASTM compliance, Halstead used 300 g as a threshold for the helmet's effectiveness. Halstead conducted eleven tests by dropping helmets on to a modular elastomer programmer (MEP), a rubber pad that is somewhat harder than packed snow. Dkt. 110, at 6. None of the drops resulted in an acceleration of more than 181 g or damaged the helmet in a way that resembled the damage to Scott's helmet. So Halstead conducted three more tests using a harder, steel anvil.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. One of these drops did crack the helmet, but the damage was still not as severe as Scott's helmet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Halstead opined that because his tests could not replicate the damage to Scott's helmet, Scott's helmet must not have been in place on Scott's head at the time of the accident.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9. Halstead did not conduct any follow-up testing; he did not, for example, try dropping the helmet while it was out of place on the headform or try dropping the helmet without using a full-sized headform. Instead, Halstead scanned both the accident helmet and the most severely damaged test helmet with a laser.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After eyeballing the results of the laser scan, Halstead again concluded that the damage did not match and that therefore the helmet was not in place at the time of the accident. He opined specifically that the helmet rotated to the left, exposing the area where Scott's skull was fractured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Two factors that a court may consider regarding the admissibility of expert testimony are whether the expert \"unjustifiably extrapolated from an accepted premise to an unfounded conclusion\" and whether \"the expert has adequately accounted for obvious alternative explanations.\"\n   <em>\n    Gopalratnam\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265991\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/877/771/#p781\">\n    877 F.3d at 788\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Fuesting v. Zimmer, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8931879\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/421/528/#p534\">\n    421 F.3d 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 534-35 (7th Cir. 2005) ). Both factors support striking Halstead's opinion here. When Halstead's test results failed to re-create the damage to Scott's helmet, Halstead had a basis for concluding that Scott's fall was in some way atypical. But he had no foundation to then extrapolate from these results that the helmet was therefore out of position. And he was even less justified in hypothesizing on the helmet's exact orientation during the accident. Halstead did not confirm his hypothesis through additional testing, nor did he address alternative explanations for the damage to Scott's helmet, such as the existence of a manufacturing defect or a weakening of the helmet through multiple impacts. And his use of laser scanning provided no additional details to support his hypothesis. Halstead simply picked one possible explanation for the test results and then assumed it was true. Halstead concedes that he is not an expert in the \"full body kinematics\" that are critical to understanding how Scott was injured. Dkt. 110, at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Second, plaintiffs move to strike Halstead's opinion regarding the speed and force of impact on Scott's head at the time of the accident:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Based on biomechanical testing the likely impact speed of his head to the surface was 13-14 mph or higher, head accelerations were in the range of 170 g - 220 g with angular acceleration between 7000-8000 rad/sec.\n   <sup>\n    2\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Dkt. 110, at 7. The court will strike this opinion. Rule 702 places the responsibility on the expert to explain how his methodologies support his opinions.\n   <em>\n    Metavante\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3778626\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/619/748/#p761\">\n    619 F.3d at 761\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although not explicitly stated, Halstead appears to have adopted these numbers from the results of his tests on the MEP pad. Dkt. 110, at 6. But as Halstead emphasized in his report, the tests on the MEP pad were unable to\n   replicate Scott's accident. It is not clear why the speeds and forces of impact must nonetheless be correct, and Halstead does not provide an explanation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Third, plaintiffs move to strike Halstead's opinion regarding the helmet's ability to protect against high-speed impact:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   \"As the biomechanical testing shows the helmet, at its thinnest, well below the test line is able to take an impact at nearly 14 miles per hour with a hemi anvil and still remain under 300g.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. The court will not strike this opinion, which is based on the test results. Plaintiffs suggest that Halstead is not qualified to provide \"biomechanical engineering opinions,\" but in their reply brief, plaintiffs concede that Halstead is an experienced technician who is qualified to conduct the type of drop testing he performed. Dkt. 151, at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The bottom line is that the court will consider Halstead's drop testing analysis, but it will not consider his testimony that the helmet was out of place at the time of the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Irving Scher, Ph.D., P.E\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Irving Scher is a biomechanical engineer at Guidance Engineering and Applied Research. Scher's report includes two separate sets of conclusions that are relevant to summary judgment. First, Scher used computer models to determine the fit and looseness of the helmet that Scott wore. Second, Scher conducted a biomechanical engineering analysis to determine the \"kinematics\" of the accident-the movement of Scott's body and ski equipment according to the laws of physics. Plaintiffs move to strike both sets of conclusions. Dkt. 137, at 7-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Helmet fit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Scher opines that the helmet was poorly fit and that it was loose enough to move out of place:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   \u2022 \"Mr. Roger's head circumference at the hat line is approximately 57 centimeters. Because the head size recommended for the subject helmet ranges from 59 to 62, Mr. Rogers' head was at or below the lower end of the subject helmet's size.\" Dkt. 107, \u00b6\u00b6 10-12.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   \u2022 \"At the level of the helmet brim there was at least 2 to 4 centimeters of free space between Mr. Rogers' head and the helmet in the anterior-posterior direction, and the helmet had space to rotate 20 degrees clockwise and counter-clockwise.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   \u2022 \"The subject helmet was not snugly fitted to Mr. Rogers' head.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   These opinions are rationally connected to the reasonably reliable data that Scher considered; the court will not strike them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Scher created a 3D computer model of Scott's head from the CT scans on the night of Scott's accident. Dkt. 112, at 15. Using this model, Scher calculated circumference of Scott's head as 57 centimeters. Because the helmet that Scott purchased was recommended for head circumferences of 59 to 62 centimeters, Scher opined that Scott's helmet was one size too large. Scher scanned an exemplar K2 helmet of the same size as Scott's helmet. Within his computer modeling software, Scher placed the 3D model of the helmet on the 3D model of Scott's head. Scher determined that there was at least 2.25 centimeters of free space between Scott's head and the interior of the helmet, and that with this extra space the helmet could freely rotate 20 degrees clockwise and counterclockwise. Finally, Scher viewed photographs of Scott on the day of the accident and determined that Scott's chin strap was \"loose.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16. Scher's analysis of the helmet's fit led Scher to conclude that it was possible for the helmet to move out of position and\n   expose a portion of the posterior region of Scott's head.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that Scher's analysis is unreliable because Scott's head actually has a circumference of 60 centimeters, not 57 centimeters. Plaintiffs' measurement comes from Tracy's declaration that she measured Scott's head with a tape measure. Dkt. 123, \u00b6\u00b6 7-8.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Neither party adduces evidence showing that the other party's measurement is manifestly incorrect, so the size of Scott's head is a matter of genuine dispute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Such a dispute does not render Scher's opinion inadmissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Kinematics analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Scher also offered opinions about how Scott fell and how he was injured, which Scher refers to as a \"kinematics\" analysis. He expresses those opinions as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   \u2022 \"Mr. Rogers likely caught his ski edge, fell forward and leftward while rotating clockwise and continuing downhill, and contacted the left, posterior region of his helmeted head on his acromioclavicular joint and proximal humerus, a very rigid area of hard-packed snow, or both.\" Dkt. 112, at 36.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   \u2022 \"Because the helmet was not snug on Mr. Rogers's head and he did not adjust appropriately the chin strap, the subject helmet was able to (and did) move out of position during Mr. Rogers's fall and subsequent head impact.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   \u2022 \"No snowsport helmet would be able to prevent the injuries sustained by Mr. Rogers in the subject accident.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   \u2022 \"The subject helmet rotated axially counterclockwise and rightwards on Mr. Rogers' head during his fall such that his helmet was out of place and exposed a portion of the left posterior region of his head just prior to impact.\" Dkt. 107, \u00b6 9.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   \u2022 \"Mr. Rogers failed to properly tighten the subject helmet's chin strap, which allowed the subject helmet to move out of position as he fell.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   \u2022 \"Immediately before Mr. Rogers' head contacted the ground, the subject helmet moved out of position, causing the point of impact to be below the helmet's test line.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   \u2022 \"In my professional opinion, any snow sport helmet with a similar fit and loose chin strap on Mr. Rogers' head would have similarly moved relative to his head in the subject fall.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The court will not consider these opinions because they are too speculative: there is simply not enough information about how Scott fell to support this analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Based on the assumption that \"catching an edge\" is a common occurrence among skiers, and the location and severity of Scott's injuries, Scher created a computer simulation using the computer program MADYMO. Scher ran several simulations in MADYMO, using different estimates for Scott's speed and the conditions on the ski slope.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29. He tweaked the variables in the simulation until he was able to create a simulation that could result in injuries similar to Scott's injuries.

Under the first theory, plaintiffs must show that the helmet had a design defect that caused Scott's injuries to be worse than they would have been without the defect.

But plaintiffs' expert, Mariusz Ziejewski, provides evidence sufficient to support a reasonable jury verdict that a foreseeable risk of harm could have been reduced by the adoption of a reasonable alternative design. Ziejewski's report states that due to tapering at the edge, the K2 helmet does not provide the protection required by ASTM standards when struck in the lower back. Dkt. 116; Dkt. 124-7. Ziejewski further states that other helmets without this tapering do provide the protection required by ASTM. This makes the K2 helmet\n   more dangerous than helmets from K2's competitors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   K2 argues that Ziejewski's report is insufficient to establish a design defect because the report does not specifically opine that the design of the K2 helmet rendered it \"not reasonably safe\" or \"unreasonably dangerous.\" Dkt. 103, at 12. But an expert does not need to parrot the exact language used in the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Zimmer Nexgen Knee Implant Prod. Liab.

K2 argues that Ziejewski instead tested the K2 helmet according to current ASTM testing procedures. Ziejewski concedes that he used the updated procedures, but he argues that it is more accurate than the old testing standard. Dkt. 124, \u00b6\u00b6 22-23. Plaintiffs need to show only that a reasonable alternative design would have eliminated the risk of harm.

The location of the helmet at the time of the accident is sharply and genuinely disputed, so that theory provides no basis for granting summary judgment to K2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Nevertheless, K2 contends that even if the helmet was in place, it is still entitled to summary judgment because no helmet could have prevented Scott's injury because preexisting injuries made him particularly vulnerable. This theory provides no basis for granting summary judgment to K2 either.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   K2 adduces some evidence that Scott had suffered previous head injuries. Dkt. 144, \u00b6\u00b6 45-50. But K2 has scant evidence that the prior injuries were serious ones. More important, K2 does not adduce any evidence to support the outlandish statement in its brief that \"no helmet would have been able to prevent the injuries he sustained on December 31, 2015.\" Dkt. 103, at 10. K2's own proposed findings of fact undermine this idea:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   Had Mr. Rogers not been wearing a helmet, his brain injury would have been at least as severe if not more severe than it was on December 331, 2015, leaving\n   him with worse permanent residuals or traumatic brain injury, or could have even adversely impacted his survival.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Dkt. 144, \u00b6 51. K2 also says that plaintiffs' expert Ziejewski \"concedes that an alternative design would not have prevented Mr. Rogers from suffering a traumatic brain injury or a subdural hematoma in the subject incident.\" Dkt. 103, at 11 (citing Dkt. 144, \u00b6 28). As plaintiffs point out, K2 has grossly misstated the substance of Ziejewski's deposition testimony in this proposed fact. Ziejewski testified that a properly designed helmet would have prevented a subdural hematoma, a level 4 injury. Ziejewski acknowledged that even with a properly designed helmet, \"mild traumatic brain injury\" was still a possible or likely outcome. Dkt. 122, at 28:21-29:25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Defective Instructions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Plaintiffs' alternative theory is that if the helmet slipped out of place before impact, it slipped because of defective instructions. Under Wisconsin's product liability statute, a product is defective because of inadequate instructions or warnings if \"foreseeable risks of harm posed by the product could have been reduced or avoided by the provision of reasonable instructions or warnings by the manufacturer and the omission of the instructions or warnings renders the product not reasonably safe.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20895.047\">\n    Wis.

Plaintiffs contend that any mistake by Scott in tightening his chinstrap was caused by the fitting instructions included with the helmet. The helmet's instructions state that the helmet should be snug and that after adjusting the straps and pads, \"the skin on your forehead should move with the helmet.\" Dkt. 145, \u00b6 10. The instructions do not include specific directions on the tightness of the chinstrap. A reasonable jury could find that this instruction does not warn consumers that they need to tighten the chinstrap in addition to adjusting the pads and comfort liner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   K2 contends that plaintiffs are required to adduce expert testimony regarding the effectiveness of product warnings. Dkt. 103, at 15. But K2 cites no case in which expert testimony was required to show that a warning was defective.

Second, K2 contends that there is no privity of contract between plaintiffs and K2.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co. v.

Loss of consortium claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   K2 moves for summary judgment on Tracy's loss of consortium claim because it is derivative of Scott's injuries.

Plaintiffs' amended complaint does not include \"loss of consortium\" as an independent cause of action, but it does include allegations that \"Plaintiff Tracy Rogers ... has been deprived of the services, society, companionship and consortium of Scott Rogers as a proximate result of his enhanced injuries.\" Dkt. 32, \u00b6 23.

Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/\">\n    556 U.S. 662\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/\">\n    173 L.Ed.2d 868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Plaintiffs' allegations are sufficient to state a claim. Even post-\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   , Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8 requires only \"adequate notice of the scope of, and basis for\" the asserted claims.\n   <em>\n    Avila v. CitiMortgage, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4340981\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/801/777/#p783\">\n    801 F.3d 777\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 783 (7th Cir. 2015) (citing\n   <em>\n    Vincent v. City Colleges of Chi.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4077419\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/485/919/#p923\">\n    485 F.3d 919\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 923 (7th Cir.2007) ). Here, K2 had adequate notice that Tracy was seeking relief for loss of consortium as a result of the enhanced injuries caused by the K2 helmet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Additional motions and requests for relief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   As a final matter, plaintiffs ask the court to deny certain requests by K2 that plaintiffs contend were improperly included in K2's summary judgment reply. Dkt. 149. Some of the \"motions\" to which plaintiffs refer are objections to allegedly inadmissible evidence-objections that K2 is allowed to raise during summary judgment. For example, K2 objects that the declarations from Tracy and Ziejewski, first produced with plaintiffs' summary judgment opposition, are untimely expert testimony. Dkt. 143, at 3-10. There is nothing improper about K2 making these objections in its summary judgment reply. (The court has overruled the objection to Tracy's declaration, and it has not considered the Ziejewski declaration. Whether the Ziejewski evidence will be allowed at trial will be addressed later at the final pretrial conference.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   But K2 requests two additional forms of relief in its reply brief. First, K2 contends that plaintiffs should be sanctioned for spoliation because Tracy adjusted the helmet's comfort liner and therefore altered it from its condition at the time of the accident. Dkt. 143, at 7-8 fn. 7. Second, K2 contends that plaintiffs did not disclose the existence of Scott's ski goggles and must be ordered to turn them over.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   A party may not raise new issues in a reply brief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Casna v. City of Loves Park\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675050\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/574/420/#p427\">\n    574 F.3d 420\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 427 (7th Cir. 2009). In any event, both of K2's requests for additional relief are undeveloped. The spoliation arguments are relegated to a footnote. And both requests misconstrue the history of this case. K2's own experts previously removed the helmet's comfort lining at issue. Dkt. 112, at 10-11. And K2 was already aware of Scott's goggles, Dkt. 130 (Tracy dep. 33:9-17), and Halstead included a pair of goggles as a factor in his testing. Dkt. 110, at 4. The court will deny K2's requests for additional relief, thus granting plaintiffs' request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   ORDER\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   IT IS ORDERED that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   1.

Because plaintiffs have produced no evidence that this flier originated from K2, K2 objects that it is inadmissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 901. However, even if the flier were admissible, it does not affect the admissibility of Scher's testimony. According to plaintiffs, the flier shows that Scher should have measured Scott's head at a lower location. But the flier uses a cartoon drawing to show the correct position to measure the head circumference, and the cartoon is not clearly different from the position where Scher measured Scott's head. Tracy claims that she measured Scott's head in the same location as Scher. Dkt. 123, \u00b6\u00b6 7-8. Tracy does not claim she used this flier.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    The Wisconsin Supreme Court has not stated whether preexisting common law still applies where consistent with the product liability statute.
