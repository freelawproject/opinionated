INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This action concerns whether the Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\") acted lawfully when it reduced Medicare payments worth billions of dollars to private institutions, to correct what it views as a fundamental misalignment of Medicare programs. Plaintiffs, a group of hospital associations and non-profit hospitals,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   contend that HHS exceeded its statutory\n   authority when it cut Medicare reimbursement rates for certain outpatient pharmaceutical drugs by nearly 30%. Defendants, HHS and its Secretary, contend that the rate adjustment was statutorily authorized and necessary to close the gap between the discounted rates at which Plaintiffs obtain the drugs at issue-through Medicare's \"340B Program\"-and the higher rates at which Plaintiffs were previously reimbursed for those drugs under a different Medicare framework.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Presently before this Court are Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary or permanent injunction and Defendants' motion to dismiss. Among other relief, Plaintiffs ask the Court to vacate the Secretary's rate reduction, require the Secretary to apply previous reimbursement rates for the remainder of this year, and require the Secretary to pay Plaintiffs the difference between the reimbursements they have received this year under the new rates and the reimbursements they would have received under the previous rates. Defendants contest the Court's ability to hear the case, arguing that Congress has shielded the Secretary's action from judicial review, that the Secretary's boundless discretion precludes review, and that Plaintiffs' failure to exhaust their administrative remedies is fatal. Defendants also argue that the Secretary's action was well within his statutory authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For the reasons stated below, the Court concludes that it has jurisdiction to provide relief in this case and that Plaintiffs are entitled to such relief. While in certain circumstances the Secretary could implement the rate reduction at issue here, he did not have statutory authority to do so under the circumstances presented. Moreover, because the parties have fully and vigorously debated the merits of Plaintiffs' claims, which turn on questions of law, not fact, the Court concludes that further merits briefing would be redundant and inefficient. However, while Plaintiffs are entitled to\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   relief, the potentially drastic impact of this Court's decision on Medicare's complex administration gives the Court pause. Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiffs' motion for a permanent injunction and orders supplemental briefing on the question of a proper remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Reg. 33,558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 33,634 (Jul. 20, 2017) (codified at 42 C.F.R. pt. 419). HHS provided a detailed explanation of why it believed this rate reduction was necessary. First, HHS noted that several recent studies have confirmed the large \"profit\" margin created by the difference between the price that hospitals pay to acquire 340B drugs and the price at which Medicare reimburses those drugs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2033%2C558\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2033%2C558\">\n    at 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,632 -33. Second, HHS stated that because of this \"profit\" margin, HHS was \"concerned that the current payment methodology may lead to unnecessary utilization and potential overutilization of separately payable drugs.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2033%2C558\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2033%2C558\">\n    at 33,633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It cited, as an example of this phenomenon, a 2015 Government Accountability Office Report finding that Medicare Part B drug spending was substantially higher at 340B hospitals than at non-340B hospitals.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2033%2C558\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2033%2C558\">\n    at 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,632 -33.

Third, HHS expressed concern \"about the rising prices of certain drugs and that Medicare beneficiaries, including low-income seniors, are responsible for paying 20 percent of the Medicare payment rate for these drugs,\" rather than the lower 340B rate paid by the covered hospitals.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2033%2C558\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Thus, HHS concluded that lowering the Medicare reimbursement rates for 340B Program drugs would \"make Medicare payment for separately payable drugs more aligned with the resources expended by hospitals to acquire such drugs[,] while recognizing the intent of the 340B program to allow covered entities, including eligible hospitals to stretch scarce resources while continuing to provide access to care.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2033%2C558\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   HHS, however, did not have the data necessary to \"precisely calculate the price paid by 340B hospitals for [any] particular covered outpatient drug.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2033%2C558\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2033%2C558\">\n    at 33,634\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Because HHS did not \"have hospital acquisition cost data for 340B drugs,\" 82 Fed. Reg. at 33,634, it could not invoke its express authority under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   (t)(14)(A)(iii)(I) to set rates according to the drugs' average acquisition costs. Instead, HHS invoked its authority under \u00a7 1395\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   (t)(14)(A)(iii)(II), \"which states that if hospital acquisition cost data are not available, the payment for an applicable drug shall be the average price for the drug ... as calculated and adjusted by the Secretary as necessary.\" 82 Fed. Reg. at 33,634. HHS would thus \"adjust the applicable payment rate as necessary\" for separately payable drugs acquired under the 340B program, \"to ASP minus 22.5[%].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   HHS stated that the adjustment was necessary because ASP minus 22.5% \"better represents the average acquisition cost for [340B] drugs and biologicals.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiffs strongly opposed the proposed 2018 340B reimbursement rates, and they voiced their opposition in comments to the proposed rule. Plaintiffs argued primarily\n   that HHS did not have the legal authority to change the 340B reimbursement rates in the manner proposed, and that reducing reimbursement rates by nearly 30% would severely impact covered entities' ability to provide critical healthcare programs to their communities, particularly to their underserved patients.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   AHA Comments, Pls.'

First, the Secretary argues that Plaintiffs' failure to exhaust their administrative remedies forecloses judicial review. Second, the Secretary argues that certain Medicare provisions preclude the Court's review. Third, the Secretary argues that the decision to reduce 340B drug reimbursement rates was \"committed to agency discretion by law,\" and therefore outside the scope of APA review. Fourth, the Secretary argues that he had clear statutory authority to \"adjust\" 340B drug reimbursement rates.

Although similar arguments have been raised in this jurisdiction, no court has held that the Secretary acted outside of his authority to make \"adjustments\" to any Medicare reimbursement rates. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Amgen\n   </em>\n   , the D.C. Circuit had \"no occasion to engage in line drawing to determine when 'adjustments' cease being 'adjustments' \" because the rate adjustment at issue there involved \"only the payment amount for a single drug, [which] does not work 'basic and fundamental changes in the scheme' Congress created in the Medicare Act ....\"\n   <em>\n    Amgen, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3722607,9056335\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/357/103/\">\n    357 F.3d at 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    MCI\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39341\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/218/#p225\">\n    512 U.S. at 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39341\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/218/#p225\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

Reg. at 52,494 (discussing the number of 340B \"covered products\" available to 340B covered entities). Moreover, the changes that the Secretary imposed are not modest. Indeed, by changing the formula from the statutory default of ASP plus 6% to ASP minus 22.5%, the Secretary is imposing a nearly 30% reduction from the formula that Congress expressly set as the standard. When viewed together, the rate reduction's magnitude and its wide applicability inexorably lead to the conclusion that the Secretary fundamentally altered the statutory scheme established by Congress for determining SCOD reimbursement rates, thereby exceeding the Secretary's authority to \"adjust[ ]\" SCOD rates under \u00a7 (t)(14)(A)(iii)(II).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In attempting to justify this drastic departure from the statutorily mandated rates, the Secretary argues that because \u00a7 (t)(14)(A)(iii) \"itself identifies 'acquisition cost[s]' as a valid reference point for drug payments,\" the Secretary must necessarily have been within his authority to adjust 340B reimbursement rates to achieve that goal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29, 33. It is true that \u00a7 (t)(14)(A)(iii) authorizes the Secretary to set reimbursement rates at levels consistent with hospitals' acquisition costs for those drugs. 42 U.S.C. 1395\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 (t)(14)(A)(iii)(I).

Congress could very well have chosen to treat Medicare reimbursements for 340B drugs differently than reimbursements for other separately payable drugs, but it did not do so. To the extent the Secretary disagrees on policy grounds with Congress's decision,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 82 Fed. Reg. at 52,495 (\"While we recognize the intent of the 340B program, we believe it is inappropriate for Medicare to subsidize other activities through Medicare payments for separately payable drugs.\"), the Secretary may either collect the data necessary to set payment rates based on acquisition costs, or\n   he may raise his disagreement with Congress, but he may not end-run Congress's clear mandate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   For these reasons, the Court concludes that the Secretary acted\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   This conclusion carries two implications.
