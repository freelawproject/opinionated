The elk migrate across several boundaries, including the BTNF, Grand Teton National Park (\"GTNP\"), and the National Elk Refuge\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"Refuge\"). In 2013, the Jackson elk herd had an estimated population of 11,600, with less than a ten percent interchange with adjacent herd units. AR28852; AR28974. Since 1998, wolf activity has influenced the movement of the elk herd in the Gros Ventre drainage,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   resulting in one large group (as much as 3,221 animals) congregating on one feedground and then moving to another feedground in the drainage. AR22037, 28774.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Wyoming first started to provide supplemental feed to elk in the early 1900's to prevent large-scale die-offs during hard winters. AR28970. Since those early years, feedgrounds have also become an important tool for the State to reduce damage to haystack yards and winter pastures on private lands\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and to reduce the potential or transmission of brucellosis to livestock.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   AR10208. On NFS lands, elk feedgrounds are strategically placed near the boundaries to gather elk as they transition from summer ranges down to lower elevations, mostly preventing elk from migrating through private lands in route to lower elevations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201506.2\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Service regulations require authorization for feedground use and occupancy on NFS lands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   State-operated feedgrounds are located on BLM, Forest Service, State, and private lands.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In terms of the Gros Ventre drainage and in addition to the Refuge, three state-operated feedgrounds provide supplemental winter feed to the Jackson elk herd: Alkali Creek, Patrol Cabin (on state land), and Fish Creek.

This location effectively limits elk movement further down onto the Refuge, as well as onto nearby private lands. AR28878.

As additional challenges, clinical signs of CWD are not diagnostic, there is a long incubation period, there is no treatment, there is no prevention in the sense of vaccination, and CWD is invariably fatal once clinical signs develop. AR18430. These challenges make surveillance difficult and expensive; hence the emphasis on preventing its introduction into the region. AR18431.

Current models projecting the arrival of CWD in the Jackson elk herd are uncertain and predict a broad range of outcomes. AR28854.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As noted above, there is controversy about feedgrounds and their contribution to the introduction and spread of CWD.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Petitioners refer to the joint 2007 Bison and Elk Management Plan (\"2007 BEMP\"), prepared by the NPS and the NFWS for the Refuge, which reported\n   feedgrounds are a significant risk factor for the introduction and rapid spread of CWD. CM/ECF Document (\"Doc.\") 43, p. 16; AR17781 (seasonal concentrations of elk create \"an unnatural situation that has contributed to ... an increased risk of potentially major outbreaks of exotic diseases,\" and \"damage to and loss of habitat\"). Further, at least one expert with the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (\"APHIS\") thinks \"long-term feedgrounds are detrimental to the health of the wildlife.\" AR26800. The Service itself recognizes \"that the WGFC action of feeding elk results in the artificial concentration of elk during winter and early spring that increases risk of disease transmission\" (AR11108), and that prevalence of CWD is likely \"functionally related to ungulate density\" (AR28876). Indeed, in its brief the Service states, \"the practice [of supplemental feeding] concentrates elk during the winter months and contributes to the spread of diseases such as brucellosis and CWD.\" Doc. 62, p.ll. Also, the Brief of Amici Curiae Scientists discusses the very high population density estimates of elk at Alkali Creek Feedground, the behavior changes that occur as elk population densities grow (higher frequency and duration of contact), and the corresponding significant risk of disease transmission, both directly between animals and indirectly through the environment. Doc. 55, p. 15; AR26284; 24695. Further, both the NPS and NFWS agree that \"elk concentrated on feedgrounds is likely to facilitate the spread of [CWD] when it reaches [the GTNP and Refuge]. As such, an overarching strategy to achieve the goals of the 2007 BEMP is to reduce reliance on winter supplemental feeding of bison and elk, and to transition to complete reliance on natural standing forage at an undetermined time in the future.\" AR28174. Finally, one court found that the 2007 BEMP for the Refuge \"might well have been unreasonable had the agencies categorically refused to phase out the winter feeding program in spite of all the evidence in the record about the dangers of supplemental feeding.\"\n   <em>\n    Defs.

The State puts forward two theories - one which postulates that a feedground might attract elk from a large catchment area and congregate them, thereby increasing the introduction of CWD to a new herd area. Doc. 63, p. 20; AR29039. Another theory suggests, based on known low-prevalence rates for the disease in wild elk, there may be little to no impact on elk populations because the purpose of most feedgrounds is to intercept elk migration corridors and prevent further migration.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3766714,3753484\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/651/112/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; AR29039; 28979.

The 2008 FEIS analyzed three alternatives: a no action alternative denying the special use request; a mid-range action authorizing only the requested feedgrounds but not the expansion of Patrol Cabin; and an action fully granting the permit as requested. AR10217-20. As a result, in 2008 the Service granted the permit for several locations but did not authorize the Patrol Cabin expansion and postponed a decision on Alkali Creek Feedground to conduct additional analyses. AR11104-07.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Prior to the 2015 decision on Alkali Creek Feedground, the Service prepared the 2015 Final Supplemental EIS (2015 FSIES), which tiered to the 2008 FEIS. The Service limited the objective and purpose of its 2015 FSEIS to whether the Alkali Creek Feedground permit should be reissued, and if so, under what terms and conditions. AR28776. In light of this objective, the Service analyzed two alternatives in detail and eliminated alternatives from detailed consideration. AR28783-88. Important to the issues raised in this case, the Service eliminated an alternative to improve winter range on the BTNF and eliminate all elk feeding in an effort to restore historical migration routes. AR28787. As to these eliminated alternatives, the Service concluded it was already working to improve winter range through habitat projects (AR28787), and it lacked the authority to direct the WGFD to stop elk feeding because, even without the permit, the WGFD would continue to feed elk on private, State, and other federal lands. AR28787. The Service also eliminated an alternative to construct elk-proof fencing around private lands in the Gros Ventre drainage, concluding this was implausible, would fence in private property to the detriment of landowners, and would negatively affect migration routes. AR28787; 21895. As part of its analysis and specific to the spread and prevalence of CWD, the Service generated a Literature Review Technical Report. AR29160; 29034-45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On December 1, 2015, the Forest Service amended the existing 2008 long-term special use permit to reauthorize the continued use of NFS lands for winter elk feedground activities at Alkali Creek Feedground.

The Service responded, \"Something to consider when drafting the decision for Alkali.\" AR34191.

The option was eliminated because of feasibility (small size of the park, near certainty that wolves would leave, and the resulting need for state agency management of wolves outside the park).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   While instructive,\n   <em>\n    WildEarth Guardians\n   </em>\n   is not controlling. Notwithstanding the Service's efforts to argue otherwise, the Court is not dealing with jurisdictional issues surrounding the management of elk. The Court is presented with a straight-forward request by a state agency to continue the long-term use of facilities on NFS lands at Alkali Creek as an elk winter feedground. Commenters asked the Service to improve winter range on the BTNF, then eliminate all elk feeding and restore historical migration routes. AR27484. Obviously, the commenters focused on function - the artificial feeding of elk - which the Service seized upon and then readily dismissed by saying it \"does not have the jurisdiction to stop elk feeding.\" AR27485. But the \"rule of reason\" controls. Was it reasonable, within the agency's jurisdiction, and feasible for the Service to consider a shorter-term, reduced impact, and/or phase-out alternative for the use of Alkali Creek as a feedground, while taking steps to transition elk to natural winter range and support historical migration routes? The answer to this question was and is yes. The Service's focus on jurisdiction\n   <em>\n    when the issue concerns WGFD's use of NFS land\n   </em>\n   , was not a reasoned explanation for its refusal to examine phase-out alternatives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Further, the argument that any action other than wholesale approval would be equivalent to the no-action alternative is unsupported by the record. While the State makes this argument, there is no citation to the record of any affirmative statement by the State that something other than approval of long-term use would result in the State ceasing its winter feeding activities at Alkali Creek. Indeed, since the Service's action authorizing the existing 2008 long-term special use permit for other feedgrounds, the Alkali Creek Feedground has operated under temporary (one year) special use permits.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , AR17733-71.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    \"Hard Look\" at Environmental Consequences\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Petitioners argue the Service failed to take a \"hard look\" at the environmental consequences of artificial feeding and its impacts on the introduction and spread of CWD in the Jackson elk herd, even if the precise extent of the effect is less certain. Petitioners claim the Service \"washed its hands\" of the problem by insisting the responsibility for managing the disease ultimately fell to WGFD, and they provide as an example, the Service's action in issuing the 2015 FEIS and draft ROD prior to the finalization and approval of WGFD's CWD Management Plan. Doc. 42, p. 43-44. Petitioners claim the literature review and deference to WGFD did not constitute a meaningful analysis of how Alkali Creek Feedground\n   <em>\n    itself\n   </em>\n   contributes to the risk of CWD introduction and spread, especially given Alkali Creek's unique location which forms a natural bottleneck for elk movement in the drainage that is the \"most likely point of entry\" for CWD into the Jackson elk herd.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   AR28884; 18851; 18706. In short, Petitioners argue the Service never explained why it could not even attempt to use the well-established methods described in the scientific literature to quantify the impacts expected from the introduction of CWD.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In response, the Service argues it took the requisite hard look at the likely impacts of CWD, pointing to the white paper prepared by the Service synthesizing the best available science on CWD in elk. AR29033-45. The Service's analysis revealed that, while \"models projecting the arrival and subsequent transmission of CWD in the Jackson Hole area are highly uncertain[,] ... it is probable that [CWD] will spread throughout Wyoming.\" AR28853. The Service continued by focusing on the Jackson elk herd and concluded \"[b]ecause other feedgrounds in western Wyoming and the Gros Ventre drainage are likely to remain operational in the absence of elk management at Alkali Creek Feedground, the timing and arrival for new diseases such as CWD in the drainage and region is not likely to be greatly affected by elk management at Alkali Creek itself.\" AR28876. Further, the Service discussed how \"Alkali Creek Feedground could become a reservoir for CWD infection if it becomes established in elk populations in northwest Wyoming,\" [AR28884] while also including the opposing discussion that Alkali Creek Feedground \"would be less likely to become contaminated with prions\" under the no-action alternative. AR28879. The Service also concluded that \"feeding operations at Alkali Creek would, to a minor extent, contribute to population-level effects ....\" AR28886. Finally, the Service argues its decisionmaker was aware of the risks posed by CWD. AR 30638 (\"I clearly understand and acknowledge that the Commission's action of feeding ... increases risk of disease transmission\"). The Service argues this satisfies NEPA's procedural requirement that the agency take a hard look at the environmental consequences of the proposed action, disclose those consequences, and apply the best available scientific information. Finally, the Service disagrees with the argument that it should have waited until WGFD finalized its new CWD management plan as no state management plan has been able to stop the spread of CWD and conditions were imposed\n   allowing revocation if the plan was insufficient. AR29026-27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The State advances many of the same arguments as the Service, in support of the claim that the agency took the requisite hard look at the effects common to both alternatives. The State argues Petitioners disagree with the Service over the impact of a single feedground on disease transmission and the conclusion of the technical report. However, disagreement is not the same as not taking a hard look. The State argues the Service adequately obtained expert opinions in the form of reports and studies, and reviewed and synthesized the reports and studies into a single report, which was then peer reviewed. AR29160; AR29034-45. Further, the Service gave careful scientific scrutiny to the material, responded to all legitimate concerns that were raised, and fairly found the science regarding the influence of a single feedground to be overall - inconclusive. According to the State, this complies with NEPA's requirement that the agency take a hard look at the environmental consequences before taking a major action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   NEPA requires an agency look at the environmental impact of the proposed action, any unavoidable adverse environmental effects, the alternatives to the proposed action, the relationship between local short-term uses of man's environment, and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity, and any irreversible and irretrievable commitment of resources.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204332\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (C).

However, the Service's failure to consider a reasonable range of alternatives results in the conclusion that the Service failed to take a hard look at the alternatives to the proposed action, some of which might mitigate impacts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Further, while not a specific focus of the arguments by the parties, there is little to indicate the Service took much of a look at the relationship between a stepped, phase out approach compared to longer-term use of the site as a feedground, and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity. There is also little to suggest the Service took a hard look at the irreversible and irretrievable commitment of resources. Both considerations are required by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204332\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (C). There is no question that Alkali Creek Feedground could become a reservoir for CWD infection if it becomes established in elk populations\n   in northwest Wyoming. That potential is increased with the concentration of elk at feedgrounds. If infected animals congregate, the environment will eventually be contaminated. This will significantly affect vegetation and soils, thus productivity, over a very long term (if not indefinitely) and may result in an irreversible and irretrievable loss of wildlife and habitat. However, the Service's only analysis and evaluation was of the longer-term use of the site as a feedground and the no-action alternative, without any evaluation of reduced impact or phase-out alternatives, or how these various alternatives affect\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   the considerations required to be evaluated under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204332\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Finally, there is no question that the Commission overseeing the WGFD decides whether or not to feed elk in the winter. However, this does not excuse the Service from taking a hard look at the consequences of\n   <em>\n    its\n   </em>\n   action to allow the long-term use of NFS lands at Alkali Creek as a feedground. Relevant to the Service (and not simply within WGFD jurisdiction) are the problems that artificial feeding increases the risk of disease transmission, increases the risk that the site will be contaminated with prions for a very long time, and also appears to blindly support WGFD's goal of managing elk movements to prevent commingling with livestock and danger to agricultural land, notwithstanding the BTNF Land and Resource Management Plan that includes a stated goal to \"[h]elp re-establish historic elk migration routes to provide increased viewing and hunting opportunities for outfitters and clients.\" AR119. Based on the record, feedgrounds seem to undermine this goal. For all these reasons, the 2015 FSEIS is inadequate in that it fails NEPA's hard look requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Cumulative Impacts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Petitioners argue the Service failed to meaningfully analyze the cumulative impacts of the region's feedgrounds on wildlife resources, in violation of NEPA. Specifically, Petitioners complain that the Service refused to examine the impacts of Alkali Creek Feedground in conjunction with the other feedgrounds located in the BTNF, or the artificial feeding program conducted by the NFWS on the Refuge. Rather, the Service restricted its evaluation of cumulative impacts to include effects only from Alkali Creek and the other feedgrounds in the Gros Ventre drainage (Fish Creek and Patrol Creek), thereby severing analysis of this action's impacts from the effects of other nearby feedground operations impacting the same elk herd, as well as the effect of the 2007 BEMP on the Refuge which anticipates a step-down approach to phase out artificial feeding. Petitioners argue these feedgrounds are all part of an integrated program which cumulatively impacts the Jackson elk herd, and the restricted analysis by the Service violates NEPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In response, the Service argues that it considered the threat of CWD to the Jackson elk herd and considered the additive contribution of the Alkali Creek Feedground to that threat. The Service also notes that its analysis supplements the 2008 FEIS, which analyzed the impacts of the other feedgrounds in one document and cannot now be challenged. According to the Service, it was not required to redo that analysis. As to the 2007 BEMP, the Service argues it incorporated that plan by reference, and discussed how use of the Alkali Creek Feedground will lower the numbers of overwintering elk at the Refuge. Further, no framework has yet emerged for transitioning from winter feeding on the Refuge to greater reliance on natural forage. Absent a framework, the Service argues it cannot consider specific impacts to Alkali Creek.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   As to cumulative impacts, the Court again agrees with Petitioners. The finality of the 2008 FEIS does not eliminate the need for the Service to consider cumulative impacts from the integrated feedground program considering the best and currently available science that has advanced the understanding of CWD risk, transmission and mitigation since the 2008 analysis. Also, the Service need not await a specific framework for the implementation of the 2007 BEMP, but may reasonably rely on the good faith representation that the agencies aim to implement the transition sometime during the life of the Alkali Creek Feedground permit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   This requires the Service to examine how granting the permit through 2028 or some shorter term would interrelate with, potentially support, or potentially undermine, the objectives of the combined agency work under the 2007 BEMP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   IV. APA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Petitioners argue the permit and record of decision violate the APA because they fail to analyze the factors set forth in federal laws governing national forests and instead impermissibly defer to WGFD's objectives. Given the conclusion that the Service failed to comply with NEPA procedural requirements, the Court concludes the agency action violated the Administrative Procedure Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The Service approved WGFC's special use permit for the Alkali Creek Feedground without complying with the procedural requirements of NEPA. Accordingly, the Court VACATES the Service's decision to amend the existing 2008 long-term special use permit to reauthorize the continued use of NFS lands for winter elk feedground activities at Alkali Creek Feedground, and REMANDS to the agency for further proceedings consistent with this decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Nothing in this decision or order adjudicates, directs, or prohibits the issuance by the Service of temporary (one year) special use permits to the WGFD Commission for Alkali Creek Feedground, as has been its interim past practice.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , AR17733-71.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    The BTNF Land and Resource Management Plan can be found in the record at AR1-388.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    The National Fish and Wildlife Service (NFWS) manages the Refuge, which is part of the National Wildlife Refuge System.
