During these years, artists represented by the Five galleries accounted for 45 percent of \"single-artist shows\" at the Museum of Modern Art, 40 percent of \"major shows\" at the New Museum, and 90 percent (eleven out of twelve) of the \"major solo exhibitions\" at the Guggenheim.

The plaintiff's amended complaint does not specify whether the Five Galleries are part of the \"select few galleries\" providing support to the defendants or whether any of the Five Galleries are part of a defendant's leadership committee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The plaintiff alleges that features of this art ecosystem - the defendants not fully disclosing their acquisition policies, the rise in a work's value once displayed in the defendant museums, the Five Galleries providing many of the defendant museums' exhibitions, and galleries supporting the defendants generally - indicate a conspiracy, and have anticompetitive effects harmful to him and other artists. Specifically, the plaintiff alleges that the defendants purchase and exhibit primarily the work of artists represented by the Five Galleries, which, given the prestige of the defendant museums, drives up the prices of works by those artists.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-30. The value and desirability of these select artists' works continue to rise as the defendants continue purchasing and exhibiting these same artists' works.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   This, according to the plaintiff, appeases the Five Galleries, which become more willing to support the defendants, and further benefits the defendants by making their collections more valuable and exhibitions more popular.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 31-34, 37-38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The plaintiff also claims that the defendants encourage private collectors to buy pieces by these select artists, and then the defendant museums display the pieces to make them more valuable in hopes that the collectors will later donate the pieces to the defendants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36. Moreover, the plaintiff alleges that auction houses contribute to the conspiracy by selling the\n   works of these select artists to museums at artificially high prices, thus keeping the art market artificially overpriced.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In short, the defendants allegedly agreed to use their clout in the art world to make certain artists' works increasingly valuable, and then to continue to draw upon those same artists to the defendants' collective benefit. To carry out this alleged scheme, the defendants coordinate with various galleries, auction houses, and private collectors who are in on the conspiracy. The plaintiff adds that the defendants hide their scheme by not disclosing their acquisition policies comprehensively; if the defendants fully disclosed their policies, the plaintiff claims, the defendants would have to draw upon a more diverse array of artists to appear in compliance with their policies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The plaintiff claims that the defendants' alleged conspiracy shuts him and others out from the New York City contemporary art market.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68. The plaintiff alleges that, as a result, he and other artists whose works are not purchased by, or displayed in, the defendant museums suffer harm in the form of \"artificial depression\" in the prices of their works.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 57, 68. Put another way, if not for the alleged conspiracy, the museums would purchase the artwork of the plaintiff and others, and consequently the plaintiff and others would see a rise in the value of their artwork. The plaintiff also alleges that the price of contemporary art has been fixed throughout the United States, and price competition in the contemporary art market restrained, as a result of the defendants' conspiracy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70. Finally, the plaintiff claims that the defendants' conspiracy is a per se violation of the Sherman Act, and he requests damages of not less than $100 million.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72, Prayer for Relief \u00b6 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The defendants have moved to dismiss the amended complaint on several grounds, including failure to allege facts sufficient to demonstrate: Article III standing, antitrust standing, a conspiratorial agreement among the defendants, a relevant geographic market, and an adverse effect on competition stemming from the defendants' alleged conspiracy. The defendants request that the plaintiff's amended complaint be dismissed with prejudice. If the Court is inclined to dismiss the amended complaint, the plaintiff asks for another opportunity to attempt to plead a viable claim. For the reasons that follow, the defendants' motion to dismiss is\n   <strong>\n    granted\n   </strong>\n   , and the plaintiff's amended complaint is dismissed\n   <strong>\n    without prejudice\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The defendants first argue that the plaintiff lacks constitutional standing to bring this suit. Article III of the Constitution of the United States limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to \"Cases\" and \"Controversies.\"\n   <em>\n    Lujan v.

Dec. 23, 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In this case, the plaintiff alleges that the defendants have injured him by conspiring in a way that shuts him out of the New York City contemporary art market\n   and artificially depresses the value of his artwork as a result. The plaintiff claims that but for the alleged conspiracy, the defendants would purchase and display his artwork, thus raising the value of his work to the price he believes it deserves. However, the plaintiff has not pleaded facts indicating that a favorable decision would be likely to redress this injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   If the defendants' alleged conspiracy were enjoined, it is mere speculation that the defendants would begin purchasing the plaintiff's work. \"[I]t must be likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p559\">\n    504 U.S. at 561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p559\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation marks omitted). Which artists' works the defendants purchase is up to the defendants' discretion. Although the plaintiff assures the Court that his artwork is of a quality that would be shown in the defendant museums if not for the alleged conspiracy, this subjective boast alone cannot substantiate the plaintiff's claim that enjoining the alleged conspiracy would lead the defendants to begin purchasing his work.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rangel v.

In addition to constitutional standing, \"[a]n antitrust plaintiff must show ... antitrust standing at the pleading stage.

According to the defendants, the plaintiff seeks to join the closed art ecosystem allegedly created by the defendants and command the super-competitive profits enjoyed by artists in the ecosystem. This, the defendants argue, is not an antitrust injury. Rather, they argue, the plaintiff is complaining that he has failed to enjoy the fruits of the alleged conspiracy. The defendants rely primarily on\n   <em>\n    Daniel v. American Board of Emergency Medicine\n   </em>\n   , in which the Second Circuit Court of Appeals held that the plaintiffs' alleged injury of being unable to obtain the super-competitive pay commanded by doctors holding a certain credential was not an antitrust injury.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1280352\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/428/408/#p438\">\n    428 F.3d 408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 438-41 (2d Cir. 2005) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sanjuan v.

Rather, he claims that, as an outsider, his work is devalued. The inflated prices of artwork inside the ecosystem, and the defendants' power to proclaim what is \"good art\" deserving of high value, allegedly precludes his artwork from reaching the value he believes it merits - not necessarily super-competitive value, but rightful value. If the conspiracy were enjoined, the plaintiff argues, his work would be displayed at the defendant museums and accordingly be more valuable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   This theory differs from that of the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Daniel\n   </em>\n   , where the plaintiffs' \"singular complaint was that they were denied the opportunity to command the same\n   <em>\n    super\n   </em>\n   -competitive pay earned by their [credentialed] colleagues.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1280352\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/428/408/#p438\">\n    428 F.3d at 439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, the\n   <em>\n    Daniel\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs, unlike the plaintiff here, sought in their prayer for relief not to end the complained-of credentialing arrangement but rather to join in it.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1280352\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/428/408/#p438\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1280352\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/428/408/#p438\">\n    at 440\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The plaintiff in this case alleges that a conspiracy precludes him and others from competing in the New York City contemporary art market, thus hindering their ability to sell their artwork at a fair price and depriving them of the benefits of open competition. He claims that his injury is indicative of this. Although the plaintiff's injury is highly speculative, it cannot be said at this stage that the plaintiff's injury is not\n   <em>\n    of the type\n   </em>\n   that the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that it does not flow from that which makes the alleged conspiracy illegal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   However, the plaintiff has failed to allege adequately that he is an \"efficient enforcer\" of the antitrust laws. Courts consider four factors in determining whether an individual antitrust plaintiff is fit to bring suit:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (1) the directness or indirectness of the asserted injury; (2) the existence of an identifiable class of persons whose self-interest would normally motivate them\n   to vindicate the public interest in antitrust enforcement; (3) the speculativeness of the alleged injury; and (4) the difficulty of identifying damages and apportioning them among direct and indirect victims so as to avoid duplicative recoveries.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    In re Aluminum Warehousing Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4337395\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/95/419/#p441\">\n    95 F.Supp.3d 419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 441 (S.D.N.Y. 2015). Each factor weighs against the plaintiff. The plaintiff hardly argues otherwise, only stating summarily in his opposition brief that \"at this stage of pleading, Plaintiff has made sufficient allegations under this [efficient-enforcer] analysis to permit this Court to conclude that Plaintiff has antitrust standing because of the direct connection between the Defendants' conspiracy and Plaintiff's injury.\" Opp'n at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   First, the plaintiff's asserted injury is indirect: favorable treatment and artificial inflation for some artists' works, according to the plaintiff, results in diminution of his artworks' value. This theory of harm depends upon the tenuous inference that five museums effectively control the value of not just the art that they purchase and display but the value of all contemporary artwork in New York City. Possible plaintiffs with more direct claims would include purchasers or other museums outside of the alleged conspiracy who buy art at the alleged artificially inflated prices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Second, there exist other possible plaintiffs who, if the conspiracy causes the effects claimed, would be typically motivated to vindicate the public interest in antitrust enforcement - namely, the purchasers and museums outside of the alleged conspiracy who pay the inflated prices.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Cal. State Council of Carpenters\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6199687\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/459/519/\">\n    459 U.S. 519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 542 n.47,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6199687\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/459/519/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 897\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6199687\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/459/519/\">\n    74 L.Ed.2d 723\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983) (\"[I]f there is substance to the [plaintiff's] claim, it is difficult to understand why these direct victims of the conspiracy have not asserted any claim in their own right.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Third, the plaintiff's alleged injury is highly speculative. The plaintiff assumes that if the alleged conspiracy did not exist, his work would appear in the defendant museums and become more valuable. This theory depends entirely upon the discretion and subjective tastes of the defendants. Other than vague statements that his work is of a quality worthy of display in the defendant museums and has been the subject of shows in the United States and Europe, the plaintiff provides no reason to infer that the defendant museums would in fact purchase and display his art but for the alleged conspiracy. The plaintiff does not allege, for example, that his artwork has been shown in museums similar to the defendant museums.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Finally, the plaintiff's alleged damages are also highly speculative, and therefore difficult to identify and apportion. Although his complaint presents some figures illustrating how much artwork increases in value after being displayed at the defendant museums, he provides no figures related to the undervaluing of his own work. Moreover, determining how much of the alleged artificial undervaluing of the plaintiff's artwork is attributable to the defendants, and how much to other factors - such as the public taste, the interest of other purchasers, and the opinions of critics and academics - calls for extensive speculation. And insofar as the plaintiff's damages consist of lost profits from his being shut out of the defendant museums, it is impossible to estimate the extent to which the plaintiff would have, but for the conspiracy, been accepted into the defendant museums, and how much he would have profited as a result. Whether a piece of the plaintiff's artwork would have been purchased by one of the defendants rather than, for example, a Warhol production,\n   would depend entirely on the subjective views of a defendant museum's staff. The difficulty in identifying and apportioning damages is amplified by the prospect of applying the plaintiff's attenuated damages theory to a \"nationwide class\" consisting of \"at least dozens\" of contemporary artists who, during an undefined period, created artwork \"eligible for exhibition in major contemporary art museums in the United States.\" Amended Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 54-55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In sum, the plaintiff is not an efficient enforcer of the antitrust laws. Therefore, he lacks antitrust standing to bring this suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Third, the defendants argue that the plaintiff has failed to allege adequately an agreement among the defendants in violation of the antitrust laws. \"Section 1 of the Sherman Act bans restraints on trade 'effected by a contract, combination, or conspiracy.' \"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

But the plaintiff's amended complaint provides nothing more than conclusory allegations. The plaintiff does not allege during what time period the conspiracy was formed, or who among the defendants' employees created the conspiracy. Nor does the plaintiff clarify the extent\n   to which the conspiracy is horizontal versus vertical - that is, among the defendants themselves rather than among the defendants and actors at different levels of the market such as galleries, auction houses, and collectors. The amended complaint focuses primarily on alleged agreements between the defendants and the Five Galleries, and leaves it to the Court to assume that the defendants also entered into a horizontal agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29, 31.

In short, the plaintiff's amended complaint is completely devoid of facts indicating who agreed with whom, to what, and when.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Moreover, the plaintiff's amended complaint lacks facts indicating the existence of plus factors. Plus factors include \"a common motive to conspire, evidence that shows that the parallel acts were against the apparent individual economic self-interest of the alleged conspirators, and evidence of a high level of interfirm communications.\"\n   <em>\n    Mayor &amp; City Council of Balt.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3547293\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/709/129/#p136\">\n    709 F.3d at 136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation marks omitted). The plaintiff does not allege facts bearing on these factors. Rather, the plaintiff broadly alleges that the benefit purportedly received by the defendants proves the existence of an agreement to conspire in the first instance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amended Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 31-37. But it is not apparent that the defendant museums actually benefit by driving up the price of artwork that they purchase even if their collections increase in value. The plaintiff also alleges that the defendants draw heavily upon the Five Galleries, and that indicates an explicit agreement among them all.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. But that is a wholly conclusory allegation and not supported. These allegations cannot be construed as plus factors supplementing the plaintiff's conclusory allegations of an illegal agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Further, there is an obvious alternative explanation to the alleged conspiratorial conduct - the defendants simply view works of certain artists, who are often represented by the Five Galleries, as worthy of collecting and showing. Indeed, the article the plaintiff cites to support his allegation of the prominence of artists represented by the Five Galleries states, \"The over-representation of a particular gallery's roster can also be an unintentional consequence of shared tastes.\" Cavanaugh Decl. Ex. 1 at 2;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Amended Compl. \u00b6 28. Conversely, to put it kindly, the defendants might not find the plaintiff's works worthy of collecting and showing. The plaintiff has not provided facts illustrating that it was a conspiracy, not this perhaps more plausible explanation, that has kept his artwork out of the defendant museums.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    550 U.S. at 566-67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In conclusion, the plaintiff has not met his burden of alleging that the challenged conduct stems from an agreement among the defendants rather than from independent decisions of the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Finally, the defendants argue that the plaintiff has not alleged a per se violation of the Sherman Act and, under the rule of reason, has failed to allege a relevant geographic market or adverse effect on competition.
