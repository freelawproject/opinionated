Duty Drawback Framework\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Duty drawback is a term of art in international trade that typically refers to a program (in a given country) pursuant to which import duties on merchandise may be recouped by the subsequent exportation of that merchandise. The antidumping statute specifically addresses duty drawback programs by directing Commerce to increase export price by \"the amount of any import duties imposed by the country of exportation which have been rebated, or which have not been collected, by reason of the exportation of the subject merchandise to the United States.\" 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c)(1)(B). Commerce applies a two-pronged test for duty drawback adjustments:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (1) the import duty paid and the rebate payment are directly linked to, and dependent upon, one another (or the exemption from import duties is linked to exportation); and (2) there are sufficient imports of the imported raw material to account for the drawback received upon the exports of the manufactured product.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Antidumping Methodologies: Market Economy Inputs, Expected Non-Market Economy Wages, Duty Drawback\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=71%20Fed.%20Reg.%2061%2C716\">\n    71 Fed.

Under the IPR, Turkish companies apply for import duty exemptions through certificates (\"DIIBs\").

Reg. 41,971\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Dep't of Commerce July 18, 2014) (final determ.) ). In this action Commerce imposed\n   additional criteria for Plaintiffs' duty drawback adjustment: (1) the claimed DIIBs must have been \"closed\" during the period of investigation (the \"POI limitation\"); and (2) the import certificates must have reflected exports to the United States of welded line pipe.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At issue in this action is the first of those criteria, the POI limitation. The parties agree that a DIIB must have been closed,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   but disagree about when that closure must have occurred. Commerce, as noted, requires closure during the POI. Plaintiffs argue that Commerce should include DIIBs closed prior to verification. \u00c7ayirova submitted two DIIBs to Commerce for use in its drawback adjustment, DIIBs # 1650 and # 6794. Commerce determined that neither DIIB could be used for \u00c7ayirova's drawback adjustment because DIIB # 1650 had no U.S. sales in the POI and DIIB # 6794 did not close until after the POI.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Cmts. at 6;\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   at 4. \u00c7ayirova only challenges Commerce's refusal to use DIIB # 6794 due to the POI limitation. Tos\u00e7elik submitted six DIIBs to Commerce for use in its drawback adjustment, DIIBs # 2756, # 2794, # 2795, # 3171, # 5139, and # 5560. Pls.' Cmts. at 23. Commerce determined that only DIIBs # 2756 and # 2795 were suitable for use in the drawback adjustment, finding that DIIBs # 3171, # 5139, and # 5560 did not contain exports of subject merchandise to the United States and that DIIB # 2794 did not close until after the POI.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   at 4. Tos\u00e7elik only challenges Commerce's refusal to use DIIB # 2794 due to the POI limitation. Critically, Commerce collected and verified information on\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the DIIBs submitted by Plaintiffs (regardless of whether the DIIBs closed within the POI or not) for the amount of Plaintiffs' uncollected import duties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Commerce, for its part, has struggled to identify a reasoned basis for its POI limitation. In the\n   <em>\n    Final Determination\n   </em>\n   Commerce merely concluded that the POI limitation applied.\n   <em>\n    Final Determination\n   </em>\n   at 11. When Plaintiffs challenged that determination here, Commerce requested a voluntary remand to provide an explanation for the new criterion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Resp. in Opp'n to Pls.' Mot. for J. Upon the Agency R., ECF No. 43 at 14-17. On remand, Commerce tried to explain the POI limitation, but faltered. Commerce thought the POI limitation might thwart potential manipulation of \"information reflected on the DIIBs prior to their closure.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   at 13. Commerce abandoned this \"manipulation\" rationale, however, because there was no evidence that respondents had manipulated the drawback information.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2041%2C971\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Consequently, in the final\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   , Commerce settled upon yet another new rationale for the POI limitation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2041%2C971\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2041%2C971\">\n    at 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Commerce's newest rationale for the POI limitation is that it reasonably allows Commerce to evaluate respondents' \"actual duty liability extinguished... during the POI.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2041%2C971\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2041%2C971\">\n    at 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Commerce also contends that the POI limitation helps to make computing respondents' duty drawback \"more administrable for Commerce.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2041%2C971\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   According\n   to Commerce: \"1) it affords Commerce sufficient time to analyze the data and notify respondents of any deficiencies; 2) it avoids the potential for the double counting of claims in multiple segments; and 3) it provides predictability and transparency in the administration of duty drawback claims.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2041%2C971\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2041%2C971\">\n    at 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In the\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   Commerce noted that \"neither the duty drawback statute nor the legislative history provides guidance on the methodology to be used in determining the amount of these uncollected duties,\" and, \"in the absence of such guidance, Commerce may develop reasonable methodologies to fill gaps in the statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   at 7. Here, Commerce was apparently hoping to frame its POI limitation as a\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   step two issue. Although Congress certainly was not thinking about the Turkish IPR when drafting the duty drawback adjustment provision, Congress did speak clearly when it required Commerce to increase export price by the amount of a respondent's duty drawback.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c)(1)(B). Against that statutory requirement, Commerce and the interested parties did an excellent job in the investigation and remand proceeding working through the complexities of the Turkish IPR. Commerce and Plaintiffs are basically in agreement on most of the challenging issues to account for Plaintiffs' duty drawback adjustment: When does a DIIB close? How does the DIIB information get reflected in Plaintiffs' margin calculation? The only remaining question is the reasonableness of Commerce's POI limitation that excluded some of the verified closed DIIBs. That question is ultimately not a legal issue resolved under the second prong of\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   , but a substantial evidence issue in which the court evaluates the reasonableness of Commerce's POI limitation given the administrative record. As explained above, Commerce's POI limitation has always been a result in search of a rationale, and in the\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   , Commerce failed to identify a reasonable explanation supported by the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Commerce tried to justify the POI limitation by equating a respondent's import duty liability with a standard \"cost or expense\" that goes into a respondent's overall Cost of Production (\"COP\") for producing subject merchandise:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Given that the transactions at issues [sic] here relate to duties on imported raw materials, and that raw materials are among costs included in COP, we find that limiting the duty drawback of those duties to amounts earned during the POI to be particularly appropriate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   at 10-11. Commerce concluded that because respondents' import duty liabilities during the POI are similar to costs, Commerce's \"general practice of examining costs and expenses during the POI\" justifies the adoption of the POI limitation in this matter.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2041%2C971\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2041%2C971\">\n    at 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiffs persuasively counter that Commerce's explanation is unreasonable given the operation of the Turkish drawback program, and Commerce's own treatment of various other margin adjustments. Plaintiffs explain that the respondents' imports of raw materials consumed in the POI \"may, or may not, have been imported under one of the DIIBs used - or opened, or closed - in the POI,\" and that there \"is literally no linkage between DIIB usage and cost accounting, particularly since the duties foregone do not show up in the respondent's accounting system at all.\" Pls.' Cmts. at 11. Plaintiffs also explain\n   that Commerce's claimed \" 'general practice' has so many exceptions that it is more a starting point than an actual practice.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2041%2C971\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2041%2C971\">\n    at 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

And here, Plaintiffs' duty drawback is \"\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   recorded in a company's books.\" Pls.' Cmts. at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Understanding that its primary justification was inadequate alone, Commerce provided a \"secondary\" rationale for the POI limitation, contending that it helped to make computing respondents' duty drawback \"more administrable for Commerce.\"\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   at 8. According to Commerce: \"1) it affords Commerce sufficient time to analyze the data and notify respondents of any deficiencies; 2) it avoids the potential for the double counting of claims in multiple segments; and 3) it provides predictability and transparency in the administration of duty drawback claims.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2041%2C971\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2041%2C971\">\n    at 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Regarding the need for time to confirm the accuracy of data, Commerce reasoned that it would be \"impracticable for Commerce to rely on information concerning DIIBs closed after the POI\" because \"Commerce must review numerous spreadsheets, duplicate and confirm calculations set forth by the respondents and confirm calculations set forth by respondents and analyze them for errors, and conduct a new analysis to determine whether the revised data meet Commerce's two-prong test.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17. Although Commerce poses an interesting hypothetical of impracticability, there was no impracticability here because Commerce verified the usage and closure of the DIIBs on the record, including those that closed after the POI, and all of which included exports to the United States made during the POI.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Cmts. at 6, 13, 23. Commerce's stated concerns about the timeliness of drawback data submissions do not apply to this administrative record. This action simply does not involve untimely information or a failure to honor statutory and regulatory time limits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2041%2C971\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2041%2C971\">\n    at 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And Commerce's verification of all the closed DIIBs belies its arguments that it would be impracticable to do so. Commerce did it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Commerce's next reason about possible double-counting lacks merit. Commerce felt that without the POI limitation Commerce would need a DIIB tracking system \"to prevent counting the same DIIB in multiple segments of a particular proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   at 18. Commerce's double-counting rationale fails because a DIIB simply cannot be double-counted from one segment to the next. Pls.' Cmts. at 15. The duty drawback ratio is not exhausted by its having been reported in a given segment of a proceeding.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2041%2C971\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2041%2C971\">\n    at 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Two exports that are in different administrative review periods that occur on the same DIIB are entitled to the same adjustment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2041%2C971\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   And although Commerce hopes that, \"the acceptance of DIIBs closed as of particular date ... lends additional transparency and predictability to the administration of the antidumping law,\"\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   at 18, Plaintiffs persuasively counter that there is no \"element of predictability or transparency served by denying a drawback adjustment that has been verified and the accuracy of which is not in question.\" Pls.' Cmts. at 15. The court agrees with Plaintiffs. Commerce's imposition of the POI limitation in this matter unreasonably undercuts its stated goals of accuracy, transparency, and predictability by ignoring verified record information. The one reasonable thing to do here is calculate Plaintiffs' duty drawback adjustments consistent with that verified information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
