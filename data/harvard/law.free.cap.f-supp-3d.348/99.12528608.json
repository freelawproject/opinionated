The salient events are as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Schulter joined Egenera on October 2, 2000. On April 20, 2001, Egenera submitted to the United Statement Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) the provisional application to which the '430 patent claims priority, listing Schulter amongst its eleven inventors. The utility application was subsequently filed on January 4, 2002, and the '430 patent issued in due course on June 12, 2007. Egenera instituted this patent infringement action against Cisco in August of 2016, identifying Schulter as an inventor of the '430 patent in its initial and supplemental disclosures in March, May, and June of 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In April of 2017, Cisco petitioned the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) for\n   <em>\n    inter partes\n   </em>\n   review (IPR) of the '430 patent, contending,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that certain claims of the '430 patent are obvious in view of prior art (including a patent (Grosner)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   with a priority date of November 2, 2000). On August 16, 2017, Egenera responded to the IPR petition, arguing, in part, that Grosner did not constitute prior art because the '430 patent was earlier conceived. (The '430 patent is governed by the first-to-invent rules predating the America Invents Act.) In support, Egenera relied on a document entitled \"Egenera Interframe I/O Architecture,\" dated September 29, 2000, and authored by inventor Max Smith, which according to Egenera, fully described the patented invention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Interframe I/O Architecture document precedes Schulter's employment by Egenera. On September 11, 2017, Egenera petitioned the PTO to remove Schulter as an inventor of the '430 patent. In support, Egenera offered a declaration signed by Schulter on August 15, 2017, stating that he was erroneously named as an inventor. The remaining ten inventors also declared that they either agreed with or did not disagree with Schulter's removal. The PTAB denied institution of the IPR on November 13, 2017, without making any finding as to the priority of the '430 patent. On January 15, 2018, the PTO approved Egenera's petition to remove Schulter as an inventor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Cisco contends that Schulter is an inventor of the '430 patent, and that his exclusion invalidates the patent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Checkpoint Sys., Inc. v.

(While not at issue for the purposes of this opinion, Cisco also alleges that Egenera submitted false affidavits to remove Schulter in order to antedate critical prior art and avoid invalidation before the PTAB.) For its part, Egenera maintains that Schulter was innocently misnamed as an inventor on the '430 patent applications, that it realized the error in the process of responding to the IPR petition and has since corrected it, and that further, should Schulter now prove to be a bona-fide inventor, the remedy is correction, not invalidation.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11708313\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/155/1344/#p1349\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"If a patentee can demonstrate that inventorship can be corrected as provided by [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20256\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ], a district court must order correction of the patent, thus saving it from being rendered invalid.\"),\n   <em>\n    quoting\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pannu\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11708313\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/155/1344/#p1349\">\n    155 F.3d at 1350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-15\">\n    Putting aside allegations of inequitable conduct, the court agrees with Cisco as a threshold matter that Egenera may not now seek to restore Schulter as an inventor to rectify any nonjoinder.

Egenera's suggestion that Schulter may be relisted as an inventor as circumstances may dictate is \"clearly inconsistent\" with its September 2017 petition to the PTO, submitted with affidavits from Schulter and the ten remaining inventors, that Schulter's name was erroneously listed.

As is clear from the chronology,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , disavowing Schulter enabled Egenera to advance an earlier priority date before the PTAB (Egenera could not have plausibly asserted a priority date prior to a joint inventor's hire date).

Jonathan Chao, another of Egenera's expert witnesses, opined that that \"all of the limitations of the claims of the '430 patent are supported by the [Egenera Interframe I/O Architecture document as incorporated in] the [ (provisional) ] Application.\" Egenera Ex. 22 (Dkt # 164-24) \u00b6\u00b6 4-5.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    Egenera's third corroborating document is entitled \"Egenera Interframe Architecture,\" dated October 1, 2000, and is also authored by Max Smith. The Interframe Architecture document discloses that \"[a]ll application node I/O is routed indirectly through two Interframe controller nodes that actually interface to the external Ethernet and storage area network. Application nodes communicate with the Interframe controller nodes and among themselves via pre-wired connections through two high-speed switch nodes.\" Egenera Ex. 36 (Dkt # 164-40) at EGENERA00006788. Further, \"[t]he node's configuration also expresses the virtual Ethernet network interfaces that will be simulated for the node when it boots. This permits the node to be reached from the external high-speed Ethernet network.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1461379\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/687/450/#p455\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at EGENERA00006799.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    On this record, the court finds a genuine dispute of material fact as to the conception of the VLAN proxy. \"It is settled that in establishing conception a party must show possession of\n    <em>\n     every feature\n    </em>\n    recited in the count, and that\n    <em>\n     every limitation\n    </em>\n    of the count must have been known to the inventor at the time of the alleged conception.\"\n    <em>\n     Coleman\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"288064\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/754/353/#p357\">\n     754 F.2d at 359\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added). The relevant claim limitation - \"logic to modify said received messages to transmit said modified messages to the external communication network and to the external storage network\" - requires both message modification and message transmission functions for each of the two external networks. The VLAN proxy \"bridges the virtual LAN server 335 to the external network 125[,] ... [and] convert[s] the internal virtual MAC addresses from each node to the single external MAC assigned to the system 100.\" '430 patent, col. 18, ll. 40-44. According to Schulter's Interframe Architecture document, this is the VLAN proxy's \"primary function.\" Cisco Ex. 45 at EGENERA01836885. The VLAN proxy modifies outgoing messages before transmitting to the external communication network - \"it replace [sic] the internal format MAC address with the MAC address of the physical Ethernet device 129 as the source MAC address.\" '430 patent, col. 18, ll. 56-58;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Cisco Ex. 45 at EGENERA01836886 (the VLAN proxy \"replace [sic] the internal Giganet based MAC address with the MAC address of the physical Ethernet device as the source MAC address.\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Egenera's priority documents, in sum, describe \"Controller modules\" (the Egenera Interframe document) or \"controller nodes\" (the Interframe I/O Architecture and Interframe Architecture documents) that interface between internal application nodes/processors and the external communication network. \"Packets destined for the external network are forwarded through the Giganet switch to one of the Interframe controller nodes, where I/O logic forwards the packet out onto the actual external network interface.\" Egenera Ex. 19 at EGENERA00006805. The priority documents do not explicitly disclose modifying messages before transmitting them to the external communication network. Nevertheless, a question remains whether the priority documents sufficiently corroborate the conception of the message modification function for messages going to the external communication network. For the parallel functions of message modification and transmission to the external storage network (which are covered by the same claim limitation), the Interframe I/O document describes the use of \"local device numbers,\" and that \"I/O server logic in the Interframe controller node is aware of which node sent the request and is able to\n    <em>\n     translate\n    </em>\n    that node's device number into the proper actual partition on the external storage area network or on an Interframe controller hard drive.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"288064\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/754/353/#p357\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at EGENERA00006807 (emphasis added). While there is no discussion of address translation for messages going to the external communication network, the Interframe I/O document describe the assignment and use of internal \"simulated MAC addresses.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"288064\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/754/353/#p357\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at EGENERA00006810.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Accepting\n    <em>\n     arguendo\n    </em>\n    that Egenera's priority documents corroborate the claimed modification function for messages bound for the external communication network, Cisco argues that they do not disclose the structures for performing this function.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Greenberg v.

While Egenera's priority documents indicate that \"each controller nodes is connected ... by ...
