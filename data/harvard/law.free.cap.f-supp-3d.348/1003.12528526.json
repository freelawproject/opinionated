Gov't Code section 12940 et seq., in the Superior Court of Alameda County, California. With a demurrer pending, Gamble filed a First Amended Complaint. When a demurrer to the First Amended Complaint was sustained with leave to amend, Gamble was permitted to file a Second Amended Complaint which added claims under 42 U.S.C. section 1981. Gamble's Second Amended Complaint was then removed to this Court on November 16, 2017 by defendants Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. (\"Health Plan\"), Kaiser Foundation Hospitals (\"Hospitals\"); and The Permanente Medical Group (\"Medical Group\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 1.) Gamble then filed a new amended complaint on January 12, 2018, in this Court. (Dkt. No. 18.) Defendants filed a motion to dismiss and a motion to strike. Gamble filed a motion for Sanctions under Rule 11 against defendants. (Dkt. No. 35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Thereafter, in April 2018 and before the Court ruled on the pending motions, Gamble sought and was granted leave to file a new iteration of the complaint, styled as a Second Amended Complaint, adding new claims and a new plaintiff, Sheila Kennedy. (Dkt. No. 38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Presently pending before the Court are three motions: (1) defendants' motion dismiss the complaint under Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) (Dkt. No. 44); (2) defendants' motion to strike allegations therein under\n   the California anti-SLAPP statute, Cal. Code of Civil Proc. section 425.16 and Rule 12(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Dkt. No. 45), and plaintiff Gamble's motion for Rule 11 Sanctions (Dkt. No. 35).

BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs Lunell Gamble and Sheila Kennedy allege that they worked for defendants Hospitals, Health Plan, and Medical Group which they allege act as a single employer, \"Kaiser.\" (SAC, Dkt. No. 38, \u00b6 12.) Plaintiffs are African-American women over the age of 40 who allege they were denied promotions and involuntarily terminated by Kaiser. Plaintiffs seek to represent a class of African-Americans, and subclasses of female African-Americans and older African-Americans, who were employed at Kaiser in the northern California region, and (1) were denied promotion, (2) were terminated, or (3) complained internally or to a governmental entity regarding race or age discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    The SAC alleges that, beginning in 1997, Gamble worked in Kaiser's Human Resources department. Gamble alleges that she was denied promotions and subjected to a pattern and practice of discrimination, despite her qualifications and excellent performance. (SAC \u00b6 44.) She alleges she also was subjected to harassment and unreasonable scrutiny by the person who began supervising her in July 2012, Rosa Grajeda. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 43-44.) Gamble asserts that Grajeda and Kaiser determined to terminate her under false pretenses, and ultimately terminated her on July 29, 2014. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 45, 46.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    Kennedy began working at Kaiser in October of 1997, and worked in various positions in the Chemical Dependency and Rehabilitation Program. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6 47.) Kennedy alleges she was denied promotions, transfers, pay raises, and other benefits that were given to non-African-American employees, even though her performance and qualifications were equal to or better than those employees. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 48, 49.) She further alleges that she was threatened, retaliated against, and ultimately terminated\n    because of her race and because she made complaints regarding Kaiser's non-compliance with civil rights laws. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 49.) Ultimately, Kennedy alleges that she was subjected to disciplinary proceedings based on false information and was terminated in February 2016. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 49.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    <strong>\n     II. MOTION TO DISMISS\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    Defendants seek to dismiss certain claims brought by Gamble and Kennedy on the grounds of: (a) failure to exhaust their administrative remedies; (b) untimeliness of the charge or suit; and (c) failure to allege the claim sufficiently. The Court considers each in turn.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    <strong>\n     A.

In addition, defendants argue as to the individual plaintiffs that: (4) Gamble failed to exhaust \"pattern and practice\" claims, including those alleging gender discrimination and failure to promote; (5) Kennedy failed to exhaust any promotion claim timely in either her 2017 or 2018 charge; and (6) Kennedy failed to exhaust an age-based promotion claim. Each is addressed below.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      1. Failure to Exhaust Disparate Impact Discrimination Claims\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    Defendants move to dismiss plaintiffs' first cause of action for violation of Title VII, section 1981, and FEHA on account of \"disparate impact in promotion\" based upon race, and upon the subcategories of race plus gender and race plus age on the grounds of failure to exhaust. (SAC at 23:16-18.) In that First Cause of Action, plaintiffs allege that Kaiser \"maintained a system for making decisions about training, performance reviews, discipline, assignments, pay, classifications, transfer, retention and promotion into supervisory and management positions which is arbitrary, subjective, retaliatory, lacking in non-discriminatory processes and which has a disparate impact on African-American employees.\" (SAC \u00b6 61.) They further allege that \"Kaiser's subjective and race and race-gender-based system is not justified by business necessity or, if it could be justified, less discriminatory alternatives exist.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    )\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    Defendants contend the disparate impact claim should be dismissed for failure to exhaust their disparate impact theory in their administrative charges because plaintiffs did not identify a specific policy or practice in their administrative charges. Plaintiffs counter with two arguments: (1) Kennedy identified the facially neutral policies underlying the First Cause of Action in her request to DFEH even though the allegations were not included in the charge finalized by the DFEH representative; and (2) plaintiffs did not need to state their disparate impact theory expressly in the charge because it falls \"within the scope of the administrative investigation which can reasonably be expected to grow out of the charge of discrimination.\"\n    <em>\n     Rodriguez v.

The\n    employer simply treats some people less favorably than others because of their race, color, religion, sex, or other protected characteristic. Liability in a disparate-treatment case depends on whether the protected trait actually motivated the employer's decision. By contrast, disparate-impact claims involve employment practices that are facially neutral in their treatment of different groups but that in fact fall more harshly on one group than another and cannot be justified by business necessity. Under a disparate-impact theory of discrimination, a facially neutral employment practice may be deemed illegally discriminatory without evidence of the employer's subjective intent to discriminate that is required in a disparate-treatment case.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    <em>\n     Raytheon Co. v.

It does not follow, however, that the particular supervisors to whom this discretion is delegated always act without discriminatory intent. Furthermore, even if one assumed that any such discrimination can be adequately policed through disparate treatment analysis, the problem of subconscious stereotypes and prejudices would remain.... If an employer's undisciplined system of subjective decisionmaking has precisely the same effects as a system pervaded by impermissible intentional discrimination, it is difficult to see why Title VII's proscription against discriminatory actions should not apply.... accordingly ... subjective or discretionary employment practices may be analyzed under the disparate impact approach in appropriate cases.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    <em>\n     Watson v.

(Friedman Decl. \u00b6 20;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Oppo. to Motion to Dismiss at 11:13-14.) Those additional allegations included a contention that Kaiser maintained \"policies and practices\" of reliance on vague, subjective criteria for employment decisions which resulted in disadvantages to African-Americans and African-American female employees. (Friedman Decl., Exh. C at \u00b6 10.)\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    In response, defendants merely argue that the \"Court need not 'dig through [plaintiffs'] opposition\" to find a reason to deny the motion. (Reply to Motion to Dismiss at 4:24.) In light of plaintiffs' representations about the allegations omitted in the administrative process on Kennedy's charges, the Court finds that it cannot take judicial notice of the administrative charges in connection with this issue without converting the motion to one for summary judgment, which it declines to do.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Next, Gamble does not dispute defendants' argument as it relates to her charge, but instead relies on the allegations in Kennedy's charges under the single-filing or \"piggybacking\" rule. \"An aggrieved employee who fails to file a timely charge\" may satisfy the exhaustion requirement by reference to the timely charge filed by another plaintiff\n    <em>\n     Arizona ex rel.

Gamble's right to sue letter is dated August 10, 2015. (RJN Exh. B.) She filed her lawsuit in state court on August 9, 2016, alleging only FEHA claims. Any claims based upon that right to sue letter and underlying charge were timely with respect under FEHA's one-year limit, but filed after the 90-day limit, and therefore untimely, as to Title VII and ADEA claims. Thus, Gamble's Title VII and ADEA claims were time-barred. Therefore, to the extent that the causes of action in the SAC are alleged under Title VII and/or the ADEA, the motion to dismiss on those grounds is\n    <strong>\n     GRANTED\n    </strong>\n    .\n    <footnotemark>\n     10\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    <strong>\n     C.

(SAC at 23:16-18.) In that First Cause of Action, plaintiffs allege that Kaiser \"maintained a system for making decisions about training, performance reviews, discipline, assignments, pay, classifications, transfer, retention and promotion into supervisory and management positions which is arbitrary, subjective, retaliatory, lacking in non-discriminatory processes and which has a disparate impact on African-American employees.\" (SAC \u00b6 61.)

However, under the reasoning in\n    <em>\n     Watson\n    </em>\n    and cases following from it, as discussed above, plaintiffs' allegations of a completely arbitrary and subjective system for making employment decisions including promotions are sufficient to state a claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    The motion to dismiss on these grounds is therefore\n    <strong>\n     DENIED\n    </strong>\n    .\n    <footnotemark>\n     11\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    <strong>\n     III.

There, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to demonstrate that each challenged claim based on protected activity is legally sufficient and factually substantiated. The court, without resolving evidentiary conflicts, must determine whether the plaintiff's showing, if accepted by the trier of fact, would be sufficient to sustain a favorable judgment. If not, the claim is stricken. Allegations of protected activity supporting the stricken claim are eliminated from the complaint, unless they also support a distinct claim on which the plaintiff has shown a probability of prevailing.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    <em>\n     Baral v.
