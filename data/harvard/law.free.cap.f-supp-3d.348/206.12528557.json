SPATT, United States District Judge\n   On December 1, 2017, Thomas Sidik (\"T. Sidik\" or the \"Plaintiff\") commenced this action individually, as Administrator of the Estate of Kristen A. Sidik (\"K. Sidik\"), his wife, and on behalf of K.S. and C.S., his two infant children (the \"Children\"), against Royal Sovereign International Inc., Royal Centurion Inc. (together, the \"Royal Defendants\"), RS Ningbo, Inc., Royal Sovereign Qingdao a/k/a RS Qingdao (together, the \"Non-Appearing Defendants\"), BJ's Wholesale, Inc. (\"BJs\"), ADT LLC (\"ADT\"), and Defenders, Inc. d/b/a Protect Your Home (\"Defenders\") (all together, the \"Defendants\") after a fire at his home on August 24, 2016. The incident caused severe injuries to the Children and K. Sidik. Later that year, K. Sidik passed away from her injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Plaintiff asserts the following claims: (1) negligence against the Royal Defendants, the Non-Appearing Defendants and BJs; (2) negligence against ADT and Defenders; (3) breach of express warranty against the Royal Defendants, the Non-Appearing Defendants and BJs; (4) breach of implied warranty against the Royal Defendants, the Non-Appearing Defendants and BJs; (5) failure to warn against the Royal Defendants, the Non-Appearing Defendants and BJs; (6) strict liability against the Royal Defendants, the Non-Appearing Defendants and BJs; and (7) wrongful death against the Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Presently before the Court is a motion by ADT and Defenders (together, the \"Moving Defendants\"), pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (\" FED. R. CIV. P. \" or \"Rule\") 12(b)(6), seeking to dismiss the second and seventh claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   For the following reasons, the Moving Defendants' motion to dismiss is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Unless otherwise noted, the following facts are drawn from the Plaintiff's complaint, and for the purposes of the instant motion, are construed in favor of the Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On or about June 6, 2012, T. Sidik and K. Sidik purchased a portable air conditioner manufactured by the Royal Defendants. This air conditioning was placed in the dining room of the family home, located at 38 Sterling Lane in Smithtown, New York (the \"Residence\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Later that month, T. Sidik entered into an alarm services contract with Defenders (the \"Contract\"), an ADT authorized detailer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. F-1, Dkt. 29. The Contract had an initial term of three years and covered \"alarm monitoring and notification\n   services\" as well as equipment installation and connection. It was signed by T. Sidik and was subsequently assigned to ADT. The Plaintiff agreed to a monthly service rate of $44.99. The Contract includes a disclaimer that Defender is not an insurer of the safety of persons or the condition of the property covered. The Plaintiff purchased an Impassa Base, key fob, wireless carbon monoxide detector, cellular backup, two wireless door/window sensors, three wireless shock detectors and a wireless smoke communicator. In pertinent part, the Contract details the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-19\">\n   You acknowledge that: (a) We have explained the full range of protection, equipment, and services available to You, (b) additional protection over and above that provided herein is available and may be obtained from Us at an additional cost to you (c) You desire and have contracted for only the equipment and services itemized on this Contract ...

THESE OBLIGATIONS WILL APPLY EVEN IF SUCH LAWSUIT OR OTHER CLAIM ARISES OUT OF OUR NEGLIGENCE, GROSS NEGLIGENCE, FAILURE TO PERFORM DUTIES UNDER THIS CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ANY APPLICABLE LAW, OR OTHER FAULT.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    The Contract at 2-4 (capitalization in original). In paragraph 10, the Contract provides a one-year statute of limitations from the date of the \"event that resulted in loss, injury, damage or liability.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    On the evening of August 23, 2016 to the early morning of August 24, 2016, a fire engulfed the Residence. At the time K. Sidik and the Children were at the Residence and in bed. As a result of the fire, K. Sidik and the Children suffered serious injuries. K. Sidik was hospitalized until December 15, 2016, when she passed away from her injuries.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    The Plaintiff alleges that the fire began in the portable air conditioner and that the plastic encasement in the unit caused \"thick, hot, toxic smoke [to] permeate[ ] throughout the [Residence].\" He contends that the smoke detector was negligently installed by Defenders on the basement wall, which purportedly violated industry codes and standards, the manufacturer's installation instructions, and company policies. By the time the smoke from the fire reached the smoke detector, which was installed on a wall in the basement, and alerted the central station monitoring service, the bedrooms where the Children and K. Sidik were located were already engulfed in smoke.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    On February 7, 2018, the Moving Defendants filed the instant motion, seeking to dismiss the second and seventh causes of action, the only claims that relate to their liability. The notice of motion incorrectly states that they seek dismissal of cross-claims against the Moving Defendants prior to their service. At that time, no cross claims had been asserted against the Moving Defendants. On March 1, 2018, the Royal Defendants filed their answer and included a cross-claim against the Moving Defendants and the Non-Appearing Defendants. Two weeks later, BJs filed its own answer and also included a cross-claim against the Moving Defendants and the Non-Appearing Defendants. In their reply briefing papers, the Moving Defendants acknowledge the mistake, which was the result of an oversight. Under these circumstances, the Court considers the portion of the instant motion related to cross-claims withdrawn and will not consider any related arguments.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    <strong>\n     II.

The Second Circuit has expounded that, after\n    <em>\n     Twombly,\n    </em>\n    the Court's inquiry under Rule 12(b)(6) is guided by two principles:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n    First, although a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint, that tenet is inapplicable to legal conclusions, and [t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice. Second, only a complaint that states a plausible claim for relief survives a motion to dismiss and [d]etermining whether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief will ... be a context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    <em>\n     Harris v.

Sidik and the Children directly benefitted from the monitoring services. The terms contained in the Contract clearly evince an intention to benefit all persons residing at the Residence. Furthermore, New York State courts have uniformly held that a spouse that lives in a residence which is subject to the terms of a services agreement is subject to the terms of that agreement, regardless of whether he or she was also present when a spouse signed the agreement.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Corbett\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3617341\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/687/124/#p128\">\n     687 F.Supp.2d at 133\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (collecting cases).

Sidik and the Children are all subject to the shortened contractual statute of limitations period, T. Sidik argues that his claims are tolled, pursuant to the CPLR. A contractually agreed limitations period may be tolled by New York State's statutory tolling provisions.\n    <em>\n     Dail v. Merch. Mut. Ins.

Sidik's death. CPLR \u00a7 210(a) states, in pertinent part: \"Where a person entitled to commence an action dies before the expiration of the time within which the action must be commenced and the cause of action survives, an action may be commenced by his representative within one year after his death.\" In other words, when a person able to bring a claim dies before the applicable limitations period ends, the claim may be brought by that person's representative within one year of his or her death.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    The fire occurred in the early morning of August 24, 2016. K. Sidik passed away on December 15, 2016, 112 days after the incident. During that period, the statute of limitations for any claim by or on behalf of K. Sidik was tolled. As the one-year contractually agreed upon statute of limitations period commenced on December 15, 2016, all of K. Sidik's claims expired on December 15, 2017. The instant lawsuit was filed on December 1, 2017, within the applicable statute of limitations. Thus, T. Sidik's claims as Administrator of the Estate of K. Sidik were timely filed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    The Plaintiff also contends that CPLR \u00a7 208 tolls his claims until the Children are 18 years old. If the statute of limitations period is less than three years, CPLR \u00a7 208 tolls the statute of limitations until a plaintiff is no loner disabled due to infancy or insanity. The CPLR defines infancy as a person under the age of 18,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    CPLR \u00a7 105(j). However, \u00a7 208 only extends a claim by a maximum of ten years.

Any such claims must have been filed within one year after (1) they turn 18; or (2) ten years after the incident, whichever occurs first. Although the complaint does not mention the specific age of the Children, it describes them as \"infants\" throughout the document. As mentioned above, this suit was filed on December 1, 2017. Since the incident occurred less than three years ago, the only relevant question before the Court is whether the Children's infancy expired prior to December 1, 2016. Reading the complaint in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff, the Court concludes that the Children were still infants on December 1, 2016. Accordingly, any claims filed on behalf of the Children were timely.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    T. Sidik also commenced this action individually and does not cite any relevant statute or precedent that tolls his individual claims. Without any statutory toll, the statute of limitations for these claims began accruing on August 24, 2016, the date of the incident and ended on August 24, 2017, one year later. The complaint was filed more than three months after the statute of limitations expired for his individual claims. Accordingly, all of the Plaintiff's individual claims against the Moving Defendants are untimely.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    The Moving Defendants' motion to dismiss, insofar as based on the statute of limitations, is granted with respect to the T. Sidik's individual claims and denied with respect to his claims on behalf of K. Sidik and the Children.

It involved a 42-story building in Manhattan and a legally-required central station fire alarm system. This dispute resulted from a decision by a homeowner, who elected to install a residential alarm system in a single-family residence. While the Plaintiff alleges in the complaint that the installation of the fire alarm/smoke detector violated industry standards as well as internal policies and procedures, there is no allegation that the Moving Defendants violated a \"comprehensive scheme of fire-safety regulations,\" which requires a certain level of fire/smoke detection.\n    <em>\n     Sommer\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4423891\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/79/540/\">\n     79 N.Y.2d at 552\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=583%20N.Y.S.2d%20957\">\n     583 N.Y.S.2d 957\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=593%20N.E.2d%201365\">\n     593 N.E.2d 1365\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The\n    <em>\n     Sommer\n    </em>\n    court reasoned that this regulatory scheme, where \"[c]entral station operators ... are franchised and regulated by [New York] City, and may be penalized for failing to transmit alarm signals, provide qualified operators, and other acts and omissions[,]\" created a \"significant public interest\" associated with the service that fire alarm companies provide.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    The Moving Defendants argue that\n    <em>\n     Vigilant Ins.

Mar. 9, 2011) is more relevant to the instant case. There, an individual entered into a contract with ADT whereby ADT agreed to provide that person with equipment and monitoring service for fire and burglary protection. The contract in\n    <em>\n     Vigilant\n    </em>\n    contained subrogation exculpatory and limitation of liability provisions. In 2009, a fire originated in that person's residence. The alarm system failed to send a signal to the central station, which resulted in almost $2 million in property damage. The plaintiff claimed that ADT owed a duty to that individual to properly examine, monitor, test, install, inspect, service, maintain and repair the system. The\n    <em>\n     Vigilant\n    </em>\n    court found that allegations of tortious conduct did not implicate a legal duty independent of the contract and noted that the plaintiff chose to have a fire alarm system installed in his residence and selected ADT to monitor it. The public interest implicated in\n    <em>\n     Sommer\n    </em>\n    was not present in\n    <em>\n     Vigilant\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Here, the Plaintiff chose to have a fire/smoke detection system installed in his home and chose ADT to monitor the system. ADT's responsibility to install, monitor, maintain, and test the system arose from the Contract, not a government-created regulatory scheme.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Vigilant Ins.

As stated in the Contract, the Moving Defendants are not security consultants, and were contracted to render a discrete service. T. Sidik had the option to purchase additional fire/smoke detection but declined. Hence, the public interest discussed in\n    <em>\n     Sommer\n    </em>\n    is not present in the instant case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    Accordingly, there is no basis for negligence liability against the Moving Defendants and the Contract is enforceable against claims of ordinary negligence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    The Plaintiff further alleges gross negligence on the part of the Moving Defendants for negligently installing the fire alarm/smoke detector at the Residence by including a conclusory statement that the Moving Defendants' alarm installation constituted gross negligence.
