PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This is an\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   action involving competing claims to a shipwreck (the\n   <em>\n    res\n   </em>\n   ) that Plaintiff, Global Marine Exploration, Inc. (\"GME\"), discovered near Cape Canaveral, Florida. The parties dispute the identity of the\n   <em>\n    res\n   </em>\n   , but the Republic of France claims that it is\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   , the flagship of the Royal Navy of France 1565 Fleet of Captain Jean Ribault. As discussed below, the sinking of\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   played a pivotal role in France's abandonment of attempts to take possession of Florida and the eventual dominance of Spain in colonizing Florida.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   GME instituted its\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   action in this Court on October 5, 2016. Doc. No. 1. It named as the Defendant the \"Unidentified, Abandoned Shipwrecked Vessel, if any, its apparel, tackle, appurtenances and cargo, if any, located within an area enclosed by a line running from 28.558002\u00b0 -80.509884\u00b0 to 28.520537\u00b0 -80.557306\u00b0 to 28.467799\u00b0 -80.469405\u00b0 and returning to 28.473599\u00b0 - 80.532415\u00b0 ....\" (\"Defendant Vessel\"). Doc. No. 1, at 1. GME alleged that it discovered the Defendant Vessel and that, upon information and belief, \"any and all efforts by any previous owners and/or other parties and/or other entities to salvage the wreckage have been long since abandoned, with the exception of looters, who make no effort to report or document their work.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. It alleged that, \"[w]hile some of the artifacts are believed ... to be from the 1550 to 1650 time period, the\n   ages and identities of the vessels making up the Defendant Site have not been determined ... because [GME] has yet to find any object in the salvage area that might be used to accurately date and identify the wreckage.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. GME set forth four (4) claims: (1) a possessory and ownership claim pursuant to the law of finds, whereby GME claimed entitlement to an adjudication of \"title and ownership in the Defendant Site, and her artifacts, and the right to recover the Defendant Site and her artifacts,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16-17; (2) a salvage award claim pursuant to the law of salvage, whereby GME claimed entitlement to a \"liberal salvage award\" for its salvage services,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18-20; (3) a request for a declaratory judgment that, among other things, declares that no government has the authority to interfere with GME's exploration and recovery of the Defendant Site,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21-23; and (4) a claim for a preliminary injunction prohibiting any rival salvors or entity from conducting search and/or recovery operations at the Defendant Site,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24-26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Upon motion by GME, the Court then issued a warrant of arrest\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   . Doc. Nos. 10, 11. The U.S. Marshals Service arrested the Defendant Vessel constructively by seizing a number of salvaged artifacts. The U.S. Marshals Service subsequently surrendered those artifacts to GME, which the Court had appointed as substitute custodian. Doc. No. 14, 15. GME then complied with the publication requirement of Local Admiralty Rule 7.03(d)(1). No claims or answers were filed in the 14 days following publication, and GME represented that it was unaware of any intervenors in this action. Thus, upon motion by GME, the Court issued a Clerk's default against the Defendant Vessel. Doc. Nos. 17, 19, 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Less than a week after the Clerk's default was entered, the Republic of France appeared in this action. It filed a verified claim to the Defendant Vessel in which it contended that the\n   <em>\n    res\n   </em>\n   is from the French Royal Fleet of 1565 commanded by Jean Ribault and sunk by a hurricane in the vicinity of what is now Cape Canaveral, Florida. Doc. No. 26. In its claim, it asserted that it had not abandoned its sovereignty over the vessel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At the same time, the Republic of France also filed a motion to set aside the Clerk's default, which was granted. Doc. Nos. 30, 34. A few days later, the State of Florida appeared in the case and filed a verified claim to the Defendant Vessel. Doc. Nos. 36, 41. The State of Florida made clear that its claim was expressly subordinate to the claim of the Republic of France and that it supported the Republic of France's claim to the Defendant Vessel. It contended that, if the\n   <em>\n    res\n   </em>\n   is not a sovereign ship of the Republic of France, the State of Florida would be its owner because it is embedded in the sovereign submerged lands of the State of Florida and has been abandoned by its previous owner. Doc. No. 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In its motion to set aside the Clerk's default, the Republic of France filed documents suggesting that GME may have made certain misrepresentations in its verified complaint and that GME was not properly in possession of the artifacts it presented to the Court for constructive arrest. Accordingly, I issued an Order to Show Cause requiring GME to show cause, in writing, why the orders granting its motion for issuance of a warrant of arrest\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   and its motion to be appointed substitute custodian should not be vacated as having been improvidently granted. Doc. No. 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Thereafter, I held a telephonic status conference. Doc. No. 43. Following the status conference, I entered an Order vacating my previous Order appointing GME as the substitute custodian and appointing the\n   State of Florida, Bureau of Archaeological Research as the new substitute custodian in this case. In that Order, I also prohibited further recovery activity on the Defendant Vessel pending further Order of the Court. Doc. Nos. 45-46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In the meantime, GME filed a response to my Order to Show Cause. Doc. No. 37. The Republic of France and the State of Florida replied to that response, Doc. Nos. 54, 56, after which GME supplemented its response with additional evidence, Doc. Nos. 55, 57-63. The State of Florida also filed an affidavit in which it detailed certain apparent problems with the manner in which GME transferred the artifacts to the State of Florida pursuant to my Order appointing the State of Florida as the new substitute custodian. Doc. No. 64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Following an additional telephonic status conference, I withdrew the Order to Show Cause, subject to reconsideration, if appropriate, after the issue of subject matter jurisdiction was resolved. Doc. No. 68. I also set a schedule for the briefing of the Republic of France's motion to dismiss, as well as a schedule for discovery and summary judgment briefing as to the State of Florida's claim. Doc. Nos. 70, 71.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Ultimately, the Republic of France filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), arguing that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction because the\n   <em>\n    res\n   </em>\n   is the French Royal Vessel\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   and has immunity from GME's claims. Doc. No. 75. It supported its motion with more than 800 pages of evidence, including declarations from (1) Marie-Laurence Navarri, a Magistrate Judge of the Republic of France and Attach\u00e9 for Judicial Affairs of the Embassy of France to the United States (Doc. No. 75-1); (2) Frank Lestringant, a historian and Professeur des Universit\u00e9s at the Universit\u00e9 de Paris-Sorbonne (Doc. Nos. 75-2 through 75-13, 81-14 through 81-29, and 104, at 5-14 (CM/ECF page numbers)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ); (3) Sylvie Soria Leluc, head of the Artillery Department at the Mus\u00e9e de l'Arm\u00e9e in Paris (Doc. No. 75-14); and James P. Delgado, Ph.D., RPA, a maritime archaeologist and maritime historian (Doc. Nos. 75-15 through 75-26, 81-1 through 81-13, 84-1, at 4-20 (CM/ECF page numbers), and 104, at 15 through 25 (CM/ECF page numbers) ). The declarations of Lestringant and Delgado were supported by primary source materials (with translations) as well as excerpts from various treatises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   GME filed a response to the Republic of France's motion to dismiss. Doc. No. 79. It supported its motion with declarations from Dr. Robert H. Baer, a professional archaeologist (Doc. Nos. 79-1 and 79-2) and Robert F. Marx, a maritime archaeologist and historian (Doc. Nos. 79-3 through 79-4). It also filed an excerpt from what appears to be the introduction to a translation of a primary source document (Doc. No. 79-5), excerpts from two treatises (Doc. Nos. 79-6 and 105\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ), and a journal article (Doc. Nos. 79-7 and 79-8). With leave of court, the Republic of France filed a reply, Doc. No. 84, which was supported by a declaration from the Republic of France's counsel (Doc. No. 84-1) and a declaration from John de Bry, Ph.D., an historian (Doc. No. 84-2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After filing an answer (Doc. No. 72) and conducting discovery, the State of Florida filed a\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   motion to exclude GME's experts (Doc. No. 96) and a motion for partial summary judgment (Doc. No. 97), both of which were supported by evidence. GME filed responses in opposition to both motions. Doc. Nos. 98, 99.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Before the Republic of France and the State of Florida filed their claims, GME consented to a magistrate judge conducting all proceedings in this case, including trial, the entry of judgment, and all post-trial proceedings. Doc. No. 6. Based on that consent, the presiding District Judge referred the case to me for all purposes. Doc. No. 8. The Republic of France and the State of Florida ratified that consent after they appeared in the case. Doc. No. 47. Thus, the pending motions are properly before me, and they are ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After conducting a thorough review of the parties' briefs, as well as all of the evidence filed in support of their motions, and for the reasons explained below, the Court concludes that the Republic of France has established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the\n   <em>\n    res\n   </em>\n   is the French sovereign vessel,\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   , and, thus, that the Republic of France's motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is due to be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

As detailed elsewhere in this Order, it makes a factual attack to the Court's subject matter jurisdiction over the\n   <em>\n    res\n   </em>\n   . The Eleventh Circuit addressed the standard for deciding such a motion to dismiss\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   claims against a sovereign vessel in\n   <em>\n    Odyssey Marine Exploration, Inc. v.

In the\n   <em>\n    Odyssey Marine Appeal\n   </em>\n   opinion, the Eleventh Circuit concluded, \"[W]hen a party raises a factual attack to subject matter jurisdiction ... the district court is not obligated to take the allegations in the complaint as true.

No. 75-14 \u00b6\u00b6 13-15 and pages 16-24 (CM/ECF page numbers). Sylvie Soria Leluc, the head of the Artillery Department at the Mus\u00e9e de l'Arm\u00e9e in Paris, has opined that the sizes and markings of the cannons are consistent with those listed on the artillery register of\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9.

No. 75-19, at 8; Doc. No. 75-20, at 35. The markings on the monument appear to be very similar to those on the territorial marker that Ribault is known to have placed at the River of May in 1562. Leluc Dec., Doc. No. 75-14 \u00b6 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <em>\n    7. Discussion.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   After reviewing all of the parties' evidence, the Court is left with the following conclusions, which are explained in more detail, below: GME found a shipwreck site on the north side of Cape Canaveral, which is in the vicinity of where the evidence shows that\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   sank. That shipwreck site included sixteenth century French cannons that are consistent with the cannons listed on the artillery register of\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   . At the same site, GME found a stone monument bearing the coat of arms of the French king. That monument was similar to another monument the 1562 Ribault fleet planted at the River of May. A contemporaneous record suggests that\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   was carrying multiple such monuments. Taken together, this evidence establishes that the\n   <em>\n    res\n   </em>\n   is more likely than not\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   a. Location.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   As explained above, the\n   <em>\n    res\n   </em>\n   is located near Cape Canaveral (to its north), which is where the weight of the contemporaneous and secondary sources presented to the Court locate the sinking of\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   . Specifically, contemporaneous accounts report that the hurricane blew the Ribault fleet south from St. Augustine.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. No. 81-3, at 91.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   A survivor of the shipwreck told Men\u00e9ndez that three of the ships \"had gone to the bottom\" \"20 or 25 leagues\" from the Matanzas Inlet (where the conversation occurred) and that\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   had been driven into shoals another \"five leagues\" away-again confirming that\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   sank significantly south of the Matanzas Inlet. Doc. No. 81-2, at 428. Most importantly, Men\u00e9ndez and de Mer\u00e1s (his second-in-command) reported that survivors of the Ribault fleet were found building a fort near Cape Canaveral. Doc. No. 84-1, at 440; Doc. No. 81-4, at 123, 127. Those survivors had artillery from \"the flag ship of Juan Rivao that had been lost there\" that was too heavy to be transported by Men\u00e9ndez's ships and certainly could not have been transported far from the site of the shipwreck by the survivors. Doc. No. 84-1, at 440 (Menendez wrote that he \"received information from the Indians, that 70 or 80 Frenchmen were collected together, building a fort at Cape Canaveral ... and that they had much\n   artillery and ammunition that they had taken out of the flag ship of Juan Rivao that\n   <em>\n    had been lost there\n   </em>\n   \") (emphasis added); Doc. No. 81-4, at 126. The 1567 account of Bartolome Barrientos also locates the site of the survivors' fort at Cape Canaveral. Delgado Dec., Doc. No. 75-16 \u00b6 52 and Ex. 10 thereto (Doc. No. 81-7, at xxi; Doc. No. 81-10, at 70, English Translation of\n   <em>\n    Pedro Men\u00e9ndez de Aviles: Founder of Florida\n   </em>\n   (\"[Men\u00e9ndez] was at Fort St. Augustine when some friendly Indians came to report that a number of men, similar to those he had slain, were building a fort and a ship at Cape Canaveral ....\"); Doc. No. 81-11, at 72 (\"November 4, 1565, three days after setting out from Canaveral the site of the Lutheran fort ... the Spanish part began to suffer hunger and fatigue.\"). Moreover, one of GME's own experts-Robert F. Marx-explains that he has \"mounted various expeditions in the area north of Cape Canaveral where [the Ribault ships] were known to be lost ....\" Marx Dec., Doc. No. 79-3 \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   GME's attempts to counter this evidence are unavailing. I address each of its arguments, below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <em>\n    i. The surviving crewmember account.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   First, GME submits that \"[t]he only record as to the location of the sunken ship ...\" comes from the surviving crew member mentioned above and that the surviving crew member reported that\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   sank \"five leagues or about 15 miles south of where they were.\" Doc. No. 79, at 2. According to GME, that means that\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   sank 15 miles south of the Matanzas Inlet, which is near current-day Dead Lake, Florida-some 90 miles north of Cape Canaveral.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This argument is problematic on several levels. Initially, the Court concludes that the crew member's statement (as reported by Men\u00e9ndez) does not, as GME claims, state that\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   sank five leagues from the Matanzas Inlet.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Read in context, the Court finds that, when Men\u00e9ndez reported that the crew member said that\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   was \"five leagues away from them, anchored in three fathoms, near some shoals,\" Men\u00e9ndez was saying that the crew member reported that\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   was driven onto shoals five leagues from the other ships in the Ribault fleet-which were, as reported by the crew member-\"about 20 to 25 leagues\" from the Matanzas Inlet, significantly further south than GME posits. Doc. No. 81-2, at 428. This would bring the site of\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   's demise to approximately 25 to 30 leagues south of Matanzas Inlet. The Republic of France's expert has credibly opined (without objection from GME) that a \"league\" was not a standard measure at the time and could be as great as 6.3 kilometers (just less than 4 miles). Delgado Dec., Doc. No. 75-16, at 16 n. 5. Combining the uncertainty of the meaning of a \"league\" with the conclusion that the crew member was saying that\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   was driven onto shoals five leagues away\n   from where the other Ribault fleet ships were lost, the Court concludes that the crew member's report is not inconsistent with the conclusion that\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   sank near Cape Canaveral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Moreover, even if the crew member's statement means what GME claims it means (that\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   was driven onto shoals five leagues south of the Matanzas Inlet), it is not true that there are no other records as to the location of the sunken ship-most importantly, the eye-witness account of Men\u00e9ndez, who found the survivors of the shipwreck near Cape Canaveral, and the account of Men\u00e9ndez's second-in-command, de Mer\u00e1s.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   If indeed the crew member's account conflicts with those of Men\u00e9ndez and de Mer\u00e1s, the Court credits those accounts over that of the crew member, giving particular weight to Men\u00e9ndez's account. Men\u00e9ndez actually visited the site where the Ribault shipwreck survivors were constructing a fort and saw the artillery that the survivors brought ashore from the shipwreck. Some of the artillery was too heavy for Men\u00e9ndez's ships to transport, and evidence supports the conclusion that the survivors could not have transported it from Dead Lake to Cape Canaveral. Accordingly, the Men\u00e9ndez account supports a finding that\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   wrecked near the survivor camp Men\u00e9ndez found at Cape Canaveral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <em>\n    ii. Fairbanks treatise.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Second, GME notes that, in an 1881 book called\n   <em>\n    History and Antiquities of St. Augustine, Florida\n   </em>\n   , George R. Fairbanks, M.A., opined (in a footnote) that the\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   wrecked \"north of 'Mosquito Inlet', also known as Ponce Inlet, just south of Daytona Beach, Florida\" because \" 'Canaveral, where Ribault wrecked, must have been some point north of Mosquito Inlet, and\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   the cape now bearing that name (emphasis added), as he could not have crossed Mosquito Inlet on his march to Matanzas.' \" Doc. No. 79, at 2-3 (quoting Doc. No. 79-6, at 33 n. 9). The Court does not credit this opinion because it offers no explanation as to how the author concluded that Ribault could not have used an inland route to bypass the Mosquito Inlet (now known as the Ponce Inlet) when he marched from the site of the shipwreck to the Matanzas Inlet.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 84-1, Declaration of James A. Goold and Exs. 5 and 6 thereto. Notably, GME's own expert-Robert F. Marx-posits that the\n   <em>\n    res\n   </em>\n   could be a 1572 shipwreck that occurred \"near Cape Canaveral,\" after which the \"survivors built a small fort\" and \"eventually walked to St. Augustine.\" Doc. No. 79-3, at 11 (CM/ECF page numbers). This suggests that-contrary to the speculation of the Fairbanks excerpt-it was possible for Ribault to have either crossed or bypassed the Mosquito Inlet in the course of a walking journey from Cape Canaveral to the north.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <em>\n    iii. Armstrong treatise.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Third, GME cites to a treatise by Douglas R. Armstrong titled\n   <em>\n    French Castaways at Old Cape Canaveral.\n   </em>\n   GME states that Armstrong discovered mid-sixteenth century European artifacts onshore just south of present-day Turtle Mound, Florida, approximately 30 miles north of the\n   <em>\n    res,\n   </em>\n   and that subsequent archaeological efforts in the early 1990s disclosed numerous additional artifacts from that time period. Then, GME states, \"it is surmised that this is the temporary fort built by the survivors of the\n   <em>\n    Trinite\n   </em>\n   .... Clearly, if it is the site of the temporary fort, it is illogical to assume that the survivors would have cannibalized the ship and carted its remains, including heavy brass cannon, up the beach some thirty miles to build their fort.\" Doc. No. 79, at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The Armstrong treatise does, in fact, surmise that the fort built by survivors of the wreck of\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   was \"located more closely to Turtle Mound than farther south near the Cape tip.\" Doc. No. 105-1, at 43. However, as the Republic of France points out in its reply, the Armstrong treatise also states that \"[a]ll of the French vessels, including the\n   <em>\n    Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   , were soon wrecked on the beaches along a fifty-mile stretch, beginning near today's Ormond Beach and ending at Cape Canaveral.\" Armstrong further writes that \"[t]he\n   <em>\n    Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   ended up at the Cape[,]\" and that Ribault told Men\u00e9ndez that\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   \"had gone ashore near Canaveral.\" Doc. No. 84-1, at 25, 26 (CM/ECF page numbers). Thus, to the extent that the Armstrong treatise posits Turtle Mound as the location for the survivors' fort-and, thus, the shipwreck itself-it is internally inconsistent and entitled to little weight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Moreover, a review of the excerpts of the Armstrong treatise filed by GME makes it clear that Armstrong's Turtle Mound prediction is far from definitive. Instead, Armstrong attempts to estimate the location of the survivors' fort by translating Men\u00e9ndez's accounts of his movements into modern-day distances. That attempt requires him to make a number of assumptions-specifically, that a Spanish league equaled 3.25 miles, that Men\u00e9ndez's troops could march one to one-and-a-half miles per hour, and that Men\u00e9ndez's troops marched only about one mile per hour when they traveled from St. Augustine to the survivors' fort. Doc. No. 105-1, at 42-43. GME did not file enough of the Armstrong treatise for the Court to adequately evaluate Armstrong's conclusion that a Spanish league equaled 3.25 miles, but portions of the excerpt that was filed undermine that conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 105-1, at 42 (noting that Men\u00e9ndez's foot patrol covered \"a known distance of nearly fifteen miles, which was said to be about four leagues,\" which would mean that a league was equivalent to 3.75 miles).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   And even if the 3.25-miles-per-league assumption is correct, the variability in Armstrong's estimates of the speed of Men\u00e9ndez's troops results in a wide possible range for the location of the\n   <em>\n    Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   survivor fort. As Armstrong explains:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   [I]f the average speed remained between one, and one-and-a-half miles per hour, the total distance traveled [by Men\u00e9ndez's troops when marching from St. Augustine to the survivors' fort] would have been somewhere between seventy two and one hundred eight miles .... The ninety-mile mean terminus point is situated midway between modern-day Eddy Point and Gallinipper Point, within the area of North Playa Linda Beach. The entire thirty-six-mile target area, however, is bracketed to its north by Turtle Mound and\n   <em>\n    at the south by the outermost tip of Cape Canaveral.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43 (emphasis added). While Armstrong assumes that the survivors' fort was located at the northern end of that range because of the difficulty of the march (and, thus, close to the French artifacts found near Turtle Mound at the Armstrong Site), his model allows for the fort to have been located as far south as Cape Canaveral, which is consistent with the location of the\n   <em>\n    res\n   </em>\n   in this case. Armstrong assumes that the\n   <em>\n    Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   survivor fort was located close to the artifacts he found near Turtle Mound mainly because he assumes that marching conditions would have caused Men\u00e9ndez's troops to move only at a one-mile-per-hour pace-not because anything definitive links the artifacts to the\n   <em>\n    Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   survivor fort in particular.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Armstrong also does not explain why Men\u00e9ndez and de Mer\u00e1s would have described the location of the fort of the\n   <em>\n    Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   survivors as being at Cape Canaveral if it was, in fact, located some 15-20 miles north of the Cape. In sum, then, the Armstrong treatise\n   is not sufficient to undermine the conclusion that\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   sank near Cape Canaveral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <em>\n    iv. Meide and de Bry journal article.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Finally, GME notes that, in 2014, Chuck Meide and John de Bry published a paper in which they \"clearly assert that the location of the wreck of the\n   <em>\n    Trinite\n   </em>\n   , based upon historical records and the Armstrong fort site is midway between Ponce Inlet, Florida, and Cape Canaveral.\" Doc. No. 79, at 3. Thus, GME notes, \"[t]hese historians and archaeologists place the wreck of the\n   <em>\n    Trinite\n   </em>\n   some 30 to 40 miles from the site of the\n   <em>\n    res\n   </em>\n   in this case.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But, upon review of the entire document, the Meide and de Bry paper does not \"clearly assert\" that the wreck of\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   is \"midway between Ponce Inlet, Florida, and Cape Canaveral.\" Rather, the article states: \"Three of the ships [of the Ribault fleet] were lost in the vicinity of Ponce Inlet, broken to pieces in the surf, while the flagship\n   <em>\n    La Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   was stranded intact on a sandbar 5 to 10 leagues further south, towards Cape Canaveral (Lyon 1976:124).\" Doc. No. 79-7, at 80. Absent any evidence as to the relative distances between Ponce Inlet and Cape Canaveral (which GME has not provided), the Court cannot conclude that Meide and de Bry have placed the wreck \"some 30 to 40 miles\" from the site of the\n   <em>\n    res\n   </em>\n   in this case. On its face, the statement appears to suggest that\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   wrecked near Cape Canaveral. Moreover, the only basis for this statement is a citation to a 1976 book by Eugene Lyon.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 80, 90 (providing citation to Lyon book). Without reviewing the Lyon book and the rationale for the assertion that\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   was stranded on a sandbar 5 to 10 leagues south of the Ponce Inlet, the Court cannot credit this statement. Accordingly, the Meide and de Bry article does not undermine the conclusion that\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   sank near Cape Canaveral.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Ultimately, GME has not come forward with credible evidence undermining the evidence submitted by the Republic of France, which establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   sank near Cape Canaveral, which is where the\n   <em>\n    res\n   </em>\n   is located.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   b. Stone Monument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Next, there is also some evidence that\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   was carrying a stone monument like that discovered by GME. Specifically,\n   in January 1566-just a few months after\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   sank-the Spanish ambassador to France reported as follows: \"Of the captain who went from Bordeaux in the small ship of which I have written your majesty, to Florida, it is also understood here that a Spanish ship sent it to the bottom and they felt this keenly because it carried six marble columns with the arms of this king and many epitaphs to put them in the fort of la Florida.\" Doc. No. 75-16, \u00b6 55 and Ex. 9 thereto, Doc. No. 81-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   It is, of course, true-as GME argues-that Ribault sailed from Dieppe (not Bordeaux) and that\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   sank following a storm (and was not \"sent to the bottom\" by a Spanish ship). GME has not, however, come forward with any evidence suggesting that the French king dispatched some other captain to put stone monuments \"in the fort of la Florida\" in the same time frame as the 1565 Ribault fleet or that another ship sent to Florida on a French royal mission was lost around the same time as\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   . In short, GME has not presented any evidence that the Spanish ambassador could have been speaking of anyone other than Ribault or any ship other than\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   . Given the difficulties of transatlantic communication in the sixteenth century, it is not surprising that the Spanish ambassador would have information that was not completely correct. The Spanish ambassador was writing just a few months after\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   sank, and the evidence establishes that Ribault had been sent on a mission by the French king to Florida. Accordingly, and in the absence of contradictory evidence from GME, the Court concludes that it is more likely than not that the Spanish ambassador was speaking about Ribault and\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   and, thus, that\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   was carrying stone monuments bearing the arms of the French king.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   As explained above, the stone monument at the shipwreck site is very similar to the monument that Ribault placed at the River of May in 1562. Thus, it is more likely than not that the stone monument found at the shipwreck site is a French territorial marker. Its presence at the shipwreck site supports the conclusion that the\n   <em>\n    res\n   </em>\n   is\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   GME does not dispute that the stone monument is French or even that it is a territorial marker like those placed by the 1562 Ribault fleet. Instead, it offers a number of arguments intended to undermine the obvious conclusion-that the\n   <em>\n    res\n   </em>\n   is\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   First, it argues that the\n   <em>\n    res\n   </em>\n   cannot be\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   because the stone monument was not included on the ship's \"manifest.\" Doc. No. 79, at 4. The document to which GME refers is the Register of Artillery. It is not a generalized manifest of everything on board\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   , but instead a register of artillery, munitions, and related supplies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Accordingly, the absence of the stone monument from the register does not undermine the conclusion that, as reported by the Spanish ambassador,\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   was carrying a monument similar to that discovered at the shipwreck site.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   In a similar vein, GME contends that the\n   <em>\n    res\n   </em>\n   cannot be\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   because a report from a Spanish spy in the French court does not mention that\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   was carrying any monuments. Doc. No. 79, at 4. The report of Gabriel de Enveja does not, however, purport to include an exhaustive inventory of the contents of\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9. See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 81-1, at 3-4 (CM/ECF page numbers) (answering, in response to the question, \"What munitions and victuals do they carry?\": \"The munitions they carry are very great, because they tell me that they carry a lot of gunpowder and shot, 200 reinforced cannons which go unmounted to put in the said fort which they have made there. They carry many hatchets, hammers and dies-victuals for land and victuals for sea, for coming and going, for land, provisions for one year.\"). Therefore, Enveja's failure to mention a stone monument does not support a conclusion that no stone monuments were aboard\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Next, GME argues that the stone monument located at the shipwreck site is not a monument carried by\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   , but rather the monument that Ribault placed at the River of May in 1562: \"Ribault ... placed two monuments in 1562, one of which has never been located. It is entirely possible that another Spanish captain acting under the same order as Rojas, located the other monument, loaded it onto his ship, and subsequently wrecked at Cape Canaveral without any documentation of it.\" Doc. No. 79, at 5-6. GME and its experts offer no evidence\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   to support this\n   rank speculation. France has submitted evidence suggesting that\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   was carrying stone territorial markers. Based on the persuasive evidence, the Court determines that it is more likely than not that the stone monument found at the shipwreck site is there because it was carried by\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   c. Cannons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Finally, the Court concludes that the cannons GME located at the site also support the conclusion that the\n   <em>\n    res\n   </em>\n   is\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   . As explained above, GME found three bronze cannons at the shipwreck site. Sylvie Soria Leluc, the head of the Artillery Department at the Mus\u00e9e de l'Arm\u00e9e in Paris, has opined that the markings on the cannons identify them as sixteenth century French culverins. Leluc Dec., Doc. No. 75-14 \u00b6\u00b6 14-15. GME does not dispute that opinion.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   Baer Dec., Doc. No. 79-2 \u00b6 15 (\"The provenance (origin) of the three bronze cannon ... are clearly French.\"). Leluc has also opined that cannons discovered by GME correspond in size to the culverins listed on the registers of artillery for\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   . Leluc Dec., Doc. No. 75-14 \u00b6 17. Again, GME submits no evidence to undermine that conclusion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Instead, GME offers more speculation. Specifically, it argues, \"The fact that the cannon were of French origin, however, does not prove they were on a French ship, when they were lost. It is just as probable that the cannon were captured by the Spanish and placed aboard one of its ships, along with the monument, and that ship sank at Cape Canaveral.\" Doc. No. 79, at 6. The Court rejects this argument for\n   the same reasons it rejected GME's speculative arguments about the stone monument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <em>\n    8. Finding.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Based on the above evidence, the Court concludes that the\n   <em>\n    res\n   </em>\n   is\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    res\n   </em>\n   is located near Cape Canaveral, which is where\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   is known to have sunk. The shipwreck site includes cannons that correspond to the artillery register of\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   . And\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   was known to be carrying a stone monument similar to the monument found at the shipwreck site. Taken together, these facts establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the\n   <em>\n    res\n   </em>\n   is\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9. See also\n   </em>\n   Delgado Dec., Doc. No. 75-16 \u00b6 56-58 (opining that the\n   <em>\n    res\n   </em>\n   is\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   ). GME has not come forward with sufficient evidence to undermine this conclusion. Instead, GME and its experts rely for the most part on speculation: Maybe some unnamed non-French ship somehow gained control of cannons like those on\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   and a territorial monument like that on\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   and then happened to sink in the exact place that\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   is known to have sunk-all without leaving any documentary evidence that can be presented to the Court. Such arguments, \"which simply advance metaphysical doubt,\" \"propos[e] explanations other than the obvious,\" and suggest pure happenstance as the \"more reasonable hypothesis\" are not persuasive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Odyssey Marine District Court\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3686620\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/675/1126/#p1138\">\n    675 F.Supp.2d at 1134, 1135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Because the Court has concluded that the\n   <em>\n    res\n   </em>\n   is\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   and it is undisputed that\n   <em>\n    la Trinit\u00e9\n   </em>\n   is the sovereign property of the Republic of France, the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the\n   <em>\n    res.\n   </em>\n   Therefore, the Republic of France's motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is due to be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

This opinion is not persuasive because Marx does not explain how he concluded-on the basis of a picture of a portion of the monument found at the shipwreck site-that the monument discovered by GME is the monument that Ribault planted at the River of May in 1562, as opposed to a similar monument. Others of Marx's arguments are similarly not persuasive because they are based on pure speculation.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g., Marx\n    </em>\n    Dec., Doc. No. 79-3, at 9-14 (CM/ECF page numbers) (listing other shipwrecks that occurred near Cape Canaveral and speculating, without supporting evidence, that any one of them could be the source of the French cannons and French territorial marker discovered by GME). Finally, Marx opines that \"positively identifying a shipwreck [on the basis of artifacts found at the shipwreck site] is extremely difficult if not impossible\" because sometimes the artifacts found in a shipwreck are older than the shipwreck itself. Marx Dec., Doc. No. 79-3 \u00b6\u00b6 7-8. While Marx's argument might be reasonable in the abstract, it is not persuasive in this case, where France relies on more than just the age of the artifacts discovered to establish that the\n    <em>\n     res\n    </em>\n    is\n    <em>\n     la Trinit\u00e9\n    </em>\n    . In a similar vein, Marx also argues that the\n    <em>\n     res\n    </em>\n    could not even be positively be identified as belonging to the Ribault fleet if the ship's bell were found because it is possible that an enemy ship could have seized the bell and then sunk with it on board.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 9. Such an argument is not persuasive because it is based on speculation and ignores the standard of proof-the preponderance of the evidence.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-134\">\n    In a confusing portion of his affidavit, GME's expert Dr. Robert H. Baer states that \"there are problems with the purported manifest of the La Trinite that are exhibits in this court litigation.\" Baer Dec., Doc. No. 79-1 \u00b6 13 and 79-2 \u00b6 13 (continued). It appears that the \"problem\" is that the registers of artillery do not identify the ship's cargo and armaments with \"identifying numbers or symbols.\" And, it appears that GME is suggesting (based on a conversation with \"Dr. Eugene Lyon\"-which is not in the record, but appears to have related to the manifests of two shipwrecks from 1622, the Atocha and the Santa Margarita) that there might be another, separate cannon manifest that would include identifying numbers or symbols. Accordingly, Dr. Baer opines that he \"can-not confirm that the two above cited bronze cannon are associated with La Trinite or any other vessel at this time.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    It is unclear to the Court why the fact that manifests of two (possibly Spanish) ships from 1622 included identification numbers for the bronze cannons listed on those manifests would suggest that the register of artillery for a 1565 French ship (\n    <em>\n     la Trinit\u00e9\n    </em>\n    ) should also include such identification numbers, and GME has not explained this point. Moreover, the fact that there might be another, as yet undiscovered, but more complete manifest for\n    <em>\n     la Trinit\u00e9\n    </em>\n    does not change the fact that the cannons GME discovered correspond to the cannons listed on the register of artillery for\n    <em>\n     la Trinit\u00e9\n    </em>\n    . And it does not change the fact that such correspondence suggests that the\n    <em>\n     res\n    </em>\n    is\n    <em>\n     la Trinit\u00e9\n    </em>\n    . The Republic of France need only prove that the\n    <em>\n     res\n    </em>\n    is\n    <em>\n     la Trinit\u00e9\n    </em>\n    by a preponderance of the evidence-not beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, the Court rejects Dr. Baer's suggestion that the\n    <em>\n     res\n    </em>\n    cannot be identified in the absence of a register that includes identifying numbers or symbols for the cannons.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
