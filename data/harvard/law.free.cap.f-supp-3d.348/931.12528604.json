On November 12, 2014, Javier Lopez was driving his 2004 Econoline Van (\"Van\"). The Van was involved in an accident with a motorcycle driven by Patrick Yager. Yager suffered various physical injuries in the accident. It is disputed as to who was at fault in the accident. Yager argues that Lopez made an unsafe lane change and collided with Yager. Wilshire argues that Yager had been in three other accidents, had been required to go to driving school twice for speeding, that he has driven his motorcycles at speeds of 190 miles an hour, that Yager lacks any memory of the accident, and that the three eye witnesses to the accident indicated that Yager caused the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After the accident, Yager filed a lawsuit in Pima County Superior Court against Lopez alleging that he was at fault in the accident; in addition, Alonso Pastor was also named in the lawsuit (\"State Lawsuit\"). Pastor was named in the State Lawsuit as he was the named insured under a commercial auto liability policy with Wilshire; the Van that Lopez owned was added as a covered auto under Pastor's previously existing policy with Wilshire, but Lopez was not listed as a named insured under that policy (the \"Policy\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is\n   no evidence reflecting that Wilshire was aware of Lopez's existence prior to the accident in question; Wilshire was only informed of Lopez's existence after the accident had already occurred.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Lopez tendered his defense to Wilshire pursuant to the Policy issued to Pastor. In March of 2015, Wilshire retained counsel to defend Lopez in the State Lawsuit. However, by August of 2015, Wilshire sent Lopez a reservation of rights letter informing him that while Wilshire would continue to provide counsel to Lopez in the State Lawsuit, it was doing so under a reservation of rights because although Lopez's Van was listed as a covered auto under Pastor's Policy, Lopez was not an insured under the Policy (i.e., one has to be both an \"insured\" driving a \"covered auto\" for liability coverage to apply).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Yager's claims in the State Lawsuit against Pastor were dismissed at summary judgment, and that dismissal was affirmed on appeal. The State Lawsuit against Lopez ended when Lopez entered into a\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   agreement with Yager whereby Lopez assigned all of his rights against Wilshire and Girard to Yager; pursuant to the\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   agreement, the parties stipulated to a judgment of $1.5 million, and Yager agreed not to seek recovery of the judgment, or any other form of damages, against Lopez. Thereafter, Wilshire filed the instant declaratory judgment action against Yager and Lopez in this Court seeking a declaration that Wilshire owed no duty to indemnify. Thereafter, Yager asserted claims for breach of contract and bad faith against Wilshire, and claims against Girard stemming from its failure to properly procure insurance coverage for Lopez.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      The Insurance Policy and Reasonable Expectations\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Wilshire and Yager have both moved for summary judgment as to the issue of whether Lopez was covered by the Policy. The Court agrees with Wilshire's position that the Policy is unambiguous and does not cover Lopez.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Contract interpretation is a matter of law, and whether the terms of the contract are ambiguous is also a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

While the Van was indeed listed as a covered auto under the Policy, it does not change the fact that the Policy clearly states that liability coverage only applies if you are also an insured under the Policy (i.e., liability coverage only applies if one is an insured who is driving a covered auto). There are three categories of insureds under the Policy. Under section \"a\", the Policy states that \"You\" refers to the named insured listed in the Declaration. Lopez is not listed as a named insured; only Pastor is listed as a named insured. Under section \"b\", one is considered an insured if the named insured (i.e., Pastor) gives permission to drive a \"covered 'auto' you own, hire or borrow.\" Lopez owned the Van involved in the accident; as such, Pastor did not give Lopez permission to drive a Van that Lopez actually owned. As to section \"c\", Lopez was driving the subject vehicle (not Pastor) at the time of the accident; thus, Lopez could not be liable for Pastor's conduct under the circumstances at bar. Although Lopez was driving a covered auto under the Policy, Lopez was not an insured under the Policy such that liability coverage did not attach.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ogden v.

Furthermore, to the extent Pastor's reasonable expectations are also considered in conjunction with Lopez's reasonable expectations, application of the reasonable expectations doctrine is unwarranted under the circumstances of this case. The clear terms of the Policy were obvious; a reasonably intelligent consumer who checked on his rights would understand the terms at issue, and the terms at issue are not unusual or unexpected, and do not emasculate apparent coverage. As discussed above, the Policy states that liability coverage only applies to insureds, Lopez was not listed as a named insured, and Lopez did not meet the basic definition of who was considered an insured under the contract. It's not unusual or unexpected for an insurance company to limit coverage to specific insured individuals. In addition, the record does not show that any additional explanation was warranted as to the unambiguous insuring terms at bar. Wilshire never even knew of the existence of Lopez until after the accident occurred in this case. Wilshire did not take any action to induce any objective belief that Lopez was covered under the Policy.

Wilshire retained counsel to defend Lopez in the State Lawsuit in March of 2015. By August of 2015, Wilshire had issued its reservation of rights letter to Lopez. There is no evidence that the defense provided to Lopez (via counsel retained by Wilshire on Lopez's behalf) was in any way improper. There is no evidence that had the reservation of rights been issued earlier, counsel for Lopez would have done anything differently, or that Lopez could have and would have done anything differently, to avoid any purported prejudice stemming from the delay in the reservation of rights. Yager argues, for example, that he was prejudiced because he testified at a deposition and responded to discovery, that a policy limit settlement offer of $750,000 expired prior to the issuance of the reservation of rights, and that Wilshire's refusal to indemnify him exposed him to the risk of losing his license to operate his van to transport customers. However, there is no evidence that Lopez was prejudiced by participating in discovery or being deposed, or that he lost his license due to the delay in the reservation of rights. Likewise, unlike the insured in\n   <em>\n    Penn-Am\n   </em>\n   who could have satisfied the $925,000 settlement demand via a second insurance policy with a separate insurer, there is no evidence that Lopez could have satisfied the $725,000 settlement demand made in this case.

Girard argues, for example, that as of the time period prior to the accident: Girard employees have stated that they never had any contact with Lopez and were not aware of Lopez; there are no receipts showing that Lopez made any payments at Girard's office regarding Pastor's Policy; there are no phone records showing any contact between Girard and\n   Lopez; and there is no physical documentation to substantiate any claim that Girard was aware of Lopez. Therefore, according to Girard, as it was completely unaware of Lopez's existence prior to the accident, it cannot be held liable for Yager's claims of negligence, breach of good faith and fair dealing, reasonable expectations of coverage, and punitive damages stemming from any failure to properly procure insurance for Lopez.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   There is evidence, however, reflecting that Girard was aware of Lopez prior to the accident. For example, according to Lopez's deposition testimony, during the time period prior to the accident: Lopez personally met with and spoke to Girard employee Francine Dortch seven times in Girard's office; Lopez only dealt with Dortch at Girard; Lopez made in-person payments on the Policy at Girard's office; Dortch was told that Lopez owned the Van; Lopez was told that he was covered under the Policy; when Lopez noticed that his name did not appear on some documents related to the insurance, and he pointed this concern out to Dortch, Dortch told Lopez that it was fine and there was no problem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In light of the foregoing, there are material issues of fact precluding summary judgment in favor of Girard; Girard's motion for summary judgment is denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     MOTIONS IN LIMINE\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   As the Court has granted summary judgment in favor of Wilshire, Wilshire's motions in limine\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Docs. 141, 146, 147, 148, 169) are denied as moot.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   As to Girard's \"motion to strike expert opinion of Daniel Fink\" (Doc. 145)\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   and \"joint Daubert motion RE: expert Carmine Cornelio's opinion of reasonableness of Morris agreement\" (Doc. 156), both motions are denied.

The words 'we', 'us', and 'our' refer to the Company providing this insurance.\" The only named insured listed in the policy is Alonso Pastor.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    When citing to docket entries, page references are to the CM/ECF computer generated page numbers appearing in the upper right hand corner of the page.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    To the extent that Yager generally argues that public policy somehow establishes liability coverage, Yager's position is not supported by the pertinent authority applicable to the circumstances of this case. For example, Yager argues that Arizona law generally requires insurance coverage where an insured grants a third party permission to drive the insured's vehicle. While this is true, it is irrelevant in this case. Lopez was driving the vehicle he owned which was involved in the accident with Yager. Pastor (the insured) did not give Lopez permission to drive the vehicle that Lopez actually owned.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Ogden\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"195768\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/188/132/#p136\">\n     188 Ariz. at 137-38\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"195768\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/188/132/#p136\">\n     933 P.2d at 1205-06\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (holding that the driver of a vehicle was not a permissive driver under Arizona law entitled to liability coverage; rather, the driver was driving a vehicle that he owned, and the insured could not give the driver permission to drive the vehicle actually owned by the driver).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    Prejudice to the insured is evaluated prior to the date of the\n    <em>\n     Morris\n    </em>\n    agreement.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 15,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4043629\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/220/7/\">\n     202 P.3d 472\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    Moreover, the record does not reflect that Wilshire intended to waive its right to deny coverage, engaged in any action or inaction that would support waiver, and never communicated any waiver to Lopez or Pastor.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    In reliance on a separately filed motion in limine to exclude the testimony of expert Carmine Cornelio (Doc. 156), Girard summarily argues that Yager cannot prove any damages to support any of his claims, and therefore summary judgment must be granted in its favor. However, as discussed herein, the motion in limine in question has been denied, and therefore there is no basis for Girard's position.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    Although some of these documents were titled \"motions to strike\", they are motions in limine seeking to exclude evidence at trial.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    To the extent that Girard filed joinders summarily relying on Wilshire's motions in limine appearing at Docs. 146, 147, and 148, those motions have now been denied. If the issues in those denied motions are still pertinent to the remaining case against Girard, Girard may file its own motions in limine arguing why such evidence is inadmissible at trial as it relates to the claims remaining against Girard.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    Although Doc. 145 is titled as a joinder in Wilshire's motion, it is a substantive motion in limine that discusses pertinent facts and authority applicable to the claims against Girard, and it stands on its own apart from Wilshire's motion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    As Girard's motion for summary judgment has been denied, Yager's motion to strike (Doc. 209) (pertaining to Girard's summary judgment motion) is denied as moot.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    Any party may file a motion seeking to stay the remaining deadlines in the case pending a settlement conference.
