Plaintiff's Employment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff was hired by Defendant, through Yonkers' Office of the City Councilman for the Third District, Michael Sabatino (\"Sabatino\"), in early January 2012. (Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 1; Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 1; Def.'s Decl. Ex. C (\"Pl.'s Dep.\") 6-7, 11-12.) At hiring, Plaintiff's title was \"Aide to the City Council II,\" a \"confidential clerical\" position that required her to, among other things, \"assist[ ] in preparing and tracking legislation\" and \"resolutions,\" assist in \"the answering of inquiries and complaints from the general public,\" \"[o]versee[ ] the requisitions and receipts of ... equipment for the department,\" \"receive visitors ... [,] including salesmen, the press, government and industry officials and the general public,\" and attend public events. (Def.'s Decl. Ex. F, at 10 (job description);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 2; Def.'s Decl. Ex. D (\"Sabatino Dep.\") 16, 37 (Dkt. No. 64).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In January 2014, Plaintiff was promoted to \"Aide to the City Council III,\" a \"highly confidential complex clerical\" position \"requiring the use of independent judgment in highly varied but routine matters.\" (Def.'s Decl. Ex. F, at 11 (job description).) In particular, the position required \"[w]elcom[ing] dignitaries and other officials,\" \"[p]repar[ing] and maintain[ing] all time, attendance[,] and payroll records,\" the \"[a]bility to supervise the work of others,\" and a \"[h]igh degree of discretion,\" in addition to completing the duties of Aide to the City Council II. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 3-4; Pl.'s Dep. 11; Sabatino Dep. 13, 17, 35-38.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In practice, Plaintiff spent much of her time on \"constituent services,\" that is, answering inquiries and complaints from the public. (Pl.'s Dep. 18-21.) Plaintiff also proofread Sabatino's press releases, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 21), and created and produced events for him, including a show on \"different issues that concerned Black Americans,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 26). Finally, Plaintiff attended numerous community and precinct meetings, ribbon\n   cuttings, construction groundbreakings, and other public events on behalf of Sabatino, where she would listen to community concerns, take pictures and notes, and report back to Sabatino. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-14, 28.) Plaintiff served, in other words, as Sabatino's \"eyes and ears in the community\" when \"he couldn't make it\" to public events. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    2. Plaintiff's Candidacy\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Between 2014 and 2017, Sabatino served as minority leader of the Yonkers City Council and head of the Council's Democratic Caucus. (Sabatino Dep. 21-22, 34.) Christopher Johnson (\"Johnson\"), Yonkers City Councilman for the First District, served as another member of the Democratic Caucus. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 5.) In May 2015, as Sabatino and Johnson were campaigning for re-election in their respective districts, (Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 6), Sabatino heard from members of a local political organization that Plaintiff had begun a political campaign to challenge Johnson, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7). Sabatino further heard that Plaintiff was running on a \"political ticket\" - the \"Yonkers Women's Ticket\" - alongside a woman challenging Sabatino. (Sabatino Dep. 39-41;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 8.) Also that month, multiple local newspaper articles were published describing Plaintiff as running for office and doing so as part of a political ticket. (Def.'s Decl. Ex. G, at 3-8, 13-14;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 9-10, 13.) And on May 23, 2015, Nicole Benjamin, herself running for local political office, sent an email stating that she was \"running on the Yonkers Women's Ticket,\" which was comprised of \"four female candidates\" including \"Ivy Reeves for the First Council District.\" (Def.'s Decl. Ex. G, at 2-3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   It is undisputed that Plaintiff was running for office in May 2015. In fact, in a May 25, 2015 email to colleagues, Plaintiff stated, \"I am running for the first district [against Johnson] as I did 4 years ago.\" (Def.'s Decl. Ex. G, at 9.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, Plaintiff denies that she was a member of a political ticket. (Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 5; Pl.'s Mem. 16 \u00b6 11.) Plaintiff states that she was not aware of any newspaper articles or emails describing her as on a ticket. (Pl.'s Dep. 55-58, 67, 93-94.) Indeed, Plaintiff told her colleagues in her May 25, 2015 email that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Unfortunately [Sabatino] is being challenged by one of his constituents. I recently found out about this and just want you all to know I had absolutely NOTHING to do with the woman running and I have told her I cannot support her run against [Sabatino].... So once again I apologize to those of you who have been pulled into this very uncomfortable situation. I have always considered [Sabatino] a friend and [am] not supporting anyone against him.... Please understand I have no control over what other people feel, think, do[,] or say.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (Def.'s Decl. Ex. G, at 9-10.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   A post\n   shared on Plaintiff's Facebook page, however, represents her as a member of a political ticket. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Dep. 64-65.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Sometime in May 2015, Sabatino spoke to Plaintiff and informed her that her campaign for office \"was a major conflict of interest because Councilman Sabatino was the Minority Leader of the City Council.\" (Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 14;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Sabatino Dep. 43-45, 59.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    3. Plaintiff's Leave Request\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On June 1, 2015, Plaintiff submitted to Defendant a request for leave from June 2, 2015 to July 7, 2015, for medical reasons. (Def.'s Decl. Ex. A, at 11 (completed leave request form);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 15; Pl.'s Mem. 15 \u00b6 1; Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 15.) Plaintiff has testified that she was experiencing emotional stress and anxiety, heart irregularities, and joint problems, and that she was on medication to treat those issues. (Pl.'s Dep. 30-35.) Sabatino has testified that he was aware that Plaintiff suffered from various medical conditions, including lupus and digestive issues. (Sabatino Dep. 73-74, 93.) Upon receiving Plaintiff's leave request, Sabatino - who as described above, had heard of Plaintiff's candidacy in May 2015 and who doubted that Plaintiff had a medical reason for her leave request, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   84-85) - sent Plaintiff two emails. The first, sent at about 8:00 p.m. on June 1, 2015, requested that Plaintiff meet with Sabatino the next day, at 3:00 p.m., to discuss \"moving beyond the current situation.\" (Pl.'s Mem. 93;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 16.) The second, sent later that night, stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   I am in receipt of your request for comp time. One of the reasons for the meeting is to discuss your request for comp time and to work on a resolution regarding the last week and a half. According to the comp time policy, compensatory time shall NOT be used for political activities such as petitioning, campaigning, electioneering, and etcetera. I have attached the policy. We have to discuss some alternative options. My expectation is that you will be at work tomorrow and we will meet at 3 pm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (Pl.'s Mem. 93.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff states that she had scheduled a doctor's appointment for \"around\" 3:15 p.m. on June 2, 2015, at about the same time as the meeting requested by Sabatino. (Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 16.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Early in the morning on June 2, Plaintiff responded to Sabatino via email, stating in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   I have taken time off to take care of myself. I am going to see a doctor tomorrow and my health comes first. There are medical needs I have to address. This is the first time I'm hearing about this meeting. I'm very sorry but you had plenty of time to speak with me and now that I put in time to take off you have an urgency to see me. Then I was informed after putting in my time that you think it is for campaigning. Campaigning is done after work not during work. I left because of the hostile work environment of you not wanting me in the office during the campaign.... I need to see my doctor because my heart has been very irregular since last week.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (Def.'s Decl. Ex. A, at 19;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Dep. 41-42.) Plaintiff then followed up with a second email, stating in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   You wanted me out of the office according to all of the people you spoke to about me. So I decided to take my time as other aide[s] have done .... Please remember I had no problem doing my job or being in [the] office, but [y]ou caused tension and the other workers could see how you were treating me. You were unable to hide your hostility and that was a shame. You are concerned about the timing which I had nothing to do with. I see that you are continuing to disrespect me. I never said I was using my time to campaign. When I ran 2 years ago for city council president I worked and took some vacation. There was no problem then. Now ... you are consumed with your assumption that I took off for campaigning. Clearly you are letting me know that you couldn't care less about my health only what seems to be a life or death matter to you in this political arena .... So bottom line today I will be taking care of someone I have neglected over the last year .... I have taken time off most of my adult working life for my birthday.... Perhaps you could use your power and tell the Democratic Party to change the month and week of the month so that peti[ti]oning does not fall on the first of June.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   (Def.'s Decl. Ex. A, at 19.) Sabatino responded to Plaintiff by email:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   I have to say I whole heartedly disagree ... regarding the office atmosphere and my actions. I look forward to meeting with [you] as soon as possible to address these issues. That being said I hope all goes well with the [d]octor. I will mark today as a sick day.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiff attended her doctor's appointment, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Decl. Ex. A, at 12-17 (documentation from doctor's visit) ), and thereafter submitted to Sabatino a doctor's note stating that Plaintiff should be excused from work for two weeks - from June 2 to June 16, 2015 - for unspecified \"medical reasons,\" (Pl.'s Mem. 95;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 17; Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 17-18; Pl.'s Dep. 35-36).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    4. Plaintiff's Campaigning, Termination, and Post-Termination Activities\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Between June 2, 2015 and July 9, 2015 - the dates corresponding to New York's period for collection of petition signatures for candidacy, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Decl. Ex. H, at 1-2; Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 18; Pl.'s Dep. 79-80) - Plaintiff witnessed 354 petition signatures for herself as candidate. (Def.'s Decl. Ex. H, at 4-39;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 19.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Over the same period, associates of Plaintiff witnessed some 150 such signatures. (Def.'s Decl. Ex. H, at 40-54;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 20-21.) Plaintiff did not notify Sabatino that she was campaigning. (Pl.'s Dep. 90-91.) When asked why she was able to collect signatures when she also had medical issues that required her absence from work, Plaintiff stated: \"[T]he doctor told me to stay out of the office, but not out of the city. So, it was the office that was causing the problems.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 88.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On June 8, 2015, Sabatino informed Plaintiff by letter that he was \"denying [her] request\" for compensatory time and terminating her employment, effective at\n   close of business on June 9, 2015. (Def.'s Decl. Ex. F, at 5 (\"Termination Letter\") );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 22; Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 22; Pl.'s Dep. 8, 12; Sabatino Dep. 98.) Sabatino stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Based on your public statements that you intend to run for Council in the First District during the period in which you have requested compensatory time, it has become abundantly clear that you intend to use this time for political and/or campaign purposes. Such use of compensatory time is expressly prohibited by this office's policy .... Your candidacy ... also creates a direct conflict of interest ... between your status as a candidate and your role as an employee in the Office of Minority Leader.... In addition, ... you are a member of a slate of candidates that includes a candidate who is running against me. While you are free to run for elected office and support whomever you wish, your actions and decision to run create a clear conflict of interest within the [O]ffice of Council Minority Leader which prevents you from carrying out the duties delineated in your job description.... Therefore, I must terminate you from your current position effective at the close of business on Tuesday, June 9, 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   (Termination Letter.) Plaintiff, for her part, maintains that \"there was no conflict of interest,\" and that she had \"informed the prospective person preparing to campaign against [Sabatino] that [she] would not support her.\" (Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Following her termination, Plaintiff authored an op-ed in\n   <em>\n    Yonkers Rising\n   </em>\n   on June 19, 2015, stating that Sabatino \"terminated me as his legislative aide ... because I decided to run again for the first district City Council seat, as I did four years ago against Christopher Johnson.\" (Def.'s Decl. Ex. G, at 16-17;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 24; Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 24; Pl.'s Dep. 69.) On June 20, 2015, the\n   <em>\n    Yonkers Tribune\n   </em>\n   published an article discussing Plaintiff's campaign against Johnson. (Def.'s Decl. Ex. G, at 18;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 25; Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 25; Pl.'s Dep. 70-71.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On March 23, 2016, Plaintiff filed her Complaint and application to proceed in forma pauperis (\"IFP\"). (Dkt Nos. 1, 2.) The Court granted Plaintiff's IFP application on April 4, 2016. (Dkt. No. 3.) On April 7, 2016, the Court issued an Order directing service on Defendant City of Yonkers, (Dkt. No. 5), and the City was served thereafter, (Dkt. No. 10). On July 5, 2016, Defendant filed a letter requesting a pre-motion conference in anticipation of a motion to dismiss on the ground that Plaintiff's claim was time-barred, (Dkt. Nos. 9, 12), and Plaintiff responded on July 28, 2016, (Dkt. No. 14). The Court held a pre-motion Conference on January 20, 2017. Defendant filed its Motion To Dismiss and accompanying papers on February 21, 2017. (Dkt. Nos. 22, 23, 24.) On February 23, 2017, Plaintiff filed a letter requesting a settlement conference. (Dkt. No. 26.) The Court rejected the request, saying it would first decide the Motion. (Dkt. No. 27.) On March 20, 2017, Plaintiff filed her response to Defendant's Motion. (Dkt. No. 28.) On April 19, 2017, Defendant filed its reply. (Dkt. No. 29.) On May 24, 2017, the Court issued an Opinion denying Defendant's Motion. (Dkt. No. 30.)

On the one hand, the Aide to the City Council III job description states that the position involves assisting \"in preparing and tracking legislation,\" preparing and maintaining \"all time, attendance[,] and payroll records,\" and overseeing \"the requisitions and receipts of ... equipment for the department.\" (Def.'s Decl. Ex. F, at 11.) The preparation and tracking of legislation often involves technical expertise on substantive policy issues, legislative procedure, and budgetary issues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burkhardt v.

On the other hand, it does not appear that\n   <em>\n    in practice\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff was substantively involved in the legislative process, or that Plaintiff had technical knowledge of legislative procedural rules. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Dep. 16-18.) Rather, the bulk of Plaintiff's role centered around answering inquiries from the public and attending community and other meetings on behalf of Sabatino. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10, 12-14, 18-21, 28.)

Plaintiff's position, particularly after her promotion to Aide to the City Council III, involved the supervision of others in the office; the job description for that position stated that \"supervision may be exercised over assigned personnel office staff\" and that the position required the \"ability to supervise the work of others.\" (Def.'s Decl.

However, as with the second factor, Plaintiff's position may have been vested with the ability to control, but Plaintiff herself does not seem\n   to have in practice exercised any significant control authority. Sabatino has testified that Plaintiff assigned projects and coordinated some activities with other aides, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Sabatino Dep. 35, 38), but there is no record of what kinds of projects were assigned or descriptions of these projects, how often Plaintiff delegated work, or how Plaintiff would typically coordinate with other staffers. Nor is there evidence suggesting, for example, that Plaintiff led a dedicated team, was responsible for or supervised a particular office program, or had any involvement in the hiring and firing process.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burkhardt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180275\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/811/632/#p645\">\n    811 F.Supp.2d at 645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding the plaintiff fell under the policymaker exception in part because she \"not only supervised the intern program for a number of years, but also had supervised staff members\" and \"conducted interviews\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The fourth through eighth factors - whether Plaintiff was \"authorized to speak in the name\" of Sabatino, was \"perceived as a policymaker by the public, \"influence[d] government programs,\" \"ha[d] contact with elected officials,\" and was \"responsive to partisan politics and political leaders,\"\n   <em>\n    Morin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053443\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/626/40/#p44\">\n    626 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   45 - \"together encompass a principle upon which [the Second Circuit] has placed primary importance: whether the employee in question is empowered to act and speak on behalf of a policymaker, especially an elected official.\"\n   <em>\n    Gordon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"694941\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/110/886/\">\n    110 F.3d at 890\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These factors, taken together, weigh heavily in favor of Defendant. Plaintiff was hired directly by and worked directly for Michael Sabatino, an elected official and policymaker. (Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 1; Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 1; Pl.'s Dep. 11, 29.) Plaintiff acted in Sabatino's name when she attended community and precinct council meetings, ribbon cuttings, and other public events on his behalf. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Dep. 10, 12-14, 28, 69.) When Plaintiff attended such meetings, there can be little doubt that she was perceived by the public as Sabatino's representative, as she answered questions from the public on his behalf. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   12-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   To be sure, the record does not show that Plaintiff exercised substantial influence over local governmental programs or that she was closely involved in the preparation or drafting of legislation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-18.) Nor is it clear whether Plaintiff had regular contact with local Yonkers elected officials other than Sabatino. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24.) But Plaintiff acknowledges that she saw herself as Sabatino's \"eyes and ears in the community\" when \"he couldn't make it\" to public events.

Here, the undisputed evidence shows that Plaintiff engaged in partisan activity. In May 2015, Plaintiff began preparing her campaign for the First District in Yonkers City Council. (Def.'s Decl. Ex. G, at 9; Pl.'s Dep. 61-63.) Soon after, Sabatino became aware of her candidacy. (Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 7-8; Sabatino Dep. 39.) As Defendant explains and as the record shows, \"Sabatino did not approve Plaintiff ... to campaign for office against a fellow member of that same caucus [led by Sabatino].\" (Def.'s Mem. 13.) Plaintiff's political conduct \"ran counter to the views of her employer\" because it created a potential and actual conflict of interest with Sabatino. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As a candidate running against a member of Sabatino's caucus, Plaintiff \"could no longer be privy to certain confidential information\" in Sabatino's office. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Moreover, Plaintiff's candidacy may have damaged Sabatino's ability to lead the caucus. As the Second Circuit has explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   There is no likely circumstance in which a shared ideology is more important than when an elected official appoints a deputy who may act in his or her stead.

She argues that \"there have never been any conflicts of interest with me regarding Mr. Sabatino\" because \"I support the LGBTQ, the environmental issues, education, stop bullying campaigns, senior services[,] and other human and social issues.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.) Plaintiff also argues that Sabatino \"is unable to show any real proof of a conflict of interest with me, or to prove the time of day the signatures were witness[ed]. Most signatures are collected after 5:30 PM. After working hours.\" (Pl.'s Mem. 28.) And Plaintiff denies that she was a member of a political ticket, (Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 5), and states that she \"informed the prospective person preparing to campaign against [Sabatino] that I would not support her,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Each of Plaintiff's statements is irrelevant to the Court's inquiry. Even assuming Plaintiff was not on a political ticket, that Plaintiff was aligned with Sabatino on substantive policy issues, that elected officials should be transparent, that \"most\" of Plaintiff's campaigning was done after work hours, it is undisputed that Plaintiff ran for political office. (Pl.'s Dep. 50; Def.'s Decl. Ex. G, at 9.) It is also undisputed that Plaintiff actively campaigned for that office by collecting petition signatures for her candidacy. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Decl. Ex. H, at 4-39.) And it is undisputed that Plaintiff's candidacy challenged a member of the political caucus led by Sabatino. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. G, at 9.) Indeed, Plaintiff's post-termination op-ed squarely acknowledged that she was \"fired from [her] position by Councilmember Sabatino last week due to [her] decision to challenge the incumbent, Christopher Johnson, in this year's September primary election for the first district Yonkers City Council.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.) It was thus Plaintiff's very candidacy, rather than her affiliation with a political ticket, that caused the core conflict of interest with Sabatino. Put succinctly, Plaintiff's own \"partisan activity\" led to her termination.\n   <em>\n    Kaluczky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7410808\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/57/202/#p208\">\n    57 F.3d at 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Therefore, Defendant has satisfied its burden at step two of\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   .

As an initial matter, Plaintiff offers no explanation as to pretext: she nowhere states or implies that her termination was in fact because of a disability. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s 56.1; Pl.'s Mem.) More importantly, the\n   record belies any suggestion of pretext. Plaintiff's May 25, 2015 email to colleagues - the email that acknowledged her candidacy against Christopher Johnson - states that Sabatino\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   is being pressured by Christopher Johnson and some of the Democratic leaders to make me resign from my position or Michael [Sabatino] will fire me. No one has ever had to or been asked to resign from their jobs ... EVER!

Ex. G, at 10.) That email, sent about two weeks before Plaintiff's termination, demonstrates that Plaintiff understood her job was at risk,\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   because of her medical issues, but because of her political conduct. Similarly, Sabatino's June 1, 2015 email to Plaintiff, responding to her leave request, states that \"compensatory time shall NOT be used for political activities such as petitioning, campaigning, electioneering, and etcetera\" and that Plaintiff and Sabatino \"have to discuss some alternative options.\" (Pl.'s Mem. 93.) Sabatino's email clearly displays a concern over Plaintiff's political activity; it does not state or imply that Defendant was concerned about, or indifferent to, Plaintiff's medical issues. Nor does Sabatino's June 8, 2015 termination letter mention Plaintiff's medical issues; rather, it explains that Plaintiff's political candidacy, a fact \"documented through numerous media and other sources,\" \"create[s] a clear conflict of interest\" and makes it impossible to \"promot[e] the [O]ffice's agenda as well as that of the Caucus which the Office serves.\" (Termination Letter.) Finally, Plaintiff's own post-termination op-ed states that Sabatino \"terminated me as his legislative aide as of June 9,\n   <em>\n    because\n   </em>\n   I decided to run for the first district City Council seat, as I did four years ago[,] against Christopher Johnson.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex.
