Code Ann., Elec. Law \u00a7 8-701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   . They contend that in enacting the law, State officials specifically intended to burden Republicans with the overarching goal of achieving a state delegation to the U.S. House of Representatives of seven Democrats and one Republican, as distinct from the previous six Democrats and two Republicans. To do so, the officials targeted Republican voters in the Sixth District by, on net, removing roughly 66,000 of them from the district and adding some 24,000 Democratic voters, thereby effecting a swing of about 90,000 voters and bringing about the single greatest alteration of voter makeup in any district in the Nation following the 2010 census. The plaintiffs point out that before the redistricting, experts regarded the Sixth District as \"Solid Republican\" and after redistricting, as \"Likely Democratic.\" Based on these factual allegations, the plaintiffs argue that in enacting the 2011 law, the State deliberately diluted their votes and burdened their associational interests based on their party affiliation and voting history, in violation of their First Amendment rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The parties have conducted and completed extensive discovery, and neither the plaintiffs nor the State has requested any more. Moreover, no party disputes the material facts in the record, although the parties do dispute the legal consequences that flow from them. Following discovery, the plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment, and the State filed a cross-motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This court conducted a lengthy hearing on the cross-motions for summary judgment on October 4, 2018, and now, for the reasons given herein, the court grants the plaintiffs' motion and denies the State's motion. The record shows that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   \u2022 The State specifically targeted voters in the Sixth Congressional District who were registered as Republicans and who had historically voted for Republican candidates.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   \u2022 The State specifically intended to diminish the value of those targeted citizens' votes by removing a substantial number of them from the Sixth District and replacing them with Democratic voters for the purpose of denying, as a practical matter, the targeted voters the opportunity to elect the candidate of their choice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \u2022 The State gave effect to its intent by, on net, removing about 66,000 Republican voters from the Sixth District and adding 24,000 Democratic voters in their place.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \u2022 The State meaningfully burdened the targeted Republican voters' representational rights by substantially diminishing their ability to elect their candidate of choice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \u2022 The State also burdened the Republican voters' right of association, as demonstrated by voter confusion, diminished participation in Republican organizational efforts in the Sixth District, and diminished Republican participation in voting, as well as decreased Republican fundraising.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 These injuries were the direct result of the State's purpose to convert the Sixth District from a solid Republican district to a Democratic district.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We thus conclude that the plaintiffs have sufficiently demonstrated that Maryland's 2011 redistricting law violates the First Amendment by burdening both the plaintiffs' representational rights and associational rights based on their party affiliation and voting history. Because the plaintiffs also satisfy the requirements for injunctive relief, we enter a judgment permanently enjoining the State from using the 2011 congressional redistricting plan after the 2018 congressional election and requiring it promptly to adopt a new plan in conformance with this Memorandum Opinion for use in the 2020 congressional elections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   I. FACTS OF RECORD\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The facts of record are not disputed. Following the 2010 decennial census, the State of Maryland redrew the lines of its 8 congressional districts and its 47 state legislative districts, as required to equalize the population in each district. In particular, the census showed that the Sixth Congressional District had grown somewhat since the prior census, having 10,186 more residents than the ideal adjusted population of 721,529 for a Maryland congressional district, a variation of 1.4%. Joint Stipulations \u00b6\u00b6 9, 52 (ECF No. 104). Thus, Maryland was required to remove a net of 10,186 residents from the Sixth District to achieve the required equal population for the District. With such a modest adjustment, however, the Sixth District would have remained a solid Republican district, which, together with the First District on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, would have given Maryland two reliably Republican districts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Since 1966, the Sixth District had always been configured to include all of Maryland's five most northwestern counties - Garrett, Allegany, Washington, Frederick, and Carroll Counties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Expert Report of John T. Willis at 9 &amp; app. A, maps 11-15 (ECF No. 186-17). After the 2002 redistricting, the District included this identifiable core of five counties, as well as a small pocket of northern Montgomery County and larger portions of Baltimore and Harford Counties, shown as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At the time of the 2010 congressional election - the last held prior to the 2011 redistricting - 47% of the Sixth District's approximately 446,000 registered voters were registered as Republicans, 36% were registered as Democrats, and 16% were registered as Unaffiliated, making the District the most Republican in the State. Joint Stipulations \u00b6 10 &amp; Ex. 2 at 2. Representative Roscoe Bartlett, a Republican, had continuously represented the District since 1993, and he won reelection in 2010 by a margin of 28%.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Md.%20Code%20Ann.%2C%20Elec.%20Law%20%C2%A7%208-701\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Md.%20Code%20Ann.%2C%20Elec.%20Law%20%C2%A7%208-701\">\n    \u00b6 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In creating the 2011 redistricting plan, the Democratic officials responsible for the plan redrew the Sixth District's boundaries far more dramatically than was necessary to remove 10,186 residents from the District. Under their plan, the Sixth District retained only one-half of its original population (specifically, the residents of Garrett, Allegany, and Washington Counties, as well as roughly half the population of Frederick County). The other half of the former Sixth District's population - roughly 360,000 residents - was moved to other districts. Approximately 60% of those removed - those from Frederick County and more than half the population of Carroll County - were shifted into the Eighth Congressional District, which had previously been confined almost entirely to Montgomery County. In place of those residents, the plan added to the new Sixth District approximately 350,000 residents from Montgomery County - the majority of whom had previously been assigned to the Eighth District. The exchange thus involved over 700,000 residents. The final 2011 redistricting map for the Sixth District is shown as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The new Eighth District is shown as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Finally, the map as a whole is shown as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The registered voters removed from the former Sixth District were predominately Republican, while those added were predominately Democratic. Specifically, in the precincts removed from the Sixth District, there were on average approximately 1.5 times as many registered Republicans as Democrats. By contrast, in the precincts added to Sixth District, registered Democrats outnumbered Republicans by more than 2 to 1. In total, the reshuffling of the Sixth District's voters resulted in a net reduction of roughly 66,000 registered Republicans and a net increase of some 24,000 registered Democrats, for a swing of about 90,000 voters.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opening Expert Report of Prof. Michael P. McDonald at 5, 11-12 (ECF No. 177-19); Opening Expert Report of Dr. Peter A. Morrison \u00b6 134 &amp; tbl. 1 (ECF No. 177-35). Thus, of the new Sixth District's roughly 437,000 registered voters, 33% were registered as Republicans, 44% were registered as Democrats, and 22% were registered as Unaffiliated. Joint Stipulations \u00b6 53 &amp; Ex. 19 at 2.

Thus, even though the number of registered Republicans in the Eighth District rose significantly after the transfer of Republicans from the Sixth District, registered Democrats\n   still outnumbered registered Republicans by nearly 2 to 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The record shows that this readjustment of the voter composition of the Sixth District was specifically intended by Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley, a Democrat; by the Maryland General Assembly, controlled by Democrats; and by the Democratic members of Maryland's congressional delegation to achieve a 7 to 1 Democratic majority in Maryland's delegation to the U.S. House of Representatives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As was the custom - and indeed the procedure specified by state law for redrawing state legislative districts - Governor O'Malley took responsibility for creating the 2011 congressional redistricting plan and submitting it to the General Assembly as a joint resolution for adoption.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   O'Malley Dep. 8, 10-11 (ECF No. 177-3). He testified explicitly that he wanted to use the redistricting process to change the overall composition of Maryland's congressional delegation to 7 Democrats and 1 Republican by flipping either the First District on the Eastern Shore of Maryland or the Sixth District in western Maryland.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Md.%20Code%20Ann.%2C%20Elec.%20Law%20%C2%A7%208-701\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Md.%20Code%20Ann.%2C%20Elec.%20Law%20%C2%A7%208-701\">\n    at 22-28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But at the same time, he \"asked Congressman [Steny] Hoyer, as the dean of the [U.S.] House delegation,\" to \"lead the effort ... to inform the [Advisory Committee] about congressional redistricting\" and \"come up with a map that a majority of the congressional delegation supports.\" O'Malley Dep. 47-48;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Willis Dep. 185-88 (ECF No. 177-14). And the record shows that the work produced under the direction of the Democratic members of Maryland's congressional delegation - including data reflecting how citizens in discrete areas of the State had voted in the past - played a central role in shaping the new Sixth District.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Miller Dep. 97 (ECF No. 177-15) (testifying that the map \"primarily was drawn by the congressional people\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Thus, while the Advisory Committee was holding public hearings across the State - indeed, even before it began - the Democratic members of Maryland's congressional delegation, led by Representative Hoyer, who has described himself as a \"serial gerrymanderer,\" ECF No. 191-3, began their work to redraw the State's congressional map. Hoyer and other members of the delegation retained NCEC Services, Inc., a political consulting firm that provides \"electoral analysis, campaign strategy, political targeting, and GIS [geographic information system] services\" to Democratic organizations. ECF No. 177-17;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Hawkins Dep. 28-36 (ECF No. 177-4); ECF No. 177-18. NCEC was specifically\n   charged with drawing a map that maximized \"incumbent protection\" for Democrats and that changed the congressional delegation from 6 Democrats and 2 Republicans to 7 Democrats and 1 Republican.

Hawkins Dep. 40-42, 47-49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The primary NCEC analyst assigned to the task, Eric Hawkins, analyzed various congressional redistricting plans to inform the Democratic members of the Maryland congressional delegation of how different options would change their districts, and he personally prepared between 10 and 20 different draft congressional maps using a GIS computer software program called Maptitude for Redistricting.

Specifically, before the 2011 redistricting, the Sixth District had a Cook PVI of \"R+13\" and a \"Solid Republican\" label; after redistricting, the District received a Cook PVI of \"D+2\" and a \"Likely Democratic\" label.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Md.%20Code%20Ann.%2C%20Elec.%20Law%20%C2%A7%208-701\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Md.%20Code%20Ann.%2C%20Elec.%20Law%20%C2%A7%208-701\">\n    at 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . An academic analysis that looked at the accuracy of the Cook Report's forecasting over the course of 11 congressional elections helps unpack the significance of this swing.

In establishing the U.S. House of Representatives, the Constitution provides that \"[t]he House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second Year by the People of the several States,\" U.S. Const. art.

The Maryland Constitution, Article III, \u00a7 5, provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   Following each decennial census of the United States and after public hearings, the Governor shall prepare a plan setting forth the boundaries of the legislative districts for electing the members of the Senate and the House of Delegates.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   The Governor shall present the plan to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Delegates who shall introduce the Governor's plan as a joint resolution to the General Assembly....

The Maryland General Assembly implemented a state legislative district plan pursuant to these provisions following the 2010 census.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Md.%20Code%20Ann.%2C%20State%20Gov.%20%C2%A7%202-201\">\n    Md.

Thus, following each decennial census, the Maryland Governor takes charge of congressional redistricting by holding advisory hearings and creating a redistricting plan, which he then submits to the General Assembly as a joint resolution for adoption. And that process was followed after the 2010 census. The process, however, did\n   not incorporate the restrictions contained in the Maryland Constitution, Article III, \u00a7 4, that provide for contiguity, compactness, regard for natural boundaries, and regard for boundaries of political subdivisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   While Article I of the U.S. Constitution gives the States primary responsibility for the apportionment of federal congressional districts, it also reserves to Congress the power to override decisions made by the States. Article I, \u00a7 4, provides that \"the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such [state] Regulations\" pertaining to the election of federal representatives. U.S. Const., art. I, \u00a7 4, cl. 1. And over the years Congress has exercised that authority in various ways. In 1842, it required that members of the House of Representatives be elected from single-member districts composed of contiguous territory. Apportionment Act of 1842, ch. 47,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20Stat.%20491\">\n    5 Stat. 491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But as it stands today, Congress only requires that the States create single-member districts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2 U.S.C. \u00a7 2c. The single-member-district requirement \"produce[s] a different ... result than would be reached with elections at large, in which the winning party would take 100% of the legislative seats.\"\n   <em>\n    Gaffney v.

P. 56(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , with respect to the mapmakers' intent, the process described in the record admits of no doubt. Maryland Democratic officials worked to establish Maryland's congressional district boundaries in 2011 with a narrow focus on diluting the votes of Republicans in the Sixth Congressional District in an attempt to ensure the election of an additional Democratic representative in the State's congressional delegation. Governor O'Malley, who was responsible for the redistricting process, asked Congressman Hoyer to lead the redistricting effort, and Hoyer retained NCEC to draw up district maps that (1) protected Democratic incumbents and (2) flipped the Sixth District from Republican to Democratic control. Hawkins, an NCEC analyst, followed those two commands and prepared district maps using NCEC's proprietary DPI metric to assess the likelihood that a district would elect a Democratic candidate. He homed in on maps where the data predicted a Democratic victory in the Sixth District, unlike maps submitted by third parties, which had sub-50% DPI values for the Sixth District. Hawkins submitted maps to the Democratic members of Maryland's congressional delegation, at least one of which the delegation passed on to Maryland Democratic officials who were members of the Governor's Redistricting Advisory Committee. Moreover, the underlying precinct-level DPI data were shared with the officials' staffers, who then used that information, along with\n   State data on party registration and voter turnout, to develop a final map with a 53% DPI for the Sixth District, which the Governor submitted to the General Assembly and the General Assembly promptly adopted. Reliance on the DPI in finalizing a map was essential to achieving the specific intent to flip the Sixth District from safely Republican to likely Democratic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Moreover, the record is replete with direct evidence of this precise purpose. For example, notes prepared for state Senate President Miller's remarks to the state House and Senate Democratic Caucuses about the redistricting plan emphasized that the map \"create[d] an opportunity for Montgomery County to control two congressional districts\"; \"preserve[d] all six incumbent Democrats in 'safe' districts,\" none of which would have \"less than 58% [DPI]\"; and \"g[ave] Democrats a real opportunity to pick up a seventh seat in the delegation by targeting Roscoe Bartlett.\" ECF No. 177-23. Governor O'Malley admitted that he intended to \"create a district where the people would be more likely to elect a Democrat than a Republican.\" O'Malley Dep. 82;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 27-28 (describing aim of \"put[ting] more Democrats and Independents into the Sixth District\" to help ensure \"the election of another Democrat\"). Senate Majority Leader Garagiola admitted that \"one of the purposes[ ] [was] to make the Sixth Congressional District have 53 percent Democratic performance.\" Garagiola Dep. 16, 27. These sorts of statements, particularly by delegates and state senators during the General Assembly's abbreviated consideration of the proposed map, are legion.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Joint Stipulations \u00b6\u00b6 40-51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The State's argument that its officials intended only \"to allow Democrats to have an equally effective voice in the election of a representative\" in the Sixth District - an intent that it argues \"cannot be equated with an intent to burden [Republicans'] representational rights\" - rings hollow. Even if the intent to make one party \"more competitive\" were constitutionally permissible, the record shows something materially different. Democratic officials, with the help of NCEC, worked to craft a map that would specifically transform the Sixth District into one that would\n   <em>\n    predictably\n   </em>\n   elect a Democrat by removing Republicans from the District and adding Democrats in their place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Moreover, the State's argument fails to appreciate the requirements of the law. If the government uses partisan registration and voting data purposefully to draw a district that disfavors one party, it cannot escape liability by recharacterizing its actions as intended to favor the other party. The First Amendment does not - indeed, cannot - distinguish between these intents because they are one and the same when applicable to two-party elections. It is impossible to flip a seat to the Democrats without flipping it away from the Republicans. Thus, when the government targets a class of persons based on the persons' political affiliation and voting and then acts so as to burden their representational rights, it has run afoul of the First Amendment, no matter how it characterizes its intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The State also argues that its officials did not act with impermissible intent because they did not target\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   voters based on their individual party affiliation or voting history. This argument, too, is based on a misunderstanding of First Amendment jurisprudence. Here, the plaintiffs have shown that they were targeted for disfavored treatment because of a shared marker of political belief - their Republican Party affiliation. The fact that the State intentionally moved Republican voters out of the Sixth District en masse, based on precinct-level data, and did not\n   examine each individual voter's history does not make its action permissible under the First Amendment.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1563963\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/900/#p916\">\n    515 U.S. at 920\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1563963\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/900/#p916\">\n    115 S.Ct. 2475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (condemning State's\n   <em>\n    targeting of areas\n   </em>\n   with \"dense majority-black populations\" for inclusion in district).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   At bottom, given the overwhelming direct and circumstantial evidence, there can be no doubt that at every stage of the process, the State's Democratic officials who put the 2011 redistricting plan in place specifically intended to flip control of the Sixth District from Republicans to Democrats and then acted on that intent. The plaintiffs have amply established the intent element of their claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , with respect to the injury element, the plaintiffs have shown that the redrawn Sixth District did, in fact, meaningfully burden their representational rights. At the threshold, it is important to reiterate that, under the standard set forth in our denial of the State's motion to dismiss, a plaintiff who has shown that the State acted with impermissible retaliatory intent need not show that the linedrawing altered the outcome of an election - though such a showing would certainly be relevant evidence of the extent of the injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shapiro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=203%20F.%20Supp.%203d%20579\">\n    203 F.Supp.3d at 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And, contrary to the State's argument, the plaintiffs need not show that the new Sixth District was\n   <em>\n    certain\n   </em>\n   to produce a Democratic congressman to establish injury to their rights as voters. Indeed, it would only be a \"perfect\" gerrymander where \"a voter [who] lives in a cracked district\" stands \"\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   chance\" of having her preferred candidate prevail.\n   <em>\n    Gill\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 1936 (Kagan, J., concurring) (emphasis added).

By several measures, the dramatic redrawing of the Sixth District's boundaries disfavored Republican voters. In creating the map, the State, on net, removed roughly 66,000 registered Republicans from the Sixth District and added some 24,000 registered Democrats, such that Republican voters went from outnumbering Democrats 1.3 to 1 (47% of the District's registered eligible voters being Republicans and 36% Democrats) to nearly the exact inverse (44% Democrats, 33% Republicans). Joint Stipulations \u00b6\u00b6 10, 53. According to the DPI metric used by the mapmakers themselves, as well as the Cook PVI metric endorsed by the State's expert, Republican voters in the new Sixth District were, in\n   <em>\n    relative\n   </em>\n   terms, much less likely to elect their preferred candidate than before the 2011 redistricting, and, in\n   <em>\n    absolute\n   </em>\n   terms, they had no real chance of doing so. Indeed, the Cook report deemed the district's swing - from R+13 and \"Solid Republican\" to D+2 and \"Likely Democratic\" - the largest of any district in the country. ECF No. 177-52 at 6-8. And, historically, \"Likely Democratic\" districts elect a Democrat 94% of the time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Campbell,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 628.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Moreover, while the State's linedrawing need not have changed the outcome of an election to be culpable, the fact that the Democratic candidate was elected in the three elections following the 2011 redistricting provides additional evidence that the Republican voters have suffered a cognizable injury. In other words, the Democratic\n   officials who drew the map achieved exactly what they aimed to do - to make Republican voters in the Sixth District less effective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <em>\n    Finally\n   </em>\n   , as to causation, the plaintiffs have established that, without the State's retaliatory intent, the Sixth District's boundaries would not have been drawn to dilute the electoral power of Republican voters nearly to the same extent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The 2010 census required shifting only a small number of residents - 10,186 - from a district consisting of over 720,000 residents. While adjustments to other districts to achieve equal population or other legitimate goals might also have resulted in some additional adjustments to the Sixth District, the record shows no legitimate basis for the wholesale removal of 360,000 residents in the northern, more Republican portion of the Sixth District and their replacement with 350,000 residents from Montgomery County, a heavily Democratic area. To the contrary, the record conclusively shows that an illegitimate basis - the intent to flip party control - dictated the decision to so radically reshape the Sixth District.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   All of these facts were consistent with the actual intent expressed by those responsible for the 2011 redistricting plan. Thus, the causal link between the State's intent and the harm to the targeted voters' representational rights could not be clearer. In short, the record refutes the conclusion that the actions were taken for any other reason than to carry out the specific intent expressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The State suggests that other causes were involved, but it fails to explain how the other causes gave rise to the massive shifts of population and the specific targeting of Republicans. It notes, for example, that the need to prevent the new First District from crossing the Chesapeake Bay gave rise to extending the First District around the northern part of the State, effectively requiring that the eastern boundary of the Sixth District be moved westward. Even accepting this suggestion - and, indeed, other similar adjustments to accommodate precise populations and other legitimate redistricting goals - none explains the dramatic exchange of populations between the Sixth and Eighth Districts. Moreover, the State's suggestions do not explain the undisputed fact that virtually all the Democratic officials involved stated that the redistricting operation was guided by the expressed plan to protect existing Democratic seats and flip the Sixth District from Republican to Democratic control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The State separately suggests that there was an expressed interest in grouping residents along the Interstate 270 corridor in one district. As for this argument, however, there is no evidence that the presence of an interstate highway running from the City of Frederick to southern Montgomery County was the reason for the reconfiguration of both the Sixth and Eighth Districts, as distinct from a post-hoc rationalization. In fact, there is affirmative evidence that the I-270 corridor was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   a reason for the reconfigurations, including both the utter implausibility of the rationale and statements from key decisionmakers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   In short, while there may have been other causes that could have marginally altered the Sixth District, the striking actions complained of are not explained by the State's proffers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Moreover, for these same reasons, the State has certainly not shown that its redistricting law was narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling government interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   In sum, the record amply demonstrates that the State violated the First Amendment under the standard we previously set forth in this case; indeed, there is no way, based on this record, that we could conclude otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   IV.

And focusing on political association in particular, Justice Kagan likewise observed only recently that plaintiffs can prove injury in the form of associational harm, as \"distinct from vote dilution,\" by showing that the State has \"burdened the ability of like-minded people across the State to affiliate in a political party and carry out that organization's activities and objects.\"\n   <em>\n    Gill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612324\" index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1916/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 1938-39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Kagan, J., concurring).

Thus, they must prove (1) intent, as described in Part III,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ; (2) that the challenged map burdened the targeted citizens' ability to associate in furtherance of their political beliefs and aims; and (3) causation, again as described in Part III,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Before turning to address the merits of the plaintiffs' claim premised on associational harm, however, we again address in this context the State's threshold argument that the plaintiffs have \"failed to produce evidence sufficient to establish that they suffered legally cognizable individual harm,\" as necessary to satisfy the injury-in-fact component of Article III standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The State's argument that the plaintiffs lack standing to bring a partisan gerrymandering claim premised on harm to their associational rights under the First Amendment is governed by the same principles applicable to the plaintiffs' claim for injury to their representational rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Part III.A,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . Only the nature of the injury is distinct. While vote dilution diminishes the targeted voters' opportunity to elect a candidate of their choice, the associational injury is the burden imposed on the targeted party members' ability to affiliate with their political party to carry out its activities and achieve its aims. As Justice Kagan explained in\n   <em>\n    Gill\n   </em>\n   , \"if the gerrymander ravaged the party [the plaintiff] works to support, then he indeed suffers harm, as do all other involved members of that party.\" 138 S.Ct. at 1938 (Kagan, J., concurring).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   In this case, the plaintiffs claim that by moving, on net, 66,000 Republican voters - over 30% of the Republican voters - from the Sixth District and replacing them with a net of 24,000 Democratic voters, the Republican Party in the Sixth District was indeed \"ravaged.\" As they showed and as described in more detail below, interest among potential Republican voters in the Sixth District declined, fundraising diminished, and enthusiasm among members of the Republican Party\n   was damaged. And certain of the plaintiffs specifically described facing this type of waning interest. We conclude that the plaintiffs, as the ones claiming to have personally suffered associational injury by reason of the 2011 redistricting, have standing to challenge its constitutionality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Turning to the merits, we conclude, based on the summary judgment record, that the plaintiffs have sufficiently established their First Amendment partisan gerrymandering claim as premised on harm to their associational rights. The plaintiffs, relying on undisputed facts of record, again have shown that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , as explained in Part III.B,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , which is also applicable here, in redrawing the lines of the Sixth District, the State acted with constitutionally impermissible intent to disadvantage certain citizens based on their party affiliation and voting history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , with respect to the injury element, the plaintiffs have shown that the 2011 redistricting plan did indeed burden their associational rights. Before the 2011 redistricting, the Sixth District was safely Republican. The Republican congressional representative in the District had been elected to represent the District since 1993, and he won reelection in 2010 by a margin of 28%. But to break that hold by the Republican Party, State officials moved over 30% of registered Republican voters from the District based on their voting history and replaced them with Democratic voters. The plaintiffs have shown that thereafter voter engagement in support of the Republican Party dropped significantly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Specifically, they demonstrated that, in midterm election years, Republican participation in Republican primaries in the counties that remained entirely in the Sixth District fell significantly. In Allegany County, for example, Republican voter participation went from 42.8% in the 2010 primary to 26.7% in the 2014 primary. ECF No. 191-11 at 3, 9-10.

Because the State's enactment of the 2011 redistricting law violated the plaintiffs' First Amendment rights, it is well recognized that the plaintiffs are, and will be, experiencing ongoing constitutional injury in the absence of a new redistricting map.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    League of Women Voters of N.C. v.

And only an injunction mandating a new, lawful map, not money damages, can remedy this injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   While the State does not really challenge these conclusions, it argues that the plaintiffs' interest in redress is weakened by the fact that any new map will only be in place for the 2020 election cycle. This argument presupposes that because there are five congressional elections after each decennial census, one unconstitutional election somehow lacks sufficient importance to justify a remedy. Unfortunately, this argument overlooks the fact that plaintiffs have ongoing associational injury and will suffer additional representational injury during both the 2020 primary election and the 2020 general election if the injunction is not entered. These are injuries resulting from a serious constitutional violation and do not deserve to be demeaned by an approach that tells the plaintiffs essentially \"to bear it because it will be over soon\" - \"soon\" meaning in two years. Every election employing constitutionally deficient districts causes irreparable harm. \"[O]nce the election occurs, there can be no do-over and no redress. The injury to these\n   voters is real and completely irreparable if nothing is done to enjoin this law.\"\n   <em>\n    League of Women Voters of N.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265715\" index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/769/224/#p247\">\n    769 F.3d at 247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   With respect to the balance of the equities, the State relies on the Supreme Court's explanation for affirming the denial of preliminary injunctive relief in this case based on the plaintiffs' delay in seeking that relief to argue that the balance tips in the State's favor with respect to now granting\n   <em>\n    vel non\n   </em>\n   a permanent injunction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Benisek\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 1944. But the difference between the plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction and their efforts to obtain a permanent injunction cannot be so quickly overlooked. The plaintiffs asked for a preliminary injunction, which operates only\n   <em>\n    pendente lite\n   </em>\n   , some three and a half years after this action was commenced, and the Supreme Court concluded that such delay was significant with respect to the interim relief being sought. But a permanent injunction, which we are now addressing, is the ultimate remedy that was sought in this action, and it was requested when the litigation was first commenced in 2013. While it is true that the case has dragged on, that protraction cannot be attributed to the plaintiffs, but to process. This case traveled to the Supreme Court twice and came back to us twice, and we have not seen any dilatory efforts during the process that was before us - either by the plaintiffs or by the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Finally, we conclude that a permanent injunction in this case will serve the public interest. It will redress a serious, ongoing constitutional injury and enable a large number of Maryland voters to more fully participate in congressional elections. While the State argues that a permanent injunction will be unduly disruptive, we note our judgment is being issued two years before the next general election - a time period that will allow the State to comply in an orderly fashion. The relief sought in this case is discrete and limited, seeking only to remedy the redrawing of the Sixth District's lines in a manner that renders them constitutional. Indeed, the plaintiffs have proposed a map that would require modifying only the border between the Sixth and Eighth Districts. We are confident that the State, if it acts diligently, will have little trouble devising an alternative map in time for the 2020 election. Finally, we believe that redrawing district lines to comply with the Constitution will not sow any additional confusion beyond that caused by the illegal lines themselves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Accordingly, we will enter an injunction (1) permanently enjoining the State from conducting any further elections for members of the U.S. House of Representatives under the 2011 congressional redistricting plan and (2) directing the State to adopt promptly a new congressional districting plan that addresses the constitutional violations found here with respect to the Sixth District for use in the 2020 elections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Judge Niemeyer wrote the opinion, in which Judge Russell joined.

His opinion for the Court considers evidence of electoral outcomes as proof that the gerrymander succeeded-in short, that the map-drawers flipped the Sixth District from red to blue. In considering this evidence, the opinion performs a causation analysis-under both the representational rights and associational rights theories-that would ask future courts to discern whether a given electoral outcome resulted from a legislative\n   manipulation of voters or from the voters themselves changing their minds.\n   <em>\n    Shapiro v.

The inherent uncertainty in what causes individuals to vote as they do in a particular election makes it challenging-perhaps impossible-to conclude that a given instance of partisan gerrymandering caused an election to turn out as it did. The Supreme Court's requirements for a standard are exacting in this context, so much so that the Court has cast aside numerous attempted standards. Assessing causation by examining the outcome of any given election will always be problematic. And, such a problematic test probably does not satisfy the requirement of\n   <em>\n    Vieth\n   </em>\n   that the tool used to gauge lawfulness be \"principled, rational, and based upon reasoned distinction.\"\n   <em>\n    Vieth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5920475\" index=\"254\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/267/\">\n    541 U.S. at 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5920475\" index=\"255\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/267/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 1769\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First, the representational rights analysis appears to line up with the many other valiant-though nonetheless rejected-attempts at crafting a standard for partisan gerrymandering claims because it does not articulate a sufficiently concrete and measurable standard. Beyond the causation problems connected to reliance on electoral outcomes for proof, it also leaves unanswered the line-drawing question: how much political consideration is\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   and how much violates the Constitution?\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Vieth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5920475\" index=\"257\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/267/\">\n    541 U.S. at 291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5920475\" index=\"258\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/267/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 1769\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting as not judicially manageable a standard that weighs factors \"with an eye to ascertaining whether the particular gerrymander has gone too far\").

Even without any evidence of electoral outcomes, the plaintiffs have established a retaliation violation of their First Amendment right to associate. I therefore concur in the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   As articulated by Judge Niemeyer, plaintiffs can establish a partisan gerrymandering First Amendment retaliation violation involving associational harm when they prove that: (1) those responsible for the redistricting drew the boundaries with the specific intent to impose a burden on plaintiffs and similarly situated citizens because of how they voted or the political party with which they were affiliated; (2) \"the challenged map burdened the targeted citizens' ability to associate in furtherance of their political beliefs and aims\"; and (3) the map-drawers' intent to burden was a but-for cause of the adverse impact.

I add that\n   no mention of electoral outcomes is necessary to prove such a violation, and, indeed, any mention must be omitted to establish a workable standard under\n   <em>\n    Vieth\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Regardless of whether the State succeeded in its obvious intent to increase the likelihood that a Democrat would win the Sixth District, the State certainly caused harm. The State targeted voters because of the political party affiliation they claimed (Republican) and with whom they associated (other Repulicans). The State\n   <em>\n    retaliated\n   </em>\n   against voters for those associations. This harm differs from a violation of representational rights in that it does not matter if \"[a voter's] individual vote carries ... less weight than it did before.\"\n   <em>\n    Gill\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 1938 (Kagan, J., concurring). Rather, the gerrymander of Maryland's Sixth Congressional District deprives the disfavored group of voters of its \"natural political strength\" by building roadblocks to \"fundraising, registering voters, attracting volunteers, generating support from independents, and recruiting candidates to run for office (not to mention eventually accomplishing their policy objectives).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This harm occurs before Election Day and persists long after. And, it is not measured by the outcome of a given election.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Illustrative examples of associational harm exist in the record before this Court. For one, during the 2011 redistricting process, the State divided Frederick County for the first time since 1840. Willis Dep. at 122 (ECF No. 177-14). Frederick County would constitute a community of interest under almost any definition of the term. The redistricting map shows that the State carved out the county seat, the City of Frederick, and siphoned the City and the County's more competitive precincts away from the more solidly Republican precincts. McDonald Expert Report at 23 &amp; Figure 6 (ECF No. 177-19). Sometimes a state may have to divide communities of interest in order to draw equal districts after a movement in population; however, the division of Frederick County is not such a collateral consequence. Coupled with ample evidence of legislative intent, the scooping out of Frederick's county seat and competitive precincts constitutes a blatant targeting of and retaliation against the Republicans in Frederick County. One Frederick County resident, who was moved from the Sixth to Eighth District, noted that he felt disoriented and disconnected after the redistricting: \"I have absolutely no connection with what is in this district except the portions of Frederick that were thrown in.\" Cueman Dep. at 36-37 (ECF No. 177-55). This is the essence of associational harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Here, the plaintiffs establish associational harm because they present evidence, primarily in the form of voter testimony, that the gerrymander \"ravaged the party.\"\n   <em>\n    Gill\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 1938 (Kagan, J., concurring). The map-drawers removed over 66,000 registered Republicans from the Sixth District and added over 24,000 Democrats. Joint Stipulations \u00b6\u00b6 10, 53 (ECF. No. 177-5). When the redistricting map arose in committee and, subsequently, on the legislative floor, not a single Republican senator or delegate voted for it. Joint Stipulations \u00b6 36. The plaintiffs present testimony, which Judge Niemeyer summarizes, Part I.A,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , at 507-09, showing that numerous Republicans from the Sixth District felt disenfranchised and said that their vote no longer mattered. Strine Dep. 61-63 (ECF No. 177-53); Cueman Dep. at 36. The plaintiffs testified that the 2011 redistricting foiled Republican organizational efforts. Volunteers spent significant time helping voters determine in which district they were voting. Ropp Dep. at 36-38 (ECF No. 177-54). And, Republicans lacked enthusiasm, repeating \"there's just no point in voting anymore\" because it seemed like \"a losing race.\" Strine Dep. at 63. The plaintiffs cite corroborating evidence\n   that Republican voter turnout dropped, and Republican fundraising dropped too. Voter Turnout Statistics for 2010 and 2014 Maryland Congressional Primary Elections at 3 (ECF No. 191-11); Stein Decl. at 8 (ECF No. 210-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Turning to causation, I note that the definition of associational harm simplifies the analysis and avoids any line-drawing problem. For an associational rights violation, the causation analysis stops when the map-drawers sketch the lines, adopt the plan, and make it law. There is no need to look to Election Day. The harm has already occurred. Members of the disadvantaged party have been severed from their preferred associates. Consequently, they feel that voting is futile. Organizers cannot effectively recruit volunteers or fundraise. Ties to communities of interest are diminished. The gerrymander has \"ravaged the party\" before its members can even go to the ballot box.\n   <em>\n    Gill\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 1938 (Kagan, J., concurring). Because map-drawers inevitably move, with each redistricting, some voters into districts in which their votes will carry less weight, any theory that relies on measuring vote dilution depends on drawing a line at which point the dilution is too much. By contrast, under an associational rights theory, any retaliation against a voter based on his or her affiliations is a constitutional violation. For that reason, the theory is more concrete and the violation more measurable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   I conclude that a First Amendment retaliation claim involving associational harm is not only cognizable,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   it is capable of measurement and assessment by concrete standards. Such a claim is therefore justiciable in the partisan gerrymandering context. Although I disagree with Judge Niemeyer and Judge Russell's focus on vote dilution and electoral outcomes, I do agree with my colleagues in a principally important respect: the plaintiffs have established as a matter of law that the State retaliated against them in violation of their First Amendment rights. Accordingly, I concur in the judgment docketed with the Court's opinions.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-161\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Republican Party of N.C. v.

The latter is dependent on how people vote. Courts cannot and should not try to answer the question of whether a partisan gerrymander succeeded in changing the outcome of an election. There are simply too many variables in play-variables that courts are not equipped to measure.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-163\">\n    Arguably, as I frame the problem, this is no longer even an issue of \"gerrymandering,\" if that term is understood to be the purposeful drawing of district boundaries to affect the outcome of elections. As I have framed the issue and its resolution, the State here may be guilty of \"gerrymandering,\" but they are also guilty of a separate and different misconduct-the intentional retaliation against certain individuals because of their affiliation with a particular political party. In this sense the case, at least for my purposes, is not about voting or the outcome of particular elections. But it is most certainly about the unjustified and illegal retaliation, by state actors, against individuals in consequence of their having exercised a core constitutional right.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"concurrence\">\n  <author id=\"p-156\">\n   RUSSELL, District Judge, concurring:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   I entirely concur in Judge Niemeyer's fine opinion for the Court. There is an illegal, partisan gerrymander in Maryland, and it succeeded in flipping the Sixth District.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   I agree with Judge Niemeyer that evidence of impact on election results is relevant and germane to the adjudication of associational claims, and that such evidence is non-problematic in that context. However, I also agree with Chief Judge Bredar's separate conclusion that a First Amendment retaliation claim is sufficiently stated and justiciable\n   <em>\n    without reference to the results of particular elections\n   </em>\n   . Accordingly, on the record of this case, in addition to joining Judge Niemeyer, I join Chief Judge Bredar's narrower opinion because I agree that the Plaintiffs have proven that they were the victims of First Amendment retaliation wholly apart from the impact on any election. In my view, Plaintiffs prevail on\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   the broad theory articulated by Judge Niemeyer\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the\n   narrow one expressed by Chief Judge Bredar.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
