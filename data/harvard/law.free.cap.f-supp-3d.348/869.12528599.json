Due to the area's development, the \"bypass\" would no longer \"bypass\" the city, but would be an \"arterial roadway\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   on the west side of Waukesha. After several years of review, the project gained the necessary agency approvals to begin construction-only this case remains.

The court will deny the plaintiffs' request and dismiss the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This highway project is colloquially known as the \"West Waukesha Bypass.\" Final Environmental Impact Statement (\"Final EIS\") \u00a7 1.1.1 at AR1059. The project involves the construction of an \"arterial roadway\" on the west side of the City of Waukesha, in a \"project corridor\" running north-south between Rolling Ridge Drive on its northern end and the intersection of Wisconsin Highway 59 and County Highway X on its southern end.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Dkt. No. 37 at 1-2. The project corridor consists of roadways with varying characteristics, including \"substandard hills and curves, high number of access points, narrow shoulders, and substandard stopping sight distance and intersection sight distance....\" Final EIS \u00a7 1.4 at AR1085. Because \"[t]he gap in the circumferential route around the city of Waukesha creates increased demand on project area roads and impedes the flow of people and goods into and out of the area,\" the defendants proposed to build a \"more reliable north-south arterial on the west side of Waukesha ... to connect the area south of Waukesha with I-94.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 11, 2010, the Federal Highway Administration (\"FHWA\") announced that, in conjunction with the United States Department of Transportation (\"USDOT\"), the Wisconsin Department of Transportation (\"WisDOT\") and the Waukesha County Department of Public Works, it would prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (\"EIS\") for the proposed project. Dkt. No. 31 at 11. The agencies released a Draft EIS on October 12, 2012, after \"open house public information meetings\" in May, July and August of 2010 and February of 2011. Dkt. No. 37 at 7; Draft EIS at AR70. The Draft EIS stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   The purpose of the West Waukesha Bypass is to provide a safe and efficient north-south arterial roadway on the west side of the City of Waukesha to complete the long-planned circumferential route around Waukesha; to accommodate growing traffic volumes along the corridor; and to improve roadway deficiencies that include tight curves, steep hills, narrow lanes, and lack of shoulders. The proposed improvements address two major needs:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Improve safety by providing a roadway that meets current design standards.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Accommodate traffic demand generated by existing and planned development within and outside the study corridor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The need for the proposed action is demonstrated through a combination of factors that include project history, regional/local transportation and land-use planning, traffic demand, safety concerns, existing roadway deficiencies, system linkage, and environmental aspects.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Draft EIS at AR66.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After release of the draft EIS, the defendant agencies held a hearing at Waukesha North High School from four p.m. to eight p.m. on November 13, 2012. Final EIS \u00a7 6.1 at AR1460. \"The public hearing was a hybrid of the open house and formal hearing formats.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   More specifically,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Representatives from WisDOT [the Wisconsin Department of Transportation], Waukesha County, and the consultant team were available to review project alternatives, listen to comments, answer questions, and explain procedures for providing testimony. At 5 p.m., the hearing chairman convened a formal hearing in the school auditorium. Three formats were available for providing testimony at the hearing: public testimony to a panel of project representatives in the auditorium, private oral testimony to court reporters, and written comment forms, letters, or e-mail. Comment forms or letters could also be mailed\n   after the public hearing, or comments could be e-mailed to the project's e-mail address.... All forms of testimony were given equal consideration. The duration of the comment period for the Draft EIS was October 26 to December 10, 2012.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20147856\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In September 2014, the defendants issued the project's Final EIS. Final EIS at AR1021. The project's purpose and need statement remained the same in the Final EIS as in the Draft EIS. Dkt.

The Final EIS chose and analyzed the \"preferred alternative\" from the Draft EIS for the project: a \"4-lane divided TT2 Alignment between I-94 and the Wisconsin and Southern Railroad and the 4-lane divided Pebble Creek West Alternative between the railroad and WIS 59.\" Final EIS \u00a7 2.6, at AR1137. Using the Final EIS, the defendants issued a Record of Decision (\"ROD\") on January 20, 2015 which selected this \"preferred alternative\" for the construction of the project. Dkt. No. 31 at 13; ROD at AR3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A year later, in 2016, the defendants proposed to redesign a portion of the project. Dkt. No. 37 at 10. The re-design sought to shift a segment of the project's alignment to avoid impacting a wetland.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   To analyze the environmental effects of this proposed new alignment-called the \"Rotated Pebble Creek West\" alternative-the agencies produced and released a reevaluation document on July 22, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In the reevaluation, the defendants concluded that a supplemental EIS was unnecessary:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   All resource studies undertaken as part of the final EIS included the location of the Rotated Pebble Creek West alignment which is located between the Pebble Creek West and Pebble Creek Far West alternatives. Even though resource studies did not contemplate the Rotated Pebble Creek West alignment, the studies were re-evaluated to a level that supports their sufficiency in concluding that there are no new significant impacts as a result of the rotated alignment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Reevaluation at 16, at AR29873.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On July 2, 2015, plaintiffs Waukesha County Environmental Action League and Coalition Opposed to the West Waukesha Bypass, UA filed this lawsuit for declaratory and injunctive relief against the above-named defendants. Dkt. No. 1. On December 15, 2015, Judge Rudolph T. Randa (to whom the case originally was assigned) conducted a scheduling conference in which the parties \"agree[d] to handle the case as an administrative appeal and dispense with summary judgment format ....\" Dkt. No. 14 at 1. On November 27, 2016, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, adding allegations pertaining to the project's 2016 re-design. Dkt. No. 27. The amended complaint asked the court to: (1) declare that the Final EIS, the ROD and the reevaluation violate the National Environmental Policy Act (\"NEPA\"), the Federal-Aid Highways Act, the Endangered Species Act (\"ESA\"), and the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"); (2) set aside and remand the Final EIS, the ROD and the reevaluation; (3) enjoin the defendants from taking any action in furtherance of implementing the Final EIS, the ROD, and the reevaluation until they come into compliance with federal law; and (4) award plaintiffs their costs and attorney's fees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The plaintiffs filed a fifty-page brief in support of their positions on December 16, 2016. Dkt. No. 31. On January 20, 2017, the defendants filed two separate opposition briefs-one by defendant Mark Gottleib (now Dave Ross), Dkt. No. 36, and one by the remaining \"federal defendants.\" Dkt. No. 37. The plaintiffs filed a reply on\n   February 20, 2017. Dkt. No. 38. Three months later, the plaintiffs filed a document titled \"Plaintiffs' Notice of Project Construction Activities and Request for an Expedited Ruling.\" Dkt. No. 40. This motion stated that the Wisconsin Department of Transportation had started construction activities on the northern end of the project, and urged the court \"to issue a ruling on the merits of Plaintiffs' NEPA claim as expeditiously as the Court's schedule permits.\" Dkt. No. 40 at 1-2. The court heard oral argument on July 11, 2017. Dkt. No. 43. It has taken the court time to issue its ruling, which spurred the plaintiffs to file two further documents: (1) a \"notice regarding status of work on project and request for a ruling,\" dkt. no. 44; and (2) an unopposed motion for a telephonic status conference to ask for emergency injunctive relief, dkt. no. 45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Here, interested citizens had just such an opportunity; the auditorium hearing gave interested citizens the opportunity to influence\n   the agency representatives and those other individuals who chose to attend the auditorium hearing. The fact that one or more citizens chose to attend other presentations going on at the same time does not change the fact that they had the opportunity to attend the auditorium hearing. The answer to the question of whether the defendants held a \"public hearing\" does not turn on whether anyone chooses to attend that hearing-the question is whether they had the opportunity to do so.

As to the prospective phrasing of the mitigation measures, the defendants state that, at the early stage of the design process, the creators of the Final EIS and ROD did\n   not have enough details to make final decisions on the particular mitigation and/or best management practices that will be most effective in mitigating the project's environmental effects.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The ROD details discussion on the mitigation efforts of the project.

But phrasing mitigation strategies as prospective is not arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law; in fact, the Supreme Court has held that \"it would be inconsistent with NEPA's reliance on procedural mechanisms-as opposed to substantive, result-based standards-to demand the presence of a fully developed plan that will mitigate environmental harm before an agency can act.\"\n   <em>\n    Robertson\n   </em>\n   , 490 U.S. at 353,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605709\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/332/#p349\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1835\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that the Court of Appeals erred in finding that NEPA \"entail[ed] the further duty to include in every EIS a detailed explanation of specific measures which\n   <em>\n    will\n   </em>\n   be employed to mitigate the adverse impacts of a proposed action.\") (internal quotations omitted) (emphasis in original).

The plaintiffs note that, after the project re-design, the agencies discarded a mitigation condition that the Army Corps' of Engineers had previously mandated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40. The plaintiffs also say that because the re-design increased the amount of damage to upland habitat that would result from the project, the defendants' reliance on the Army Corps' concurrence with their mitigation strategy violated NEPA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   It appears that after finalizing the Final EIS and ROD, the defendants submitted a request for a wetland fill permit from the Army Corps of Engineers under the Clean Water Act. Least Environmentally Damaging Practicable Alternative (\"LEDPA\") Memo p. 2-3 at SAR29904-05. Because the project would impact a wetland (Wetland-8), the Corps imposed the following mitigation conditions for the project before the Corps would issue a permit: (1) \"Preserve an offsite fen within the Upper Fox River Watershed to mitigate for impacts to W-8; (2) Permanent, legal protection of the interior forest habitat and surrounding uplands on Buzz Hardy property; and (3) Mitigate for trees lost in the primary environmental corridor upland woods south of Sunset Drive.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, SAR29904-05. In response, the defendant agencies re-designed the project to the Rotated Pebble Creek West alignment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3, SAR29905. This redesign avoided impacting Wetland-8, which meant that they were no longer required to obtain a wetland fill permit from the Corps.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5, SAR29905-06.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The Corps imposed its original mitigation conditions based on the project's impacts on Wetland-8.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, 29904-05. Once the redesign avoided that impact, both the EPA and the Corps concurred with the agencies' mitigation strategy and no longer required the permanent, legal protection of the interior forest habitat and surrounding uplands on the Buzz Hardy property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   EPA Letter, June 6, 2016 at SAR29922-23 (\"Based on EPA's review of the re-evaluation, the County's letter, and\n   U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' letter dated April 25, 2016 ...

Once the redesign avoided those impacts, it followed that the upland forest mitigation requirement would drop from the picture. The court cannot conclude that the defendants impermissibly delegated their NEPA duties to the Army Corps' of Engineers. The record shows that the agencies presented a detailed discussion of the Rotated Pebble Creek West alignment in their memo to the Corps and to the EPA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LEDPA at SAR29903-29910. The defendants requested agency concurrence, and they got it. While the new, Rotated Pebble Creek West alignment had greater upland habitat impacts, it also avoided altogether the impacts to Wetland 8. The court's role is not to second-guess the expertise of the agency in its weighing of certain environmental benefits as opposed to others; the court reviews only whether the agency followed the procedures prescribed by NEPA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Habitat Educ.

Instead, they argue that those metrics should not be enough to conclude that the project will not adversely affect the bats. They provide no authority showing why the 2015 acoustic surveys provide a superior scientific metric than measuring the presence of hibernacula or maternity roost trees. The plaintiffs have given the court no reason to question the expertise of the FWS in its determination that the presence of hibernacula and maternity roost trees supplied a superior metric for determining whether a project would result in a prohibited take of the bats.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    San Luis &amp; Delta-Mendota Water Authority v.
