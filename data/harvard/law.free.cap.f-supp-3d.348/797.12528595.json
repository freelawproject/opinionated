After the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation assigned these suits to the undersigned judge, Doc. 1, Plaintiffs filed five consolidated class action complaints, Docs. 120-123, 143, which alleged that they were misled by the labels because the products contain non-cheese ingredients such as cellulose. Defendants moved to dismiss the complaints under Civil Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). The court denied the Rule 12(b)(1) motions but granted the Rule 12(b)(6) motions without prejudice to repleading. Docs. 215-216 (reported\n   at\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12418866\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/275/910/\">\n    275 F.Supp.3d 910\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D.

Doc. 225 (against Kraft Heinz Company); Doc. 226 (against Publix Super Markets, Inc.); Doc. 227 (against Albertsons Companies, Inc., Albertsons LLC, and SuperValu, Inc.); Doc. 228 (against Target Corp. and ICCO-Cheese Company, Inc.); Doc. 229 (against Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and ICCO-Cheese Company, Inc.). Like the initial complaints, the amended complaints allege that Plaintiffs were misled by the \"100% Grated Parmesan Cheese\" labels because the products contained cellulose and other non-cheese ingredients. In addition, the amended complaints except for the one against Publix allege that the products' ingredient lists are misleading because they say that the cellulose was added to prevent caking, when in fact it also acted as filler.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendants move to dismiss the amended complaints under Civil Rule 12(b)(6), Docs. 237, 238, 243, 246, 249, incorporating by reference many of the arguments they made in litigating the motions to dismiss the initial complaints.

In short, when \"a plaintiff contends that certain aspects of a product's packaging are misleading in isolation, but an ingredient label or other disclaimer would dispel any confusion, the crucial issue is whether the misleading content is ambiguous; if so, context [such as an ingredient label] can cure the ambiguity and defeat the claim, but if not, then context will not cure the deception and the claim may proceed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12418866\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/275/910/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 922 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Solak v.

In challenging that conclusion, Plaintiffs cite two reports from linguistics professors opining that the phrase \"100% Grated Parmesan Cheese\" conveys only the message that the products consist entirely of cheese. Doc. 255 at 7-8. The linguists do not advance Plaintiffs' cause. As an initial matter, a reasonable consumer-the touchstone for analysis under the consumer fraud statutes-does not approach or interpret language in the manner of a linguistics professor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rugg v.

As the court explained, that context is important given that the \"products are packaged and shelf-stable at room temperature, a quality that reasonable consumers know is not enjoyed by pure cheese,\" and that \"reasonable consumers are well aware that pure dairy products spoil, grow blue, green, or black fuzz, or otherwise become inedible if left unrefrigerated for an extended period of time.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12418866\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/275/910/\">\n    275 F.Supp.3d at 923\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As the Seventh Circuit has held, it is \"well settled\" that a court, on its own, may \"determine as a matter of law\" that \"an allegedly deceptive advertisement would not have misled a reasonable consumer.\"\n   <em>\n    Fink v. Time Warner Cable\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5868029\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/714/739/#p741\">\n    714 F.3d 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 741 (2d Cir. 2013).

Moreover, it bears mention that the surveys find that some consumers do\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   believe that the products are 100% cheese; the disagreement between those consumers and those who\n   <em>\n    do\n   </em>\n   believe that the products are 100% cheese supports, rather than refutes, the notion that the label is ambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs cite a Kraft patent teaching a method for manufacturing grated parmesan cheese, which states that \"[f]ully cured Parmesan cheese is very hard and keeps almost indefinitely,\" and a U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service webpage, which states that, \"[a]s a general rule ... grated Parmesan do[es] not require refrigeration for safety, but ... will last longer if kept refrigerated.\" Doc. 255 at 16 &amp; n.1. These materials do not render unambiguous the phrase \"100% Grated Parmesan Cheese.\" There is no reason to believe that either the patent or the Department of Agriculture report would be familiar to a reasonable consumer with an ordinary understanding of how dairy products generally fare when unrefrigerated. In any event, by saying that pure grated parmesan \"keeps\n   <em>\n    almost\n   </em>\n   indefinitely\" and, \"[a]s a\n   <em>\n    general\n   </em>\n   rule,\" \"will last\n   <em>\n    longer\n   </em>\n   if kept refrigerated,\" the materials necessarily imply that pure grated parmesan will\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   keep indefinitely if left unrefrigerated. The materials therefore do not undermine the court's view that a reasonable consumer\n   would not presume that a shelf-stable dairy product was 100% cheese or would disregard the \"well-known fact[ ] of life\" that pure dairy products spoil if left unrefrigerated.\n   <em>\n    Red v.

There is no reason to run this issue to ground, however; because the Alabama express warranty claims against SuperValu and Kraft, the ICFA claims against Albertsons/SuperValu and Kraft, and the Illinois express and implied warranty claims against Albertsons survive dismissal, there remain several claims on which to ground the Alabama and Illinois unjust enrichment claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Finally, Kraft argues that the Michigan unjust enrichment claims fail because Michigan law requires a plaintiff to show that he \"directly conferred a benefit on the defendant.\" Doc. 162 at 29 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Storey v.
