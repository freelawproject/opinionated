Plaintiffs are members of a proposed class of approximately 6,000 individuals in Ohio taking HIV-related medications for treatment and prevention of medical conditions related to being HIV-positive. They are clients of the Ohio HIV Drug Assistance Program (\"OHDAP\"). The OHDAP website states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   The Ohio Department of Health (ODH) administers the Ohio HIV Drug Assistance Program (OHDAP), providing medications to fight HIV and to treat HIV-related conditions. This program must be the payer of last resort. For eligible participants, HIV-related medications are provided free of charge. The medications are obtained through a specialty mail-order pharmacy to ensure confidentiality and to ensure all geographic areas of Ohio have equal access to this service. Verification of monthly income, updated enrollment applications and a physician's report are required at the beginning of each enrollment period.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    http://ohiv.org/care/medication-pavment-assistance/\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    last accessed 11/14/2018\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The following facts are taken from the Amended Complaint in Case No. 2:18-cv-238, (\"Complaint A\"):\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Caremark, a foreign limited liability company with its principal place of business in either Rhode Island or Illinois, entered into an agreement with the State of Ohio to operate as the pharmacy benefits manager for the OHDAP program. Caremark contracted with Fiserv to mail information to Plaintiffs and approximately 6,000 other patients throughout Ohio in the proposed class. (\n   <em>\n    Complaint A,\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 38, \u00b6\u00b6 5-8.)\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   12. OhDAP was initially established in 1990 under the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Extension Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 300ff,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   This federal legislation has been renewed four times - 1996, 2000, 2006 and 2009 - and is now called the Ryan White Program within Ohio and nationwide.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   13. There are three main components within OhDAP. One component is for direct drug provision for eligible uninsured individuals (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   individuals with HIV who are not eligible for Medicaid due to income level or citizenship status). Another component is used to provide premium assistance to eligible individuals (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , ACA, Medicare Part D, private health insurance or the employee copayment or coinsurance portion of employer-based insurance). The last component assists insured individuals with their co-pays for their life-saving HIV-related medications.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   14. To participate in OhDAP, an individual must submit an application and certify that he or she is HIV-positive, stating the year of the individual's first positive HIV test. The applicant must also attach \"medical verification documents,\" which \"are required to establish that an individual is HIV+ and, thus, eligible for our services.\" Therefore, for purposes of OhDAP, an individual's HIV-positive status necessarily means that the individual has had an HIV test performed on him or her, the result of that HIV test was positive, and provided Personal Health Information (\"PHI\") to a third party reflecting those results.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   15. In February 2017, ODH issued a request for proposals for the purchase of pharmacy benefit management services for OhDAP. The first criterion for evaluating services to be provided under the contract was \"Pharmacy Services,\" the first of which was the development of a pharmacy distribution network. CVS, which submitted a proposal to promote, market and sell its services to ODH, proposed to create this network through its own retail and mail-order pharmacies, through which it has provided medications under contracts with OhDAP since 2000. In the cover letter for its bid, CVS stated, \"All of the information contained in this proposal references the capabilities of, and services available from Caremark, L.L.C. ('CVS Caremark').\" CVS also stated that it is a health care provider: after stating that it was using the terms \"CVS Health\" and \"CVS Caremark\" interchangeably, CVS stated, \"As a Fortune 10 company, CVS Health is the largest pharmacy health care provider in the United States with integrated offerings across the entire spectrum of pharmacy care.\" In another part of its bid, CVS also stated, \"We understand that offering open access to pharmacy services and honoring consumer preferences (retail, mail delivery, or personal consultation with a CVS pharmacist) sets us apart from other health care providers.\" CVS also repeatedly described its delivery of healthcare services under the heading \"Pharmacy Distribution Network.\" For example, CVS stated, \"Our therapy-specific CareTeam outreach, provided by expert specialty pharmacy clinicians with up-to-date knowledge of evidence based protocols, helps improve member adherence by educating them on taking medications correctly, reviewing proper\n   medication storage and handling, and troubleshooting medication side effects.... Additionally, our national nursing model delivers specialty nursing services, education, and drug administration to our members who receive infusion and injection medications ....\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   16. CVS's bid, which was made in connection with the marketing, promotion, offering for sale and sale of such services, also represented that it understood state and federal laws concerning the privacy of personal information and thus the extent to which it maintains and protects the privacy, confidentiality and integrity of personal information collected from or about consumers: \"We are in compliance with federal and state laws and regulations that are applicable to the services to be provided by CVS Health under the Contract.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   17. In March 2017, ODH awarded an exclusive contract to CVS, effective July 2017. Through this contract and others, CVS is responsible not only for managing OhDAP's pharmacy benefits, but also providing medications to OhDAP participants.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   18. Beginning in approximately late July or early August 2017, Defendants mailed a letter containing membership cards and information marketing and promoting the CVS program and how persons would access their HIV-related prescriptions. This letter was mailed to an estimated 6,000 participants in OhDAP, regardless of whether they were active pharmacy customers of CVS, and thus marketed and promoted the use not only of CVS's pharmacy benefit management services, but also of its health care delivery services. The letter advised OhDAP participants that they could obtain their HIV medications in one of two ways, both provided exclusively by CVS-affiliated entities: from one of CVS's 320 retail pharmacies in Ohio (as well as 59 pharmacies located in Target stores), or through CVS's specialty mail-order pharmacy. Such services were thus offered from CVS as a singular health care entity, since otherwise Caremark LLC would have been prohibited by law from sharing the PHI it possessed and was provided to it by the ODH with these other CVS entities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   19. Even though the information contained in this letter contained the PHI of each individual, specifically information relating to their HIV-positive status, the envelopes containing these mailings had two clear glassine windows. One, in the upper left, contained the logo of \"CVS/caremark,\" the words \"Ohio Department of Health,\" and an address for ODH. A second window contained the recipient's name and address, with the designation \"PM 6402 HIV\" directly above the person's name. This reference to the recipient's HIV status was plainly visible through the glassine window. The designation \"HIV\" in the program identification number was not required by ODH, but rather was created by CVS. The envelope referred in big red letters to \"new prescription benefits,\" thereby revealing that the mailing from CVS involved health-related information, including information about prescription medications. The envelope also stated that it was sent from St. Louis, Missouri, with Postal Permit No. 1977. Fiserv is the owner of this permit. Defendants clearly made no advance effort to test or review the disclosure of such information prior to disseminating the mailing, since had they done so they would have seen that the identification number with \"HIV\" next to it was prominently visible through the envelope....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   20. The Defendants' combined use of a glassine windowed envelope, their design of the letter containing the HIV status of the individual recipient in identification code that was not required by\n   law, and placing that code directly above the consumers' name and address such that no matter what size glassine envelope that was used this PHI could be seen through the envelope window, instead of using a different code, an opaque envelope or a letter that was properly spaced not to publicly reveal such information through the envelope window and an identification reference with the term \"HIV,\" resulted in the actual disclosure of recipients' HIV status to the United States Postal Service, which was not privileged to receive this information under Ohio law or federal law, and potential disclosure to numerous individuals, including their families, friends, roommates, landlords, neighbors, and complete strangers. A reasonable person seeing this envelope with the letter in it, or even seeing a mock-up of the letter with the code directly above the name, or creating the identification code in the first place, would conclude that the recipient was HIV-positive. That conclusion would be correct in every instance, as this mailing was sent only to HIV-positive individuals, apparently from ODH.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   21. The use of envelopes with transparent glassine windows contravenes the standard practice of ODH, which is to send all mailings relating to HIV-related issues in opaque, nonwindowed envelopes. Thus, Defendants must not have cleared the form of this mailing, or they did so with the knowledge of that Department in contravention of such practices.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   22. Defendants must have known, or either knew or reasonably should have known, that this mailing was disseminated in violation of both federal and state laws. While CVS refers in connection with its privacy practices to different entities as \"CVS Health\" as a collective health care entity, without defining precisely what entity they are referring to, CVS has publicly represented it has systems in place to protect the privacy of sensitive health information. For example, in its Vendor Code of Conduct entitled \"Conducting Business With CVS Health\" (which would apply to its relationship with Fiserv), CVS claims on page 3 \"It is critical that CVS Health and our vendors/suppliers, who also access, use and store this information, handle it only as needed and in accordance with our Privacy and Information Security Policies and Procedures as required under our agreement with our vendors/suppliers, including our Information Privacy and Security Requirements and Business Associate Agreements. It is critical that our vendors/suppliers have in place reasonable and appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect this information from improper or unauthorized access or use.\" In addition, CVS requires in this same Code of Conduct that its vendors and suppliers are expected \"to abide by applicable laws and regulations, including applicable Federal health care program requirements, in the states and countries in which they conduct business\" - in this case, the Ohio state laws here at issue. In addition, as noted above CVS requires all vendors to comply with CVS' Data Privacy and Security Requirement Agreements, its information Privacy and Security Requirements, and its Privacy and Information Security Policies. This Code of Conduct was executed by Neal Baker as the Chief Privacy Officer of \"CVS Health\" - the same person who responded to Plaintiffs' request for a response as to this particular privacy breach as set forth herein. Yet under no set of agreements, Codes, business associate agreements, policies or procedures would it be permissible to disclose\n   for public viewing the HIV status of a particular person, in violation of Ohio law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Compl.

For example, in the\n   <em>\n    Hageman\n   </em>\n   case,\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   the Ohio Supreme Court held that \"[a]n attorney may be liable to an opposing party for the unauthorized disclosure of that party's medical information that was obtained through litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Hageman,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3844696\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/119/185/#p188\">\n    119 Ohio St.3d 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 188,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=893%20N.E.2d%20153\">\n    893 N.E.2d 153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 154 (2008) (syllabus).

Defendants assert that all of the claims, including the\n   <em>\n    Biddle\n   </em>\n   claim and the Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 3701.243 claim, fail because Plaintiffs have not alleged \"actual disclosure\" of their confidential \"HIV-positive status.\" (\n   <em>\n    See Fiserve MTD, Case A,\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 44, p. 6.) The dictionary defines \"disclose\" as \"to make known or reveal to another or to the public.\"\n   <em>\n    https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/disclose\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    last visited 11/26/2018\n   </em>\n   ). At the outset, Plaintiffs assert that, inasmuch as they did not know Caremark had their information (the purpose of the mailing was to announce Caremark's participation in the OHDAP program) it is axiomatic that Plaintiffs did not, and could not have consented to Caremark's disclosure of their nonpublic medical information. (\n   <em>\n    Pl. Mem. Opp., Case B,\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 30, p. 8.) Thus, Plaintiffs assert that any disclosure of their confidential medical information is not an authorized disclosure. The Ohio Supreme Court made it clear that for purposes of the breach of medical confidentiality tort, the focus is on the patient's wishes, as \"it is for the patient - not some medical practitioner, lawyer, or court - to determine what the patient's interests are with regard to personal, confidential medical information.\"\n   <em>\n    Biddle,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"870657\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/86/395/#p408\">\n    86 Ohio St.3d at 408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=715%20N.E.2d%20518\">\n    715 N.E.2d 518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Defendants cite to\n   <em>\n    Yoder v.

However, the\n   <em>\n    Yoder\n   </em>\n   decision, decided before the Ohio Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Biddle,\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable for several reasons. In\n   <em>\n    Yoder,\n   </em>\n   the court determined that a breach of privacy tort could not be proven under the \"publicity\" theory of the tort of invasion of privacy under Ohio law, because the disclosure in that case could not be proven to have been made intentionally. The Court relied on key facts developed in the record on summary judgment: \"nothing on the outside of the envelope received in the Aro mail room indicated that it contained a confidential medical record,\" and \"the disclosure would not have occurred without Plaintiff's mother's intervening act of opening and reading the medical records without authorization from the Defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    Yoder,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"373264\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/31/565/#p570\">\n    31 F.Supp.2d at 570-71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Section 3701.243 of the Ohio Revised Code is titled \"Disclosing of HIV test results or diagnosis.\" It states, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   (A) Except as provided in this section or section 3701.248 of the Revised Code, no person or agency of state or local government that acquires the information while providing any health care service or while in the employ of a health care facility or health care provider shall\n   disclose or compel another to disclose any of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   (1) The identity of any individual on whom an HIV test is performed;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   (2) The results of an HIV test in a form that identifies the individual tested;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   (3) The identity of any individual diagnosed as having AIDS or an AIDS-related condition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   (D) The results of an HIV test or the identity of an individual on whom an HIV test is performed or who is diagnosed as having AIDS or an AIDS-related condition may be disclosed to a federal, state, or local government agency, or the official representative of such an agency, for purposes of the medicaid program, the medicare program, or any other public assistance program.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   (E) Any disclosure pursuant to this section shall be in writing and accompanied by a written statement that includes the following or substantially similar language: \"This information has been disclosed to you from confidential records protected from disclosure by state law.

Code \u00a7 3701.243(A) 1-3, (D),(E).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Defendant Fiserv moves to dismiss this statutory claim by arguing for a strained reading of the statute, asserting that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   [t]aken together, these provisions indicate that the Ohio statute prohibits unauthorized third-party disclosure that a person has \"AIDS\" or an \"AIDS-related condition,\" but does not prohibit disclosure that a person is HIV positive or, as Plaintiffs allege, a person's \"HIV status.\" Instead, in the specific context of \"HIV,\" the Ohio statute prohibits only the unauthorized third-party disclosure of \"[t]he identity of any individual on whom an HIV test is performed\" or \"[t]he results of an HIV test in a form that identifies the individual tested.\" The portion of alphanumeric code \"PM 6402 HIV\" does neither.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Fiserve MTD, Case A,\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 44, p. 13.) Similarly, in Case B, Defendant Caremark parses the AIDS/HIV line too thin in this assertion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   \"Plaintiff does not allege that the mailing disclosed the identity of anyone diagnosed with AIDS.

There are no allegations in the Complaint at all regarding any \"symptoms.\" Indeed, the provision of the statute that Plaintiff alleges Caremark violated is also inapplicable because the alphanumeric code does not actually reveal the \"identity\" of anyone. In short, Plaintiff has not alleged the disclosure of any information protected by R.C. \u00a7 3701.24(A)(3).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Caremark MTD, Case B,\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 18, p. 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that Defendants' argument that \"Plaintiff has not alleged the disclosure of any information protected by R.C. \u00a7 3701.24(A)(3)\" ignores other subsections in Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 3701.24(A). Section 3701.24 is titled \"Report as to contagious or infectious diseases AIDS and HIV,\" and it provides the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   (A) As used in this section and sections 3701.241 to 3701.249 of the Revised Code :\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   (1) \"AIDS\" means the illness designated as acquired immunodeficiency Syndrome.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   (2) \"HIV\" means the human immunodeficiency virus identified as the causative agent of AIDS.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   (3) \"AIDS-related condition\" means symptoms of illness related to HIV infection, including AIDS-related complex, that are confirmed by a positive HIV test.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   (4) \"HIV test\" means any test for the antibody or antigen to HIV that has been approved by the director of health under division (B) of section 3701.241 of the Revised Code.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that revealing an individual's HIV infection discloses an AIDS-related condition. (\n   <em>\n    Pl. Mem. Op, Case B,\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 30, p. 19.) In any event, Plaintiffs have alleged that they were participants in OHDAP based on their need for HIV-related medications, and \"[accordingly, Caremark unlawfully disclosed Plaintiff's AIDS-related condition, namely his HIV infection, in violation of the statute.\" (\n   <em>\n    Pl. Mem.

However, Plaintiffs allege that \"[t]he disclosed information was obtained while running a state-run program, and providing a health care service, namely Caremark's provision of pharmacy benefits management and pharmacy services to OhDAP and obtaining a contract for the sale of such services from ODH.\" (\n   <em>\n    Compl., Case A,\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 38, \u00b6 53.)

He was an OHDAP member, and the letter merely announced how he could receive certain OHDAP benefits.\" (\n   <em>\n    Caremark MTD, Case B,\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 18, p. 22.) In addition, Defendants assert that there is no allegation that Caremark is a consumer reporting agency, or that the communication was a consumer report. A consumer report is a communication \"bearing on a consumer's credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681a(d)(l). Defendants' arguments are well-taken, and Count 1 (willful violation of\n   FCRA) and Count 2 (negligent violation of FCRA) fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    B.
