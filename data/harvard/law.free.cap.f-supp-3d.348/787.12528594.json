In addition to those federal claims, Sullivan-Knoff further alleges that the Ordinance violates Section 2 and Section 18 of Article I of the Illinois Constitution and the Illinois Human Rights Act (\"IHRA\"), 775 ILCS 5\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   Before the Court is Defendants' motion to dismiss Sullivan-Knoff's Complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim.

(Compl. \u00b6 10, Dkt. No. 1.) In pursuing a career as an artist, Sullivan-Knoff has performed at various venues across the Chicago area, some of which hold liquor licenses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.) Sullivan-Knoff's performances often involve exposing her body in a public place. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.) She does so \"to reclaim her body in the face of legislation and discrimination directed against transgender bodies, to make herself vulnerable, and to create an impactful experience for the audience.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In one of Sullivan-Knoff's performance pieces, she appears onstage with her body wrapped in a sheet and her head covered by a brown paper bag with \"Touch Me\" written on all four sides. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.) Members of the audience are invited to touch Sullivan-Knoff's body, and after a set period, Sullivan-Knoff removes the brown paper bag. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Sullivan-Knoff has been prevented from performing this piece because of the Ordinance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) In 2015, Sullivan-Knoff wished to perform this act at a festival held at an establishment that holds a liquor license in Chicago, but she did not do so because of the Ordinance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.) In April 2016, Sullivan-Knoff performed the act at an establishment that holds a liquor license issued by the City, but she feared legal repercussions against herself and the establishment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.) Sullivan-Knoff anticipates performing again in the future at the same festival and establishment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.) She remains concerned about the possibility of legal repercussions against her and the establishment due to the Ordinance.

Sullivan-Knoff contends that this differential treatment of females and males violates the Equal Protection Clause. Defendants, on the other hand, proffer that the Ordinance is designed to combat the harmful secondary effects that arise from the combination of sexual nudity and alcohol. (Defs.' Memo. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss at 6, 10, Dkt. No. 20.) The differential treatment about which Sullivan-Knoff complains is premised on the notion that female breasts are sexual in nature in a way that male breasts are not. Defendants cite cases that appeal to societal convention in substantiating this proposition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4) (citing\n   <em>\n    Buzzetti v.

Defendants' justification for the Ordinance relies upon the assumption that females have a heightened capacity to arouse sexual desire when exposing their breasts as compared to males-and based on this, the Ordinance limits females in a way that it does not limit males. But Defendants' claim about female and male breasts might in fact be an overbroad generalization about the sexual capacity of males and females. Of course, the Court does not deny that there are differences between female and male breasts-principally, female breasts can nourish children while male breasts cannot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Johns Hopkins Medicine,\n   <em>\n    Anatomy &amp; Physiology of the Breast\n   </em>\n   , https://pathology.jhu.edu/breast/basics/overview.

Accordingly, Defendants' motion to dismiss must be denied. Instead,\n   both sides will have the opportunity in discovery to explore whether, how, and to what extent the exposure of female breasts-as opposed to male breasts-creates a sexual environment, and whether, how, and to what extent this legitimates the differential treatment of females and males under the Ordinance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    N.

But this is inapposite-Sullivan-Knoff is not presenting a mere hypothetical to the Court; rather, she is presenting the very scenario she finds herself in as a transgender woman who does not how the Ordinance applies to her. Consequently, the Court denies Defendants' motion to dismiss Sullivan-Knoff's Due Process Clause claim based on vagueness. Again, in reaching this determination, the Court has not decided the ultimate issue but rather will allow the parties an opportunity to explore through discovery whether the Ordinance is vague.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Sullivan-Knoff also raises a substantive due process claim, alleging that the Ordinance \"restricts her fundamental right to bodily integrity.\" (Pl.'s Resp. at 17.) Specifically, Sullivan-Knoff argues that the Ordinance prevents her from performing a piece about her own gender identity and thereby shocks the conscience.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Court determines that Sullivan-Knoff has not stated a claim based on a theory of substantive due process. \"[T]he Supreme Court has recognized a liberty interest in bodily integrity in only very limited circumstances involving such things as abortions, end-of-life decisions,\n   birth control decisions, and instances where individuals are subject to dangerous or invasive procedures where their personal liberty is being restrained.\"\n   <em>\n    Moore v.

Sullivan-Knoff has not cited any authority for the proposition that limitations on public nudity-like that imposed by the Ordinance-implicate substantive due process rights. The Court cannot, consistent with the Supreme Court's narrow delineation of substantive due process, find by analogy that the Ordinance violates Sullivan-Knoff's right to bodily integrity. The Ordinance does not involve an intrusion into Sullivan-Knoff's private decisions about her body, nor does it involve a direct or indirect invasion into Sullivan-Knoff's body; it simply limits the places of public accommodation where Sullivan-Knoff may appear nude. Thus, insofar as Sullivan-Knoff's Due Process Clause claim is predicated on a restriction of her right to bodily integrity, it is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Counts IV and V - Claims under the Illinois Constitution\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Sullivan-Knoff concedes that she is only seeking declaratory relief for her claims under the Illinois Constitution. (Pl.'s Resp. at 19) Defendants' arguments for dismissal of Sullivan-Knoff's claims for violations of the equal protection and due process protections of the Illinois Constitution echo their arguments against Sullivan-Knoff's claims under the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the United States Constitution. As the Court has rejected those arguments with respect to the federal constitutional protections, the Court rejects them as to the state constitutional protections as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Count VI - Claims under the IHRA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Finally, Sullivan-Knoff concedes that she has not administratively exhausted her IHRA claim and so the Court dismisses Count VI. (Pl.'s Resp. at 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Defendants' motion to dismiss is granted in part and denied in part. Specifically, the Court denies the motion with respect to Sullivan-Knoff's claims arising under the Equal Protection Clause (Count I) and the First Amendment (Count II). The Court also denies the motion with respect to Sullivan-Knoff's Due Process Clause claim that the Ordinance is void for vagueness (Count III) but grants the motion with respect to her Due Process Clause claim that the Ordinance violates her right to bodily integrity (Count III). With respect to Sullivan-Knoff's claims under the Illinois constitution (Counts IV and V), the Court grants the motion insofar as Sullivan-Knoff seeks anything but declaratory relief but otherwise denies the motion. Finally, as Sullivan-Knoff has voluntarily withdrawn her claim under the IHRA (Count VI), the motion is denied as moot with respect to that claim.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    The following facts are drawn from Sullivan-Knoff's Complaint and accepted as true for purposes of Defendants' motion to dismiss.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Apex Digital, Inc. v.

Neither party addresses Sullivan-Knoff's standing to pursue her claims given that she is not directly regulated by the Ordinance.
