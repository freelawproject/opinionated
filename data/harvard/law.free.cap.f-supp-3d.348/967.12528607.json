CHEN, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiffs bring this putative class action alleging that they have been discriminatorily denied benefits under their employer-offered prescription drug benefit plans. The complaint names two sets of defendants: CVS Pharmacy, Inc., Caremark, LLC., and Caremark California Specialty Pharmacy, LLC (collectively \"CVS\"), and Amtrak, Lowe's Companies, and Time Warner, Inc. (collectively \"Employer Defendants\"). CVS contracted with Employer Defendants to provide prescription drug benefits to Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs allege that their benefit plans allow them to obtain their HIV/AIDS medications at favorable \"in-network\" prices only via mail or from a CVS pharmacy. Compared to the non-CVS \"community pharmacies\" from which Plaintiffs were previously able to obtain their medications, the mail order and CVS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Pharmacy pickup options do not offer the same level of privacy, convenience, reliability, and service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs bring eight causes of action: (1) violation of the anti-discrimination provision of the Affordable Care Act (\"ACA\"); (2) violation of Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"); (3) violation of the California Unruh Civil Rights Act; (4) violation of the California Unfair Competition Law (\"UCL\"); (5) claim for benefits due under plans governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\"); (6) claim for breach of fiduciary duties under ERISA; (7) failure to provide full and fair review under ERISA; and (8) declaratory relief. Counts 1-4 are against CVS only. Counts 5-8 are against all Defendants. CVS and each of the Employer Defendants have moved to dismiss the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the reasons discussed below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   CVS and Employer Defendants' motions to dismiss. Plaintiffs' ACA and ADA claims fail because the benefit plan restrictions they challenge do not discriminate on the basis of HIV/AIDS status or disability generally; the restrictions apply to medications that treat disabilities as well as those that do not. Plaintiffs' Unruh Act claim fails because they cannot show intentional discrimination on the part of CVS. They have not stated a claim under the UCL because the benefit restrictions are neither \"unlawful\" nor \"unfair.\" Plaintiffs' ERISA claims against CVS fail because their benefit plans do not entitle them to the benefit they seek, and because CVS is not an ERISA fiduciary with respect to the benefit plans. Plaintiffs' ERISA claims against Employer Defendants fail for similar reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The First Amended Complaint alleges the following. Plaintiffs\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   are individuals living with HIV/AIDS who are enrolled in employer-sponsored health plans. Docket No. 75 (\"FAC\") \u00b6 1. CVS Defendants \"act as agents of one another and operate as a single entity for purposes of administering pharmacy benefits and providing prescription drugs to health plans and health plan members.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. One of the CVS Defendants, CVS Caremark, administers the prescription drug benefits under Plaintiffs' plans.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1. In order to qualify for lower \"in-network\" drug prices under their plans, Plaintiffs are required by CVS Caremark to obtain their HIV/AIDS medications from Caremark California Specialty Pharmacy, which delivers medications in one of two ways: by mailing the medications to Plaintiffs directly, or by mailing them to a CVS Pharmacy for pickup.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Otherwise, Plaintiffs \"must either pay more out-of-pocket or pay full-price\" to procure their HIV/AIDS medication from an \"out-of-network\" community pharmacy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs refer to this CVS-mandated scheme for obtaining medications as \"the Program.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   All drugs designated in the benefit plans as \"specialty medications\" are subject to the Program's restrictions, not just drugs that treat HIV/AIDS. However, Plaintiffs allege that HIV/AIDS patients are \"disproportionately impacted by the Program\" due to the \"complex nature of their disease and medications.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 92, 94. CVS Caremark offers \"financial inducements\" to health plan sponsors-Plaintiffs' employers-to enroll Plaintiffs in benefit plans subject to the Program.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Before their employers enrolled Plaintiffs in the Program, each of the Named Plaintiffs was able to purchase their HIV/AIDS medications through their benefit plan from any in-network pharmacy, including non-CVS pharmacies, with full insurance benefits.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9-13. Many of them had long obtained their medications from their local \"community pharmacies\" and had developed relationships with their pharmacists.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   These in-person appointments with expert pharmacists who were familiar with Plaintiffs and their medical histories serve a critical function because the pharmacists can \"detect potentially life-threatening adverse drug interactions and dangerous side effects, some of which may only be detected visually\"; immediately prescribe new drug regimens as Plaintiffs' conditions progress and evolve; and provide essential counseling to help Plaintiffs and their families navigate the challenges of living with a chronic condition.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 70, 80-84, 89.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Since being enrolled in the Program, however, Plaintiffs have faced numerous difficulties and indignities in their efforts to obtain their HIV/AIDS medications. Those who opted to have the medication mailed to their homes have experienced delivery problems.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37, 46, 51. For example, in some instances the packages containing their medications were left \"baking in the afternoon sun,\" which could \"quickly degrade the potency and stability\" of the medication.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. Out of concerns about parcel theft, some Plaintiffs have had to wait at home on the days their medications are scheduled for delivery, resulting in missed doctor appointments and missed days of work.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 46, 51. Those who have opted to pick up their prescriptions from CVS Pharmacies have also encountered problems. For some, the closest CVS Pharmacy is many miles away.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34. Some have had to make multiple trips to and from a pharmacy to deal with incorrectly filled prescriptions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Others have experienced \"CVS personnel shout[ing] the name of their HIV/AIDS Medications across the room in front of other customers, raising severe privacy concerns.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76. Many Plaintiffs have reached out to CVS in an attempt to resolve their problems, only to encounter bureaucracy and long wait-times.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29, 35, 40, 91. Reportedly, CVS representatives also \"appear to have no specialized knowledge about HIV/AIDS Medications or the concerns of HIV patients.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39, 48, 85.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In short, Plaintiffs allege, the Program forces them into a \"potentially life-threatening\" decision: to either \"forego essential counseling from an expert pharmacist at a community pharmacy and face risks to their privacy that are inherent in the Program,\" or \"pay hundreds or thousands of dollars out-of-pocket monthly for their medications at their non-CVS community pharmacy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69. Thus, the Program \"constitutes a material and discriminatory change in [Plaintiffs'] coverage, a significant reduction in or elimination of prescription drug benefits, and a violation of the standards of good health care and clinically appropriate care for HIV/AIDS patients.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 78.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Many Plaintiffs have attempted to opt-out of the Program, but their requests were denied.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Some have made formal, written opt-out requests, appealed the denial of those requests, and ultimately received \"final determinations\" affirming the denials.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs seek to represent the following class:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   All persons currently or previously enrolled in or covered by a health plan since January 1, 2015 in which the prescription drug benefit is or was administered by CVS Caremark, and who: (i) obtained or may obtain HIV/AIDS Medications; and (ii) have been or may in the\n   future be required to participate in the Program with no right to opt-out or notice thereof, but not including individual claims for personal injury or bodily harm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 131.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiffs filed their original class action complaint on February 16, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 1.

The majority of their allegations are made against the collective \"CVS Caremark,\" without specifying what role each CVS Defendant played. Their claim that the CVS Defendants \"act as agents of one another and operate as a single entity\" is conclusory and unsupported by factual allegations.

But this is just an attempt to challenge the design of the plan in another guise. Plaintiffs' own language in the complaint demonstrates this allegation concerns the form of the plan and its structuring of benefits: \"CVS Caremark provid[ed] financial incentives to self-funded plans and other plan sponsors\n   <em>\n    to select the Program over a prescription drug benefit plan that allows enrollees to use the pharmacy of their choice.\n   </em>\n   \" FAC \u00b6 79 (emphasis added). \"ERISA's fiduciary duty requirement simply is not implicated where [an employer] ... makes a decision regarding the form or structure of the Plan such as who is entitled to receive Plan benefits and in what amounts.\"\n   <em>\n    Hughes Aircraft Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076610\" index=\"235\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/525/432/#p445\">\n    525 U.S. at 444\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076610\" index=\"236\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/525/432/#p445\">\n    119 S.Ct. 755\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   The distinction between plan design, which does not implicate a fiduciary duty, and plan administration, which does, is illustrated by the two cases Plaintiffs cite. In\n   <em>\n    Caplan v. CNA Short Term Disability Plan\n   </em>\n   , an employer created a conflict of interest by outsourcing the review of benefits claims to a third-party that allegedly had a financial incentive to deny claims.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5879676\" index=\"237\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/479/1108/#p1109\">\n    479 F.Supp.2d 1108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1109 (N.D. Cal. 2007). Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Finkelstein v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. Am.\n   </em>\n   , the breach of fiduciary duty arose from the issuer of a benefit plan \"systematically den[ying] legitimate claims in an attempt to boost profits.\" No. C 07-01130 CRB,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"238\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%204287329\">\n    2007 WL 4287329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 5, 2007). Reviewing benefits claims is a prototypical aspect of plan administration. In contrast, deciding to adopt a particular prescription drug benefit plan is an aspect of plan design, and \"ERISA does not prohibit an employer from acting in accordance with its interests as employer when not administering the plan.\"\n   <em>\n    Kalda v. Sioux Valley Physician Partners, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3870224\" index=\"239\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/481/639/#p646\">\n    481 F.3d 639\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 646 (8th Cir. 2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Second, Plaintiffs argue that Employer Defendants \"are liable under ERISA for their failure to monitor CVS in adopting this discriminatory Program.\" Docket No. 121 at 12. \"Failure to monitor\" was not expressly alleged as a claim in the complaint, but Plaintiffs now argue that the claim is grounded in the allegation in FAC \u00b6 103: \"Amtrak, Lowe's, and Time Warner have each knowingly participated in CVS's breach of its fiduciary duties through its agreement with CVS subjecting members of its health plan to the Program,\" and \"having expressly agreed to subject its members to the Program, each knew of CVS's breach of its fiduciary duties and failed to make reasonable efforts to remedy the breach.\" To the contrary, it is clear that FAC \u00b6 103 pertains to Plaintiffs' ERISA co-fiduciary claim, not a failure to monitor claim. The language of the allegation echoes the language of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"240\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201105\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), which imposes co-fiduciary liability\n   where a fiduciary \"participates knowingly in ... an act or omission of such other fiduciary, knowing such act or omission is a breach,\" and where \"he has knowledge of a breach by such other fiduciary, unless he makes reasonable efforts under the circumstances to remedy the breach.\" Paragraph 103 is also sandwiched between FAC \u00b6 102, which alleges that \"[t]he employers ... act as co-fiduciaries with CVS,\" and \u00b6 104, which alleges that \"CVS is also a co-fiduciary with each of Amtrak, Lowe's, and Time Warner in that CVS ... had knowledge of the breach by each of those employers and failed to make reasonable efforts to remedy the breach.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Even if the allegation is construed as a \"failure to monitor\" claim, it is again a challenge to the plan design packaged in another guise. Plaintiffs make clear that the \"breach\" at issue is CVS and Employer Defendants' \"agreement\" to provide a benefit plan that has terms Plaintiffs feel are unfavorable. The challenge is to the Employer Defendants' \"decision regarding the form or structure of the Plan\" offered to employees.\n   <em>\n    Hughes Aircraft Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076610\" index=\"241\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/525/432/#p445\">\n    525 U.S. at 444\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076610\" index=\"242\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/525/432/#p445\">\n    119 S.Ct. 755\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
