Products that undergo a substantial transformation in a foreign country may be considered to be from that country, effectively removing them from the ambit of AD or CVD orders applying to the original country.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In both its Preliminary and Final Scope Rulings, Commerce determined that the processing of seamless unfinished OCTG from the PRC into finished OCTG in Indonesia does not constitute substantial transformation. Preliminary Scope Ruling at 31; Final Scope Ruling at 24. In reaching its conclusion, Commerce appears to rely upon its findings with respect to all five factors of its test comprising its totality of the circumstances analysis.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Preliminary Scope Ruling at 31 (relying on each factor \"to the extent practicable\" and \"the totality of the circumstances\" to reach\n   its conclusion that the downstream processing of seamless unfinished OCTG from the PRC into finished OCTG does not constitute substantial transformation). Commerce fails to explain how three of the factors upon which it relies support its determination. Therefore, the court remands the matter for further explanation or reconsideration consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Commerce first considered whether the product falls within the same class or kind of merchandise before and after processing. Preliminary Scope Ruling at 16. Commerce found that green tube and finished OCTG fell within the same class or kind of merchandise, noting that \"the clear language of the scope indicates finished and unfinished OCTG are of the same class or kind.\" Preliminary Scope Ruling at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Commerce does not explain how its finding that the two products are of the same class or kind of merchandise supports its ultimate conclusion that there has not been a substantial transformation. Commerce states that it has \"continued to accord the class or kind of merchandise criterion with the consideration required under the Department's standard analysis.\" Final Scope Ruling at 16. Commerce incorporates this factor into its analysis and appears to rely on it as part of its totality of the circumstances analysis, yet nowhere does it explain how this factor supports its determination, and its rationale is not reasonably discernable. Finished and unfinished OCTG are part of the same class only because the petitioners requested that Commerce investigate the two together.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Petition for Scope Inquiry 2, AD PD 1, bar code 3065185-01 (Mar. 26, 2012);\n   <em>\n    Certain [OCTG] from the\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People's Republic of China\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=74%20Fed.%20Reg.%2020%2C671\">\n    74 Fed.

Commerce does not explain, and it is not reasonably discernible, how this factor bears any relationship to whether the downstream processing was sufficient to cause a substantial transformation. Although Commerce seems to minimize the importance of this factor, stating that no one factor is dispositive,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Final Scope Ruling at 16, the weight to be accorded to this factor does not substitute for explaining its usefulness.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Commerce must provide a reasonable explanation regarding how this factor contributes to its conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Commerce next considered the nature/sophistication of processing in the country of exportation, determining that the finishing process performed in Indonesia did not warrant a finding of substantial transformation. Preliminary Scope Ruling at 19; Final Scope Ruling at 17. In its Preliminary Scope Ruling, Commerce explained that it does not base its analysis on whether the upstream production is more\n   or less sophisticated than the downstream processing, but that it does not exclude the upstream production from its analysis. Preliminary Scope Ruling at 19. The analysis instead focuses on the extent and complexity of the downstream processing, and the changes to the product imparted by the processing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=74%20Fed.%20Reg.%2020%2C671\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Commerce described the processing conducted in Indonesia, noting that it entails \"quenching and tempering, upsetting on certain merchandise, threading (for external or integral joint), and coupling (for some merchandise).\" Preliminary Scope Ruling at 19. Commerce noted that, although the processing is \"not insignificant,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=74%20Fed.%20Reg.%2020%2C671\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=74%20Fed.%20Reg.%2020%2C671\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   the heat treatment process is completed with relative ease and with the help of standardized equipment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=74%20Fed.%20Reg.%2020%2C671\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=74%20Fed.%20Reg.%2020%2C671\">\n    at 19-20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, Commerce noted that the threading process is standardized, and is commonly utilized by companies on tubing prior to its sale. Accordingly, Commerce concluded that this process was not more sophisticated than techniques commonly used in the steel industry, and thus did not warrant a finding of substantial transformation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=74%20Fed.%20Reg.%2020%2C671\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=74%20Fed.%20Reg.%2020%2C671\">\n    at 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In its Final Scope Ruling, Commerce departed from the analytical approach described above. Commerce emphasized the importance of the unfinished OCTG product relative to the contribution of the finishing process, and explained that it would not be possible to produce a finished, heat-treated OCTG product without first creating the upstream, unfinished OCTG product. Final Scope Ruling at 17. Commerce thus concluded that, compared to the complex production process used to create unfinished OCTG in the PRC, the heat treatment process conducted in Indonesia was not more sophisticated.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=74%20Fed.%20Reg.%2020%2C671\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Consideration of the nature of the production process did not, according to Commerce, warrant a finding of substantial transformation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   This approach is not reasonable. Commerce abandoned its previous analytical approach-an examination of the extent and complexity of the downstream processing and any changes imparted to the product by that processing-in favor of a strict comparative methodology. Yet, as Commerce correctly noted in its Preliminary Scope Ruling, \"if every downstream steel production process were compared to the making of hot-rolled steel, the Department might potentially find it difficult to separate classes or kinds of steel products beyond the hot-rolled steel stage.\" Preliminary Scope Ruling at 19. Indeed, this type of strict comparative analysis could preclude a finding of substantial transformation for any downstream processing. Such an approach strays from the focus of the inquiry, i.e., whether substantial transformation occurs as a result of the downstream processing. Plaintiff correctly notes that Commerce's comparative approach necessarily implies that the only situation where third-country processing could result in substantial transformation is when the processing is more sophisticated than any other step in producing the entire product. Reply Br. Pl. [Bell Supply] Supp. Mot. J. Agency R. at 19, Feb. 11, 2015, ECF 68 (\"Pl. Reply Br.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Final Scope Ruling at 17 (determining that the \"heat treatment conducted in Indonesia is not more sophisticated than ... producing the unfinished OCTG in the PRC.\"). A scenario could conceivably arise in which a downstream production process, though less sophisticated than the upstream production process, is still sophisticated for purposes of the substantial transformation test. Without further explanation, Commerce's determination regarding the nature/sophistication of the processing fails to support its conclusion that substantial\n   transformation did not occur.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Commerce next considered the product properties, the essential component of the merchandise, and the intended end-use, concluding that this factor did not support a finding of substantial transformation. Commerce stated in its Preliminary Scope Ruling that although the finishing process in Indonesia conferred different mechanical properties on the finished OCTC compared to the green tubes, the major physical and chemical properties of both finished and unfinished OCTG are imparted during the steel forming process. Preliminary Scope Ruling at 22. Additionally, despite the fact that the downstream processing conducted in Indonesia altered the OCTG's mechanical properties, Commerce concluded that the essential component of the merchandise-both finished and unfinished OCTG-is the green tube produced in the PRC.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=74%20Fed.%20Reg.%2020%2C671\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=74%20Fed.%20Reg.%2020%2C671\">\n    at 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Commerce explained this determination by noting that although heat-treated (and threaded and coupled) OCTG is not necessarily interchangeable with the unfinished OCTG in question, unfinished OCTG may still be used as a vehicle for oil and gas extraction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=74%20Fed.%20Reg.%2020%2C671\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=74%20Fed.%20Reg.%2020%2C671\">\n    at 22-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Commerce cited several examples of pipe grades under the American Petroleum Institute (\"API\")-5CT specification that do not require heat treatment to qualify for such specifications.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=74%20Fed.%20Reg.%2020%2C671\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=74%20Fed.%20Reg.%2020%2C671\">\n    at 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Commerce emphasized that although heat treatment conferred new mechanical properties, these mechanical alterations did not change the essential component of the merchandise, since the record indicates that unfinished OCTG can be used for oil and gas extraction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=74%20Fed.%20Reg.%2020%2C671\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=74%20Fed.%20Reg.%2020%2C671\">\n    at 22-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the physical and chemical properties of the OCTG did not change significantly as a result of the third-country processing, and because the heat treatment was not required in order for the product to be used for oil and gas extraction, Commerce concluded that the physical and chemical characteristics of green tube, rather than the subsequent heat treating in Indonesia, determined the green tube's ultimate use as OCTG.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=74%20Fed.%20Reg.%2020%2C671\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=74%20Fed.%20Reg.%2020%2C671\">\n    at 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In its Final Scope Ruling, Commerce affirmed its preliminary determination, noting that all of a product's characteristics-physical, chemical, and mechanical-are equally important and are evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Final Scope Ruling at 19. Commerce explained that while the finishing process in Indonesia altered the mechanical and microstructure of the green tubes, the physical and chemical properties of the heat-treated OCTG product are equally important with regard to\n   the product's structure, its size, and its end-use, and these properties are established during the production of the unfinished OCTG in the PRC.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=74%20Fed.%20Reg.%2020%2C671\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Commerce therefore declined to use the mechanical properties of OCTG as the \"dividing line,\" as doing so would diminish the importance of the production process necessary to create the unfinished OCTG in the PRC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=74%20Fed.%20Reg.%2020%2C671\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Commerce's analysis regarding this factor is reasonable. Plaintiff concedes that the chemical properties of finished OCTG are established by the chemistry of the green tube.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Resp. to Scope Inquiry at 12, AD PD 33, bar code 3086198-01 (July 13, 2012). Moreover, the record supports Commerce's determination that there are \"few physical and chemical differences\" between green tubes and heat-treated OCTG.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Preliminary Scope Ruling at 23. The fact that the third-country processing is not necessary for the product to be used for oil and gas extraction reasonably cuts in favor of a finding that the product's essential component is the green tubes from the PRC, and therefore the processing did not constitute substantial transformation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Preliminary Scope Ruling at 22-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiff argues that it is the mechanical properties that enable the products to be sold as P-110, T-95, and Q-125 OCTG, thus enabling the OCTG to be used for its intended end-use. Mot. Pl. [Bell Supply] Supp. Mot. J. Agency R. 39 n.11, Sept. 19, 2014, ECF No. 36-1 (\"Pl. Br.\"). As previously described, however, this alteration does not impact the physical and chemical properties of the product, all of which Commerce properly considered. Indeed, the record indicates that Bell Supply and Citra Tubindo, the company responsible for processing in Indonesia, are responsible for selecting the appropriate physical and chemical requirements of the green tubes, and the processing does not change these properties. Preliminary Scope Ruling at 23. Also, the intended end-use-oil and gas extraction-remains the same, even where the API certification changes. Preliminary Scope Ruling at 23 (\"worth noting is that the application (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , oil and gas extraction) remains identical across all grades of OCTG\"). Thus, although the mechanical alterations may mean the products are more desirable for use in certain environments, Commerce did not act unreasonably by concluding that the essential component and intended end-use remain unchanged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiff also argues that Commerce's conclusion regarding the properties, essential\n   component, and intended end-use factor conflicts with previous determinations. Specifically, Plaintiff invokes two prior determinations for the proposition that Commerce found the mechanical properties of steel to be a critical part of the finished merchandise and that processing that imparts such properties constitutes substantial transformation. Pl. Br. at 39 (citing Pl.'s Comments on Preliminary Scope Ruling at 30, AD CD 50 (June 24, 2013) (\"\n   <em>\n    Pure Magnesium from China\n   </em>\n   \"); Final Results of Redetermination Pursuant to Court Remand in\n   <em>\n    Peer Bearing Co.-Changshan v.

In\n   <em>\n    Pure Magnesium from China\n   </em>\n   , the third-country processing transformed the input product-pure magnesium-into an alloy of magnesium in a new shape and with different chemical and mechanical properties. Pl.'s Resp. to Scope Inquiry at Ex. 2 and 3, AD PD 35 (Sept. 6, 2006). This change in physical and chemical properties is lacking here. Moreover,\n   <em>\n    Peer Bearing\n   </em>\n   involved parts and components that, prior to assembly, could not perform their respective functions as tapered roller bearings parts because they had not been ground and polished into their final dimensions, see\n   <em>\n    Peer Bearing Co.-Changshan v.

Preliminary Scope Ruling at 23. Examination of mechanical properties is just one part of the analysis, and Commerce's analysis did not rest solely on the assertion that unfinished OCTG is the product's essential element. As described above, Commerce considered the importance of the mechanical alterations imparted by the third-country processing, and ultimately found that the physical and chemical properties of the finished OCTG were just as important to the product's structure, size, and end-use, and that these properties were established prior to the downstream processing. Commerce correctly notes that it evaluates the physical, chemical, and mechanical properties on a case-by-case basis, and no individual category of characteristic is more determinative than another. Final Scope Ruling at 19. Accordingly, Commerce's determination that the product characteristics, essential component, and intended end-use do not warrant a finding of substantial transformation is supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Commerce next considered the cost of production/value added, determining in its Preliminary Scope Ruling that the value added by the third-country processing \"ranged from under [ [ ] ] percent for certain products to approximately [ [ ] ] percent for other products.\" Preliminary Scope Ruling at 25. Additionally, Commerce determined that for the heat treatment process, the value added is less than [ [ ] ] percent of the total value of all OCTG products.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25. Commerce noted that no established threshold exists for determining whether a certain value-added figure constitutes substantial transformation, and the required amount can vary across industries. Preliminary Scope Ruling at 25. Moreover, Commerce emphasized that the cost of production/value added should be considered within the context of the broader case, and that the Department is not required to place equal weight on each factor when making a substantial transformation determination. Id. at 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   For its Final Scope Ruling, Commerce revised the value-added analysis for certain\n   products based on supporting calculations provided by Plaintiff. This modification enabled Commerce to convert Plaintiff's aggregated U.S. sales prices for certain sizes to per-unit sales prices, as required by Commerce's value-added formula.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final Scope Ruling at 20. Commerce noted that, as a result of these changes, the value added for certain products increased,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 20, but nevertheless concluded that, as a whole, the value added by the third-country processing is not significant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22. Commerce noted that although the value added for one of the products in question increased to a point that may, under certain circumstances, be considered significant, this particular product was not representative \"on a quantitative basis\" of the entire population of products in question.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22. Commerce based this determination on the low sales quantity of this product relative to that of all OCTG for which a U.S. sales price was provided, as well as to all OCTG covered by the scope ruling generally for which processing costs were reported.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Commerce's handling of the cost of production/value added factor is not supported by substantial evidence. It is reasonably discernible that Commerce, in arriving at this conclusion, relied at least in part on the weighted-average of value added for all products, which was [ [ ] ] after processing. Final Scope Analysis Memo at 2, AD CR 54, bar code 3181447-01 (Feb. 7, 2014); Final Scope Ruling at 22 (\"Based on the weighted-average value added percentage for all of the products covered by this scope ruling, we find that the value added ... is not significant.\"). It is also reasonably discernible that Commerce, to some extent, considers the percentage of value added a proxy for the degree of transformation. Such an approach is reasonable; where a product's value sees a marked increase as a result of downstream processing, such processing could reasonably be perceived as probative of transformation. What is not reasonably discernible, however, is why Commerce found the percentage of value added in this case insignificant. Commerce provides little to no explanation on this point, and it is not clear at what percentage Commerce would consider value added significant under the circumstances. Also unclear is the extent to which the value-added factor was of greater or lesser importance in this case relative to other cases. Commerce reasonably notes that it does not have an established threshold for determining whether a certain value-added figure constitutes substantial transformation on its own, and that the amount of value added required to substantially transform a product will vary significantly across industries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Preliminary Scope Ruling at 25. Commerce is not obliged to establish a threshold, but without an established threshold or additional explanation relating to the facts of this case, Commerce's determination that the percentage of value added in this case is not significant lacks any rationale.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final Scope Ruling at 22. For instance, Commerce would do well to explain why a level of [ [ ] ] overall value added is not significant within the context of the OCTG industry.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, Commerce could explain the extent to which it relies less on this\n   factor than on other factors for reasons specific to this case. In its Preliminary Scope Ruling, Commerce states that the value-added factor is of less importance in this case than the physical, chemical, and mechanical characteristics of the OCTG, the product's intended end-use, and the class or kind of merchandise factor. Preliminary Scope Ruling at 25. However, Commerce does not reiterate this determination in its Final Scope Ruling, and given its seemingly diminished reliance on the class or kind of merchandise factor, the court cannot reasonably infer that Commerce carried this position over into its Final Scope Ruling. Although a totality of the circumstances analysis eschews bright line rules for balancing, Commerce must explain how each factor weighs in the balance and why. The failure to explain the reasonableness and weight of each factor results in an \"I know it when I see it test,\" which is no test at all. Commerce's determination that the level of value added by the third-country processing was not significant is therefore unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   With respect to the final factor-level of investment-Commerce found in its Preliminary Scope Ruling that the investment in the third-country processing was small in comparison to the investment required to build \"a complete pipe mill.\" Preliminary Scope Ruling at 27. Commerce explained that previously adopted methods were inapplicable in this case because of the unique factual circumstances, paving the way for a \"tailored\" analysis based on the information in the record.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23 and 29. Accordingly, Commerce deemed the investment required for the processing performed in Indonesia \"small in comparison\" to that necessary for a complete pipe mill.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In its Final Scope Ruling, Commerce affirmed its position and explained that this analytical method is appropriate for a substantial transformation test, since the \"primary purpose\" of the test is to determine whether the third-country processing is significant relative to the production of finished or unfinished OCTG. Final Scope Ruling at 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Commerce's determination on the level of investment factor is supported by substantial evidence. Commerce's analysis determined that the investment required to conduct processing in Indonesia was insignificant in comparison to the investment required for a complete pipe mill. Final Scope Analysis Memo at 2, CD 54, bar code 3181447-01 (Feb. 7, 2014). Record evidence supports this conclusion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Plaintiff challenges Commerce's method of comparing the investment required for the finishing operations with that required to build a complete pipe mill.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Br. at 42-43. Here, as Commerce noted, the ideal analytical approach would be to compare the level of investment for the processing of OCTG in Indonesia to the investment required for the processing company to completely produce OCTG in Indonesia.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Preliminary Scope Ruling at 28. Because the processing company in this case does not engage in complete production of OCTG, the record does not allow such an analysis. Consequently, Commerce performed a tailored analysis based on information available on the record, comparing the investment in the processing in Indonesia with the investment made by Tenaris in its Bay\n   City, Texas seamless pipe production facility.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Final Scope Ruling at 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   It was reasonable for Commerce to compare the investment made in Indonesia to that required for complete pipe production. It is reasonably discernable that Commerce examines the capital investment required for downstream processing as a proxy for the degree of transformation. The greater the investment, the analysis goes, the greater the transformation of the product. This approach is reasonable, so as not to evaluate the level of investment in a vacuum. Different industries have different barriers to entry-a small capital investment in one industry might be significant in another. Therefore, in order to contextualize the investment in further processing, it is reasonable to compare the level of investment required at different processing stages within the same industry. A comparatively small investment in downstream processing indicates a lack of substantial transformation. Nowhere does Commerce state that in order to constitute a substantial transformation, the level of investment for the processing of unfinished OCTG must be equal to or greater than the cost of investing in a complete pipe mill. Commerce merely uses pipe mill investment as a comparative reference.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   The goal of the substantial transformation test is to determine whether the processing is \"of such significance as to require\" that the merchandise be deemed to be from that country.\n   <em>\n    Bell Supply IV\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516647\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/1222/\">\n    888 F.3d at 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    E.I.
