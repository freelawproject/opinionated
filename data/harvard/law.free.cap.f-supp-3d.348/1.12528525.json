Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Over twenty-five years ago, the Cook Inlet Tribal Council (\"CITC\") and the Indian Health Service (\"IHS\") entered into a self-determination contract pursuant to the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (\"ISDEAA\"). Under this contract, CITC has operated substance abuse programs serving Alaskan Native patients, while IHS provides federal funding to CITC, allowing CITC to administer federal programs and services that IHS would have otherwise provided. In 2014, CITC proposed a contract amendment for additional \"contract support costs\" funding to account for increased facility support costs, among other costs. IHS declined CITC's proposed amendment in part, stating that CITC receives payment for facility support costs as part of its annual \"Secretarial\" funding. CITC now appeals IHS' declination decision, bringing suit against Christopher Mandregan, Jr., Alaska Area Director of IHS; Alex Azar,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\"); and the United States of America. At issue is whether the ISDEAA clearly requires that CITC's facility support costs be funded exclusively from the Secretarial amount, or whether CITC's facility support costs may also be funded as contract support costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Pending before the Court are the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment. Having carefully reviewed the motions and the entire record herein, the Court concludes that CITC's interpretation of the ISDEAA's ambiguous funding provision is reasonable. Therefore, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS IN PART\n   </strong>\n   CITC's motion for summary judgment and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   the defendants' cross-motion for summary judgment. However, rather than \"immediately\" compel IHS to approve and fund CITC's proposed contract amendment, the Court\n   <strong>\n    VACATES\n   </strong>\n   IHS' declination decision and\n   <strong>\n    REMANDS\n   </strong>\n   the matter to IHS for a determination consistent with this Memorandum Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This case arises out of a dispute regarding the ISDEAA's funding provisions.

Reply, ECF No. 21 at 10, n.28 (discussing the Manual).

Thus, the necessary facility support cost funding has not been \"made available\" and may therefore be eligible as contract support costs funding.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343475\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/170/243/#p249\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Second, IHS repeatedly argues that CITC has already received facility support costs funding in its Secretarial amount, Defs.' MSJ, ECF No. 15 at 4, 5, 7; Defs.' Stmt., ECF No. 15-1 \u00b6 8, and that if IHS \"pa[id] these costs again as [contract support costs], [IHS] would violate [the ISDEAA provision] that prohibits the payment of [contract support costs] for costs already included in the contractor's program funding,\" A.R., ECF No. 11-1 at 3. The parties do not dispute that CITC was funded $11,838.50 in 1992 for facility support costs, and that the funding was included in the Secretarial amount. Pl.'s Stmt., ECF No. 13-2 \u00b6 4; Defs.'

Defs.' Reply, ECF No. 21 at 15. The Court disagrees. As discussed at length\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the Manual provides that facility support costs may be eligible for contract support costs funding\n   <em>\n    to the extent they are not provided in the Secretarial amount.\n   </em>\n   IHM \u00a7 6-3.2(D)(1)(e). Accordingly, IHS has not met its burden to establish that facility support costs beyond the $11,838.50 were provided in CITC's Secretarial amount. In fact, the only support that IHS cites in its \"Statement of Material Facts Not in Dispute\" is CITC's complaint and its own July 7, 2014 letter declining CITC's proposed contract amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.'

Essentially, IHS contends that the ISDEAA clearly mandates that activities may only be funded by one type of funding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Stmt., ECF No. 15-1 \u00b6 8; Defs.'

The ISDEAA authorizes the Court to \"order appropriate relief including money damages, injunctive relief ..., or mandamus to compel an officer or employee of the United States, or any agency thereof, to perform a duty ...

Moreover, because the administrative record does not contain any information regarding the facility support costs paid via the Secretarial amount, the Court cannot assure itself that CITC's request does not duplicate any funding already provided.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R., ECF Nos. 11-1, 17, 20;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205325\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 5325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Therefore, the Court will remand CITC's contract proposal to IHS for a decision consistent with this Memorandum Opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Florida Power &amp; Light Co. v.

As the record stands now, there is insufficient information for the Court to determine the amount CITC is owed for facility support costs. As this Opinion makes clear, however, CITC's contract amendment proposal was improperly declined. Therefore, on remand, IHS must review CITC's proposal in a manner consistent with this Memorandum Opinion and determine the amount of facility support costs that should be funded as contract support costs beginning with the 2014 contract to date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    V.
