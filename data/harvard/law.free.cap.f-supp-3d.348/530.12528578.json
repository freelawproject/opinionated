(\"Cempra\"), between July 7, 2015, and November 4, 2016 (the \"class period\"). In their amended complaint (Doc. 46), Plaintiffs seek recovery for stock losses under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), as amended by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (\"PSLRA\") and Rule 10-b5 promulgated thereunder,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .10b-5. The Defendants are Cempra; Prabhavathi B. Fernandes, Ph.D., Cempra's then-chief executive officer (\"CEO\"), president, and member of the board of directors from the company's founding in November 2005 until December 12, 2016 (Doc. 46 \u00b6 22); Mark W. Hahn, Cempra's executive vice president and chief financial officer (\"CFO\") during the class period (Doc. 46 \u00b6 25); and David W. Oldach, M.D., Cempra's chief medical officer, during the class period (together, \"Defendants\"). (Doc. 46 \u00b6 28.) Before the court is Defendants' motion to dismiss the amended complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). (Doc. 49.) Plaintiffs oppose the motion and also filed a motion to strike seven exhibits contained in the appendix to Defendants' motion (Doc. 56), which the court recently denied without opinion. (Doc. 65.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, Defendants' motion to dismiss will be granted. In addition, the court will address Plaintiffs' motion to strike and explain which exhibits the court considered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The facts alleged in the amended complaint, which are accepted as true and viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs for purposes of the present motion, and the contents of other documents which the court may consider in deciding the motion to dismiss, show the following:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Cempra is a biopharmaceutical company that develops antibiotics for the treatment of infectious diseases. (Doc. 46 \u00b6 4.) Cempra's lead product, solithromycin, is being developed for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (\"CABP\"), as well as other indications. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) During the class period, solithromycin was in the late stages of its clinical development for the treatment of CABP, the seventh leading cause of death and the leading cause of death due to infection in the United States, with a reported five to ten million cases per year. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5-6, 36.) In August 2015, the Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") granted the drug \"Fast Track\" designation for the short-term (five to seven day) treatment of CABP with intravenous (\"IV\") and oral capsules under the FDA's Fast Track program, which is designed to facilitate the development of new drugs that have the potential to address unmet medical needs and are designed to treat serious or life-threatening conditions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.) On May 1, 2016, Cempra completed and submitted its New Drug Applications (\"NDAs\") for solithromycin to the\n   FDA for the treatment of CABP, which qualified for eight-month priority review under the Prescription User Drug Fee Act. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Cempra generated little revenue during the class period and depended largely on raising capital through public stock offerings to sustain its business operations and complete the clinical development of solithromycin. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 91-92.) During this period, Cempra conducted two stock offerings in order to raise capital to fund the company's operations for combined net proceeds of approximately $170 million. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 94-95.) In January 2016, Cempra sold 4.17 million shares of common stock at a price of $24.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of $94 million. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 94.) Between May 2016 and July 2016, Cempra sold an additional 4 million shares of common stock during an \"at-the-market\" offering for net proceeds of $75.1 million. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 95.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In their amended complaint, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants made false and misleading statements regarding the safety profile of the drug and failed to adequately disclose instances of drug-induced liver injury (\"DILI\") observed in clinical trials prior to and during the class period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 58-65, 67, 69-77.) According to the amended complaint, these false and misleading statements caused Cempra's common stock to trade at artificially high prices, so that when the risks were revealed by the FDA at the end of the class period, Plaintiffs suffered losses from the subsequent stock price decline. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12, 96-102.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Solithromycin's Clinical Development Program\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Solithromycin belongs to a class of antibiotics known as macrolides that are frequently prescribed to treat respiratory tract infections. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.) Due to the serious side effects associated with another class of antibiotics known as fluoroquinolones, macrolides are the preferred first-line treatment for CABP. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.) Solithromycin is a fourth-generation fluoroketolide macrolide-class antibiotic, which was designed to address the growing problem of antibiotic resistance among the currently-approved class of macrolides approved to treat CABP. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.) During the class period, analysts estimated that Cempra would earn up to $2 billion a year in sales if solithromycin were approved by the FDA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The potential risk of DILI among this particular class of macrolides was well known to both the company and potential investors prior to the class period. In 2004, the FDA approved the drug telithromycin, known by the brand name Ketek, a third-generation macrolide and the first ketolide antibiotic. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.) Shortly after its approval, Ketek was found to cause severe adverse effects in patients, including reversible visual disturbances, loss of consciousness, myasthenia gravis (a neurological disorder associated with improper muscle regulation), and severe liver injury that resulted in liver failure, liver transplant, and death. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) These safety issues led to two congressional investigations into the FDA's approval of the drug and accusations that the FDA stifled concerns over the drug raised by its own reviewers and ignored suspicious clinical data that were later determined to be fraudulent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.) Ultimately, the FDA revoked Ketek's approval for treatment for all indications other than CABP and required a \"black box\" warning label highlighting the risk of potential liver injury. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Cempra recognized that the approval of solithromycin depended on the company's ability to differentiate the drug from Ketek. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 38, 69.) As a fluoroketolide, solithromycin has a nearly identical chemical structure to Ketek, except it includes an aminophenyl group with a 1, 2, 3-triazole\n   ring as opposed to the pyridine attached to an imidazole ring in Ketek. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.) Cempra claimed that removing the pyridine moiety would prevent the drug from inhibiting the body's nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which purportedly caused the severe adverse effects observed with Ketek. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38, 69.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Prior to obtaining marketing approval, a developmental drug must undergo a series of pre-clinical and clinical trials to evaluate its safety and effectiveness for a particular treatment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39-43.) Clinical trials are conducted in three distinct phases of clinical investigation in humans, identified as Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39-43);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20312.21\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 312.21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Each phase of clinical testing is designed to gather information on the safety and efficacy of the drug in human subjects. (Doc. 46 \u00b6 43.) Phase 1 trials \"are designed to determine the metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40 (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20312.21\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 312.21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ).) Phase 2 trials are exploratory studies designed to address efficacy and to determine common short-term side effects and risks. (Doc. 46 \u00b6 41);\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20312.21\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 312.21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Phase 3 trials are expanded studies to address the efficacy and safety of the drug, which generally involve hundreds of, and sometimes several thousand, subjects. (Doc. 46 \u00b6 43);\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20312.21\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 312.21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). FDA rules and regulations require that a sponsor promptly report all drug-related serious adverse events (\"SAEs\"), including a single occurrence that is either uncommon or strongly associated with drug exposure, such as hepatic (i.e., liver) injury. (Doc. 46 \u00b6 57 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20312.32\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 312.32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1)(i)(A) ) );\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20312.32\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 312.32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1)(i) (requiring sponsor to file a report within fifteen days after a determination by the sponsor that the information qualifies for reporting as a \"[s]erious and unexpected suspected adverse reaction\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Cempra's development of solithromycin for treatment of CABP involved a proposed short-term course of five to seven days, depending on the mode of administration. (Doc. 51-15 at 5, 62.) Prior to the class period, Cempra completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials for the oral and IV dosages of solithromycin to treat CABP, which Cempra represented demonstrated a promising safety and tolerability profile for those dosages to treat CABP. (Doc. 46 \u00b6 44.) Cempra disclosed in its SEC filings that the FDA placed a partial clinical hold on a Phase 1 trial for oral solithromycin and later converted it to a full clinical hold, citing concerns that the drug may have similar toxicity issues as Ketek. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45.) Cempra was eventually allowed to proceed with the trial, which it successfully completed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The company assured investors that it had addressed the FDA's concerns but noted that the clinical hold indicated that the FDA may subject its NDAs to heightened scrutiny in light of the Ketek experience. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Phase 3 clinical trial of solithromycin taken orally for the treatment of CABP (\"Solitaire-Oral trial\") involved 860 subjects and was conducted between December 2012 and October 2014, while the Phase 3 clinical trial for IV treatment (\"Solitaire-IV trial\") involved 863 subjects and was conducted between November 2013 and September 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50-51.) The Phase 3 CABP clinical trials evaluated the safety and efficacy of oral and IV solithromycin compared to moxifloxacin, a fluoroquinolone considered to be the most potent drug for CABP. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.) Both trials had the primary objective and endpoint of demonstrating statistical non-inferiority compared to moxifloxacin, while the secondary objectives included demonstrating the safety and tolerability of the drug compared to moxifloxacin. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Cempra reported that both of the trials met their primary and secondary objectives of demonstrating solithromycin's statistical non-inferiority as compared to moxifloxacin. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 52, 54.) Cempra disclosed that it observed in some patients elevation of the liver enzyme alanine aminotransferase (\"ALT\") but stated that these elevations were generally asymptomatic and reversible. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 52, 55.) Furthermore, the company reported that no patient in either trial met the criteria of \"Hy's Law,\" a standard used by the FDA to predict the risk of severe DILI. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 53, 55.) To meet Hy's Law, a patient must have an elevation of ALT or the liver enzyme aspartate aminotransferase (\"AST\") greater than three times the upper limit of normal (\"ULN\") in combination with impaired hepatic function (defined as an elevation of bilirubin (a liver byproduct) greater than two times ULN), without any evidence of an alternative cause of hepatic injury. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 51-16 at 154-55 (describing Hy's Law criteria).) \"A Hy's Law case predicts severe liver injury at a rate of at least 1/10 of the rate of Hy's Law cases,\" such that 1 case in 1,000 suggests severe injury at a rate of 1 in 10,000. (Doc. 46 \u00b6 53.) However, a study of at least 3,000 patients is needed to accurately predict that no Hy's Law cases will result from a particular treatment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53.) According to an FDA guidance document, the failure to detect a Hy's Law case does not imply that a drug with aminotransferase elevations is free from risk of severe DILI. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In September 2015, Cempra initiated Phase 2 clinical trials to evaluate the effectiveness of solithromycin as a treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (\"COPD\") and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (\"NASH\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.) The company enrolled four patients in the Phase 2 COPD trial, where patients received a daily oral dose of 400 mg of solithromycin for twenty-eight days. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Doc. 51-11 at 15, 25, 29.) During the class period and shortly after the trial was initiated, three out of the four patients in the COPD group experienced \"patterns of DILI,\" including ALT elevations in excess of four times ULN. (Doc. 46 \u00b6 48; Doc. 51-11 at 15-17, 25-26.) After receiving twenty-three days of treatment, one patient was diagnosed with clinical cholestatic hepatitis with jaundice\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and was discontinued from treatment. (Doc. 46 \u00b6 48; Doc. 51-11 at 15-17.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In that case,\n   the patient's liver test results did not return to normal until twenty-nine days after being discontinued from treatment. (Doc. 51-11 at 16.) While the two other patients experienced asymptomatic ALT elevations (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25-26), one of these patients also continued to show signs of liver injury in the form of increasing ALT elevations even after treatment was discontinued. (Doc. 46 \u00b6 48; Doc. 51-11 at 25-26.) In light of these developments, Cempra reduced the dosage in the ongoing Phase 2 NASH trial to an oral dose of 200 mg of solithromycin daily for seven days, followed by 200 mg oral doses three times a week for a total course of thirteen weeks of treatment. (Doc. 46 \u00b6 49; Doc. 51-12 at 3.) Cempra reported this amendment in the NASH protocol at the website ClinicalTrials.gov and to investors during the company's September 30, 2016 conference call. (Doc. 46 \u00b6 49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Material Misrepresentations and Omissions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   During the class period, Defendants made public statements regarding the clinical results from the Phase 3 CABP trials as well as the overall safety profile of the drug. In their amended complaint, Plaintiffs challenge several of these statements, as set forth below, as material misrepresentations and omissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    1. July 7, 2015 Press Release\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On July 7, 2015, Cempra issued a press release announcing that it had completed enrollment for the Solitaire-IV Phase 3 trial. (Doc. 46 \u00b6 58.) The press release contained a quote from Fernandes, which stated in relevant part: \"We remain on track to announce the top line results before year-end 2015. We believe that these results, coupled with our successful Solitaire Oral results, which we announced in January, will provide a compelling clinical data set in our solithromycin NDA submission, expected in 2016.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    2. October 16, 2015 Press Release\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On October 16, 2015, Cempra issued a press release announcing positive topline results from its Solitaire-IV trial. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54.) The company reported that the trial met the primary and secondary objectives of statistical non-inferiority compared to moxifloxacin. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) With regard to safety, Cempra disclosed that there were fatalities that occurred with similar frequency in both arms of the study due to pneumonia or its complications during the study period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The company noted that more treatment-related adverse events were observed with solithromycin (34.3%) than moxifloxacin (13.1%), but stated that this difference was largely attributable to infusion site reactions of mild and moderate severity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Cempra reported that 2.1% of IV solithromycin patients discontinued the drug due to adverse infusion-related events and noted that infusion site pain is a common side effect of intravenous macrolides but is not generally noted with fluoroquinolones such as moxifloxacin. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Cempra also reported that SAEs occurred in 6.9% of solithromycin patients and 5.4% of moxifloxacin patients, but only three SAEs were considered drug-related. (Doc. 51-5 at 7;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 46 \u00b6 55.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Only two of the three SAEs were associated with solithromycin; all were allergic reactions. (Doc. 51-5 at 7.) Cempra also noted that ALT elevations were observed in both\n   treatment arms, reporting that Grade 3 ALT elevations (explained as ALT elevations of between 3 to 8 times ULN) were observed in 8.2% of solithromycin patients and 3.4% of moxifloxacin patients, and Grade 4 ALT elevations (explained as ALT elevations greater than 8 times ULN) were observed in 0.7% of solithromycin patients and 0.5% of moxifloxacin patients. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Cempra reported that \"[t]reatment emergent ALT elevations were generally asymptomatic, reversible, and not associated with increased bilirubin\" and \"[n]o solithromycin patient met Hy's Law criteria of concurrent ALT and bilirubin elevations post-baseline.\" (Doc. 46 \u00b6 59 (emphasis omitted).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    3. October 16, 2015 Conference Call\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On October 16, 2015, Cempra held a conference call to discuss the topline results from the Solitaire Oral-IV trial. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60.) In response to a question from an analyst regarding whether any symptomatic ALT elevations were observed during the course of the clinical trial, Oldach provided the following response:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   We've gone through all of these cases and looked carefully at them. There were a few patients, for instance, that had infusion pain but no symptoms relatable to right upper quadrant or liver pain. But we want to be very careful about that. So before we say categorically absolutely none, we will be going back through their cases two more times before we declare that. But generally, no symptoms, no evidence of hepatic injury that was symptomatic or with bilirubin elevation. So that was just a cautionary statement on our part just so we could be absolutely certain. But our impression is none.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Fernandes further noted, \"And remember, the [data management committee]\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   has seen each of these, you know, any significant ALT elevation, during the study and did not do anything.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (alteration in original).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    4.

During her opening remarks, Fernandes made the following statement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   As one would expect, in both Phase 3 trials, these we saw some Grade 3 ALT elevation, and to a much lesser extent some Grade 4 ALT elevations. In almost all cases of ALT elevations among solithromycin recipients, these elevations occurred early, peaked on day four - remember, it is day one through seven - and their levels were typically declining by day seven, despite continued study drug dosing.

In addition, the prospectus also stated that \"[t]he results of either of our ongoing studies of the effectiveness of solithromycin as a treatment for NASH and COPD or any other study or trial involving solithromycin, if negative, could have an adverse effect on FDA and other regulatory approval of solithromycin as a treatment for CABP as well our commercialization efforts for solithromycin and market acceptance of the same.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    7.

Because if you look at the modeling, the long-term dosage and our experience with it is saying that - that was more of a redundant study to show that one would be a long-term chronic dose and if you look at azithromycin, for instance with CF, in multiple doses for many weeks. It's dosed three times a week so it's not unusual for macrolides, which happen to linger intercellularly for long periods of time. That you should reduce the dose of chronic dosing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   (Doc. 46 \u00b6 76.) When later questioned during the conference call regarding the amendment to the protocol, Fernandes stated that \"[t]he driver [behind the decision to alter dosages] was efficacy as well as safety.\" (Doc. 51-12 at 9.) She also noted that \"I will remind you that in our CABP trial, which we presented to you, we have seen ALT increases even during the five to seven days of treatment which comes back.\" (Doc. 46 \u00b6 75.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   During the conference call, Fernandes made various statements touting the overall safety profile of the drug.

There was a spectrum of both hepatocellular and cholestatic signatures of hepatotoxicity, in one case accompanied by eosinophilia and suggesting hypersensitivity as a mechanism for liver injury. These findings were noted among a relatively small\n   number of patients treated with solithromycin for CABP (n=920), normal healthy volunteers exposed to the drug in PK studies, and a small number of patients administered solithromycin in studies of other conditions. We conclude that these findings comprise a genuine liver injury signal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   (Doc. 46 \u00b6 8; Doc. 51-15 at 35.) The FDA Briefing Document further concluded that Cempra failed to adequately differentiate solithromycin from Ketek, noting:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   Despite the differences in chemical structure, the hepatic adverse effects seen with solithromycin during its development program exceed the pre-marketing hepatic signal seen with [Ketek ].

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-11.) Defendants claim that Plaintiffs \"erroneously equate ALT elevation with DILI\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4) and contend they had no legal duty to report \"the eight alleged instances of DILI\" because \"ALT elevations - which Defendants disclosed - are not synonymous with liver injury.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Most of the challenged statements appear to closely track the reported clinical data.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , (Doc. 46 \u00b6 59 (\"Treatment emergent ALT elevations were generally asymptomatic, reversible, and not associated with increased bilirubin.

Nothing in the FDA Briefing materials indicates that any of these statements is false.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   It is also not the case that Defendants denied any evidence or \"signal\" of liver injury of any kind.

This is not entirely accurate. The challenged statements deny any actual cases of liver toxicity. (Doc. 46 \u00b6 64 (\"But let me again say: there is no liver toxicity. There is no hepatic toxicity.

The FDA Briefing Document appendix also includes a \"Disease Severity Scale\" developed by the National Institutes of Health's Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) Study Group. (Doc. 51-15 at 95.) This \"Disease Severity Scale\" defines \"severe\" liver injury as the presence of \"[e]levated ALT and/or Alk P and serum bilirubin =2.5 mg/dl\" and the presence of either \"[h]epatic failure (INR =1.5, ascites or encephalopathy\" or \"[o]ther organ failure renal/pulmonary) [due to] dili.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) It is logical that Defendants' explanations of the clinical trial results would therefore be made in the context of Hy's Law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Apart from two SAEs that were attributable to allergic reactions to solithromycin\n   in the Solitaire-IV trial, Plaintiffs have not identified any other drug-related SAE in the Phase 3 CABP trials which would have been subject to the FDA's reporting requirements and relevant to the allegedly misleading statements. (Doc. 46 \u00b6\u00b6 52 (noting that Cempra reported \"no SAEs were considered study drug related\" in the Solitaire-Oral trial), 55 (noting Cempra reported that only two SAEs associated with solithromycin in the Solitaire-IV trial were considered drug-related, both of which were allergic reactions ).) Indeed, the FDA Briefing Document noted that apart from one liver-related SAE associated with moxifloxacin, \"no other liver-related SAEs were noted in either arm [of the study]\" in the pooled clinical results from the Phase 3 CABP trials. (Doc. 51-15 at 30.) In fact, the FDA Advisory Committee voted, albeit narrowly,\n   <em>\n    in favor\n   </em>\n   of approving solithromycin for use. (Doc. 51-16 at 336.)

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 83.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   The FDA confirmed these findings. During the FDA Advisory Committee meeting, Dr. Avigan stated that during the Phase 3 trials: \"we never saw a severe or serious liver injury.\" (Doc. 51-16 at 255-56.) Yet, the Avigan memorandum acknowledged that the results for the eight patients in the Phase 3 CABP trial were \"solithromycin-induced liver injury\" and concluded there was an \"\n   <em>\n    open question\n   </em>\n   concerning the actual 'real-world' population-level risk for\n   <em>\n    serious\n   </em>\n   DILI associated with solithromycin.\" (Doc. 51-15 at 92 (emphasis added).) This was reiterated during the FDA Advisory Committee meeting, when Dr. Avigan stated that the issue was whether the trials \"tested enough people to feel comfortable with where the risk may lie to say that we haven't seen an event.\" (Doc. 51-16 at 257, 258.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on this record,\n   even if Cempra was negligent to describe the trial results without noting that failure to meet Hy's Law criteria \"does not imply that a drug with aminotransferase elevations is free from risk of severe DILI,\" Cempra did not recklessly claim that there was no risk of severe DILI in future trials. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 156; Doc. 46 \u00b6 53);\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Medimmune, Inc. Sec.

Md. 1995) (finding challenged statement that \"[t]here's absolutely no question about efficacy\" to be actionable). Rather, the company simply reported its Phase 3 CABP trial results based on the data, and the Avigan memorandum agreed that no serious liver injury was observed. Accordingly, the record fails to suggest that Cempra was acting intentionally or recklessly when describing its Phase 3 CABP results, as opposed to simply stating its interpretation of them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Sanofi Sec.

Rather, the FDA's Complete Response Letter only required additional safety information to characterize solithromycin's hepatotoxicity. (Doc. 46 \u00b6\u00b6 11, 88.) The FDA recommended a comparative study with 9,000 CABP patients exposed to solithromycin and indicated that if solithromycin were approved, the drug's label would need to include \"adequate information about the potential for hepatotoxicity.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.) Thus, the FDA did not conclude that Cempra's statements were factually inaccurate but simply determined that more data should be obtained before drawing those same positive interpretations. Therefore, the most compelling inference is that any disparity between the challenged statements and the information disclosed by the FDA appears to reflect a difference of opinion regarding the interpretation of the clinical results, rather than a concerted effort to deceive the investing public.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re AstraZeneca Sec.

(Doc. 46 \u00b6\u00b6 69, 71.) Plaintiffs' allegation that Cempra presented \"no evidence\" to differentiate solithromycin from Ketek is contradicted by Cempra's clinical trials. As noted in Cempra's FDA briefing document, Cempra conducted a detailed analysis of its clinical results, with particular attention to the adverse events observed with Ketek. (Doc. 51-14 at 130.) In addition, Cempra relied on a complex computational model of DILI, performed by an independent service, to assess the risk of Hy's Law cases or incidents of severe idiosyncratic liver injury from use of the drug. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 122-23; Doc. 51-15 at 90.) The Avigan memorandum noted that Cempra's modeling predicted that the \"main driver of hepatocyte loss causing the range of ALT and ALP abnormalities that were observed in the clinical study program\" were likely to be \"most strongly connected to drug-induced mitochondrial toxicity,\" which was different from that thought to be associated with erythromycin. (Doc. 51-15 at 90.) The Avigan memorandum concluded that the Cempra modeling \"may become more valuable in the long-term as more information accrues,\" but that \"with the limited power of study subject liver test data that has been used, a\n   <em>\n    firm\n   </em>\n   conclusion that solithromycin is not associated with a risk for clinically serious idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity cannot be drawn.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 90-91 (emphasis added).) The Avigan memorandum recommended more studies, using telithromycin (Ketek ) as a positive control, and concluded that Cempra's argument that solithromycin \"is marked by a substantially lower potential to cause severe hepatotoxicity than telithromycin [Ketek ]\" was \"so far unproven.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) So, even though the FDA ultimately found Cempra's arguments to be unpersuasive, it is untrue that\n   Defendants presented no evidence to support their claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   Indeed, the cautionary language contained in Cempra's January 7, 2016 prospectus undermines any claim that the challenged statements regarding Cempra's ability to differentiate solithromycin from Ketek based on its chemical composition were in fact misleading. (Doc. 46 \u00b6 69; Doc. 51-7 at 22-23.) The prospectus alerted investors that Cempra \"might not successfully differentiate solithromycin from telithromycin (Ketek ), a macrolide found to cause severe side effects,\" noting that \"[b]ecause of the Ketek experience, the macrolide class is likely to be carefully scrutinized by the FDA.\" (Doc. 51-7 at 23-24.) The prospectus further noted that \"[t]he results of either of our ongoing studies of the effectiveness of solithromycin as a treatment for NASH and COPD or any other study or trial involving solithromycin, if negative, could have an adverse effect on FDA and other regulatory approval of solithromycin as a treatment for CABP as well as our commercialization efforts for solithromycin and market acceptance of the same.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   Through this cautionary language, therefore, investors were clearly advised of the risks surrounding Cempra's ability to successfully differentiate solithromycin from Ketek. When read in light of the prospectus, the challenged statements did not present an obvious danger of misleading a reasonable investor.\n   <em>\n    Lerner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12418222\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/273/573/#p586\">\n    273 F.Supp.3d at 594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Consequently, there is no reckless conduct sufficient to establish a strong inference of scienter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   Plaintiffs' arguments as to the challenged statements differentiating the drug from Ketek on the basis of the clinical results present a closer question, given Cempra's failure to disclose the adverse events observed in the Phase 2 COPD trials. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 46 \u00b6\u00b6 65, 74, 77.) In particular, Plaintiffs point to Hahn's statements at the Morgan Stanley Global Healthcare Conference on September 12, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 73-74.) In response to a question from an analyst regarding \"what happened with Ketek and how solithromycin differs,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   Hahn responded: \"in all of our trials - we have exposed over 2,000 patients and subjects over the years, and nobody has had any of those same types of issues that the folks had experienced with Ketek.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74.) But this statement was not made in the abstract. In that same response, Hahn had identified the issues caused by Ketek as \"visual disturbance,\" \"exacerbation of myasthenia gravis,\" and \"liver toxicity.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In this context, therefore, the statement does not appear to be false, but its accuracy is subject to criticism insofar as the FDA noted that persons with a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis were excluded from the study and some participants, while not experiencing liver toxicity as measured by Hy's Law, had \"a very significant signal\" of liver toxicity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   note 23\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   Plaintiffs also point to Hahn's response to a question during the same conference regarding how the FDA Advisory Committee panel will address the ALT elevations observed during the clinical trials. Hahn responded: \"What we see is what you expect from a macrolide: you expect ALTs to go up in the early days, and come back down.\n   <em>\n    Even on continued therapy\n   </em>\n   , we saw the ALT levels coming right back down.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).) While Hahn's statements were broad in scope, purporting to cover \"all\" of Cempra's trials, he failed to disclose the adverse events in the Phase 2 COPD trials, where at least one participant exhibited clear symptoms of liver injury and his liver test results did not return to normal until twenty-nine days after being discontinued from treatment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 51-11 at 15-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   At least with regard to Cempra's Phase 3 CABP clinical trials, Defendants correctly note that there is limited evidence of serious idiosyncratic liver toxicity or other notable symptoms that were associated with Ketek, even if the FDA ultimately found that the clinical data demonstrated a \"signal\" for hepatic injury. (Doc. 59 at 12-13.) The clinical data supported Cempra's interpretation of the clinical results. The fact that the FDA ultimately gave the data different weight does not necessarily render the challenged statements misleading. It cannot be said that Cempra's statements are \"such an extreme departure from the standard of ordinary care\" that the Defendants \"must have been aware\" of such an obvious danger of misleading the plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    Lerner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12418222\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/273/573/#p586\">\n    273 F.Supp.3d at 594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   Nevertheless, the adverse events observed during the Phase 2 COPD trial did provide a much more concerning indicator of idiosyncratic liver injury similar to what had been observed with Ketek. Indeed, Cempra's January 7, 2016 prospectus acknowledged generally that the company's ongoing studies involving solithromycin, including the COPD study, \"if negative, could have an adverse effect on FDA and other regulatory approval of solithromycin as a treatment for CABP as well as our commercialization efforts for solithromycin and market acceptance of the same.\" (Doc. 51-7 at 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   In particular, one patient in the Phase 2 COPD study developed cholestatic hepatitis, and his liver test results did not return to normal until twenty-nine days after\n   treatment of solithromycin was discontinued. (Doc. 51-11 at 15-16.) During the FDA Advisory Committee hearing, Oldach acknowledged this was a case of DILI. (Doc. 51-16 at 111 (\"[W]e agree that the COPD patient with cholestatic hepatitis had a drug-induced liver entry [sic]. There's no question. But we think this is due to dose and duration, something which we were actively exploring in our trials.\").) Notably, however, the patient was ultimately determined\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to meet Hy's Law criteria. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 89.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even though these adverse events occurred in the Phase 2 trial for a different treatment, Cempra and its executive officers were well aware that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   clinical data would be considered by FDA in the approval process. Fernandes publicly acknowledged as much in an investor call. (Doc. 46 \u00b6 76 (\"So all of the safety data - every human exposure is submitted as part of the law. We have submitted data until at the end of August and all data comes in, every part will be exposed. And we're very pleased with the safety of the drug.... We're proud to be able to submit this data.\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   However, even assuming that Plaintiffs plausibly pleaded that Hahn's challenged statements were false or misleading because Hahn failed to disclose the results of the Phase 2 COPD trials (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74), this failure, given the context of the statements made, does not provide a strong inference of scienter. The question is not whether a reasonable person could infer that scienter existed, but whether the inference of scienter is \"strong - and compelling, and powerful - when it is weighed against the opposing inferences that may be drawn from the facts in their entirety.\"\n   <em>\n    Cozzarelli\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5735109\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/549/618/#p623\">\n    549 F.3d at 624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As Defendants note, the COPD clinical trial concerned a much longer term of treatment with solithromycin - 28 days. The facts, when viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, are more consistent with the Defendants having acted on the belief that the COPD adverse events were distinguishable from the five to seven day treatment plan for which Cempra was seeking regulatory approval for the CABP application. (Doc. 51-15 at 62.) This conclusion is supported by the Avigan memorandum's notation that solithromycin may have a \"steep dose-liver injury response curve.\" (Doc. 51-15 at 78.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   A comparison of the extensive briefing materials prepared by the FDA staff and Cempra reveals that each side had its own interpretation of the data.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re AstraZeneca Sec. Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3666825\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/559/453/#p470\">\n    559 F.Supp.2d at 471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When evaluating the facts alleged in the amended complaint holistically, the more compelling inference is that Defendants had a good faith belief in their interpretation of the clinical data, and any failure to disclose the adverse events in the COPD trials did not result from any dishonest or reckless behavior.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yates\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4120267\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/744/874/#p881\">\n    744 F.3d at 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of pleading scienter under the PSLRA, where the facts indicated that the \"more compelling ... inference [was] that the [defendants] were, at most, negligent\");\n   <em>\n    In re AstraZeneca Sec.

Allegedly Misleading Statements Regarding Solithromycin's Safety Profile in the Phase 2 NASH Study\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs allege that Cempra amended the protocol for the Phase 2 NASH clinical trial to reduce the dosage amounts of solithromycin because of the adverse effects observed in the Phase 2 COPD trial, but failed to adequately disclose this point to investors. (Doc. 46 \u00b6\u00b6 75-76; Doc. 55 at 28.) On September 30, 2016, Cempra held a conference call for analysts and investors to discuss the preliminary results of the Phase 2 NASH clinical trial. (Doc. 46 \u00b6 76; Doc. 51-12.) During the question-and-answer session, Oldach acknowledged that the dosing regimen was changed to address ALT elevations observed when treating patients with solithromycin for longer durations, but he did not disclose the full extent of the adverse events observed during the COPD clinical trials. (Doc. 46 \u00b6 76; Doc. 51-12.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fernandes also stated that the company had submitted all of the clinical data to the FDA as part of the approval process and reiterated that \"we're very pleased with the safety of the drug.\" (Doc. 46 \u00b6 76; Doc. 51-12 at 13.) When later questioned regarding the amendment to the protocol during the conference call, Fernandes said that \"[t]he driver [behind the decision to alter dosages] was efficacy as well as safety.\" (Doc. 51-12 at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Oldach's statement regarding the amendment of the protocol of the Phase 2 NASH trial was false and misleading because he failed to disclose that the amendment occurred due to \"patterns of DILI observed in the Phase 2 COPD trial,\" citing the FDA Briefing Document. (Doc. 46 \u00b6 82; Doc. 55 at 28.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants contend the FDA Briefing Document does not contain any such statement (Doc. 50 at 29 n.13), and the court can find no such statement. FDA Presenter Dr. Gopinath did state during the FDA Advisory Committee meeting that \"after considering some of the safety information that came out of the COPD trial, the protocol for the NASH trial was amended.\" (Doc. 51-16 at 171.) Defendants contend that Oldach's statement regarding the Phase 2 trials is \"not at all inconsistent with Plaintiffs' allegation that Cempra adjusted the dose due to observations from the Phase 2 COPD trial.\" (Doc. 50 at 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   While Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 \"do not create an affirmative duty to disclose\n   any and all material information,\"\n   <em>\n    Singer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516076\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/883/425/#p439\">\n    883 F.3d at 440\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted), it is a closer question whether Oldach had a duty to disclose the complete rationale for the dosing change when he referenced ALT elevations observed \"[w]hen dosing solithromycin for longer durations,\" even if he did not refer to the clinical study by name. (Doc. 46 \u00b6 76.) Defendants' argument - that Oldach's reference to just ALT elevations is consistent with the Phase 2 COPD trial results - conflicts with the distinction Defendants draw between ALT elevation and DILI in defending against the other challenged statements. At least one patient during the COPD Phase 2 trials demonstrated clear symptoms of DILI. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 46 \u00b6 82;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 51-11 at 15-17; Doc. 51-16 at 111.) In these circumstances, where Cempra was noting the increased ALT elevations in other phases of its solithromycin trials where DILI was not identified, Oldach's reference to just ALT elevations and not DILI in the Phase 2 NASH trial plausibly \"would have misled a reasonable investor.\"\n   <em>\n    Lerner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12418222\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/273/573/#p586\">\n    273 F.Supp.3d at 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   Nevertheless, Plaintiffs again fail to adequately allege a strong inference of scienter with respect to these challenged statements relating exclusively to the Phase 2 NASH trials. During the same conference call, Fernandes clarified that the dosage change was made for \"efficacy as well as safety.\" (Doc. 51-12 at 9.) This mirrors the explanation given by FDA presenter, Dr. Gopinath, that changes were made to the NASH trial protocol \"after considering some of the safety information that came out of the COPD trial.\" (Doc. 50 at 29-30 n.13 (quoting 51-16 at 171).) In light of the conflicting interpretations of DILI, and for reasons similar to those previously discussed, the court finds that the allegations with respect to these challenged statements do not support a finding of a strong inference of scienter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Human Genome Scis.

Section 20(a) imposes liability on any person who \"directly or indirectly, controls any person liable\" for violations of the Exchange Act, \"unless the controlling person acted in good faith and did not directly or indirectly induce the act or acts constituting the violation or cause of action.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t(a). Plaintiffs have alleged that each of the individual Defendants had authority over the content and dissemination of the challenged statements and qualifies as a control person within the meaning of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. (Doc. 46 \u00b6\u00b6 24, 27, 30.) Because the court finds that Plaintiffs fail to state a claim regarding the predicate violation of Section 10(b), Plaintiffs' Section 20(a) claims cannot proceed.\n   <em>\n    BearingPoint\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4037444\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/576/172/#p181\">\n    576 F.3d at 192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Because the complaint fails to withstand a Rule 12(b)(6) motion with respect to the predicate violation of \u00a7 10(b), it also fails with respect to the \u00a7 20(a) claims.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Soon after release, however, Ketek was found to cause reversible visual disturbances, exacerbate myasthenia gravis (a neurological disorder characterized by improper muscle regulation) and cause liver failure. These effects led the FDA to require the drug label for Ketek to include a strengthened warning section regarding specific drug-related adverse events and contributed to Ketek being withdrawn in 2007 for the treatment of all infections other than CABP. Our research suggests these side effects may be caused by the pyridine moiety, which forms a part of the structure of Ketek. We have demonstrated that pyridine inhibits the action of nicotinic acid acetylcholine receptors that could result in the side effects caused by Ketek. Solithromycin and older generation macrolides, including azithromycin and clarithromycin, that have been widely marketed do not have a pyridine component. If our research is proven to be incorrect or if solithromycin demonstrates similar side effects, the FDA might not approve solithromycin, or, if already approved, might withdraw approval, require us to conduct additional clinical trials or require warnings on product labeling, which would significantly harm our ability to generate revenues from solithromycin. Even if the FDA approves solithromycin, physicians may not be convinced that solithromycin is a safe and effective treatment for CABP and other infections. If physicians believe solithromycin demonstrates characteristics similar to Ketek, they might not prescribe solithromycin, which would negatively affect our revenues.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-244\">\n    (Doc. 51-2 at 6.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"25\">\n   <p id=\"p-245\">\n    In discussing toxicity for Ketek, the FDA Briefing Document notes that some participants in the Ketek clinical trials developed \"reversible hepatitis with or without jaundice,\" and \"a comprehensive assessment of 42 published and spontaneously reported post-marketing cases of clinically significant telithromycin-associated liver injury\" performed by an FDA expert panel found that four of those cases involved the severe outcome of death, one required a liver transplant, and a total of 26 were judged to be \"highly likely\" or \"probable\" in their causal association with telithromycin.
