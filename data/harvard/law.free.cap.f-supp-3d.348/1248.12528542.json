The court granted the defendant's motion to dismiss, holding, inter alia, that U.S. Steel's claim was precluded because U.S. Steel could have challenged the all-others rate at the time it challenged the individual respondents' rates in\n   <em>\n    U.S. Steel I\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10. The court explained that U.S. Steel had all of the facts it required to seek a change to the all-others rate in\n   <em>\n    U.S. Steel I\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    U.S. Steel II\n   </em>\n   , and therefore could have sought a change to the all-others rate in addition to challenging the mandatory respondents' rates.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10. As a result, U.S. Steel's challenge to the all-others rate was merged into the U.S. Steel II judgment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. The court explained that U.S. Steel, \"in essence, contends that the judgment in U.S. Steel II required Commerce to recalculate the all-others rate,\" and that if U.S. Steel believes that the U.S. Steel II judgment requires such action by Commerce, U.S. Steel may seek to enforce the judgment issued in\n   <em>\n    U.S. Steel II\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11,. U.S. Steel brought the present motion seeking to compel Commerce to recalculate the all-others rate.

First, U.S. Steel argues that 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673d(c)(5)(A) requires that Commerce recalculate the all-others rate when the dumping margins for mandatory respondents change in the course of judicial review. Pl. [U.S. Steel's] Br. Supp. Mot. Enforce J. at 6, June 19, 2018, ECF No. 154 (\"Pl.'s Br.\"). Second, U.S. Steel argues that Commerce's determination of the all-others rate contravenes the line of cases holding that Commerce may not rely on dumping margins that have been invalidated by the courts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. Third, U.S. Steel argues that Commerce's determination of the all-others rate in the\n   <em>\n    Amended ADD Order\n   </em>\n   departed from Commerce's established practice of revising the all-others rate after its final remand determination is sustained by the court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The court has inherent authority to enforce its own judgments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    B.F.

The all-others rate is the weighted average of the mandatory respondent rates, excluding any zero and de minimis rates. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673d(c)(5)(A). Parties may challenge Commerce's findings made in an ADD investigation before this court,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(a)(2)(B)(i) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201581\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), and this court in some cases will remand Commerce's findings for further consideration. Commerce, pursuant to a remand order, may alter its methodology in a manner that affects the calculation of the mandatory respondent rates, as Commerce did in its\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   pursuant to the remand order in\n   <em>\n    U.S. Steel I\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   at 51-52. Because the all-others rate is a function of the mandatory respondent rates, a change to the mandatory respondent rates implicates the all-others rate. The question before the court is whether enforcement of a judgment sustaining Commerce's\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   , which involves changes to the mandatory respondent rates but contains no mention of the all-others rate, requires that Commerce also revise the all-others rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The court finds that Commerce has a practice of revising the all-others rate when mandatory respondent rates change in the course of judicial review, even when the plaintiff does not raise a challenge to the all-others rate in its complaint or during remand proceedings. Agency action becomes an established practice \"when a uniform and established procedure exists that would lead a party, in the absence of notification of change, reasonably to expect adherence to\" the agency's past action.\n   <em>\n    Mid Continent Steel &amp; Wire, Inc. v.

In its\n   <em>\n    Hyundai Remand Results\n   </em>\n   , after making changes to its methodology which altered the mandatory respondent rates, Commerce explained its practice with respect to the all-others rate:\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Although no party has challenged the all others rate in this proceeding, it does not follow that Commerce has no authority to adjust this rate in this remand proceeding. We regard adjusting the all others rate as a consequential (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   collateral) change properly within the scope of the litigation. If the Court affirms this remand redetermination and Commerce consequently issues an amended final determination effectuating this remand redetermination, it will be governed by section 735 of the Act, which provides for both the determination of weighted-average dumping margins for individually investigated respondents and an all others rate that, as a general rule, derives from the weighted-average dumping margins determined for the individually investigated respondents. Therefore, because we intend to change the all others rate in any future amended final determination issued pursuant to this litigation, we are announcing this intent now. Provided the statutory scheme in section 735 of the Act, we do not agree with the petitioner that adjusting the all others rate within this remand proceeding in accordance with the change made to [respondent's] calculated margin is outside the scope of the remand proceeding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Hyundai Remand Results\n   </em>\n   at 15. Commerce, therefore, affirmed that its practice is to revise the all-others rate when the mandatory respondent rates change in the\n   course of judicial review, even when the all-others rate is not specifically raised in the plaintiff's complaint or during remand proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Examination of Commerce's prior determinations also shows that its practice is to revise the all-others rate in accordance with changes to the mandatory respondent rates, even if not requested to do so in a complaint. For example, in\n   <em>\n    [OCTG] From Turkey\n   </em>\n   , Commerce revised the all-others rate after the mandatory respondents' rates changed pursuant to remand. See\n   <em>\n    [OCTG]\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    From Turkey\n   </em>\n   (notice of court decision not in harmony with the final determination of the countervailing duty investigation),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2012%2C691\">\n    81 Fed.

Def.'s Br. at 15. The court is not persuaded. Even if the involvement of an all-others plaintiff serves to implicitly raise the issue of the all-others rate's accuracy, Commerce has not, in practice, utilized the presence of an all-others plaintiff as the dispositive factor. The facts of\n   <em>\n    [OCTG] From Turkey\n   </em>\n   may be distinct, but Commerce regularly revises the all-others rate upon a change to the mandatory respondent rates in the course of judicial review, regardless of whether the case involves an all-others plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Heavy Walled Rectangular Welded Carbon Steel Pipes and Tubes\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    From the Republic of Turkey\n   </em>\n   , 83 Fed.

The manner in which Commerce revised the all-others rate in each of these proceedings belies the notion that\n   <em>\n    [OCTG] From Turkey\n   </em>\n   turned solely on the fact that an all-others plaintiff participated in the litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendant points out that in Commerce's ADD investigation into OCTG from Turkey,\n   <em>\n    Certain [OCTG] From the Republic of Turkey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2036%2C876\">\n    81 Fed.

Def.'s Br. at 16. Defendant argues that this outcome demonstrates that Commerce does not have an established practice, and that U.S. Steel could not have relied on Commerce adhering to its practice, since U.S. Steel participated in litigation related to the above determination.

The mandatory respondent rates had not been declared invalid, as they were determined pursuant to this review. The question here is not whether Commerce relied on valid rates to calculate the all-others rate, but whether Commerce must recalculate an all-others rate once a mandatory respondent's rate changes as a result of judicial review.

U.S. Steel, in its complaint and ensuing brief pursuant to\n   <em>\n    U.S. Steel I\n   </em>\n   , raised several issues, each of which pertained to Commerce's methodology in its final determination and the propriety of respondents' dumping margins.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. Pl. [U.S. Steel] J. Agency R. at 15-74, Mar. 23, 2015, ECF No. 31; Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 17-27, Nov. 10, 2014, ECF No. 9. Missing from U.S. Steel's argument, however, is any explanation of how these issues should affect Commerce's calculation of the all-others rate. U.S. Steel might have argued, as it did on this motion, that the plain language of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673d(c)(5)(A) requires Commerce to recalculate the all-others rate when the mandatory respondent rates change. U.S. Steel made no such argument, however, in its complaint pursuant to\n   <em>\n    U.S. Steel I\n   </em>\n   or during the remand proceedings before Commerce. Defendant is therefore correct that U.S. Steel waived its claim that Commerce is required by statute to recalculate the all-others rate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Nonetheless, the issue before the court is what the judgment in U.S. Steel II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   required. The judgment required that Commerce act in accordance with law to effectuate the judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(1). In order to act in accordance with law, Commerce must follow its established practice or explain why it is reasonable for it to deviate from its practice. Where Commerce deviates from its practice, it has two options. First, Commerce may explain why it is reasonable under the circumstances to deviate from that practice. Second, Commerce may announce a change to its practice, unless the party in the instant case can be shown to have detrimentally relied on such practice.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Shikoku Chemicals Corp. v.

This argument sidesteps the question before the court, i.e., whether Commerce effectuated the court's judgment in U.S. Steel II. The court's judgment required that Commerce adjust the rates in accordance with law, or explain why it was deviating from its practice. Where Commerce has an established practice, such practice is part of the law Commerce must follow, unless it explains why it is reasonable to deviate from its practice or it changes its practice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fed.

Thus, Commerce did not address the all-others rate until after the remand proceedings, and given Commerce's practice of revising the all-others rate, U.S. Steel had no reason to challenge the all-others rate during the remand proceedings. At issue is not a prescribed administrative remedy, but rather the requirement that Commerce effectuate the court's judgment in accordance with law, which includes Commerce's practice, and U.S. Steel was not required to petition Commerce to follow the law. U.S. Steel could not have been expected to speculate that Commerce might not follow its practice when issuing its Timken notice.

Although U.S. Steel has shifted its position on this matter across cases, this shift does not preclude the court from finding (in part) for U.S. Steel here.
