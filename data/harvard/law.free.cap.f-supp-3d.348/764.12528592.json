PARKER, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   As Tennesseans make final preparations to cast their ballots, Plaintiffs move for a Temporary Restraining Order (\"TRO\") and Mandamus requiring state and local election officials to take last-minute affirmative steps to implement procedures Plaintiffs believe will make the election more secure and trustworthy. (ECF No. 23.) The day after Plaintiffs filed the motion for TRO, this Court held a hearing. (ECF No. 42.) Because Plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of proof, at the end of the hearing, the Court issued a brief oral ruling denying the Motion. The Court now issues this written opinion explaining its reasons for DENYING Plaintiffs' Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and Mandamus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs filed this suit on Friday, October 12, 2018, five days before early voting began in Shelby County, Tennessee for the November 2018 elections. (ECF No. 1.) The Complaint brings \"a civil rights action for declaratory and injunctive relief\" against the State of Tennessee, Shelby County and various individuals responsible for conducting elections. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs claim that the Defendants' use of certain voting devices-and the lack of security and accountability associated with those devices-violates Plaintiffs' constitutional right to vote. (ECF No. 1 at PageID 2.) In particular, the Complaint alleges that Shelby County Election Commission's (\"Shelby County\") use of AccuVote-TSx R7 direct-recording electronic voting machines (\"AccuVote DRE\") and Diebold GEMS version 1.18.24.101 voting software does not meet Tennessee statutory requirements and thus creates an inherently insecure and inaccurate voting system. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID 48-49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In essence, Plaintiffs' main dispute with Shelby County's voting system is that it does not create a voter verified paper audit trail (\"VVPAT\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID 2.) The AccuVote DRE does not record each voter's selection on a paper ballot. Instead, each voter verifies their choices on the screen (much like using a banking ATM machine) before submitting their ballot electronically and their votes are stored on removable memory card and on the voting machine's internal flash memory. (ECF No. 1 at PageID 22.) The election officials later upload the information from the memory card to a server that tabulates the votes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Allegedly, the lack of a VVPAT has caused-and will continue to cause-\"Plaintiffs and Shelby County voters to cast votes on an illegal and unreliable system that must be presumed to be compromised and that is incapable of producing verifiable results.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID 49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs also assert that Defendants are aware of the deficiencies in Shelby County's voting system and that Defendants have violated the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution by continuing to use this voting system. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In fact, Plaintiffs allege that Shelby County created a fundamentally unfair voting system in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (ECF No. 1 at PageID 52.) And Plaintiffs allege that Defendants knowingly treated Plaintiffs and other Shelby County voters differently than similarly situated voters in other Tennessee counties in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Finally, Plaintiffs allege that Shelby County's voting system violates Tennessee statutory law and the Tennessee Constitution. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID 59-60.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Monday after filing suit, Plaintiffs then moved for a temporary restraining order and mandamus order requesting an order requiring the election officials take various affirmative measures related to the voting system before early voting began on October 17, 2018. (ECF No. 23.) The Court held a hearing on this matter on October 16, 2018. Representatives for all parties appeared at this hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A TRO \"is an extraordinary remedy designed for the limited purpose of preserving the status quo pending further proceedings on the merits....\"\n   <em>\n    Stein v.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs state that the current voting system is susceptible to hacking or physical manipulation (ECF No. 1-5 at PageID 88-89), it increases the possibility that a voter could receive the wrong ballot (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID 93), it allows the election commission to manipulate vote totals (ECF No. 1-6), and, in at least one instance, it has malfunctioned causing on-screen selection of one candidate to register as a selection of another candidate (ECF No. 1-10). These issues combine to allegedly result in an unfair voting system incapable of producing verifiable results.

Here, Shelby County officials have determined that it is in the best interest of the voters to use AccuVote DRE machines in these elections. The Court understands that many of Plaintiffs' concerns fit with reports in the media about computer hacking and foreign interference with the election process in the United States. And the Court agrees that a paper verification might be more reliable than the current voting system. All of that may be true, but Plaintiffs' allegations in this lawsuit are no more than hypothetical concerns about possible wrongdoing or device malfunction. They have not established that Shelby County voters cannot vote and have their votes counted on an equal basis with other voters in Tennessee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   During the hearing, Plaintiffs conceded that every voting system in this nation is\n   susceptible to inaccuracies or malicious interference. Indeed, the measures Plaintiffs request here do not guarantee the voting system in Shelby County will be secure or reliable. By contrast, however, if the Court were to grant the TRO here, it definitely would cause a mad scramble for the state and local election officials to alter their operations on the eve of early voting. Such an outcome would render the voting system less secure and reliable.

The real question is whether the lack of a VVPAT \"constitutes a 'severe' restriction on the right to vote.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9052771\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/347/1101/#p1102\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This Court finds that Shelby County's use of the AccuVote DRE and accompanying software does not severely restrict the right to vote. No one is being turned away from the polls and there is no evidence that votes are not being counted. As a result, a rational basis standard applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Weighing the Plaintiffs' asserted injury from using a paperless voting system against Defendants' interest in using their chosen voting system, the Court finds that any burden on Plaintiffs' equal protection rights is not so severe that this Court should interfere with the County's decision to use AccuVote DRE machines. Only fourteen counties-out of ninety-five-use the paper ballot methods Plaintiffs advocate. (ECF No. 1-2 at PageID 177.) Shelby County is therefore in the majority of Tennessee counties using voting systems other than those equipped with a VVPAT. Plaintiffs therefore face an uphill battle when they allege that they are being treated in a disparate manner compared to other Tennessee voters. And Plaintiffs have not adequately alleged that some Shelby County voters are being treated differently than others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Constitution grants states substantial leeway in determining the time, place, and manner of voting.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. Const. Art. 1, \u00a7 4, cl. 1. In fact, \"our constitution also defines the relationship between spheres of government, state and federal, and their responsibilities for protecting the rights of the people.\"\n   <em>\n    Ohio Democratic Party\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6056013\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/834/620/#p626\">\n    834 F.3d at 623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Federal courts therefore should not be quick to interfere with a state's chosen method of voting based only on unsupported allegations of vote manipulation and unreliable technology. The balance of power between the state and federal government \"is no less deserving of vigilant respect\" than the individual's fundamental right to vote.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6056013\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/834/620/#p626\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Tennessee has seen fit to allow each county, in accordance with state law, to determine which voting system it will use. Shelby County has decided to use this particular voting system-that does not include a VVPAT. The State of Tennessee has not objected to Shelby County's choice. The law requires stronger evidence than that submitted by Plaintiffs to justify this Court interrupting the constitutionally implemented balance of power.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    D. State Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Plaintiffs also allege that Shelby County's voting system violates Tennessee constitutional and statutory law. The Court declines to address these issues. That said,\n   it is notable that the Tennessee Court of Appeals has held that the use of DRE voting machines, as opposed to paper ballots, does not violate the Tennessee Constitution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mills v. Shelby Cty. Election Commn.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8317251\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/218/33/\">\n    218 S.W.3d 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tenn. Ct. App. 2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Remaining Injunction Factors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Court also finds that Plaintiffs have not sufficiently alleged that they will suffer irreparable harm if made to use this voting system in future elections. The county used this voting system as recently as August 2018,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   with no showing that they did not function properly. And the burden on Defendants would be substantial if the Court granted Plaintiffs' TRO request. The attorney for Shelby County stated at the TRO hearing that the county has deployed over 200 of these voting machines for early voting, and expect to deploy another 1000 machines on election day, November 6, 2018. Granting the TRO would undoubtedly undermine and significantly burden Defendants' capacity to conduct a smooth election process. Furthermore, while implementing more secure and accurate voting systems always advances the public interest, implementing the requested TRO would interfere with the elections and would harm the public's experience at the polls. The Court finds that under the Rule 65 factors, no factor points to issuance of the TRO here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Court is sympathetic to Plaintiffs' quest to obtain more secure and accurate voting systems for Shelby County. The security of our election process matters to all citizens of this country. However, it is not the duty of the Court to substitute its judgment for that of state and local officials at the eleventh hour.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Choosing voting systems is a decision mainly reserved for state and local authorities, not the federal courts. This is evidenced in jurisdictions where DRE voting machines have been replaced because of the actions of state election officials\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   --not federal courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Court urges Shelby County voting officials to continue studying the efficacy of the current voting system and to implement better procedures as they become available. But the Court understands that these actions are part of a larger process that should not be disturbed. As a result, the Court DENIES Plaintiffs' Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and Mandamus.
