Allied World National Assurance Company et al.\n   </em>\n   , case number 16-CV-3812 (the \"\n   <em>\n    Lighton\n   </em>\n   Action\") and\n   <em>\n    Hibuild LLC v. Mt. Hawley Insurance Company\n   </em>\n   , case number 16-CV-5302 (the \"\n   <em>\n    Hibuild\n   </em>\n   Action\"), which have been consolidated pursuant an order issued February 2, 2017 by the Honorable Steven M.

Both actions relate to the applicability of insurance coverage to an alleged accident on the campus of Brooklyn College on August 16, 2014. Also before the court are an objection to, and a motion to strike, a late-filed Local Rule 56.1 statement, and a motion to authorize the filing of the same statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Lighton Industries, Inc. (\"Lighton\") seeks summary judgment on its claims for declaratory judgment that defendants Allied World National Assurance Company (\"Allied\") and Mt. Hawley Insurance Company (\"Mt. Hawley,\" and together with Allied, \"defendants\") have a duty to defend Lighton and a duty to indemnify Lighton with respect to litigation and potential liability arising from the alleged accident. (Lighton Memorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Lighton Mem.\"), ECF No. 25-1, at 1-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Hibuild Limited Liability Company (\"Hibuild,\" and together with Lighton, \"plaintiffs\") seeks summary judgment that Mt. Hawley has a duty to defend Hibuild in the same litigation, but does not seek summary judgment regarding indemnification, as Hibuild concedes that issue is not ripe. (Hibuild Memorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Hibuild Mem.\"), ECF No. 27-1, at 1 and n.1.) Conversely, defendants seek summary judgment that they do not have any duty\n   to defend or indemnify plaintiffs. (Allied Memorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Allied Mem.\"), ECF No. 23-1, at 1; Mt. Hawley Memorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Mt. Hawley Mem.\"), ECF No. 24-14, at 1-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Additionally, Allied objects to, Mt. Hawley seeks to strike, and Lighton seeks to have the court receive and consider, Lighton's belatedly-filed Amended Local Rule 56.1 Statement of Undisputed Material Facts. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Allied Objection to Lighton Amended 56.1 Statement, ECF No. 50; Mt. Hawley Motion to Strike Lighton Amended 56.1 Statement, ECF No. 51.) Lighton filed this statement with its reply papers, in response to Allied and Mt. Hawley's observations that Lighton's initial Local Rule 56.1 statement did not comply with Local Rule 56.1. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lighton Amended Rule 56.1 Statement, ECF No. 49-1; Allied Rule 56.1 Counter-statement, ECF No. 26-1; Mt.

Plaintiffs and Relevant Third Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   This action relates to a masonry repair project (the \"James Hall Repairs\") at Brooklyn College's William James Hall, a five-story building located at 2900 Bedford Avenue, Brooklyn, New York (\"James Hall\"). (Mt. Hawley Requests for Admission (\"Mt. Hawley RFA\"), Joint Stip. Ex. A, ECF No. 22-1, No. 1, 7-8, 11-12; Lighton Responses to Mt. Hawley RFA (\"Lighton RFA Resp.\"), Joint Stip. Ex.

C ECF No. 22-3, No. 1, 7-8, 11-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Lighton and Hibuild are both construction companies involved in the James Hall Repairs. Specifically, the Dormitory Authority of the State of New York (\"DASNY\") retained Lighton to serve as general contractor for the James Hall Repairs. (Mt. Hawley RFA No. 15; Lighton RFA Resp. No. 15; Hibuild RFA Resp. No. 15.) Lighton, in turn, retained Hibuild to serve as subcontractor and/or project manager. (Mt. Hawley RFA Nos. 16-17 (asserting Hibuild was subcontractor or project manager); Lighton RFA Resp. Nos. 16-17 (admitting Hibuild was subcontractor); Hibuild RFA Resp. Nos. 16-17 (admitting Hibuild was Project Manager).) Additionally, Hibuild retained non-party Rock Scaffolding Corporation (\"Rock\") to serve as a subcontractor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Mt. Hawley RFA No. 18; Lighton RFA Resp. No. 18; Hibuild RFA Resp. Nos. 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The specific contractual arrangements involving DASNY, Lighton, Hibuild, and Rock are as follows: on December 14, 2012, Lighton entered into a construction contract with the Dormitory Authority of the State of New York (\"DASNY\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Contract, Joint Stip. Ex. F, ECF No. 22-6.) The contract referenced a job order and required Lighton to, in relevant part, \"perform the tasks required by each individual Job Order issued pursuant to\" the contract. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.) DASNY subsequently issued a job order on November 5, 2013 calling for Lighton to carry out \"[c]ornice\n   repair\" at James Hall building (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the James Hall Repairs). (Job Order, Joint Stip. Ex. G, ECF No. 22-7, at 002.) More specifically, Lighton was to \"[p]rovide the labor[ ] and equipment to remove and replace the deteriorated areas on ... the James Hall Building on the south, north, and east sides.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 004.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On December 21, 2012, Lighton entered into a subcontracting agreement with Hibuild for the James Hall Repairs. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Subcontracting Agreement, Joint Stip. Ex. H, ECF No. 22-8.) The subcontracting agreement called for Hibuild to \"provide all necessary equipment, material and labor to complete all work as per individual work orders issued under DASNY JOC Contract 173254/CR276\" (Subcontracting Agreement Art. 8), which the DASNY Job Order indicates is the contract between Lighton and DASNY relevant to this action. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Job Order at 002.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Hibuild, in turn, entered into a subcontracting agreement with Rock. The agreement states that it is \"[f]or the following Project: JOB ORDER CONTRACT REGION-1 CONTRACT NO. 173254CR276.\" (Rock-Hibuild Subcontracting Agreement, Joint Stip. Ex. J, ECF No. 22-10, at 1.) Further, pursuant to the agreement between Rock and Hibuild, Rock was to \"[p]rovide all Plant, Labor, Material, Equipment, tools and supervision (English speaking) necessary to perform work outlined in individual Work Order also known as Individual Job Order [sic].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Art. 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The James Hall Repairs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   James Hall is a five-story building with brick pillars lining the exterior walls. (Mt. Hawley RFA Nos. 1, 5, 7-8, 11-12; Lighton RFA Resp. Nos. 1, 5, 7-8, 11-12; Hibuild RFA Resp. Nos. 1, 5, 7-8, 11-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As noted above, the Job Order between DASNY and Lighton for the James Hall Repairs stated that the project involved,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , \"cornice repair\" on the exterior of the building (Job Order, Joint Stip. Ex. G, at 002), but Lighton and Hibuild both deny that the Project actually involved repairs to a cornice on the exterior of James Hall. (Mt. Hawley RFA No. 6; Lighton RFA Resp. No. 6; Hibuild RFA Resp. No. 6.) The parties agree that the James Hall Repairs also involved masonry patching work on the exterior of the building, repointing and/or restoration of the brick pillars on the exterior walls, and the erection of a scaffold that scaled the full height,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   five stories, of the building on at least one of its sides. (Mt. Hawley RFA Nos. 4, 5, 7, 8; Lighton RFA Resp. Nos. 4, 5, 7, 8; Hibuild RFA Resp. Nos. 4, 5, 7, 8.) Notably, the James Hall Repairs involved no interior work. (Mt. Hawley RFA No. 9; Lighton RFA Resp. No. 9; Hibuild RFA Resp. No. 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Insurance Policies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Allied and Mt. Hawley are both insurance companies. Allied issued one insurance\n   policy, and Mt. Hawley issued two insurance policies, relevant to the instant action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Allied Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Allied issued Policy No. 5050-0003 (the \"Allied Policy\") to Lighton for the policy period of April 14, 2014 to April 14, 2015. (Allied Policy, Joint Stip. Ex. RR, ECF No. 22-52.) The Allied Policy includes a coverage limit of $1,000,000 per occurrence and, as well as a $2,000,000 \"General Aggregate Limit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at AW000241.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   By endorsement, the named insured under the Allied Policy was amended to include both Lighton and Lighton Electric, Inc. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at AW000247.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Additionally, the Allied Policy contains an endorsement that creates an exclusion for work by \"uninsured or underinsured subcontractors\" (the \"Subcontractor Exclusion\"). (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at AW000312-13.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Subcontractor Exclusion provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Solely with respect to operations or work performed in the State of New York\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    SECTION I - COVERAGES, COVERAGE A BODILY INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE LIABILITY, 2.

The Mt. Hawley Policies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Mt. Hawley issued two insurance policies to Hibuild that are relevant to the instant action. The first, Commercial General Liability Policy No. MGL0177275 (the \"Mt. Hawley CGL Policy,\" Joint Stip. Ex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   O, ECF No. 22-15), was issued for the period November 19, 2013 to November 19, 2014. The Mt. Hawley CGL Policy, in relevant part, provided coverage for bodily injury liability subject to a $2 million general aggregate limit, $1 million per-occurrence limit, and a $1 million products-completed operations limit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at MH002278.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The second, Excess Liability Policy No. MXL0418432 (the \"Mt. Hawley Excess Policy,\" Joint Stip. Ex. Q, ECF No. 22-25), was issued for the same coverage period. The Mt. Hawley Excess Policy provides that it applies, in relevant part, \"(a) only in excess of the underlying insurance; [and] (b) only after the underlying insurance has been exhausted by payment of the limits of liability of such insurance.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at MH000300.) Its general aggregate limit, per-occurrence limit, and products-completed operations limit are each $2 million. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at MH000297.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     a. The Classification Limitation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Mt. Hawley CGL Policy contains an endorsement setting forth a classification limitation (the \"Classification Limitation\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   which provides that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   [t]his insurance applies only to \"bodily injury,\" \"property damage\" and/or \"personal and advertising injury\" resulting from the Classification or Operations as per application: [Hibuild's] operations as a General Contractor with incidental exterior work not to exceed two stories.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   (Mt. Hawley CGL Policy at MH002299.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The first page of the Mt. Hawley CGL Policy states that Hibuild's classification is \"GC - Interior Renovation\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at MH002278), and Hibuild's application materials made several representations regarding the nature of Hibuild's operations. For instance, in a \"Contractors Supplemental Application,\" Hibuild described its operations as consisting of \"[i]nterior retrofitting.\" (Hibuild Contractors Supplemental Application, Joint Stip. Ex. P(1), ECF No. 22-16, at RSG-000017.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The same document also indicated that Hibuild performed no work over two (2) stories in height from grade (other than interior only),\" and indicated that Hibuild had zero payroll costs or subcontract costs for any work involving \"Exterior Restoration,\" \"Fa\u00e7ade Work,\" \"Masonry,\" \"Plastering,\" or \"Siding/Windows,\" and that all of its work over the coming 12-month period would consist of \"Carpentry,\" \"Electrical,\" \"Maintenance,\" \"Mechanical,\" \"Painting,\" \"Plumbing,\" and \"Supervisory\" work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at RSG-000018-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Hibuild also submitted a Commercial Insurance Application to Mt. Hawley that described Hibuild's business as \"Commercial Contractor - Carpentry\" (Hibuild Commercial Insurance Application, Joint Stip. Ex. P(1) at RSG-000022), and a\n   \"Schedule of Hazards\" in a document titled \"Commercial General Liability Section\" lists only \"GC - Interior Renovation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at RSG 000025.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In responding to Mt. Hawley's requests for admission, Hibuild admitted that the signatures on the \"Commercial Insurance Application\" and \"Contractors' Supplemental Application\" documents annexed to Mt. Hawley's requests for admission\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"appear[ ] to be th[ose] of [Hibuild's] Vice President,\" but otherwise declined to admit or deny the documents' authenticity. (Hibuild RFA Resp., Joint Stip. Ex. C, Nos. 26-27.) Hibuild also stated that it \"has no recollection of ever seeing, submitting, or causing to be submitted\" either document \"in connection with [Hibuild's] 2013 insurance application.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     b. The Designated Ongoing Operations Exclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Mt. Hawley CGL Policy also contains an endorsement setting forth an exclusion for \"Designated Ongoing Operations\" (the \"Designated Ongoing Operations Exclusion\"), which provides that the Mt. Hawley CGL Policy does not apply to \" 'bodily injury' or 'property damage' arising out of the ongoing operations described in the Schedule of th[e] endorsement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at MH002305.) The schedule, in turn, designates \"[e]xterior work/projects above 2 stories\" as ongoing operations within the Designated Ongoing Operations Exclusion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     c. Incorporation into Mt. Hawley Excess Policy\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Mt. Hawley Excess Policy provides that it \"is subject to all of the conditions, agreements, exclusions, and limitations of and shall follow the underlying insurance in all respects ... includ[ing] changes by endorsement.\" (Mt. Hawley Excess Policy at MH000300.) Therefore, the Classification Limitation and the Designated Ongoing Operations Exclusion are incorporated into the Mt. Hawley Excess Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Tunkara Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   On November 3, 2014, Mr. Babalemmeh Tunkara (\"Tunkara\") filed a notice of claim (the \"Notice of Claim,\" Joint Stip. Ex. L, ECF No. 22-12) against DASNY asserting that, while working on James Hall on August 16, 2014 as an employee of Rock, he \"was walking down a ladder from scaffold [sic] and was injured from his fall from said ladder.\" (Notice of Claim at 2.) On October 13, 2015, Tunkara filed a Summons and Verified Complaint (the \"Tunkara Complaint\") in the Supreme Court of New York, Kings County (the \"State Court\"), thereby commencing an action captioned\n   <em>\n    Babalemmeh Tunkara v. Dormitory Auth. of State of N.Y., Lighton Indus., Inc., and Hibuild LLC\n   </em>\n   , and assigned\n   Index Number 12345/2015 (the \"Tunkara Action\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tunkara Action Summons and Verified Complaint, Joint Stip. Ex. M, ECF No. 22-13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In the Tunkara Action, Tunkara alleges that he was injured on August 16, 2014, while the Allied and Mt. Hawley policies were in effect, when he sustained a fall while walking down a ladder from a scaffold in the course of his employment by Rock, while working on the James Hall Repairs. (Mt. Hawley RFA Nos. 1-3; Lighton RFA Resp. Nos. 1-3; Hibuild RFA Resp. Nos. 1-3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Tunkara Action Complaint at \u00b6\u00b6 70-72;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Notice of Claim at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   After commencing the Tunkara Action, and upon a demand by DASNY, Tunkara filed a Verified Bill of Particulars (the \"Bill of Particulars,\" Joint Stip. Ex. N, ECF No. 22-14) with the State Court. According to the Bill of Particulars by Tunkara, the \"subject occurrence took place on August 16, 2014 at approximately 1:00 p.m. ... in front of [James Hall], on the left side, as one is facing the building, at the corner where the side and front of the building meet.\" (Bill of Particulars \u00b6\u00b6 1-2.) Further, the Bill of Particulars asserts that DASNY \"by and through [its] agents ... [was] negligent: in that [it] ... fail[ed] to provide proper and/or adequate ladder and scaffolding for [Tunkara] to climb down from an elevated area\" and \"fail[ed] to properly secure the ladder which plaintiff was using to climb down from an elevated area.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The Notice of Claim, the Tunkara Action Complaint, and the Bill of Particulars are all silent as to (1) the specific floor on which Tunkara was (or to which he was level) at the time of his fall, (2) the nature of the James Hall Repairs, and (3) the extent to which the James Hall Repairs involved exterior work relative to the extent to which it involved interior work. As noted above, however, Lighton and Hibuild admitted in their responses to Mt. Hawley's requests for admission that the James Hall Repairs were entirely comprised of exterior work and involved no interior work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Based on these allegations, the Tunkara Action Complaint asserts claims, in each case against DASNY, Lighton, and Hibuild, for negligence (Tunkara Action Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 1-91), violation of section 200 of the New York Labor Law (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 92-94), violation of section 240(1) of the New York Labor Law (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 95-98), and violation of section 241(6) of the New York Labor Law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 99-102). The Tunkara Action Complaint does not state the amount of damages that Tunkara seeks, but Tunkara's Notice of Claim states that he seeks damages of $2,000,000.

Defense and Indemnification Requests\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In December 2014, after Tunkara filed his Notice of Claim, but before he commenced the Tunkara action, DASNY sent Allied a letter (the \"DASNY Demand Letter\") informing Allied of the Notice of Claim. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DASNY Demand Letter, Joint Stip. Ex. MM, ECF No. 22-47.) The letter is dated December 12, 2014, but it is not clear when Allied received the letter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.) In the letter, DASNY noted that Lighton was Allied's insured, and that Lighton was \"obligated, pursuant to [its] contract [with DASNY] to obtain primary insurance coverage on behalf of DASNY and the City University of New York.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.) DASNY thus demanded that Allied \"assume the defense and agree to indemnify and hold harmless DASNY and the City University of New York ... as additional insureds on the [Allied Policy].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Also in December 2014, after DASNY sent the DASNY Demand Letter to Allied, Rockville Risk Management (\"RRM\"), Allied's third party claim administrator, sent Mt. Hawley a letter on behalf of Lighton seeking defense and indemnification. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RRM Request Letter, Joint Stip. Ex. U, ECF No. 22-29.) The letter is dated December 23, 2014, and is stamped as received as of December 29, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In January 2015, Mt. Hawley sent several letters denying coverage for the Tunkara Claim and citing, in relevant part, the Designated Ongoing Operations Exclusion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   January 7, 2015 Letter, Joint Stip. Ex. S, ECF No. 22-27 (disclaiming coverage to Hibuild, with copies to other party and non-party entities); January 9, 2015 Letter, Joint Stip. Ex.

Hawley has no duty to defend or indemnify Lighton or its indemnities); January 9, 2015 Letter, Joint Stip. Ex. W, ECF No. 22-31 (same).) Each of the letters also expressly reserved all other defenses to coverage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Following Mt. Hawley's denial of coverage, on March 17, 2015, Allied, through RRM, sent a letter to Lighton denying coverage for the Tunkara claim based on the Subcontractor Exclusion. (Allied Claim Denial Letter, Joint Stip. Ex. KK, ECF No. 22-45.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   By letter dated November 23, 2015, after the Tunkara Action was initiated, RRM, on behalf of Lighton, its indemnities (which the letter does not identify), and Allied, sent Mt. Hawley a demand for defense and indemnification in the Tunkara Action. (RRM Demand Letter, Joint Stip. Ex. AA, ECF No. 22-35.) On November 30, 2015, Mt. Hawley responded with an e-mail acknowledging receipt of RRM's tender and stating that \"Mt. Hawley maintains its position as outlined in [its] attached correspondence dated January 8, 2015, and January 9, 2015,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that Mt. Hawley owed no duty to defend or indemnify any party under any policy. (Mt. Hawley Denial E-Mail, Joint Stip. Ex. BB, ECF No. 22-36.) On December 9, 2015, RRM sent Lighton a letter on behalf of Allied denying coverage for the Tunkara Action based on the Subcontractor Exception. (Allied Action Denial Letter, Joint Stip. Ex. LL, ECF No. 22-46.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   These actions followed Allied and Mt. Hawley's denials of coverage. On May 27, 2016, Lighton filed a complaint in New York State Court (the \"\n   <em>\n    Lighton\n   </em>\n   Complaint\") seeking declaratory judgment that Allied and Mt. Hawley have a duty to defend and indemnify it under the Allied Policy and the Mt. Hawley CGL Policy. (\n   <em>\n    See Lighton\n   </em>\n   Complaint, ECF No. 1-2, at 1-2.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Lighton\n   </em>\n   Complaint also asserts a \"bad faith\" claim against Mt. Hawley. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6.) Allied removed the\n   <em>\n    Lighton\n   </em>\n   Action to this court on July 8, 2016, based on\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1446.

Hawley and Atlantic Casualty Insurance Company (\"ACIC\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint (the \"\n   <em>\n    Hibuild\n   </em>\n   Complaint\"), ECF/\n   <em>\n    Hibuild\n   </em>\n   No. 1.) Hibuild voluntarily dismissed ACIC as a defendant, without prejudice, by a notice of dismissal filed and so-ordered in December 2016. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   So-Ordered Notice of Dismissal,\n   ECF/\n   <em>\n    Hibuild\n   </em>\n   No. 17.) The\n   <em>\n    Hibuild\n   </em>\n   Complaint seeks declaratory judgment that Mt. Hawley is required to defend and indemnify Hibuild, Lighton, and DASNY in the Tunkara Action. (\n   <em>\n    Hibuild\n   </em>\n   Complaint at 8.) The\n   <em>\n    Hibuild\n   </em>\n   Complaint also alleges that Mt. Hawley denied coverage in bad faith, and on this basis seeks attorneys' fees and expenses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 51-58.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   On December 14, 2016, Lighton filed a letter agreeing to dismiss its \"bad faith\" claim. (ECF No. 17.) As noted above, on February 2, 2017, Magistrate Judge Gold ordered the\n   <em>\n    Lighton\n   </em>\n   Action and the\n   <em>\n    Hibuild\n   </em>\n   Action consolidated (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Minute Entry, ECF No. 20), and the cases were consolidated the following day. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   February 3, 2017 Docket Notation.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   On May 19, 2017, the court granted the parties leave to file cross-motions for summary judgment and set a briefing schedule. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   May 19, 2017 Minute Entry.) The instant motions for summary judgment were submitted on September 28, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Allied Motion, ECF No. 23; Mt. Hawley Motion, ECF No. 24; Lighton Motion, ECF No. 25; Hibuild Motion, ECF NO. 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In connection with its motion for summary judgment, Lighton served, and eventually filed, a Local Rule 56.1 statement that contains disputed material factual statements, and contains no citations to any admissible evidence, respectively in violation of Local Rules 56.1(a) and 56.1(d). (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Lighton Initial 56.1 Statement, ECF No. 25-2.) Both Allied and Mt. Hawley's Local Rule 56.1 counter-statements objected to Lighton's statement on these bases. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Allied Local Rule 56.1 Counter-statement, ECF No. 26-1; Mt. Hawley Local Rule 56.1 Counter-statement to Lighton, ECF No. 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Lighton also served and filed an Amended Local Rule 56.1 statement in connection with its reply brief. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lighton Amended 56.1 Statement, ECF No. 49-1.) Allied objects to, and Mt. Hawley seeks to strike, Lighton's Amended Local Rule 56.1 statement, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Allied Objection, ECF No. 50; Mt. Hawley Motion to Strike, ECF No. 51), and on October 5, 2017, one week after filing the Amended Local Rule 56.1 statement, Lighton moved to amend its initial statement.

Mt. Hawley's Duty to Defend\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Hibuild seeks summary judgment in its favor solely \"on the issue of Mt. Hawley's duty to defend Hibuild in the Tunkara Action\" (Hibuild Mem. at 10), and expressly concedes that \"the issue of Mt. Hawley's duty to indemnify Hibuild ... is not yet ripe.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1 n.1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hibuild asserts that it is entitled to defense in the Tunkara Action because the action is covered by the Mt. Hawley CGL Policy, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-7), and because Mt. Hawley cannot establish that any exclusion applies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-10.) Lighton, for its part, seeks summary judgment that Mt. Hawley is obligated both to defend\n   and indemnify it as an \"additional insured\" under the Mt. Hawley CGL Policy and the Mt. Hawley Excess Policy. (Lighton Mem. at 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Conversely, Mt. Hawley seeks summary judgment in its favor on the grounds that (i) the Tunkara Action is outside the scope of the Mt. Hawley CGL Policy and the Mt. Hawley Excess Policy by operation of the Classification Limitation, and, in the alternative, (ii) the Designated Ongoing Operations Exclusion excludes the Tunkara Action from Mt. Hawley policies' scope of coverage. (Mt. Hawley Mem. at 9-15.) Additionally, Mt. Hawley asserts that Lighton cannot qualify as an additional insured under the policies at issue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7 n.2, 15-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Policy Language\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Upon a review of the relevant Mt. Hawley-Hibuild policy provisions, specifically the Classification Limitation and the Designated Ongoing Operations Exclusion, in light of the New York law that governs them and the record before the court, the court concludes that both provisions are ambiguous as applied here and are therefore construed against Mt. Hawley.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Classification Limitation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   To reiterate the operative language, the Mt. Hawley CGL Policy's Classification Limitation, which the Mt. Hawley Excess Policy incorporates by reference (Mt. Hawley Excess Policy at MH000300), provides that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n   [t]his insurance applies only to \"bodily injury,\" \"property damage\" and/or \"personal and advertising injury\" resulting from the Classification or Operations as per application: [Hibuild's] operations as a General Contractor with incidental exterior work not to exceed 2 stories.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   (Mt. Hawley CGL Policy at MH002299.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Based on the Classification Limitation and Hibuild's representations to Mt. Hawley in its application paperwork, Mt. Hawley contends that the Mt. Hawley CGL Policy \"clearly provides that any 'exterior work' must be incidental to Hibuild's interior work.\" (Mt. Hawley Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motions (\"Mt. Hawley Opp.\"), ECF No. 30, at 17.) Mt. Hawley further contends that because the James Hall renovation involved no interior work, \"none of the exterior work could have been incidental.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Mt. Hawley Mem. at 11 (\"Hibuild's exterior work was not incidental, as the entirety of the [James Hall] project consisted of interior work.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Mt. Hawley's argument rests on the proposition that in evaluating whether any given \"exterior work above two stories\" is \"incidental,\" the court should look to the specific project for which the relevant work was performed, and not, as Hibuild contends, to Hibuild's overall operations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hibuild Opposition to Mt. Hawley Motion, ECF No. 35, at 10-11 (\"[T]he Mt. Hawley Policy expressly covers ... exterior work up to two stories in height that is 'incidental' to Hibuild's 'operations as a General Contractor.' \" (emphasis and citations omitted).) As the insurer seeking to deny coverage, Mt. Hawley must demonstrate that its interpretation is correct, the Classification Limitation is \"subject to no other reasonable interpretation,\"\n   <em>\n    Pioneer Tower\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3736291\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/12/302/\">\n    880 N.Y.S.2d 885\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3736291\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/12/302/\">\n    908 N.E.2d at 877\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted), and that Hibuild's contention that the court should look to Hibuild's overall operations is not consistent with the \"reasonable expectations of a businessperson.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Parks Real Estate\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5197826\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/472/33/#p42\">\n    472 F.3d at 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that insurance policies are \"read in light of ... the reasonable expectations of a businessperson.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Mt. Hawley, however, cites to no contractual provision, evidence in the record, or applicable law establishing that, in determining whether work is \"incidental\" within the meaning of the Classification Limitation, the court must look to the\n   specific project in which that work arises, instead of the insured's overall operations. Looking first to the relevant contractual language, Mt. Hawley contends that \"incidental\" should be accorded its plain and ordinary meaning, which is \"subordinate to something of greater importance.\" (Mt. Hawley Mem. at 11 (citation omitted); Mt. Hawley Opp. at 18 (citation omitted).) The court agrees with Mt. Hawley's interpretation of the word \"incidental,\" but this interpretation sheds no light on whether Hibuild's operations, or only its specific projects are the \"[ ]thing[s] of greater importance\" to which exterior work may be \"subordinate\" within the meaning of the Classification Limitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Comparing the Classification Limitation with the policy language from which Mt. Hawley draws its interpretation of the term \"incidental\" puts into stark relief the lack of clear direction in the Mt. Hawley CGL Policy's Classification Limitation. In Mt. Hawley's cited case,\n   <em>\n    Lend Lease (US) Construction LMB Inc. v. Zurich American Insurance Company\n   </em>\n   , the policy at issue was for a specific project and \"insure[d] against all risks of direct physical loss of or damage to,\" in relevant part, \"temporary buildings or structures ... all incidental\n   <em>\n    to the project.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4104483\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/136/52/\">\n    136 A.D.3d 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4104483\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/136/52/\">\n    22 N.Y.S.3d 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 27 (2015) (emphasis added),\n   <em>\n    aff'd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12281701\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/28/675/\">\n    28 N.Y.3d 675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12281701\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/28/675/\">\n    49 N.Y.S.3d 65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12281701\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/28/675/\">\n    71 N.E.3d 556\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). Thus, the\n   <em>\n    Lend Lease\n   </em>\n   policy unambiguously set forth a reference point against which the \"incidental\" character of \"temporary buildings or structures\" must be determined. Here, however, the Classification Limitation sets forth no analogous reference point for \"exterior work not to exceed two stories.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Further, Hibuild's proposed reading of the Classification Limitation is consistent with principles of contract interpretation. The Second Circuit has noted that, in interpreting written instruments, courts \"often interpret a word by the 'company it keeps (the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    noscitur a sociis\n   </em>\n   ).' \"\n   <em>\n    Rothstein v.

Here, the word \"incidental\" keeps company with Hibuild's \"operations,\" but not \"projects.\" Thus, Hibuild's proposed reading, unlike Mt. Hawley's, relies on the words actually used in the Classification Limitation and does not require that the court look to concepts and terms that are wholly absent from the Classification Limitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Moreover, Mt. Hawley's extrinsic evidence and remaining arguments do not provide a sufficient basis to conclude that Hibuild's reading of the Classification Limitation is not reasonable. In support of its own reading of the Classification Limitation, Mt. Hawley relies on representations by Hibuild in its insurance application materials. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mt. Hawley Reply, ECF No. 34, at 2 (\"Mt. Hawley's references to Hibuild's own prior representations [are] offered only to rebut Lighton's and Hibuild's incorrect arguments that the language at issue should be interpreted otherwise.\"). For instance, Mt. Hawley asserts that Hibuild represented that it \"is an interior contractor that performed no exterior renovation, fa\u00e7ade work, or masonry,\" and suggests that that Hibuild therefore \"could not have reasonably had any expectation of coverage\" for the James Hall Repairs. (Mt. Hawley Mem. at 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Even under Mt. Hawley's reading of the Classification Limitation, however, so long as a given instance of exterior renovation, fa\u00e7ade work, and/or masonry were to remain incidental to an interior project, Hibuild would be covered. Thus, Mt. Hawley's\n   own interpretation of the Classification Limitation establishes that Hibuild could reasonably expect coverage for at least certain exterior renovation, fa\u00e7ade work, and/or masonry. Moreover, Hibuild's representations regarding the types of exterior work it performed in its overall operations shed no light on whether the \"incidental\" nature of a particular instance of exterior work should be determined with reference to Hibuild's overall operations, or the project on which Hibuild performed the relevant work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Mt. Hawley also asserts, albeit in discussing the Designated Ongoing Operations Exclusion, that exterior work is riskier and therefore commands higher premiums. (Mt. Hawley Mem. at 13-14.) Once again, however, Mt. Hawley concedes that certain \"incidental\" exterior work is covered. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mt. Hawley Opp. at 17 (asserting that, to be covered, \"any 'exterior work' must be incidental to Hibuild's interior work\").) Therefore, Mt. Hawley necessarily concedes that the premiums Mt. Hawley accepted from Hibuild took into account the added risk from incidental exterior work. Additionally, both Mt. Hawley and Hibuild's proposed readings limit Mt. Hawley's exposure to risk and potential liability arising from purportedly higher-risk exterior work, which Mt. Hawley suggests is the purpose of the Classification Limitation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mt. Hawley Opp. at 17 n.5 (\"[T]he [C]lassification [L]imitation was placed on the Mt. Hawley policy in direct response to Hibuild's representations in its application.\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   As the instant action demonstrates, Hibuild's proposed interpretation of the Classification Limitation may not limit Mt. Hawley's exposure as much as Mt. Hawley would prefer. Hibuild's proposed interpretation nevertheless unquestionably accomplishes the overall purpose of the Classification Limitation, and consequently, Mt. Hawley's suggestions regarding the purpose of the Classification Limitation do not suffice to establish that Hibuild's reading of the Classification Limitation is not a \"reasonable interpretation\" of the relevant contractual language, which is the standard Mt. Hawley must meet.\n   <em>\n    Pioneer Tower\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3736291\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/12/302/\">\n    880 N.Y.S.2d 885\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3736291\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/12/302/\">\n    908 N.E.2d at 877\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). Consequently, Mt. Hawley's arguments regarding risks, premiums and the purpose of the Classification Limitation do not establish the unreasonableness of Hibuild's position regarding the reference point that the court should use to determine whether particular exterior work is \"incidental.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Hibuild's application materials, which the Classification Limitation expressly references, do not clarify whether the court should look to the particular project on which Hibuild performed work or to Hibuild's operations as a whole in determining whether the particular \"exterior work\" in this case was \"incidental.\" Nor do Mt. Hawley's arguments regarding the purpose of the Classification Limitation or the relative risks of interior and exterior work establish that Hibuild's interpretation of the Classification Limitation is incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Accordingly, the court concludes that the Classification Limitation is ambiguous insofar as it does not clearly establish what the court should reference in determining whether a particular instance of exterior work is \"incidental.\" As New York law requires, the court will resolve this ambiguity against Mt. Hawley, \"the insurer which drafted the contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Home Indemnity\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=495%20N.Y.S.2d%20969\">\n    495 N.Y.S.2d 969\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=486%20N.E.2d%20827\">\n    486 N.E.2d at 829\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the court concludes that the \"incidental\" nature of exterior work must be determined with reference to Hibuild's operations as a whole. Under that interpretation, Mt. Hawley has not established that the Mt. Hawley CGL Policy and the Mt. Hawley Excess Policy do not cover the\n   Tunkara Action based on the Classification Limitation, as the only evidence in the record regarding Hibuild's overall operations indicates that the overwhelming majority of Hibuild's operations are interior.

Webster's Dictionary defines \"work\" similarly: it is \"activity in which one exerts strength or faculties to do or perform\n   ... sustained physical or mental effort valued as it overcomes obstacles and achieves an objective or result,\" and/or \"the labor, task, or duty that affords one his accustomed means of livelihood.\" Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged (2002) (\"Webster's Unabridged\") at 2634.

As discussed above, the Tunkara Action complaint and the Bill of Particulars are wholly silent as to the story or stories of James Hall on which Tunkara was performing work at any time relevant to his alleged fall that gave rise to his action, and no other information before the court sheds light on the matter. The Tunkara Complaint and Bill of Particulars are also wholly silent as to what work, if any, by Tunkara could be relevant to Tunkara's alleged fall. Therefore, there is no basis in the record to conclude that any \"work\" above two stories was a \"but for\" cause of Tunkara's alleged fall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   As an illustrative example, the record before the court leaves open the possibility that Tunkara's alleged accident could have arisen from Tunkara climbing a ladder to hang a sign on the higher portions of ground-level scaffolding. Under this set of circumstances, Tunkara's alleged accident would be wholly disconnected from any work above two stories by Tunkara or any other person, and would therefore not \"arise out of\" exterior work above two stories. The court concludes that Mt. Hawley, which has the burden of establishing that the Tunkara Action falls within the Designated Ongoing Operations Exclusion, has not established that the Tunkara Action arises out of \"work\" above two stories.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Critically, the terms \"work\" and \"projects\" as they appear in the Designated Ongoing Operations Exclusion are separated by a virgule, also referred to as a forward slash, and the virgule's meaning is dispositive of whether Tunkara's alleged injury falls within the Designated Ongoing Operations Exclusion. If the virgule means \"or,\" or \"and/or,\" then the Designated Ongoing Operations Exclusion applies where bodily injury arises out of an exterior \"project\" above two stories regardless of whether the bodily arises from exterior \"work.\" If, however, the virgule means \"and,\" then bodily injury must arise from\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   an exterior \"project\" and exterior \"work,\" in each case above two stories.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Here, no party has expressly stated how it believes the virgule should be interpreted. The court notes that Mt. Hawley argues that the precise floor on which Tunkara\n   was located at the time of his accident is \"immaterial because the project was a five-story exterior restoration\" (Mt. Hawley Opp. at 8), thus reading the virgule as \"or\" or \"and/or.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Nothing in the Mt. Hawley CGL Policy clearly supports, much less compels, Mt. Hawley's interpretation, or any other reading of the virgule. Further, the limited authority that exists regarding the meaning of a virgule does not establish a clear meaning.

Notably, the Appellate Division observed that the 1986 edition of Webster's Third New International Dictionary (Unabridged) defines \"virgule\" as \"a symbol used to denote,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , \"or\" or \"and or.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 73 (citation omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Appellate Division concluded that \"[e]ven defined in this way, the virgule allows for usage as 'and', resulting in no contradiction when both alternatives apply.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   The Appellate Division noted that still another dictionary provides a \"more comprehensive[ ]\" definition of \"virgule,\" specifically \"a short oblique stroke (/) between two words indicating that whichever is appropriate may be chosen to complete the sense of the text in which they occur.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Random House Dictionary of the English Language (Unabridged) (2d ed. 1993) at 2125). In light of this definition, the Appellate Division considered the relevant regulation as a whole (as opposed to only the phrase at issue), as well as the overall regulatory scheme, and concluded that the Department's interpretation of the regulation,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , as an \"and,\" \"ha[d] a rational basis.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 73-74.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Further, a Second Circuit partial concurrence notes that, according to a different version of Webster's from that cited in\n   <em>\n    Elcor\n   </em>\n   (specifically, the Third Edition of Webster's New World Dictionary, published in 1986), a virgule is used between two words to show that either meaning is applicable.\n   <em>\n    Matusick v.

Specifically, the concurring opinion observed that in argument to the jury before the district court, and in briefing to the Second Circuit, plaintiff-appellee's counsel had conflated the status of the plaintiff-appellee's relationship with his significant other, which was a \"critical fact supporting [his] constitutional claim of intimate association.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4125600\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/757/31/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 72 and 72 n.5.

The Appellate Division, First Department, however, has concluded that where a plaintiff drafted a check and used \"what might be interpreted as a virgule in addition to the word 'and' between payees,\" the check was ambiguous on its face, payable jointly, and required both payees' endorsements.\n   <em>\n    C.H.

Mt. Hawley notes that the Designated Ongoing Operations Exclusion reflects \"the balance of risks and benefits the parties achieved\" in negotiating coverage (Mt. Hawley Mem. at 14), and that Mt. Hawley sought to limit its exposure to risks associated with certain exterior work (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15), but construing the virgule as an \"and\" would still effect a reduction in exposure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   As previously noted, longstanding case law holds that ambiguities must be construed against the insurer. Certainly Mt. Hawley, as an insurer, would now\n   <em>\n    prefer\n   </em>\n   that the policy be read more narrowly, specifically by reading the virgule to mean \"or,\" and may have intended the virgule to mean \"or.\" Based on the record before the court, however, the court concludes that the virgule is ambiguous, and particularly because the virgule arises in an exclusion, New York law requires that it be construed against Mt. Hawley.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Home Indemnity\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=495%20N.Y.S.2d%20969\">\n    495 N.Y.S.2d 969\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=486%20N.E.2d%20827\">\n    486 N.E.2d at 829\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he ambiguity must be resolved against the insurer which drafted the contract.\" (citation omitted) );\n   <em>\n    Sylvan Beach\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7412214\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/55/114/#p115\">\n    55 F.3d at 115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[I]f the policy language is ambiguous, particularly the language of an exclusion provision, the ambiguity must be interpreted in favor of the insured.\" (citation omitted) ). Based on the foregoing, the court construes the virgule to mean \"and.\" Thus, to fall within the Designated Ongoing Operations Exclusion, bodily injury must arise out of both exterior work and an exterior project, in each case above two stories.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   Accordingly, the court concludes that Mt. Hawley has not established that the claims asserted in the Tunkara Action fall within the Designated Ongoing Operations Exclusion. As set forth above, the claims asserted in the Tunkara Action certainly arise out of an exterior project above two stories, but the court cannot conclude that\n   it arises from exterior work above two stories.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Application to Hibuild's Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Because the court must construe the ambiguities in the Classification Limitation and the Designated Ongoing Operations Exclusion against Mt.

Hawley asserts that Lighton is not an additional insured, but does not explain the basis for this contention. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mt.

Hawley CGL Policy at MH002311.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   The Mt. Hawley Excess Policy provides that \"[t]he word 'insured' means any person or organization qualifying as an insured person under the terms of the underlying insurance,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   the Mt. Hawley CGL Policy. (Mt. Hawley Excess Policy, Joint Stip. Ex. Q, ECF No. 22-25, at MH000300;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Mt. Hawley Excess Policy at MH000299 (identifying underlying insurance).) It further provides that, in relevant part, \"[s]ubject to the other provisions of this policy, [Mt. Hawley] will pay on behalf of the insured the insured's ultimate net loss if such loss results from an occurrence insured by the underlying insurance.\" (Mt. Hawley Excess Policy at MH 000300.) Thus, if a party is an additional insured under the Mt. Hawley CGL Policy, it will also have insurance under the Mt. Hawley Excess Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   Here, Mt. Hawley concedes that \"[i]t is undisputed that the December 21, 2012 Lighton-Hibuild 'Standard Form of Agreement Between Contractor and Subcontractor' requires Hibuild to procure,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , liability coverage with limits of at least $2 million and to make Lighton an additional insured on Hibuild's commercial liability insurance policy.\" (Mt. Hawley Local Rule 56.1 Counter Statement to Lighton, ECF No. 28, \u00b6 5(a) (citation omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Subcontracting Agreement, Joint Stip. Ex. H, ECF No. 22-8 \u00a7 13.1 (requiring, in relevant part, that Hibuild obtain insurance that names Lighton as an additional insured).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   Accordingly, Lighton is an additional insured under the Mt. Hawley CGL Policy and the Mt. Hawley Excess Policy by operation of the Additional Insured Endorsement, and Mt. Hawley owes Lighton a duty to defend the Tunkara Action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Muss Development\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%206160240\">\n    2015 WL 6160240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5-7 (finding in favor of party claiming additional insured status under substantially similar contractual provision where contractual requirements for additional insured status were satisfied). Consequently, as to Lighton's claim for a declaration that Mt. Hawley owes it a duty of defense in the Tunkara Action, Lighton's motion for summary judgment is granted, and Mt. Hawley's motion for summary judgment is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Allied's Duty to Defend\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   Allied's argument that it has no duty to defend or indemnify any party rests entirely on its contention that coverage under the Mt. Hawley policies is lacking, and therefore the Subcontractor Exclusion of the Allied-Lighton policy is triggered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Allied Mem. at 7-11; Allied Reply, ECF No. 36, at 4-6.) Notably, Allied concedes that the Mt. Hawley policies, if applicable, satisfy the coverage limitations requirements set forth in the Subcontractor Exclusion. (Allied Mem. at 9 (\"[T]he [Mt. Hawley] policies had the required limits.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   (citing Allied Rule 56.1 Statement, ECF No. 23-2, \u00b6\u00b6 16, 18) ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   Further, Lighton's assertion that Allied is obligated to defend it is based on Lighton's contention that Mt. Hawley is obligated to defend the Tunkara Action. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lighton Mem. at 23-25; Lighton Reply, ECF No. 49, at 12-13 (asserting that Mt. Hawley's denial was wrongful, and Allied is therefore obligated to defend) ). Thus, summary judgment as to Allied turns on whether Mt. Hawley has a duty to defend Hibuild.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   As set forth above, the court has concluded that Mt. Hawley owes Hibuild a duty to defend because Mt. Hawley has not established that the claims asserted in the Tunkara Action fall outside the scope of coverage. Accordingly, Allied cannot establish that the claims asserted in the Tunkara Action fall outside the scope of the Allied Policy, and Allied owes Lighton a duty to defend the Tunkara Action. Therefore, as to Lighton's claim for a declaration that Allied owes it a duty of defense in the Tunkara Action, Lighton's motion for summary judgment is granted, and Allied's motion for summary judgment is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Indemnification\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   As noted above, Hibuild does not seek summary judgment regarding Mt. Hawley's duty to indemnify, and concedes that the issue is not ripe for adjudication. (Hibuild Mem. at 1 n.1.) All other parties in these consolidated actions (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Lighton, Allied, and Mt. Hawley), however, have moved for summary judgment as to indemnification. No party, however, has established that it is entitled to summary judgment on the issue of indemnification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   As the parties made clear on the record when the court held oral argument on the instant motions, the Tunkara Action has not yet resulted in a determination that either plaintiff here is liable to Tunkara. At this time, there is no liability for which defendants could indemnify plaintiffs Lighton or Hibuild. Additionally, the record is unclear as to the story of James Hall on which Tunkara was working at the time of his alleged injuries, and as to the existence and nature of any other exterior work that may be connected to Tunkara's alleged accident. This lack of clarity resulted, in part, in the court's finding that defendants must defend plaintiffs as set forth herein. This lack of clarity also prevents any party from establishing that a duty to indemnify does or does not exist. Accordingly, no party has established that undisputed material facts entitle it to judgment as a matter of law on the issue of indemnification, and the motions for summary judgment by Lighton, Allied, and Mt. Hawley as to indemnification must be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   Further, the Second Circuit has concluded that \"[w]here ...
