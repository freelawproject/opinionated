The Commission determined that market participants generally reported that the U.S. tire market was divided into three tiers reflecting trade-off and performance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   USITC Pub. 4673 at 24-25. According to the Commission's investigation, half of the responding producers (three of six) and the majority of importers (thirty-one of thirty-five) and purchasers (fourteen of eighteen) reported that bus tires were sold in tiers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at II-16. The record shows that a vast majority of U.S. producers reported only selling products in tiers one, two, and three, whereas importers reported selling a majority of their tires in the third tier.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   The Commission provided substantial evidence that there is broad recognition of three distinct tiers in the market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Commission also provided sufficient evidence that eleven of the fifteen responding purchasers perceived competition between different tiers of truck and bus tires.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   USITC Pub. 4673 at II-16.
