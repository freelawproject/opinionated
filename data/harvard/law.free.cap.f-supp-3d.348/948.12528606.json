After the hearing the Court ordered supplemental briefing, which has been completed. For the reasons set forth below, the Court GRANTS plaintiff's motion and DENIES defendants' motion. No later than\n   <strong>\n    November 15, 2018\n   </strong>\n   , the parties shall: (1) meet and confer and file a proposed order regarding appropriate injunctive relief; (2) file a joint letter stating the parties' views on what further proceedings, if any, are necessary in this case; and (3) file a proposed judgment if appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff MetroPCS brings this action for declaratory and injunctive relief seeking to\n   declare unlawful, and enjoin enforcement of, three resolutions passed by the California Public Utilities Commission (\"CPUC\"), Resolution T-17542, Resolution T-17568 and Resolution T-17579 (\"the Contested Resolutions\"). The Contested Resolutions implement California's Prepaid Mobile Telephony Service Surcharge Collection Act (the \"Prepaid Collection Act\" or \"the Act\") and require that end consumers of prepaid wireless telephony service packages pay a surcharge (the \"prepaid MTS surcharge\") that is a percentage of the sales price of each retail transaction that occurs in California. The surcharge is used to fund,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , California's universal service fund and certain CPUC fees. MetroPCS contends that the CPUC's portion of the surcharge impermissibly assesses interstate revenues, including revenues attributable to interstate voice service and broadband data service, and that the imposition of a surcharge on these interstate services directly conflicts with federal law, including the Communications Act of 1934, various orders of the Federal Communications Commission (\"FCC\"), the Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act of 2000, and the United States Constitution's dormant Commerce Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendants are the Commissioners of the CPUC. Defendants contend that the CPUC's portion of the surcharge does not conflict with federal law because in calculating the amount of the surcharge, the CPUC adopted an \"intrastate allocation factor\" that has the effect of removing interstate and international charges from the surcharge base. The CPUC also contends that the methodology it has imposed is required by the plain language of the Prepaid Collection Act, which requires that \"if prepaid mobile telephony services are sold in combination with mobile data services or any other services or products for a single price, then the prepaid MTS surcharge and local charges shall apply to the entire price.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2042018\">\n    Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code \u00a7 42018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The CPUC argues that the surcharge, which contains the interstate allocation factor, is the only way that that the prepaid MTS surcharge can be \"appl[ied] to the entire price.\" The CPUC also contends that MetroPCS is judicially estopped from challenging the MTS surcharge because MetroPCS previously advocated that the CPUC adopt the surcharge and interstate allocation factor methodology. Both parties move for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Federal Communications Act requires every telecommunications carrier that provides interstate telecommunications services to contribute to the federal universal service fund (\"USF\").\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20254\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f).

Prior to the passage of the Prepaid Collection Act, California required all telecommunications carriers in the state to collect universal service surcharges from their end users. Under that system, the universal service surcharges and other fees (such as a 9-1-1 surcharge to fund California's 9-1-1 emergency response system) were included on a customer's bill, and the carrier would collect those surcharges and fees and then remit those monies to the agency imposing the fee or the tax.

However, because many prepaid wireless consumers do not have a contractual relationship with a carrier, \"the surcharges [were] essentially built into the purchase price\" and carriers were responsible for remitting the surcharges. Cal. Senate Appropriations Comm., Legislative Analysis of AB 1717, at 6 (Aug. 11, 2014), Koltz Decl. Ex. 5 (Dkt. No. 73-6).

Henry T. Perea, California State Assembly (Apr. 14, 2014), Koltz Decl., Ex. 6 (Dkt. No. 73-7). In a letter dated April 14, 2014 to Assemblyman Henry Perea, a group representing the wireless industry wrote,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The state's current system for collecting taxes and fees is based on carriers having a contractual relationship with customers and collecting those taxes and fees on a monthly bill. These consumers pay 911 fees that help fund the network costs associated with the delivery of wireless 911 services. They also pay state-imposed fees to fund telephone service for low-income households, broadband for underserved areas and more, and local government services such as police, fire, parks and libraries through local utility user taxes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   However, today a growing number of customers choose to purchase wireless minutes on prepaid cards. While this provides benefits and flexibility to the consumer, it has created a problem with collection of existing taxes and fees on wireless services. Most prepaid wireless cards are purchased in third party retail outlets and are paid for in full before the consumer uses the service. Wireless carriers do not generally have an ongoing billing relationship with prepaid customers and are, therefore, unable to collect the same taxes and fees from prepaid customers that they collect from other customers on monthly bills.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   AB 1717 would modernize California's system of collecting existing taxes and fees to reflect new technologies, new business models and consumer choices. The bill establishes a statewide retail point-of-sale mechanism for collecting taxes and fees from prepaid wireless consumers.

CPUC's 2016 Resolution, Resolution T-17504\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On November 23, 2015, the CPUC issued Resolution T-17504 (the \"2016 Resolution\"), in which the CPUC first implemented the Prepaid Collection Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Karanjia Decl., Ex. 1 (Dkt.

The 2016 Resolution required prepaid wireless carriers to assess the Prepaid MTS Surcharge \"on prepaid wireless telephone service\n   <em>\n    intrastate\n   </em>\n   revenues subject to surcharge and collected from end-users in California.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2042010\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2042010\">\n    at 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

In those comments, the Joint Wireless Carriers raised concerns about the CPUC's draft resolution, which proposed assessing surcharges only on intrastate revenues. The Joint Wireless Carriers recommended that the CPUC utilize an \"alternate approach\" for the assessment of the prepaid MTS surcharge:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   The new law requires the Commission to aggregate its Public Policy Program surcharges and its reimbursement/user fee into a single rate so that it can be incorporated by the BOE with the Emergency Telephone Users surcharge and local taxes into a single surcharge to be assessed on prepaid wireless consumers. As noted above, the Commission-related charges are only to be assessed on the intrastate revenue associated with these consumers. The Proposed Resolution currently appears to rely on the carriers to adjust their collections and remittances to account for intrastate revenue, which is how wireless revenues are currently adjusted with respect to mandatory surcharges and fees. The Joint Wireless Carriers suggest an alternate approach for the prepaid MTS Surcharge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   In particular, the Joint Wireless Carriers recommend that the Commission, through the Resolution, adjust its portion of the MTS Surcharge to account for the fact that it applies only to intrastate revenue. In order words, take the rate of the aggregated Commission surcharges and fees (e.g., 8.07%), multiply it by a reasonable estimate of the intrastate portion of prepaid revenues (e.g., a weighted average of the major carriers' intrastate traffic factors), and then post that adjusted rate with the [Board of Equalization]. This adjustment would have the effect of removing interstate and international charges from the surcharge base. This alternative approach provides a number of advantages for all the stakeholders including, but not limited to, the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   \u2022 Consumer clarity - consumers will be able to more easily identify the amount of surcharges and fees they are required to pay for the Commission programs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \u2022 Equitable charges - consumers will be subject to the same MTS surcharge regardless of whether they purchase prepaid wireless services directly from a wireless provider or from a third party retailer.[ ]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \u2022 Simpler audits - the Commission will be able to more readily audit the collection and remittance of these charges since the MTS surcharge amounts collected from consumers will match the adjusted rates. Carriers would not adjust their reported intrastate revenue figures under this approach, as the rate adjustment already removes the portion of the revenue which is attributable to interstate and international traffic.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Wireless Industry Comments on Draft Resolution T-17504, Oct. 26, 2015, at 3-4 (internal footnotes omitted), Karanjia Decl., Ex. 31 (Dkt. No. 63-32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The CPUC responded to those comments and provided the following explanation\n   of why it was not adopting the Joint Wireless Carriers' proposal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   The Commission finds the methodology proposed in the Resolution to be more reasonable and more consistent with the operating statutes than the Joint Wireless Carriers' alternate approach. The Joint Wireless Carriers' alternate approach is unnecessarily complex and may inappropriately assess surcharges and fees on interstate, international and other revenues and services not subject to the Commission's or other State surcharges.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Currently, carriers assess surcharges only on those intrastate revenues subject to surcharge, regardless of whether the revenues derive from prepaid, postpaid, wireline, or wireless service. Consistent with this practice, the Act directs the Commission to do so for the \"reimbursement fee or universal service surcharge ... on both postpaid and prepaid intrastate service.\" We therefore calculated the MTS surcharge to be applied only to intrastate service revenues. The Act further supports the adoption of a rate that is only applied to intrastate services in it requiring that, \"a prepaid MTS provider or direct seller shall report the intrastate revenue portion subject to the reimbursement fee and the telecommunications universal surcharges.\" We therefore do not find it consistent with the Act to calculate a prepaid MTS surcharge rate that would not be limited to intrastate prepaid wireless service revenue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Karanjia Decl. Ex. 1 at 13-14 (internal footnote omitted) (Dkt.

No. 63-3). In this Resolution, the CPUC adopted the intrastate allocation factor that is challenged in this lawsuit. The CPUC stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   In an effort to ensure that all customers purchasing prepaid wireless telephone services are assessed the MTS surcharge in an equitable manner, the Commission has modified the MTS rates for 2017. For 2017, the MTS surcharge is to be assessed on the total sales price rather than only the intrastate portion, as the rate has now been pre-adjusted by an intrastate allocation factor. Therefore, regardless of the purchase method, location, or seller type, the customer will pay one universal rate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2042010\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2042010\">\n    at 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The CPUC also explained why it declined to adopt the proposal, advanced by the Joint Carriers, to make the intrastate allocation factor an optional \"safe harbor\" that the carrier could elect to use:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Because our goal is to ensure all prepaid wireless customers are treated equally and assessed the MTS surcharge in the same manner, we do not authorize the use of the intrastate factor as an optional \"safe harbor\" only for direct sellers. The intrastate factor has been applied to assure that all prepaid wireless customers are assessed the MTS surcharge equally regardless of where they purchase their prepaid wireless service(s). As the Act requires, the MTS Surcharge is to be calculated and adjusted so that it can be applied to the total sales price. Indeed, Joint Carriers agree that the adoption of an intrastate factor in calculating the MTS Surcharge rate is consistent with the Act, in that \"adjusting the surcharge rate by an intrastate factor\n   promotes the equitable treatment of wireless consumers regardless of whether they purchase prepaid services from direct or indirect sellers and regardless of whether they are prepaid or postpaid consumers.\" Allowing carriers the option to potentially assess an amount for the MTS surcharge that is greater than or less than the amount being assessed on all other customers of indirect sellers would be inconsistent with the Act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2042010\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2042010\">\n    at 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal footnotes omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   On January 24, 2017, MetroPCS and T-Mobile asked the CPUC to modify Resolution T-17542, again requesting that the intrastate allocation factor be optional for direct sellers rather than mandatory.

MetroPCS argues,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that its positions are not clearly inconsistent because it previously advocated the use of a \"reasonable\" estimate of the intrastate portion of prepaid revenues, including for example a \"weighted average of the major carriers' intrastate traffic factors.\" Karanjia Decl. Ex. 31 at 3 (Dkt. No. 63-4). MetroPCS argues that the CPUC did not use a reasonable estimate, nor did it use a weighted average. MetroPCS also argues that the CPUC neither relied on nor accepted the October 2015 advocacy because the CPUC did not adopt the Prepaid MTS Surcharge in response to that advocacy; instead, the CPUC rejected the carriers' arguments and did not adopt the Prepaid MTS Surcharge until the following year. MetroPCS also emphasizes that it argued in 2016 and 2017 that the intrastate allocation factor should be an optional safe harbor for direct sellers, and not a \"one-size-fits-all\" charge applied to both direct and indirect sales.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Court concludes that it is not appropriate to apply the doctrine of judicial estoppel as a bar to MetroPCS's claims. The Court agrees with MetroPCS that its current and prior positions are not clearly inconsistent because MetroPCS previously advocated that the CPUC adopt a \"reasonable\" intrastate allocation factor and MetroPCS now contends that the CPUC's methodology is not reasonable, and MetroPCS did previously (although not consistently) argue for an optional safe harbor in addition to the usage of an intrastate allocation factor. The Court also notes that both the CPUC and MetroPCS have asserted positions that have evolved over time, and that these changing views are not surprising given the complexities of regulating a rapidly changing telecommunications industry and the fact that the usage of an intrastate allocation factor is an apparently novel approach to making jurisdictional assignments of prepaid revenues.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under these circumstances, the Court finds that it would not be appropriate to apply the doctrine of judicial estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Therefore, to avoid a conflict with the Commission's rules, a state imposing universal service contribution obligations on interconnected VoIP providers must allow those providers to treat as intrastate for state universal service purposes the same revenues that they treat at intrastate under the Commission's universal service contribution rules. This will ensure that state contribution requirements will not be imposed on the same revenue on which an interconnected VoIP provider\n   is basing its calculation of federal contributions. To the extent a state fails to comply with this limitation in the future, it may be subject to preemption consistent with the prospective Declaratory Ruling we issue today.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20FCC%20Rcd%2015651\">\n    25 FCC Rcd. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   15658 \u00b6 17 (internal footnotes omitted).

Taken together, the three FCC orders discussed above stand for the proposition\n   that wireless carriers have several options when allocating their interstate and intrastate revenues for federal USF assessments, and that the states may not adopt methodologies that are inconsistent with the federal rules. By using the intrastate allocation factor as the sole method for assessing the CPUC fees, the CPUC has deprived carriers of the ability to rely on alternative allocation methodologies, such as their actual revenue data. As the FCC stated in the\n   <em>\n    Universal Service Declaratory Ruling\n   </em>\n   , \"state universal service contribution requirements do not conflict with federal rules to the extent that states calculate the amount of their universal service assessments in a manner that is consistent with the rules adopted in the\n   <em>\n    Interim Contribution Methodology Order.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20FCC%20Rcd%2015651\">\n    25 FCC Rcd. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   15658 \u00b6 17.

In order to reach the result that MetroPCS advocates, the Court would be required to sever multiple provisions of the statute relating to the CPUC's calculation of the surcharge based upon the \"entire price\" of the retail transaction, and either sever or rewrite provisions that require the surcharge to be \"collected by a seller,\" that direct that the \"posted combined rate shall be the rate that applies to all retail transactions,\" and that \"[a] direct seller must utilize the rate....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Further, the Court finds it significant that the California Legislature considered allowing direct sellers to continue assessing and remitting an individualized, carrier-specific surcharge, and the Legislature declined to do so. Finally, the Court notes that both the CPUC and the CDTFA, the state agencies charged with implementing and administering the Prepaid Collection Act, have taken the position that the Prepaid Collection Act requires the use of an intrastate allocation factor to be applied to all sales of prepaid telephony services in California.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Accordingly, the Court declares that the Prepaid Collection Act and the Contested Resolutions conflict with federal law and are therefore preempted and unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   For the foregoing reasons and for good cause shown, the Court hereby GRANTS plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and DENIES defendants' motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   No later than\n   <strong>\n    November 15, 2018,\n   </strong>\n   the parties are directed to meet and confer and submit a proposed order (or competing\n   orders, if the parties cannot agree) regarding the appropriate injunctive relief.

Because direct sellers complete the calls as wireless service providers, they have data that shows the intrastate versus interstate share.
