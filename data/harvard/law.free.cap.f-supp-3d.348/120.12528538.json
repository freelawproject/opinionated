(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1, Compl.) On February 8, 2018, after a pretrial conference, plaintiff amended the complaint. (ECF No. 26, Am. Compl.) On April 9, 2018, defendant filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 12(b)(6) on the bases that (1) plaintiff's state law claims related to Atkin Nutritionals' quantitative Net Carbs claims and calculation method are preempted by federal law, (2) plaintiff's claims should be dismissed pursuant to the primary jurisdiction doctrine, (3) plaintiff' claims should be dismissed for failure to satisfy the pleading requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 8, (4) plaintiff fails to adequately allege injury for his NY General Business Law claims, (5) plaintiff's breach of warranty claims should be dismissed as plaintiff failed to provide defendant with notice, and (6) plaintiff lacks standing to seek injunctive relief. (ECF No. 27-1, Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss (\"Def. Mem.\"), at 7-9.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   By letters filed October 12, 2018 and November 2, 2018, defendant provided the court with supplemental authority supporting its Motion to Dismiss. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 35, Defendant's Supplemental Authority Letter; ECF No. 37, Plaintiff's Supplemental Authority Letter.) For the following reasons, the defendant's motion to dismiss is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Factual Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff, in the Amended Complaint, alleges that Atkins Nutritionals' labeling of Net Carbs on its food products is \"false, misleading, and likely to deceive consumers.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 51.) The three labeling claims that plaintiff alleges are false, misleading and likely to deceive consumers are (1) the use of the phrase \"Xg Net Carbs\" while excluding sugar alcohols, (2) the use of the phrase \"Only Xg Net Carbs,\" and (3) Atkins Nutritionals \"Counting Carbs\" label, which explains the calculation method for Net Carbs and states that sugar alcohols \"minimally impact blood sugar.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 53-55.) Plaintiff alleges that the claims are false, misleading and likely to deceive because Atkins Nutritionals claims that sugar alcohols \"minimally impact blood sugar\", but sugar alcohols are proven to \"have a significant impact on blood sugar levels.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3, 30-32.) Atkins Nutritionals' website allegedly explains that the calculation of Net Carbs is based on science and reflects \"the total carbohydrate content of the food minus the fiber content and sugar alcohols.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16-17.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that the Atkins Nutritionals website also states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Net Carbs are the carbohydrates that significantly impact the blood-sugar level; they're the only carbs that count when following Atkins. The good news is that the grams of carbohydrate in fiber, glycerine, and sugar alcohols don't break\n   down and convert to blood sugar and need not be counted by people on the ANA.... So Net Carbs represent the number of grams of total carbohydrate minus those that do not impact blood sugar.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   According to plaintiff, however, Atkins Nutritionals' claims are contradicted by science. Dr. Atkins originally rejected the use of sugar alcohols on the Atkins Diet, and other scientists have refuted Atkins Nutritionals claim regarding sugar alcohols' limited impact on blood sugar. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30-32.) Plaintiff cites the Diabetes Teaching Center at the University of California, San Francisco, and Dr. Regina Castro of the Mayo Clinic, who both state that sugar alcohols can affect blood sugar levels. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 31-32.) Plaintiff thus alleges that \"sugar alcohols do impact blood sugar more than a minimal amount, and Atkins' 'Net Carb' count does not assist consumers with tracking carbohydrates that impact blood sugar because it omits sugar alcohols from its equation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27, 52-53.) Plaintiff also cites to an FDA warning letter issued in 2014, wherein the FDA admonished a company for failing to include maltitol in its Total Carbohydrate count.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44 (citing Food and Drug Administration Warning Letter ONPLDS 20-01 (June 20, 2001).) Here, however, the exemplar label provided by plaintiff in its Amended Complaint reveals that maltitol, a sugar alcohol, is included in the total carbohydrate amount, but is then subtracted from the total carbohydrate amount, along with fiber, to obtain the Net Carb amount. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In the Amended Complaint, plaintiff provides an example of an allegedly misleading label that states that Atkins Endulge Chocolate Candies have only one gram of Net Carbs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21-26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   According to plaintiff, the representations made in the labeling pictured above are \"identical or substantially similar\" to the representations that appear on the Atkins Nutritionals products identified in paragraph 20 of the Amended Complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20, 25.) The nutritional label includes the following categories: calories, fat calories, total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium, potassium, total carbohydrates, dietary fiber, sugars, sugar alcohols, protein, Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Calcium and Iron. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) Additionally, the packaging includes the formula Atkins Nutritionals utilizes to calculate Net Carbs and explains that fiber and sugar alcohols are excluded from the Net Carb number because they minimally impact blood sugar. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.) Plaintiff does not allege that he purchased the Atkins Endulge Chocolate Candies that he provided as an example of a misleading label, and only alleges that he purchased three of the thirty-one food items listed in paragraph 20 of the Amended Complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that he believed Atkins Nutritionals' alleged misrepresentations about Net Carbs on its product labels and relied on those representations in deciding to purchase three products sold by Atkins Nutritionals. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 55-57.) Specifically, plaintiff alleges that within the two years preceding the filing of the Amended Complaint, plaintiff purchased a Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Bar, Sweet &amp; Salty Trail Mix, and Chocolate Peanut Candies from a Wal-Mart store in Nassau County, New York. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff's Amended Complaint asserts three claims:(1) violation of NYGBL \u00a7 349 ; (2) violation of NYGBL \u00a7 350 ; and (3) breach of express warranty. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 67-99.) Plaintiff alleges that by including misleading statements in its labeling, Atkins Nutritionals violated NYGBL \u00a7 349 which prohibits deceptive and unfair trade practices, and NYGBL \u00a7 350, which prohibits false advertising. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 67-89.) Plaintiff seeks an injunction to enjoin defendant's alleged deceptive practices in connection with defendant's alleged violation of\n   NYGBL \u00a7 349. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80.) Further, Plaintiff alleges that Atkins Nutritionals breached its express warranty that its products would conform to Atkins Nutritionals' written promises on it labels that its products \"contained minimal 'net carbs' and ... sugar alcohols contained therein had minimal and effectively no impact on blood sugar,\" when its products did not have the qualities promised. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 92-98.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Specifically, defendant contends that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20343\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (q), 343(r), and 343-1(a)(5) together provide for broad and explicit \"preemption of non-identical state law requirements\" related to nutrition levels and health-related claims, as described in Section 343(r), that are displayed on food products. Plaintiff counters that his claims are not federally preempted because there is a presumption against preemption and Atkins Nutritionals' Net Carbs representations are not nutrient content claims. Plaintiff further argues that even if the Net Carb representations were nutrient content claims, plaintiff's NYGBL claims and breach of warranty claim would not be preempted because defendant's representation of \"Xg Net Carbs\" is false or misleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Upon review, and for the reasons explained below, the court finds that plaintiff's NYGBL and breach of warranty claims regarding defendant's use of the phrase \"Xg Net Carbs,\" and defendant's explanation of the calculation method for Net Carbs that subtracts sugar alcohols and fiber from total carbohydrates are preempted. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 52.) The court further finds that plaintiff's claims regarding the \"Only Xg Net Carbs\" statement on labels and the portion of the \"Counting\n   Carbs\" information box on the label of the Atkins Nutritionals products that discuss the impact of sugar alcohols on blood sugar, are not preempted.

Agency Discretion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Defendant argues that the narrow issues raised by the Amended Complaint fall squarely within the purview of the FDA's regulatory scheme. The three main issues raised by the Amended Complaint are: (1) whether Atkins Nutritionals is permitted to subtract sugar alcohols from total carbohydrates to calculate the Net Carbs displayed on its product labels, (2) whether Atkins Nutritionals should be able to use the word \"only\" in connection with the Net Carbs calculation, and (3) whether Atkins Nutritionals can include a statement that sugar alcohols minimally impact blood sugar in its explanation of its Net Carbs calculation. The analysis and regulation in connection with Net Carbs calculations involve technical and policy considerations and are both particularly within the agency's discretion and involve technical and policy considerations within the FDA's particular field of expertise. Further, the FDCA expressly authorizes the FDA to assess whether product labels are deceptive or misleading.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re KIND LLC \"Healthy and All Natural\" Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272417\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/209/689/#p695\">\n    209 F.Supp.3d 689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 695 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (citation omitted) (\"[T]he FDCA empowers the FDA to prohibit labels that are 'false or misleading in any particular.' \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <em>\n    iii.

Defendant argues that because Atkins Nutritionals faces lawsuits in at least three jurisdictions that assert claims substantively almost identical to those asserted by the instant Plaintiff, there is a risk that Atkins Nutritionals could face inconsistent, state-law labeling requirements, making it unduly difficult to comply with the regulation scheme the federal statutes contemplate.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Turek v.

Atkins Nutritionals has also presented extensive evidence that the FDA has considered the Net Carbs issues significantly for over a decade. In\n   <em>\n    Haggag\n   </em>\n   , the court dismissed plaintiff's claims regarding allegedly misleading food labeling on primary jurisdiction grounds.\n   <em>\n    Haggag v.

Cal. Mar. 24, 2014). The court analyzed current FDA regulations and determined that the FDA had evaluated and regulated similar health claims made on food or beverages, and although it had not regulated the specific claim at issue, regulating the claim would usurp the FDA's interpretative authority.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26, 55.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Plaintiff does not allege facts in the Amended Complaint that support his claim that the statement on Atkins Nutritionals' food labels that sugar alcohols minimally impact blood sugar is false or misleading. Instead, plaintiff pleads that scientific evidence shows that sugar alcohols \"are still a form of carbohydrate, and they still affect your blood sugar levels, if not as dramatically,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that sugar alcohols \"can increase your blood sugar level.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 31-32.) These assertions do not contradict Atkins Nutritionals' labels, which state that sugar alcohols minimally impact blood sugar. The Amended Complaint's proposal of an alternate calculation methodology based on extrapolations from analyses of sugar alcohols' energy content or recommendations by a Canadian regulatory body, is also insufficient to plausibly allege that the statement challenged in the complaint violates FDA regulations or is false and misleading.
