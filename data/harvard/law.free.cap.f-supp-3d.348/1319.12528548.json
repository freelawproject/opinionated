Because Commerce has now supported its determination with substantial evidence, the court sustains the Remand Results.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the purposes of this opinion, familiarity with the facts is presumed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    JSW Steel I\n   </em>\n   , 42 CIT at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525667\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/315/1379/\">\n    315 F.Supp.3d at 1380-81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Due to the Department's abandonment of the AFA rate-and for the reasons stated in the court's prior opinion-Commerce's determination is supported by substantial evidence and in accordance with law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Accordingly, Commerce's Remand Results are\n   <strong>\n    SUSTAINED\n   </strong>\n   and judgment is entered.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    Commerce now mischaracterizes the court's prior remand as predicated on a misunderstanding as to the operation of the Department's subsidy attribution practice. Remand Results at 8. However, the court's prior opinion expressed dissatisfaction not with Commerce's practices but with the Department's questionnaire.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     JSW Steel I\n    </em>\n    , 42 CIT at ----,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525667\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/315/1379/\">\n     315 F.Supp.3d at 1383-84\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
