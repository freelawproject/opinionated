Neb. Nov. 29, 2011) (\n   <em>\n    Markman\n   </em>\n   Order ). The Court adopted the parties' agreed-to construction of \"first flow control baffle\" as \"a front structure within the walls of the mower deck that controls the flow of air and grass clippings.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%205976264\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court found no construction was required for the phrase \"said front flow control baffle extending substantially continuously from the front location adjacent the interior surface of said second side of wall to a second location adjacent the interior surface of said front side wall,\" or to the phrase \"and adjacent the forward end of said discharge opening\" finding the meaning is relatively clear in the context of the patent as a whole, with the word \"adjacent\" referring to parts that are near one another, but not touching.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. Further, no construction of the phrase \"a front arcuate baffle portion that 'extends from the interior surface of said second side wall' \" was necessary since the language does not require that the first arcuate baffle portion contact or abut the second side wall.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Court also found the phrase \"substantially straight\" needed no construction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Similarly, the Court found no claim construction was necessary with respect to the phrase \"a front elongated and substantially straight baffle portion, having first and second ends, extending from said second end of said front arcuate baffle portion\" because the jury would be able to determine what \"extends\" means in this context.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Court found that the phrase \"said front elongated and substantially straight baffle portion being angularly disposed with respect to the said circle defined by the blade tip path of said second cutting blade in a chord-like fashion\" should be construed as \" 'the front elongated and substantially straight baffle portion is oriented such that the line corresponding to that baffle portion intersects the circle defined by the blade tip path of the second cutting blade at two points.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The term \"second flow control baffle\" was construed as \"a second rear structure within the walls of the mower deck that controls the flow of air and grass clippings.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7. The Court construed the phrase \"semi-circular baffle portions\" to mean \"baffle portions that are shaped like a portion or part of a circle,\" rejecting the contention that a semi-circular baffle portion must be half of a circle.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Court found no construction necessary for the term \"said front and rear flow control baffles defining\n   a plurality of open throat portions which are positioned between adjacent cutting blades,\" as reflected in the preferred embodiment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8.

Filing No. 309. After briefing on the motions and oral argument, this Court found as a matter of law that Claim 1 of the '863 Patent was not invalid as anticipated by prior art, finding that undisputed evidence showed the defendants could not meet their burden of proving anticipation by clear and convincing evidence. Filing No. 476, Memorandum and Order at 24-25. The Court also found the patent was not invalid as indefinite.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25-27. Further, the Court granted Exmark's motion for summary judgment of infringement, with respect to the Briggs's original accused mowers, but found genuine issues of material fact with respect to whether or not Briggs's modified designs infringed the patent and on whether the defendants' infringing conduct was willful.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27-29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The action proceeded to a trial before a jury and the jury found that Briggs willfully infringed Exmark's patent.

The Appeals Court suggested that this court had \"adopted a broader construction than the PTO's construction\" of the \" 'baffle' and 'flow control baffle' as 'an element that \"controls\" the flow of air and grass clippings within the mower deck\n   <em>\n    in a 'meaningful way\n   </em>\n   ,' \" and concluded that Briggs had been precluded from arguing that the prior art anticipated the claims or rendered them obvious under the district court's broader construction of the claims.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267190\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/879/1332/#p1337\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267190\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/879/1332/#p1337\">\n    at 1343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (noting that \"[t]he fact that the Board held that the asserted anticipating prior art reference did not disclose the claim requirements (entire baffle and meaningful effect) as construed by the Board, does not foreclose the possibility that a jury may find otherwise under a broader construction not requiring those aspects\"). The Federal Circuit directed this court on remand to \"consider how its claim construction, to the extent it is the same or different from the Board's construction, impacts its anticipation and obviousness analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at n. 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Exmark now moves to reaffirm the Court's summary judgment decision on invalidity. In opposition, Briggs argues that genuine disputes of fact exist with regard to alleged anticipation by prior art references. Specifically, in reliance on the testimony of expert witnesses Fronczak, Del Ponte, and Strykowski, it argues that the Walker and Kidd references and the Simplicity mower anticipate the invention.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Similarly, Briggs argues that the asserted claim is obvious in that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated to modify Walker alone, or in combination with numerous other prior art references, to achieve the same function as the '863 Patent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   These are essentially the same arguments presented in opposition to Exmark's invalidity summary judgment motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both parties relied on expert testimony to support and oppose the validity motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The evidence at trial established that the significance of the front baffle being away from the front wall is that it inhibits the exhaust of air under the front of the deck thereby reducing blowout and improving air flow towards the side discharge opening. Exmark's engineer, Garry Busboom, added a flow control baffle that extended across the entire front of the deck and shaped that baffle with a combination of arcuate baffle portions and substantially straight baffle portions that improved the quality of cut and grass discharge while at the same time reduced \"blowout.\" Relative to the flow control baffles, the \"object of the invention\" is to improve the efficiency by which air and grass clippings are directed across the deck and out of the side discharge opening.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Filing No. 1-1, Ex. A, '863 patent at 2:23-29. Similarly, the \"summary of the invention\" section states that the \"flow control baffles, and especially the first flow control baffle, efficiently direct the grass clippings and air to the side discharge opening.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2:66-3:4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The structure of the Walker invention shows only a small front baffle structure between the blades and the front wall of the mower deck. Undisputed evidence shows the baffle structure of the Walker prior art is based on the portions of the deck wall on either side of the structure being both a front wall and flow control baffle. Similarly, the structure of the Simplicity mulching mower is undisputed and shows a mower deck with a mulch kit installed in the deck. The mulch kit has three V-shaped baffles that are mounted to the front wall by long thin mounting plates that run along and contact the front wall of the deck, and also has a curved piece that closes the discharge opening. The '863 patent requires a \"discharge opening\" in the side wall.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5:66-6:2, 15-19; 7:10-13, 27-31, 45-48. With the mulching kit installed, the Simplicity mulching mower does not have a \"discharge opening.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, even if it were obvious to modify the Simplicity mulching mower exactly as proposed by Briggs, it still would not meet all limitations of the claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Prosecution history shows the focus of prosecution in front of the Patent and Trademark Appeals Board (\"PTAB\") was the patentability of the '863 claims over United States Patent No. 4,055,036 to Kidd. The baffle disclosed in the Kidd patent is different than the front baffle of the '863 patent. The '863 Patent discloses substantially straight portions that point inwardly as to direct grass clippings from one chamber into the blade path of an adjacent blade.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Filing No. 1-1, Ex. A, '863 Patent, Fig. 4. Exmark amended Claim 1 to add the limitation \"angularly disposed ... in a chord-like fashion\" in order to overcome Kidd. Exmark's '575 application shows a mower deck having the exact structure that was later claimed in the '863 patent in that air and grass clippings are directed in a chord-like fashion into the path of the next blade, as recited in the '863 patent claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   II.

DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   As a threshold matter, the Court will address the Federal Circuit's directive on claim construction. The Federal Circuit suggested that in granting a summary judgment of validity over the prior art, this court applied a broader claim construction than the PTAB, and directed the Court on remand to address issue of claim construction in the context of determination of anticipation or obviousness. In its earlier opinion on summary judgment, the Court noted in a footnote that it would\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   adopt language from the PTAB construction regarding a flow control baffle having a \"meaningful effect\" on the flow of air and grass clippings. Filing No. 476, Memorandum\n   and Order at 24 n.8. To clarify, the Court did not apply a different claim construction - it merely noted that the parties agreed construction was easily understood and there was no need for the \"meaningful effect\" language. The Court noted that the meaningful effect language used by the PTAB was meant to explain why the mounting plates in the Simplicity mulch kit that run along, contact and conform to the front wall are not \"flow control baffles.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"675357\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/755/1549/#p1555\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The evidence before the Court establishes that the significance of a separate, spaced baffle is that \"[t]he placement of the front baffle away from the front wall of the deck inhibits the exhaust of air under the front of the deck thereby reducing blowout and improving air flow towards the side discharge opening.\" Filing No. 353-3, Ex. 3, Stykowski testimony at 141. The baffle thus controls the air flow as a matter of fluid mechanics.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41. A thin piece of metal that runs along the wall of the deck and conforms to it would not change the flow within the mower deck to any greater extent than the deck walls themselves.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39-46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As understood in context, there is no substantive difference between the PTAB's construction and the parties' original agreed-upon construction. In context, to a person of ordinary skill in the art, a baffle is separate from and spaced away from the front wall in order to constitute a \"flow control baffle.\" The two phrases effectively convey the same basic point - under the Court's claim construction, the claim term \"flow control baffle\" does not cover thin mounting plates that run along, contact, and conform to the front deck wall as in the Simplicity mulching mower. The concept of a \"meaningful effect\" is subsumed within the notion of \"control\" of the flow of clippings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The evidence presented to the Court in support of Exmark's summary judgment motion establishes that the claimed invention of the '863 patent was a substantial and non-obvious advancement over the prior art and, that at the time of the '863 invention, it was unusual to add a front baffle of any shape to a multi-bladed side discharge mower. Generally, at that time, in side-discharge mowing, the space in front of the blades was as open as possible to allow grass clippings to flow along the front of the deck. None of the prior art showed a three-bladed mower with a separate baffle extending across the entire front of the deck in a side discharge configuration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The testimony of Briggs's expert, Dr. Fronczak, establishes that the small V-shaped front structure between the blades and the front wall of the Walker mower deck functions as a baffle based on considering the portions of the deck wall on either side of the baffle to be both a front wall and flow control baffle. Filing No. 378-2, Ex. 5, Fronczak Dep. at 231. However, the claim limitations at issue do not allow the same structure to be both deck wall and flow control baffle. The claims of the '863 patent expressly require two distinct structures: a \"front wall\" and a front \"flow control baffle.\" The fact that there are two structures implies some space between them. The claim language indicates that the claimed \"flow control baffle\" of the '863 patent requires some \"spatial separation.\" The Walker reference can only anticipate Claim 1 of the '863 patent if parts of the mower deck are said to constitute parts of the baffle, in effect, by counting the same structure in the prior art as both the \"deck wall\" and \"baffle\" to satisfy the Claim 1 limitations. Under the Court's claim construction, the claim limitations do not allow the same structure to be both deck wall and flow control baffle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The '863 patent also requires that the front wall have an \"interior surface\" and it\n   states that the flow control baffle extends downwardly from the top wall \"between said cutting blades and said front wall.\" The prosecution history shows that the \"chord-like\" limitation was added to the patent in response to the PTO's rejection based on Kidd. Exmark pointed out to the PTO that the front baffle in Kidd is tangential, whereas the '863 requires that the substantially straight portion is \"angularly disposed\" (i.e., angled, pointing to, aiming at, or tipped toward) the blade path circle so as to cross that circle at two points. The specification refers to the importance of deflecting the cuttings inwardly into the path of the cutting blade.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The defendants also rely on the Simplicity mower with a mulch kit accessory installed as prior art, but that mower is not relevant to the claims of the '863 patent because the claims are directed to an improvement in side discharge mowing and when the mulching kit is installed in the Simplicity deck it is no longer a side discharge mower, it becomes a mulching mower. Thus, even if it were obvious to modify the Simplicity mulching mower exactly as proposed by Briggs, it still would not meet all limitations of the claims. Also, to be a \"discharge opening,\" the opening must be one through which grass will actually discharge when grass is cut. This means that neither the Walker reference nor the Simplicity mower are properly prior art that anticipates the invention, nor was it obvious, to a person skilled in the art, to make the alterations found in the '863 patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Court reaches this conclusion independent of the PTO. The Court has considered the PTO's findings during reexamination of evidence to consider in determining whether Briggs has met the statutory burden of overcoming the presumption of validity by clear and convincing evidence but has not afforded the PTO's findings dispositive weight. Nevertheless, the PTO's findings bolster the court's independent conclusion and support the court's claim construction and its understanding of the limitations of the claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Court finds, as a matter of law, Briggs has not overcome its high burden of proving the factual elements of invalidity by clear and convincing evidence. In making this determination, the Court applies the claim construction adopted early in the litigation, specifically, the terms agreed to by the parties. To adopt Briggs's arguments would be to rely on a claim construction that is at odds with the\n   <em>\n    Markman\n   </em>\n   order and, importantly, with the parties' agreed construction of the term flow control baffle. The claim language, specification, and prosecution history all support Exmark's argument that the flow control baffle was not anticipated or obvious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Court has considered all the record evidence, including the prior art and expert testimony. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Briggs, and has drawn all justifiable inferences in its favor, and concludes, in view of the Court's claim construction, that there are no genuine issues of material fact as to whether a prior art reference anticipates or renders Claim 1 of the '863 patent obvious. Accordingly, the Court reaffirms its previous holding on Exmark's motion for summary judgment on invalidity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   IT IS ORDERED:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   1. Briggs &amp; Stratton's motion to file a sur-reply brief (Filing No. 751) is granted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   2. Exmark's motion for summary judgment to reaffirm that the asserted claims of the '863 patent are not invalid in view of the prior art (Filing No. 722) is granted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    Also pending is Defendant's motion to file a sur-reply brief,\n    <em>\n     Filing No. 751\n    </em>\n    . The Court finds the motion should be granted and the Court has considered the brief. The brief states that the Court should be aware of \"(i) Exmark's failure to offer a consistent construction of the term \"flow control baffle\" and (ii) the need for the Court to articulate a clear construction of this term that applies to all aspects of the case, including both invalidity and infringement. At the beginning of this case in 2011, Exmark and Briggs agreed to the following construction: \"a flow control baffle is a structure within the walls of the mower deck that controls the flow of air and grass clippings.\"\n    <em>\n     Filing No. 143\n    </em>\n    , Transcript of\n    <em>\n     Markman\n    </em>\n    Hearing at 6, 105. This Court adopted that agreed-to construction.\n    <em>\n     Filing No. 156\n    </em>\n    , Memorandum and Order at 8. Contrary to Briggs's assertion, the Court has applied that construction throughout the case. The Appeals Court's directive with respect to claim construction is addressed later in this opinion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    \"Chord\" is a geometry term.

Also, the Court's opinion conformed to and was based on the claim construction. Nevertheless, the court will further elucidate its thinking as directed by the Federal Circuit.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    In moving for summary judgment on the defenses of anticipation and obviousness prior to trial, Exmark addressed the defendants' cited prior art.
