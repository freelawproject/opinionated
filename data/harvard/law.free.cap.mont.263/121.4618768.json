We affirm in part and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">This Court, in the case of <em>Trustees, Missoula County Sch. Dist. No. 1 v. Anderson </em>(1988), 232 Mont. 501, 757 P.2d 1315, set forth the background facts of this case. Therein we found that a teacher, Carol Anderson (Anderson), was improperly dismissed for incompetence based on poor performance following four interviews upon her return to teaching following a sabbatical leave. The opinion of this Court reversed the district court\u2019s decision which set aside the findings of fact and conclusions of law of the State Superintendent and the County Superintendent. We directed the court to reinstate the decision of the State and County Superintendent.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">One year after this Court returned the case to the District Court to implement our decision, Anderson and the Trustees entered into a settlement agreement and a release. That settlement agreement involved payments to Anderson as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b145-11\">2. <em>Payments. </em>In consideration of the Release set forth above[,] the District hereby agrees to pay a sum totaling $81,585.07 as negotiated and compromised by Anderson and the District which is the sum of the following amounts:</p>\n<p id=\"b145-15\">Total Net Annual Income $64,473.74</p>\n<p id=\"A3\">Total Interest $12,023.81</p>\n<p id=\"AB\">Total Medical $ 5,387.81</p>\n<p id=\"b145-17\">Receipt of $81,885.36 is expressly acknowledged.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>The District further agrees to pay the interest required by [the Teachers\u2019 Retirement System] in addition to the [Teachers\u2019 Retirement System] contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">The District agrees to pay the federal income tax, state income tax and FICA deducted from gross salary to the appropriate state and federal agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">With these facts, we now consider the problem of who is going to pay the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">In 1984, the Trustees of the Missoula School District No. 1 (Trustees), purchased a School Professional Legal Liability Insurance Policy from an insurance representative of Western States Insurance Agency, Inc. (Western States). The policy came through Pacific Employers Insurance Company (Pacific); the effective dates were from December 1,1984 to December 1,1987. Prior to purchasing the policy, and upon inquiry whether there were any lawsuits outstanding, a trustee informed the Western States representative that a \u201ctenured teacher\u2019s [Anderson] dismissal is being challenged at this time through the regular channels, now in the hands of the County State Superintendent of Schools.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">Upon being presented the above amounts, Pacific denied coverage of the claims on the grounds that the policy provided an exclusion for claims made against the insured for \u201cany amounts due under the terms of any contractual obligation. ...\u201d Pacific characterized the payment agreement between the School District and Anderson as one arising out of a \u201ccontractual obligation.\u201d The Trustees argue that the School District\u2019s settlement with the dismissed teacher was based upon negligent firing and, therefore, the clause which provides for coverage for errors, omissions, and claims made \u201c(a) by reason of any act, error, or omission in services rendered in the discharge of the School District....\u201d applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">Several issues are set forth; two by the respondent Trustees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-9\">1. Whether the District Court erred by holding that the \u201ccontract exclusion\u201d provision of the insurance agreement, authored by Pacific, was not applicable to preclude coverage under the insurance agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-10\">2. Whether the District Court\u2019s Memorandum and Order of January 12, 1993, (as opposed to its February 19, 1993, entry of Rule 54(b) Judgment) has any effect on the viability of the third and fourth affirmative defenses raised by Pacific\u2019s answer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>Western States responds to the second issue as set forth by the appellants as:</p>\n<p id=\"b147-3\">3. Did the District Court properly grant partial summary judgment to the Trustees on the \u201ccontract exclusion\u201d issue without addressing several coverage defenses set forth in Pacific\u2019s answer?</p>\n<p id=\"AQ7\">Plaintiff Trustees filed an action in District Court naming as defendants Pacific and Western States. The Trustees alleged that they were entitled to declaratory relief and to the benefits of coverage under a Pacific insurance policy issued to the school district. Pacific denied coverage for sums the Trustees paid to Carol Anderson after she successfully appealed her dismissal as a tenured teacher. The Trustees also alleged in the amended complaint that Western States had been negligent in advising them to purchase the Pacific policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">The parties filed cross-motions for partial summary judgment addressing whether the \u201ccontract exclusion\u201d in Pacific\u2019s policy precluded coverage for sums that the Trustees paid to Anderson. The District Court granted partial summary judgment to the Trustees, ruling that the contract exclusion did not apply and that Pacific had breached its obligation to provide coverage under the insurance policy. Pacific and Western States were represented by the same counsel during the summary judgment proceedings and thereafter separate counsel represented Western States which aligned itself with the Trustees for the purpose of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">This Court uses the same standard in reviewing a denial of summary judgment as the District Court used in denying the motion. <em>Frazier Educ. Ass\u2019n, MEA/FEA v. Board of Trustees, Valley County Elementary Sch. Dist. No. 2 </em>(1993), 256 Mont. 223, 225, 846 P.2d 267, 269; see also <em>Graham v. Montana State University </em>(1988), 235 Mont. 284, 287, 767 P.2d 301, 303. In order for summary judgment to issue, and to be affirmed on appeal, there can be no \u201cgenuine issue as to all facts deemed material in light of the substantive principles that entitle [the movant] to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Cereck v. Albertson\u2019s Inc. </em>(1981), 195 Mont. 409, 411, 637 P.2d 509, 511; and Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Whether the District Court erred by holding that the \u201ccontract exclusion\u201d provision of the insurance agreement, authored by Pacific, was not applicable to preclude coverage under the insurance agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">In the case before us, there is no factual dispute which is material to the determination of the contract exclusion issue. Based on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>briefs that have been submitted to the District Court and to this Court, the parties agree that Pacific\u2019s exclusion must be construed in the context of Anderson\u2019s appeal of her dismissal. While the parties may supply differing interpretations of the contextual facts, the facts themselves are undisputed. Thus the real issue on appeal is whether the District Court correctly determined, as a matter of law, that the exclusion did not apply, which entitled the Trustees to partial summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">In reaching the principal issue in this appeal, we must first decide how to characterize Anderson\u2019s challenge to her dismissal. Appellant Pacific repeatedly characterizes the challenge as one for breach of contract in order to bring it within the ambit of the contract exclusion. Western States argues that Pacific misperceives the nature of Anderson\u2019s claim. \u201c1. Montana authority establishes that Carol Anderson\u2019s claim was for dismissal without good cause in violation of her rights under section 20-4-207, M.C.A.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Montana school laws generally embody a legislative effort to balance the rights of teachers with those of trustees. <em>Anderson, </em>757 P.2d at 1318; and <em>Massey v. Argenbright </em>(1984), 211 Mont. 331, 336, 683 P.2d 1332, 1334. The rights of tenured teachers are treated with solicitude because \u201ctenure is a substantial, valuable, and beneficial right which cannot be taken away except for good cause.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>757 P.2d at 1318.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Our cases have also looked to the obligation and rights of school trustees in maintaining the integrity of their schools. <em>Anderson, </em>757 P.2d at 1318. Article X, \u00a7 8 of the Montana Constitution provides that \u201c[t]he supervision and control of schools in each school district shall be vested in a board of trustees ....\u201d Section 20-3-324, MCA, enumerates the specific powers and duties of the trustees, including the power to employ and to dismiss personnel. We have held that trustees must exercise discretion in deciding whom they will employ and whom they will dismiss. See <em>Kelsey v. School Dist. No. 25 </em>(1929), 84 Mont. 453, 458, 276 P. 26, 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">Section 20-4-207, MCA (1983), which governed the dismissal of Anderson, reflected the tension between the competing rights of teachers and trustees. The statute provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-8\">(1) The trustees of any district may dismiss a teacher before the expiration of his employment contract for immorality, unfitness, incompetence, or violation of the adopted policies of such trustees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>(2) Any teacher who has been dismissed may in writing within 10 days appeal such dismissal to the county superintendent. Following such appeal a hearing shall be held within 10 days. If the county superintendent, after a hearing, determines that the dismissal by the trustees was made without good cause, he shall order the trustees to reinstate such teacher and to compensate such teacher at his contract amount for the time lost during the pending of the appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-3\">This statute covers the appellate procedure and established the measure of Anderson\u2019s damages and is conceded by Pacific. However, Pacific insists that her claim was \u201cstrictly and solely a claim for breach of the employment contract\u201d and that the damages she received were for breach of that contract. As noted previously, Western States disagrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">This Court has distinguished the remedial process that is afforded a teacher who is dismissed while under contract from an action for breach of contract. <em>Kelsey, </em>276 P. at 26-27; see also <em>Wyatt v. Sch. Dist. No. 104 </em>(1966), 148 Mont. 83, 89, 417 P.2d 221, 224. These cases show the differences between a statutory appeal of a dismissal and an action for breach of contract, noting that a teacher is not free to choose between an appeal and an action for contractual damages; the proceedings are not interchangeable. In the absence of exceptional circumstances a teacher must exhaust his or her administrative remedies under Montana school law. See <em>Throssell v. Board of Trustees of Gallatin County Sch. Dist. No. </em>7 (1988), 232 Mont. 497, 499, 757 P.2d 348, 349-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">However, under Montana law, the remedies that are available in a statutory appeal of dismissal are not necessarily the same as those available in a breach of contract action. Section 20-4-207(2), MCA (1983), limits the relief that is available to a wrongfully dismissed teacher to reinstatement and to compensation \u201cat his contract amount for the time lost during the pending of the appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The decision of this Court supports characterizing Anderson\u2019s proceedings as one vindicating her statutory rights as a teacher rather than a breach of contract case. As noted in Western States\u2019s brief an analogy may be drawn with a proceeding to vindicate the rights of a protected person who has suffered a discriminatory termination of employment. See Title VII, Civil Rights Act (1964), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l); and the Montana Human Rights Act, \u00a7 49-2-303(l)(a), MCA. Both types of proceedings are originally consigned to administrative agencies by statute and with limited exceptions, ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>haustion is required. Both kinds of proceedings feature remedies prescribed by statute, which may include reinstatement and compensation or back pay. The fact that compensation or back pay is calculated by reference to a contract amount does not convert the proceeding from one for violation of statute to one for breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">As previously noted, the undisputed facts here establish that Anderson\u2019s claim was for dismissal without good cause in violation of her statutory rights. Her claim establishes that she was dismissed without good cause rather than a breach of contract. Here all the proceedings, both the administrative appeals, and both district court and Supreme Court decisions, are consistent with characterizing Anderson\u2019s claim as one for a violation of the Montana statute that protects teachers -under a contract from dismissal without good cause. Section 20-4-207, MCA (1983). We find that neither the law nor the facts support Pacific\u2019s assertion that Anderson\u2019s claim was \u201cstrictly and solely a claim for breach of her employment contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">As a general rule, an insurance company must look to the allegations of a complaint to determine if a loss is covered. \u201cCoverage is based upon the act [or conduct that] giv[es] rise to the claims, not necessarily upon the language of the complaint\u201d or other pleading that initiates a proceeding. <em>New Hampshire Ins. Group v. Strecker </em>(1990), 244 Mont. 478, 482, 798 P.2d 130, 132; see <em>Burns v. Underwriters Adjusting Co. </em>(1988), 234 Mont. 508, 510, 765 P.2d 712, 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Here, Anderson initiated an administrative proceeding by submitting a form \u201cappeal\u201d to the County Superintendent of Schools, designating \u00a7 20-4-207, MCA, as the basis for her appeal. Therefore, \u00a7 20-4-207, MCA, must be read into her appeal. The statute and interpretive precedent establish that although trustees may dismiss a teacher who is -under contract, they may not do so without good cause. <em>Johnson v. Beaverhead County High Sch. Dist. </em>(1989), 236 Mont. 532, 534, 771 P.2d 137, 138; <em>Anderson, </em>757 P.2d at 1318; and <em>Trustees, Lincoln County Sch. Dist. No. 13 v. Holden </em>(1988), 231 Mont. 491, 495-96, 754 P.2d 506, 509.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">The conduct that gave rise to Anderson\u2019s claim was an omission \u2014 failure of the Trustees to consider and to weigh all of the available evidence before dismissing her. The omission constituted a violation of the Trustees\u2019 statutory obligation to dismiss only for good cause. At the same time, the omission constituted a violation of Anderson\u2019s statutory rights. She filed her appeal to vindicate those rights and to secure reinstatement to her teaching position. The record demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>strates that she did not explicitly seek compensation in the immediate aftermath of her dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-3\">Under the insurance agreement, Pacific promised to pay all sums which the Trustees became legally obligated to pay as damages as a result of claims first made during the policy period \u201cby reason of any act, error, or omission in services rendered in the discharge of School District duties. ...\u201d Clearly, the Trustees became obligated to pay Anderson damages after this Court reinstated the decisions of the State and County Superintendents. There is also no question that Anderson\u2019s claim arose by reason of an omission in services rendered in the discharge of the Trustees\u2019 duties. Thus, for purposes of the issue before this Court, Pacific\u2019s insurance agreement provided coverage for the conduct that gave rise to Anderson\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">While Pacific contends that the damages Anderson \u201csought and received were Tor... amounts due [her] under the terms of [the School District\u2019s] contractual obligation\u2019 with her,\u201d the exclusion provides that the claim must be for amounts due under the terms of a contractual obligation. Western States argues that Pacific misperceives the nature of Anderson\u2019s claim and that Pacific\u2019s position is untenable if her claim is viewed as anything other than one for breach of contract. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The facts of this case indicate that Anderson was discharged from her employment from the School District in good faith, but this Court later found that she should not have been. The School District was not acting maliciously in discharging her, as it felt that there were sufficient grounds. As it turned out it was a mistake, but in this case, and many other wrongful discharge cases where a negligent termination occurred, they did not know what they had done was negligent until it was finally determined to be so by a higher court. Under these circumstances, the School District should not be denied the coverage which it had bargained for.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">A very similar situation is presented in the case of <em>United Pacific Ins. Co. v. First Interstate Bancsystems </em>(D. Mont. 1987), 664 F. Supp. 1390, where there was an insurance coverage dispute involving a wrongful termination claim. There, in discussing the unique nature of the wrongful discharge claim, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-7\">Likewise, in wrongful termination, there is an intent to terminate but injuries are not compensable unless a Court or a jury establishes that the termination was wrongful.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>An employer may not know that his or her conduct is wrongful until liability is established. Because the purpose of liability insurance is to protect against risk, this Court should not deny employers the protection of insurance coverage ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-4\"><em>United Pacific, </em>664 F.Supp. at 1394.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">We note that in the <em>United Pacific </em>case, the claim for damages was for loss of compensation, loss of future earning capacity, physical and emotional stress and humiliation, loss of benefits, and loss of work life earnings. While the claim obviously involved damages which were tied to the employment contract, nowhere in the <em>United Pacific </em>decision is the claim stated to be a claim arising out of a contractual obligation. There, the court was clearly of the opinion that the claim was for tortious wrongful termination and for personal injury such as emotional stress and humiliation. <em>United Pacific, </em>664 F.Supp. at 1394.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">As is the case here, in <em>United Pacific, </em>First Interstate was seeking reimbursement from its insurer related to a settlement of a wrongful termination claim. In this regard, the court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-7\">Although the settlement does not distinguish the grounds for settlement, Schroeder\u2019s complaint provided the potential for damages based on negligence and plaintiff would have a duty to indemnify defendants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-8\"><em>United Pacific, </em>664 F.Supp. at 1393.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">In this case, as in <em>United Pacific, </em>the settlement document does not specifically identify the grounds for settlement in terms of theories of liability (although virtually all of the claims released by Anderson sound in tort). At a minimum, \u201cthe potential\u201d for damages based on pure negligence, even though subject to a specific statutory remedy, was there. Thus, there is a clear obligation in this case for Pacific to cover the loss, subject to other defenses which were not at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">It is obvious that the contract exclusion portion of the insurance agreement is ambiguous as applied in this case. Although the exclusion had its purpose, and legitimately could fulfill its purpose in a case where the facts were supportive of that position \u2014 this is not one of them. The ambiguity of the exclusionary provision in an insurance agreement should be construed against the facts of the matter presented. Considering the facts in this instance, the District Court\u2019s decision clearly does not have the effect of \u201celiminating the contract exclusion\u201d from the policy entirely, as alleged by Pacific. In fact, nothing could be further from the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>From the statement of the facts, the insurance agreement claims to provide a wide range of coverage for negligent acts, errors, or omissions rendered in the discharge of School District duties. It then goes on to exclude coverage for \u201cany amounts due under the terms of any contractual obligation.\u201d As we have noted before, here, the Anderson obligation was not due under the terms of a contractual obligation. In this case, a contractual obligation exclusion is most certainly unclear. It purportedly applies without limitation to construction and demolition contracts and purportedly to other contractual obligations, but as to non-construction or non-demolition contracts, the insurance company agrees to cover fees, costs, etc., resulting from the School District\u2019s failure to perform or breach of contract. Nowhere in this exclusion is it apparent that the exclusion applies in anything other than contracts the School District entered into with third parties outside of the School District for goods and services. There is no specific mention in the exclusion clause for internal contractual obligations within the School District, or more importantly of liability by termination of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-3\">If it was the intent of the policy drafters to exclude coverage related to negligence, or even intentional wrongful termination of employment, appropriate language could have been inserted. The policy was very carefully drafted and, as such, the fact that an incident is not specifically excluded, conclusively demonstrates that it was not intended to be. Here the ambiguity was created by the policy and must be construed against the company as a matter of law. The District Court very acutely and properly noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-4\">The agreement does not address issues such as those presented in this case where damages sustained are a result of errors made by school officials in terminating a contract. Therefore, the terms of the insurance contract need to be construed according to the entirety of its terms and conditions as set forth in the policy. See, \u00a7 33-15-316, M.C.A.; and <em>United Pacific </em>.... A particular clause of a[n insurance] contract must always be subordinate to the contract\u2019s general intent. \u00a7 28-3-307, M.C.A.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-5\">The general intent of the policy in the present case is to insure the School District from liability for errors in the discharge of their duties. The exclusions or words of limitations in the policy must be construed against the insurer; <em>Bauer Ranch v. Mountain West Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance, </em>(1985), 215 Mont. 153, 695 P.2d 1307, 1309, as an insured is entitled to all the coverage he may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>\u201creasonably expect\u201d to be provided in a policy under the \u201creasonable expectation\u201d doctrine subscribed to in this state.

Mountain West Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1985), 215 Mont. 153, 156, 695 P.2d 1307, 1309.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Whether the District Comb\u2019s Memorandum and Order of January 12, 1993, (as opposed to its February 19, 1993, entry of Rule 54(b) Judgment) has any effect on the viability of the third and fourth affirmative defenses raised by Pacific\u2019s answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">Last, but not least, the question of the viability of Pacific\u2019s third and fourth defenses has been raised for discussion. The District Court\u2019s Rule 54(b) Judgment indicated that in ruling on the merits of the partial summary judgment motions which were presented through its memorandum and order of January 12,1993, \u201cthere was coverage for the Plaintiffs\u2019 [sic] losses under the subject insuring agreement.\u201d Both the School District and Western States agree with Pacific that the viability of its third and fourth affirmative defenses have not yet been subject to a court determination. The solution to this problem can be resolved by holding that a Rule 54(b) judgment is, in essence, the \u201cjudgment to be appealed from here.\u201d The practical effect of the Rule 54(b) judgment is to certify the District Court Judge\u2019s previous memorandum and order adjudicating the partial summary judgment motion of January 12, 1993, as a \u201cfinal order.\u201d We hold that this is the \u201cjudgment appealed from.\u201d We find that the District Court reached the proper result in its memorandum and order of January 12, and in so doing we hold that the contract exclusion had no effect on the coverage under the insurance policy as construed against the background history and the underlying facts of the settlement of Anderson\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">The District Court is affirmed on issue one and the case is remanded to conform to this opinion as to the third and fourth affirmative defenses.</p>\n<judges id=\"b154-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES TRIEWEILER and HUNT concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b154-10\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"At2\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>This is a difficult case.

That conclusion ignores the plain language of the statute which leads inevitably to the conclusion that, without a breach of her employment contract, Anderson would have no claim against the Trustees of Missoula County School District No. 1 (School District), nor would she have any rights, statutory or otherwise, to vindicate.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-4\">The statute provides in pertinent part that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-5\">The trustees of any district may dismiss a teacher <em>before the expiration of his employment contract </em>for immorality, unfitness, incompetence, or violation of the adopted policies of such trustees, (emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Section 20-4-207(1), MCA. The statute does not provide a right against wrongful dismissal separate and apart from the underlying contract. The statute presupposes that there is an employment contract in the first place, and it is the breach of that contract, by firing the teacher for other than good cause \u2014 immorality, unfitness, incompetence or violation of adopted policies \u2014 that gives rise to a violation of the statute. For that reason, I cannot conclude that Anderson\u2019s claim against the School District was anything but for sums due under her contract. Simply put, she wanted the benefit of her contract. She wanted employment, and she wanted to be paid for her employment in accordance with the terms of her contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Here, the exclusion in the insurance policy applies to any claims made against the School District for \u201cany amounts due, under the terms of any contractual obligation.\u201d While Anderson argues that she filed her claim to vindicate her statutory rights, thereby avoiding the exclusionary language in the policy, the exclusion does not limit itself to excluding claims for damages only if presented under a breach of contract <em>theory. </em>The exclusion applies if the claimed damages are in fact \u201camounts due under the terms of any contractual obligation,\u201d regardless of how the theory of liability is characterized.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">Anderson\u2019s rights to employment, compensation and fringe benefits did not arise from the statute. Those rights arose from the contract obligations assumed by the parties, the breach of which gave rise to the very damages claimed by Anderson and the very damages paid by the School District.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>In actuality, Anderson was not vindicating her statutory rights; she had none apart from her contract. She was, in truth, vindicating her contract rights under her teacher\u2019s contract and the collective bargaining agreement which incorporated the statute that allowed the School District to dismiss her if she was found to be immoral, unfit, incompetent, or if she violated the trustees\u2019 adopted policies. The only rights Anderson had were those arising out of her contract with the School District. The fact that this particular contract was subject to a special statute which required administrative appeals as opposed to court action as the means of enforcement does not change the essence of the claim itself \u2014 one arising out of the contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">As pointed out in the Court\u2019s opinion, \u00a7 20-4-207(5), MCA, limits the relief that is available to a wrongfully-dismissed teacher to reinstatement and compensation \u201cat [her] contract amount for the time lost during the pending of the appeal.\u201d The statute itself makes clear that the amounts due Anderson were amounts due under her contractual obligation with the School District. Here, Anderson received a settlement which included amounts exactly equal to the types and amounts of compensation that she should have received under her contract, with interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">She received her salary, and she received the medical benefits she would have received under her health insurance policy with the School District. In addition, the School District contributed to the Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, with interest, and paid the federal and state income tax and FICA which would have been deducted from Anderson\u2019s gross salary. The settlement <em>exactly matched </em>what Anderson would have received under her contract, with interest. The settlement agreement and release broke out the amounts paid in precisely the manner that those amounts would have been paid had the School District not breached its agreement with Anderson and had it not wrongfully terminated her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">These amounts were due because of Anderson\u2019s employment contract which the School District breached when it discharged Anderson during the term of her contract without good cause. Clearly, even if this action is characterized as one where Anderson was \u201cvindicating her statutory rights,\u201d the amounts the School District paid Anderson were precisely the \u201camounts due under the terms of [her] contractual obligation,\u201d and are thus excluded from coverage by the terms of the policy with Pacific.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">Effectively, this Court has turned a simple breach of contract action, for which there is no insurance coverage, into a tort case for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>which there is, under the guise of the teacher \u201cvindicating her statutory rights.\u201d This is a breach of contract case and the amounts due and paid arose under the contractual obligation of the School District to Anderson and are, therefore, excluded from coverage under the insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-3\">Similarly, I cannot agree with the opinion of the Court which characterizes the policy contract exclusion as \u201cambiguous.\u201d The contract exclusion, while broad, is very specific \u2014 it applies to amounts due under <em>any contractual obligation. </em>There are no exceptions to this exclusion. There is no language in the exclusion that limits its application to only third-party contracts, to construction or other special-type contracts, to contracts under which an obligation of indemnity is assumed, or to \u201cinternal contractual obligations.\u201d This Court reads into the exclusion limiting language, by the expedient of finding that the limitations are not there. That turns the rules of construction upside down. I do not believe that the policy contract exclusion at issue here even requires construction, much less that it be construed against Pacific on the theory that it is ambiguous. The exclusion may be broad; it is not, however, ambiguous. When the language of a contract is clear and unambiguous, as it is in this case, the contract does not require the application of the rules of construction, and it is this Court\u2019s duly to enforce the contract as made by the parties. <em>Keller v. Dooling </em>(1991), 248 Mont. 535, 539, 813 P.2d 437, 440.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">Finally, the potential for mischief which will be generated by the Court\u2019s opinion is disturbing, to say the least. Under this opinion, school districts with similar insurance policies will have free rein to discharge tenured teachers under contract, knowing that their liability insurer will have to pay all attorney\u2019s fees to defend the administrative appeals, and will then have to pay all compensation and fringe benefits ultimately awarded if it turns out that the termination was not for good cause. This is a win-win, no-risk situation for the school district; there is simply no incentive not to roll the dice and fire teachers where good cause might be questionable or, perhaps, lacking altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The School District can breach an employment contract by firing the teacher without regard to whether there is good cause or not. If the teacher loses the administrative appeal, then the teacher is gone and the school district does not have to pay salary and benefits from and after termination. If the teacher wins the administrative appeal, then the teacher is gone or reinstated and the school district does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>have to pay salary and benefits from and after termination or, at least from and after termination through the point of reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">If, as the Court points out, citing <em>United Pacific Insurance Co. v. First Interstate Bancsystems of Montana, Inc. </em>(D. Mont. 1987), 664 F. Supp. 1390, 1394, \u201cthe purpose of liability insurance is to protect against risk,\u201d I am hard pressed to discover where, under the facts of this case, the School District assumed or incurred any risk at all. It paid in settlement <em>exactly </em>what it would have paid (interest excluded) had it not breached Anderson\u2019s employment agreement and had it, instead, continued her employment. Pacific is now required to indemnify the School District for the costs, attorney\u2019s fees and damages associated with the improper termination. And, the School District got rid of an unwanted teacher. There is no risk in that for the School District!</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Worse, that scenario certainly does not provide any incentive to a school board of trustees and to a school administration to insure that there is good cause before terminating a teacher\u2019s employment. In fact, quite the opposite is true. I cannot believe that it was realistically in the contemplation of either the insured or insurer that the referenced policy exclusion would be interpreted to allow such an absurd result. I do suspect, however, that there may be a few teachers in shaky relationships with their boards and administrations who should now begin looking over their shoulders.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">For the foregoing reasons, I would reverse the District Court and hold that the contract exclusion bars the School District\u2019s claim.</p>\n<judges id=\"b158-7\">JUSTICE GRAY concurs in the foregoing dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b158-8\">JUSTICE WEBER</author>\n<p id=\"AS6\">concurs in the foregoing dissent with the exception that he does not concur in the last four paragraphs of the dissent with regard to the potential for mischief which may be generated by the Court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
