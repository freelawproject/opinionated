Stenerson, Attorney at Law from Hamilton, Montana. The state was not represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-28\">Before hearing the application, the Defendant was advised that the Sentence Review Division has the authority not only to reduce the sentence or affirm it, but also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>to increase it if such is possible. The defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Sentence Review Division. The defendant acknowledged that he understood this and stated that he wished to proceed.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b549-7\">DATED this 24th day of September, 1993.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">After careful consideration, it is the unanimous decision of the Sentence Review Division that the sentence shall be affirmed except that the defendant shall be given credit for nine (9) years and four (4) months on successful probation. The Petitioner\u2019s sentence should be adjusted accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">The reason for the decision is to bring this sentence more in line with other revocations of a similar nature.</p>\n<judges id=\"b549-8\">Hon.
