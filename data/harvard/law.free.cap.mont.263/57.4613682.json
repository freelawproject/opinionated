The state was not represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Before hearing the application, the Defendant was advised that the Sentence Review Division has the authority not only to reduce the sentence or affirm it, but also to increase it if such is possible. The defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Sentence Review Division. The defendant acknowledged that he understood this and stated that he wished to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">After careful consideration, it is the unanimous decision of the Sentence Review Division that the sentence shall remain the same as originally imposed except for Count III. Count III shall be reduced from thirty (30) years to twenty (20) years. All other portions of the sentence shall remain unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">The reason for the decision is to bring the Aggravated Burglary charge more in line with other sentences of a similar nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">The Sentence Review Board took into consideration the minor injury that was inflicted upon the victim.</p>\n<judges id=\"b532-11\">Hon.
