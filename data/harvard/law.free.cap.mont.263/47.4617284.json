DC-87-159</docketnumber>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b521-18\">DATED this 7th day of May, 1993.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"Aej9\">DECISION</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b521-13\">On February 11, 1988, the Defendant was sentenced to Count I, ten (10) years for Felony Assault; Count II, forty (40) years for Mitigated Deliberate Homicide. Counts I and II shall be served concurrently to each other. The Defendant knowingly used a dangerous weapon and is sentenced to a term of ten (10) years. This sentence shall be served consecutively with the terms imposed for Count I and Count II. The additional ten (10) year sentence shall run concurrently on each Count, however. It was further ordered that the defendant is designated a Persistent Felony Offender, and the consecutive sentence imposed for use of a dangerous weapon is sufficient to also apply to the Persistent Felony Offender statute in Section 46-18-502, MCA. The Defendant is given credit for 252 days time served and is designated as a Dangerous Offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-14\">The Defendant was present and was represented by William Hritsco, Legal Intern from the Montana Defender Project. The state was not represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-15\">Before hearing the application, the Defendant was advised that the Sentence Review Division has the authority to increase the sentence, to leave it as it is, or reduce it. The defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from the decision of the Sentence Review Division. The defendant acknowledged that he understood this and stated that he wished to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-16\">After careful consideration, it is the unanimous decision of the Sentence Review Division that the sentence shall be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-17\">The reason for the decision is the sentence imposed by the District Court is presumed correct pursuant to Section 46-18-904(3), MCA. The Division finds that the reasons advanced for modification are insufficient to deem inadequate or excessive as required to overcome the presumption per Rule 17 of the Rules of the Sentence Review Division of the Montana Supreme Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b521-19\">Hon. Thomas McKittrick, Chairman, Hon. G. Todd Baugh, and Hon. John Warner, Judges</judges>\n<p id=\"b521-20\">The Sentence Review Board wishes to thank William Hritsco, Legal Intern from the Montana Defender Project for his assistance to the defendant and to this Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
