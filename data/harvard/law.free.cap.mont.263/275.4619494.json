In the present appeal, we are asked to determine whether the State has a valid indemnification claim against the guaranty association for $360,000 previously paid to an insurance company in settlement. We affirm the determination of the Fourth Judicial District Court, Missoula Comity, that the State\u2019s indemnification claim is a covered claim but conclude that the claim is statutorily limited to $300,000. A brief summary of the procedural history is necessary to understand the issues currently before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-12\">In 1979, several Washington potato farmers filed suit against William and Jensen Howell (the Howells) for selling seed potatoes infected with ring rot. They also filed against the Montana Potato Improvement Association (Potato Association) for certifying the seed potatoes and against two Washington warehouses. A Washington jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>found the Potato Association and the two warehouses jointly and severally hable in various degrees for $485,653.82 in damages and $1,451.06 in costs. The Howells were not found negligent, but the Washington court ordered the Howells to indemnify one of the warehouses because of a breach of warranty claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">In June of 1981, the First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County, issued a declaratory judgment finding that the Potato Association was an agent of the State and holding that the State\u2019s insurer, Glacier General Assurance Company (Glacier General), had a duty to defend and indemnify the Potato Association under the insurance contract between the State and Glacier General. The Washington plaintiffs subsequently filed their judgments with the First Judicial District Court and, in an order issued in August of 1983, that court recognized the validity of the foreign judgments against the Potato Association in the total amount of $485,653.82, plus costs and interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">In October of 1983, the Washington plaintiffs assigned their interests in the judgments to the Howells. The Howells used funds provided under a reservation of rights agreement by their insurer, Grange Insurance Association (Grange Insurance), to purchase the assignments. When Glacier General failed to pay the judgments, the Howells and Grange Insurance filed the present action in the Fourth Judicial District Court, Missoula County, seeking to enforce the judgments against the State, the Potato Association and Glacier General.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">After Glacier General was declared insolvent in the spring of 1985, the Montana Insurance Guaranty Association (MIGA) intervened to defend the State and the Potato Association under a reservation of rights, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 33-10-101 et seq., MCA, of the Montana Insurance Guaranty Association Act (the Act). On April 30,1987, the State, the Potato Association and MIGA entered into a written agreement concerning the defense and indemnity of Grange Insurance\u2019s claims against the three parties (1987 Agreement).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">On October 6,1988, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the State, the Potato Association and MIGA and against the Howells and Grange Insurance. It concluded that only Grange Insurance, and not the Howells, owned the foreign judgments and that, pursuant to the Act, an insurance company could not collect from either MIGA or the insureds of an insolvent insurance company. This Court concluded on appeal that, although the definition of \u201ccovered claim\u201d found in \u00a7 33-10-102(2)(b), MCA, does not include any amount due an insurer and, therefore, prohibited Grange Insurance from collecting from MIGA, the Act did not absolve the tortfeasors from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>judgments. Therefore, we reversed the summary judgment entered in favor of the State and the Potato Association. <em>Howell v. Glacier Gen. Assurance Co. </em>(1989), 240 Mont. 383, 387, 785 P.2d 1018, 1020 <em>(Howell </em>I). We directed the court to enter judgment against the Potato Association and to determine the amount of damages for which the State was liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">After the case was remanded, the District Court granted a motion by the State and the Potato Association (collectively hereafter the State) to file a third-party complaint against MIGA. The third-party complaint alleged that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-5\">[A]s was determined in a prior declaratory action, Cause No. 44186 ..., the State and [the Potato Association] were insureds of Glacier under the contract issued by Glacier. Also, as was determined in Cause No. 44186, Glacier owed the [Potato Association] a duty to defend and indemnify it under the terms of the applicable Glacier Insurance Company policy for the matters alleged by Grange Insurance. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">Under the provisions of the Montana Insurance Guarantee Act,... [MIGA] stands in the shoes of Glacier and [MIGA] has all rights, duties and obligations of Glacier concerning the State or the [Potato Association].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-7\">One purpose of the Guarantee Act is to avoid financial loss to insureds of insolvent insurers. Allowing an insurance company such as Grange Insurance to recover from the insured while refusing to allow the insured recovery from [MIGA] defeats this purpose of the Guarantee Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">The complaint sought a declaratory judgment that MIGA was obligated to indemnify the State for monies paid to Grange Insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">By this time, the amount of the judgment had increased through accruing of interest to well over a million dollars. Grange Insurance offered to settle for $360,000; the State offered to pay $180,000, provided that MIGA would match that figure. MIGA declined, maintaining that our decision in <em>Howell I </em>had absolved it of any liability to Grange Insurance. On June 22,1992, the District Court approved a settlement resolving all claims between Grange Insurance, the State and the Potato Association for $360,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">The State then filed a motion for summary judgment against MIGA for indemnification of the $360,000 settlement amount, plus costs and certain attorney\u2019s fees; MIGA responded with a cross-motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>summary judgment. The District Court granted summary judgment for the State, concluding that MIGA was liable for the $360,000 settlement amount under both the Act and the 1987 Agreement. The District Court denied the State\u2019s request for attorney's fees. Both parties appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Our standard in reviewing a grant of summary judgment is the same as that initially utilized by the trial court. <em>McCracken v. City of Chinook </em>(1990), 242 Mont. 21, 24, 788 P.2d 892, 894. Summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings, depositions, and other documents on file demonstrate that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P. Both parties agree that no genuine issues of material fact exist; indeed, both moved for summary judgment in the District Court on that basis. Therefore, our review is whether the District Court correctly interpreted the law. <em>Mooney v. Brennan </em>(1993), 257 Mont. 197, 199, 848 P.2d 1020, 1022.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The first issue before us is whether the State\u2019s claim against MIGA for indemnification of the $360,000 paid out as settlement monies in an action to enforce judgments against the State is a \u201ccovered claim\u201d as defined by the Act. MIGA raises two arguments to support its contention that the State\u2019s claim is not covered. First, it asserts that the claim has been paid and, therefore, cannot constitute a covered claim. Second, it asserts that the Act prohibits insurance companies from recovering against MIGA and the claim in the hands of the State is, in effect, an insurance subrogation claim. We will examine each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">The Act is patterned after the Post-Assessment Property and Liability Insurance Guaranty Association Model Act, which has been enacted in some form in forty-three states. <em>Palmer by Diacon v. Montana Ins. Guar. Ass\u2019n </em>(1989), 239 Mont. 78, 81, 779 P.2d 61, 63; \u00a7\u00a7 33-10-101 et seq., MCA, Part Compiler\u2019s Comments. The statutorily-stated purposes of the Act are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-7\">\u2022 to provide a mechanism for payment of covered claims under certain insurance policies to avoid excessive delay in payment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-9\">\u2022 <em>to avoid financial loss to claimants or policyholders because of the insolvency of an insurer-,</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-11\">\u2022 to assist in the detection and prevention of insurer insolvencies; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-12\">\u2022 to provide an association to assess the cost of such protection among insurers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>Section 33-10-101(2), MCA (emphasis added). The Act also provides that it is to be liberally construed to effectuate the above purposes and that the stated purposes constitute an aid and guide to interpretation. Section 33-10-101(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">MIGA is the nonprofit association of insurance companies statutorily created to carry out the purposes of the Act; membership in MIGA is a prerequisite to transacting insurance business in Montana. Section 33-10-103, MCA. Once an insurer is declared insolvent, MIGAsteps into the shoes of the insolvent insurer and \u201cis considered the insurer to the extent of its obligation on the covered claims and to that extent has all rights, duties, and obligations of the insolvent insurer as if the insurer had not become insolvent.\u201d Section 33-10-105(l)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">MIGA\u2019s primary statutory duty, insofar as relevant to this appeal, is to pay covered claims arising under an insurance policy issued by the insolvent insurer and unpaid prior to the insolvency. Section 33-10-105(l)(a)(i), MCA, and Commission Notes thereto. A \u201ccovered claim\u201d is defined in pertinent part as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-6\">an unpaid claim, including one for unearned premiums, which arises out of and is within the coverage and not in excess of the applicable limits of an insurance policy to which this part applies issued by an insurer, if such insurer becomes insolvent after July 1,1971....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ArC\">Section 33-10-102(2)(a), MCA. On appeal, MIGA primarily argues that the State\u2019s claim is not \u201cunpaid\u201d because Grange Insurance\u2019s claim has been paid by the State \u2014 albeit in the reduced settlement amount of $360,000. This contention incorrectly identifies the actual \u201cclaim\u201d at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Under the State\u2019s third-party complaint, the State, as the policyholder, sought indemnification under its insurance policy with Glacier General of settlement monies it had paid to Grange Insurance in the action brought to enforce judgments against it. The policy with Glacier General provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-8\">[Glacier General] shall pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay on account of any claim for breach of duty made against the insured if such negligent act, error or omission is committed during the policy period ... and [Glacier General] shall have the right and duty to defend any suit against the insured seeking damages on account of such breach of duty ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">In the 1981 declaratory judgment, the First Judicial District Court concluded that Glacier General had a duty to defend and indemnify the Potato Association under the terms of Glacier General\u2019s insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>contract with the State and stated that the Potato Association \u201cshall be indemnified by Glacier General. ...\u201d In the present action, the District Court determined that the State\u2019s claim for indemnity \u201carises out of and is within the coverage and not in excess of the applicable limits\u201d of the insurance policy between the State and Glacier General. MIGA does not dispute the question of coverage under Glacier General\u2019s policy on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Furthermore, the State\u2019s claim against MIGA for indemnification is, indeed, \u201cunpaid\u201d under the Act. MIGA\u2019s focus on the original claims \u2014 those originally held by the Washington plaintiffs and ultimately held by Grange Insurance \u2014 is misplaced. The only claim now before us is the State\u2019s indemnity claim against MIGA for $360,000. As discussed above, the claim arises out of and is within the coverage of the State\u2019s insurance policy with Glacier General. Glacier General, the State\u2019s insolvent insurer, did not pay this claim. Therefore, in the hands of the State as the policyholder asserting a claim under its policy, this claim remains \u201cunpaid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">As emphasized above, the purpose of the Act is for MIGA to pay \u201ccovered claims\u201d in order to avoid financial hardship for both policyholders and other claimants when an insurance company becomes insolvent. As an immediate result of Glacier General\u2019s insolvency, the State has suffered a direct loss of $360,000. It is undisputed that Glacier General would have been liable to the State in this amount had it not been declared insolvent. Upon Glacier General\u2019s insolvency, MIGA assumed the duties and obligations of Glacier General to the extent of \u201ccovered claims,\u201d including the duty to indemnify the State for the monies paid to Grange Insurance. Any other result would run contrary to the stated purpose of the Act to protect <em>\u201cpolicyholders\u201d </em>from insolvent insurers and would completely deprive the State of the benefit of its insurance contract with Glacier General.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">The cases cited by MIGA to support its argument that the State\u2019s claim was \u201cpaid\u201d are distinguishable. In <em>Florida Ins. Guar. Ass\u2019n v. Dolan </em>(Fla. App. 1978), 355 So.2d 141, an injured skier asserted a claim for $70,000 and obtained a judgment in that amount against a ski resort. The resort\u2019s insurer subsequently became insolvent and, faced with the threat of execution against the property, the ski resort placed $70,000 in an escrow account to which the skier had absolute and unconditional access. The injured skier then asserted a claim against the Florida Insurance Guaranty Association (FIGA). In that case, the Florida appellate court held that the skier\u2019s claim was not covered because it was not an unpaid claim. <em>Dolan, </em>355 So.2d at 142. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>The injured party had been paid the $70,000 and was not entitled to a double recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">In this case, the injured Washington plaintiffs have been paid and, under <em>Dolan, </em>would not be allowed to recover against MIGA. In <em>Dolan, </em>the Florida corut did not consider the question of whether the ski resort had a claim against FIGA; the ski resort was not a party to the suit. Therefore, although <em>Dolan </em>does not apply to our situation, it clarifies the meaning of \u201cunpaid\u201d in the definition of a covered claim. The adjective \u201cunpaid\u201d eliminates situations like <em>Dolan, </em>where a stranger to the insurance policy seeks some type of double recovery. It does not apply to this case, where an insured has paid out settlement monies and seeks indemnification from MIGA under its insurance policy and the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">MIGA also relies on <em>King Louie Bowling Corp. of Missouri v. Missouri Ins. Guar. Ass\u2019n </em>(Mo. App. 1987), 735 S.W.2d 35, which is factually similar to the case before us but, nonetheless, mandates a result opposite from that urged by MIGA. In <em>King Louie, </em>the injured plaintiffs refused to file suit against the Missouri guaranty association when the bowling alley\u2019s insurance company became insolvent. The bowling alley settled the claims and then filed claims against the association for indemnification. The Missouri Court of Appeals first explained that the purpose of the guaranty act was to protect insureds from the effects of insolvent insurers, a purpose which would be frustrated if an insured facing a judgment was denied protection from the association. <em>King Louie, </em>735 S.W.2d at 39. However, the insurance policy between the bowling alley and the insolvent insurance company did not provide for indemnification if a lawsuit was voluntarily settled before the insured became legally obligated to pay. Therefore, because the association stood in the shoes of the insurer, the association was not obligated to indemnify the bowling alley. <em>King Louie, </em>735 S.W.2d at 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">We are faced with the opposite situation in this case. It is undisputed that Glacier General would have been obligated to indemnify the State if it had not become insolvent. Moreover, unlike the bowling alley in <em>King Louie, </em>the State was legally obligated to Grange Insurance because of the judgments entered against it and our opinion in <em>Howell </em>7. As a result, <em>King Louie </em>does not support MIGA\u2019s contention that the State does not have a valid claim for indemnification. We conclude that the State\u2019s claim for indemnification is \u201cunpaid\u201d as defined by the Act, arises out of and is within the coverage of an insurance policy to which the Act applies and, thus, by definition, is a \u201ccovered claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>MIGA also argues that the claim is essentially an insurance subrogation claim and, therefore, under \u00a7 33-10-102(2)(b), MCA, the State cannot seek indemnity from MIGA. We disagree. Section 33-10-102(2)(b), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-4\">\u201cCovered claim\u201d shall not include any amount due a reinsurer, insurer, insurance pool, or underwriting association, as subrogation recoveries or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">MIGA concedes that neither the State nor the Potato Association is a reinsurer, insurer, insurance pool or underwriting association.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">The rules of statutory construction require the language of a statute to be construed according to its plain meaning; if the language is clear and unambiguous, no further interpretation is required. <em>GBN, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Revenue </em>(1991), 249 Mont. 261, 265, 815 P.2d 595, 597. Applying those principles, we conclude that \u00a7 33-10-102(2)(b), MCA, does not apply to this claim. The State is asserting its claim as the <em>insured, </em>the <em>policyholder, </em>under its insurance policy with Glacier General.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">Additionally, MIGA argues that our decision in <em>Howell I </em>requires us to conclude that the State\u2019s claim is not a covered claim. We disagree. In <em>Howell I, </em>we explicitly stated that the Act prohibited an insurance company, Grange Insurance, from recovering subrogation benefits from MIGA based on \u00a7 33-10-102(2)(b), MCA. We also stated that Grange Insurance was not prohibited from recovering from the State and the Potato Association as tortfeasors. <em>Howell </em>I,785 P.2d at 1020. We did not address the issue of whether the State and the Potato Association could recover from MIGA on a separate indemnification claim. As emphasized above, the present claim arises from the State\u2019s third-party complaint against MIGA based on the State\u2019s insurance contract with Glacier General; the third-party complaint was filed after our decision <em>iaHowell I </em>and is unrelated to the issues resolved in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">In sum, we conclude that the State\u2019s claim against MIGA for indemnification of the $360,000 is a \u201ccovered claim\u201d under \u00a7 33-10-102(2)(a), MCA. As a result, we need not discuss issues raised by the State concerning the contractual waiver of MIGA\u2019s defenses and alleged constitutional violations. However, two final issues remain for our review: we must determine whether the Act limits MIGA\u2019s liability to $300,000 for this claim and whether the State is entitled to certain attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">Regarding the limitation issue, the District Court recognized that \u00a7 33-10-105(l)(a)(ii), MCA, limits MIGA\u2019s liability for each covered claim to $300,000. It reasoned, however, that the original claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>against the Howells involved ten separate plaintiffs and concluded that the statutory limitation did not apply. We conclude that the court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">As discussed above, the State holds and asserts one covered claim against MIGA \u2014 the indemnification claim which would have been submitted to Glacier General under its insurance contract absent Glacier General\u2019s insolvency. Section 33-10-105(l)(a)(ii), MCA, is clear and unambiguous: it expressly limits MIGA\u2019s liability to $300,000 for each covered claim. We conclude, therefore, that the State\u2019s indemnification claim is limited to $300,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">As a final matter, the State argues that it is entitled to recover attorney\u2019s fees incurred in defending against the claims of Grange Insurance after MIGA withdrew its defense. On February 15, 1990, this Court denied the petition for rehearing in <em>Howell I, </em>which held that Grange Insurance could not recover from MIGA. One month later, MIGA sent notice to the State and the Potato Association that it was withdrawing its defense in the matter, asserting that this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Howell I </em>absolved it of any further obligation to indemnify the State or the Potato Association as a result of the claims made by Grange Insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Regarding this issue, the District Court concluded that, under the Act, MIGA had a duty to defend the insured and to accept a reasonable settlement offer in appropriate cases. It then determined that MIGA\u2019s decision to withdraw its defense based on <em>Howell I </em>was in bad faith because <em>Howell I </em>did not address the issue of MIGA\u2019s obligation to the State. Therefore, the court concluded that MIGA breached the 1987 Agreement and violated the Act by refusing to defend the State. However, the District Court went on to explain that \u00a7 33-10-110, MCA, which grants MIGAimmunity from liability for all actions done in the performance of its duties, provided MIGA with complete immunity from damages resulting from the breach of a statutory or contractual duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">The longstanding rule in Montana is that, absent statutory or contractual authority, attorney\u2019s fees will not be awarded. <em>Goodover v. Lindey\u2019s, Inc. </em>(1992), 255 Mont. 430, 445, 843 P.2d 765, 774; <em>Bitney v. School Dist. No. 44 </em>(1975), 167 Mont. 129, 137, 535 P.2d <em>1273, 1211; Ehly v. Cady </em>(1984), 212 Mont. 82, 100, 687 P.2d 687, 696. If such authority exists, the awarding of attorney's fees is a matter of the district court\u2019s discretion. <em>Grenfell v. Duffy </em>(1982), 198 Mont. 90, 96, 643 P.2d 1184, 1187. Our review of a district court\u2019s legal conclusion that no basis for attorney\u2019s fees exists, however, is plenary. <em>See Steer, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Revenue </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 470, 474-75, 803 P.2d 601, 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>It is clear that neither the State\u2019s insurance policy with Glacier General, the 1987 Agreement, nor the Act specifically authorize an award of attorney\u2019s fees to the State. The State does not contend otherwise. Thus, the State has not established a basis upon which attorney\u2019s fees ordinarily could be awarded in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">The State argues, however, and the District Court agreed, that MIGA violated the Act and breached the 1987 Agreement by withdrawing its defense. Thus, according to the State, the damages it sustained in the form of attorney\u2019s fees incurred in defending against the Grange Insurance judgments are recoverable. In this case, we need not address whether the District Court correctly found breaches of both MIGA\u2019s statutory and contractual duties. Regardless of whether MIGA breached the 1987 Agreement or violated the Act, the District Court correctly determined that the State is not entitled to recovery of the attorney\u2019s fees it seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">We note initially that the attorneys fees sought do not come within the statutory definition of a covered claim contained in \u00a7 33-10-102, MCA. Glacier General\u2019s policy does not contain an attorneys fees provision; thus, the fees do not \u201carise out of\u2019 and fall \u201cwithin the coverage\u201d of an insurance policy to which the Act applies. Section 33-10-102(2)(a), MCA. Therefore, MIGA\u2019s statutory duty to pay covered claims does not apply to these attorneys fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">In addition, the attorneys fees sought by the State are in the nature of damages for breach of both statutory and contractual duties separate and apart from its covered claim. However, nothing in the Act imposes liability on MIGA for such damages. Indeed, we agree with the District Court that \u00a7 33-10-110, MCA, provides MIGA with immunity from liability for the attorneys fees in this case. Section 33-10-110, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-7\">[tjhere shall be no liability on the part of and no cause of action of any nature shall arise against any member insurer, the association or its insurance producers or employees, the board of directors, or the commissioner or his representatives for any action taken by them in the performance of their powers and duties under this part.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">Statutes must be construed according to the plain meaning of their language. <em>Norfolk Holdings, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Revenue </em>(1991), 249 Mont. 40, 43, 813 P.2d 460, 461. Further, it is our duty to interpret individual sections of an act in such a manner as to ensure coordination with the other sections of the act. <em>State v. Meader </em>(1979), 184 Mont. 32, 37, 601 P.2d 386, 389. In doing so, a statute will not be interpreted to defeat its evident object or purpose; the legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>objective is of prime consideration in interpreting statutes. <em>Lewis and Clark County v. Dep\u2019t of Commerce </em>(1986), 224 Mont. 223, 227, 728 P.2d 1348, 1351.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">On its face, \u00a7 33-10-110, MCA, could be read to preclude the assertion of <em>any </em>liability against MIGA, even the statutory obligation to pay covered claims imposed by \u00a7 33-10-105(l)(a), MCA. Such an interpretation, however, would render the entirety of the Act, and its primary purpose of avoiding financial loss to claimants or policyholders caused by the insolvency of an insurer, a nullity. <em>See Lewis and Clark, </em>728 P.2d at 1351. We decline to interpret \u00a7 33-10-110, MCA, in such a manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">On the other hand, the legislature clearly intended to preclude liability for, and claims based on, actions taken by MIGA in the performance of its duties. Section 33-10-110, MCA. Reading this statute together with the purposes of the Act and MIGA\u2019s clear statutory duty under \u00a7 33-10-105, MCA, to pay covered claims, we conclude that the legislature intended to preclude liability against MIGA for claims other than \u201ccovered claims\u201d as defined in the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Although we have not interpreted \u00a7 33-10-110, MCA, previously, other states have concluded that similar versions of the guaranty act provide immunity for guaranty associations from those claims which do not qualify as \u201ccovered claims.\u201d In <em>Pannell v. Missouri Ins. Guar. Ass\u2019n </em>(Mo. App. 1980), 595 S.W.2d 339, for example, the insured brought a claim against the Missouri Insurance Guaranty Association for \u201cvexatious refusal to pay,\u201d a statutory cause of action under the Missouri Insurance Code. In concluding that the trial court erred in submitting the claim to the jury, the Missouri Court of Appeals focused on the tightly restricted authority of the association that required it to pay only \u201ccovered claims\u201d and the immunity provision that insulated the association from liability for actions taken by it in the performance of its powers and duties. <em>Pannell, </em>595 S.W.2d at 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">In <em>Vaughn v. Vaughn </em>(Wash. App. 1979), 597 P.2d 932, the Washington court held that damages for bad faith did not constitute a \u201ccovered claim\u201d under the guaranty act. Therefore, the guaranty association was not liable for such damages. <em>Vaughn, </em>597 P.2d at 934. The Maryland Court of Appeals similarly concluded that although attorney\u2019s fees were available under the Public Information Act, the immunity provision of the guaranty act precluded an award of attorney\u2019s fees against the Maryland Insurance Guaranty Association. <em>A. S. Abell Publishing Co. v. Mezzanote </em>(Md. 1983), 464 A.2d 1068, 1075.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Further, in <em>Isaacson v. California Ins. Guar. Ass\u2019n </em>(Cal. 1988), 750 P.2d 297, the insured sued the California Insurance Guaranty Association (CIGA) for compensatory and punitive damages under three tort theories. The Supreme Court of California held that the legislative intent behind California\u2019s Guaranty Act indicated that CIGA was immune from tort liability for its conduct relating to the handling of the claims under all three theories. Focusing on CIGA\u2019s limited authority to disburse funds only for \u201ccovered claims\u201d and to collect only those funds necessary for the payment of \u201ccovered claims,\u201d the court reasoned that CIGA did not stand in the shoes of the insolvent insurer for all purposes, but only regarding \u201ccovered claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">Finally, we agree with the rationale expressed by the Mississippi Supreme Court in <em>Bobby Kitchens, Inc. v. Mississippi Ins. Guar. Ass\u2019n </em>(Miss. 1989), 560 So.2d 129. In concluding that the immunity provision precluded punitive damages against the guaranty association, the Mississippi court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-5\">It does appear that MIGA received protection from the statutory limitations and restrictions ... This protection is not unintended by the legislative enactment.... The sole purpose of the statute [the act] is to protect the insured from insolvent insurance companies and to require the financially healthy insurance companies to involuntarily contribute to protect the public. The statutes are of good purpose. Because of MIGA\u2019s involuntary nature the Legislature rightfully placed limitations on the liabilities of Association members.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-6\"><em>Bobby Kitchens, </em>560 So.2d at 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Applied to this case, MIGA is liable for the covered claim under the State\u2019s insurance policy with Glacier General, as provided in \u00a7\u00a7 33-10-102 and -105, MCA. MIGA is not, and cannot be, liable for the attorney\u2019s fees requested by the State because those fees do not constitute a covered claim, as defined in \u00a7 33-10-102, MCA, and MIGA is immune from other liability for its actions pursuant to \u00a7 33-10-110, MCA. We hold that the District Court did not err in concluding that the State could not recover the attorney\u2019s fees it incurred in defending against Grange Insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded for further orders consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b310-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES HARRISON, TRIEWEILER, HUNT, NELSON and WEBER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
