In this action she alleged that she was the mother and defendant, the father of said child. Thereafter petitioner served upon plaintiff in said action notice of a motion for a change of venue to the county of his residence, to wit, San Diego County, California. Subsequent thereto plaintiff Roberts filed a motion for allowance of support money, attorney\u2019s fees, and costs <em>pendente lite. </em>March 6, 1940, respondent made an order requiring petitioner to pay support money, attorney\u2019s fees, and costs <em>pendente lite, </em>and further ordered that, unless the order was complied with within fifteen days from the date thereof, petitioner\u2019s motion for change of venue would be denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-12\">This is the sole question to be determined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>\n<em>Was respondent\u2019s order requiring the payment of support money, attorney\u2019s fees, and costs pendente lite prior to the determination of petitioner\u2019s motion for a change of venue void?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">This question must be answered in the affirmative. It is the established law of California that the filing of a motion for the change of place of trial suspends the power of the trial court to act upon any other question until the motion has been determined <em>(Nolan </em>v. <em>McDuffie, </em>125 Cal. 334, 336 [58 Pac. <em>4]; Hennessy </em>v. <em>Nicol, </em>105 Cal. 138, 142 [38 Pac. 649]; <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>44 Cal. App. 31, 32 [185 Pac. 998]; <em>Pickwick Stages System </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>138 Cal. App. 448, 449 [32 Pac. (2d) 433]) and that any order made prior to the determination of the motion for a change of place of trial is a nullity <em>(Nolan </em>v. <em>McDuffie, supra, </em>p. 337).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Section 396b of the Code of Civil Procedure has no application to an action under the provisions of section 196a of the Civil Code. The latter code section pertains to support money for a child born out of wedlock, while section 396b of the Code of Civil Procedure has application to actions for divorce and separate maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Applying the foregoing rules to the facts of the instant case, it appears that respondent, having failed to pass upon petitioner\u2019s motion for a change of venue, the order of March 6, 1940, for support money, attorney\u2019s fees, and costs <em>pendente lite </em>was a nullity. Therefore, petitioner is entitled to the relief he seeks, and it is ordered that a writ issue as prayed in his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">Moore, P. J., and Wood, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
