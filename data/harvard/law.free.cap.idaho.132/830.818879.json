Evans, </em>129 Idaho 274, 276-79, 923 P.2d 981, 983-86 (1996) <em>(Hummer </em>I). Briefly, however, Hummer brought a claim against the Respondents, Jerry L. Evans (Evans), the Idaho Department of Education (Department), and the Idaho State Board of Education (Board) after being fired from her position as a consultant on Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) education with the Department. While working as the AIDS consultant, Hummer was subpoenaed to testify at a sentence reduction hearing for a convict who Hummer believed would be helpful as a speaker for AIDS awareness. Due to scheduling difficulties, Hummer did not testify and instead wrote a letter on Department letterhead in support of the convict. On February 27,1992, Evans, the former State Superintendent of Public Instruction, terminated Hummer, citing the letter as the basis for her termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-17\">Hummer then filed a claim alleging various tort and contract claims arising out of the circumstances surrounding her termination. Hummer\u2019s complaint requested costs and attorney fees pursuant to I.R.C.P. 54, I.C. \u00a7 12-117, I.C. \u00a7 12-121 and \u201csuch other laws as may apply.\u201d Following a bench trial on the claim, the district judge held that Hummer\u2019s termination was in violation of public policy and awarded Hummer $10,349.71 together with prejudgment interest, which was the amount she would have received in wages through the end of June 1992. <em>Hummer I, </em>129 Idaho at 278, 923 P.2d at 985. Hummer then made a timely application for attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-121.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-18\">On May 14, 1994, Hummer filed a Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment, requesting the district judge apply tort principles for the damage calculations and increase the award of damages to an amount of $85,480. In a subsequent memorandum, Hummer again renewed her request for attorney fees pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-121. At a hearing on Hummer\u2019s motions, the district judge clarified that the case did not fall under tort law. Subsequent<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>ly, the district judge awarded Hummer additional damages, however, the judge declined to award attorneys fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-117 or I.C. \u00a7 12-121, determining the defendant\u2019s position was not so unreasonable as to warrant awarding attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 \u00a7 12-117 and 12-121; that there was no prior authority on the issue in the case; and the defendant had not taken an unreasonable or frivolous position on the issue of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">Evans appealed the district judge\u2019s decision to this Court but did not appeal the denial of attorney fees. On appeal, this Court held that Hummer\u2019s termination for responding to a court-issued subpoena was a violation of public policy and provided the basis for a claim of wrongful termination. The Court then clarified that a cause of action for wrongful termination in violation of public policy is based on breach of contract, not tort, and stated that \u201cHummer is entitled to contract damages based on the Department\u2019s wrongful termination of her in violation of public policy.\u201d The Court reversed the award of additional damages because Hummer had not proven her damages with \u201creasonable certainty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 280-81, 923 P.2d at 987-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">Following this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hummer I, </em>Hummer filed a Renewed Motion for Attorney Fees and asserted a right to attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3). Hummer based her motion on this Court\u2019s clarification in <em>Hummer I </em>that a cause of action for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy is a contract claim. The district judge denied Hummer\u2019s motion determining that, because Hummer had never made a motion for attorney fees based on I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3), argued for a tort measure of damages in the case, and never appealed the failure to award attorney fees based on I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3), the judge was without power to award fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3). Hummer appealed the denial of her motion to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b880-8\">A. The district judge was without jurisdiction to consider Hummer\u2019s request for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-9\">Hummer contends that the district judge incorrectly determined that she was without power to award attorney fees. Hummer\u2019s main argument is based on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>J.R. Simplot Co. v. Chemetics International, Inc., </em>130 Idaho 255, 258, 939 P.2d 574, 577 (1997), where we held that on remand, the issue of attorney fees was \u201ca subsidiary issue fairly comprised therein.\u201d In the first appeal brought by Chemetics, this Court had reversed jury verdicts on two counts in favor of Simplot. Simplot had cross appealed, challenging the method by which the district judge had awarded its attorney, fees. The Court held that the district judge had not abused his discretion in calculating the award of fees to Simplot. However, because the verdict had been reversed against Simplot on two counts, the Court remanded the case back to the district court to determine which part of the fees were attributable to Simplot as the prevailing party. <em>Id. </em>at 256-557, 939 P.2d at 575-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-11\">Chemetics filed a Petition for Rehearing seeking clarification of the opinion which the Court declined to hear. An Amended Remittitur was issued which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-12\">IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the District Court shall forthwith comply with the directive of the Opinion, if any action is required; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-13\">IT is FURTHER ORDERED that costs are allowed to Appellants. No attorney fees on appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b880-14\"><em>Id. </em>at 557, 939 P.2d at 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-15\">On remand, the district judge reduced the original award of attorney fees to Simplot. Chemetics then sought an award of costs and attorney fees as the prevailing party. The district judge determined that he did not have the authority to consider Chemetics\u2019 motion and Chemetics again appealed. <em>Id. </em>In the second appeal, this Court held that when the Court reversed part of the verdict, relieving Chemetics of liability, the question of attorney fees was a \u201csubsidiary issue fairly comprised therein.\u201d The Court held that on remand, the district judge had jurisdiction to consider whether Chemetics was the prevailing party and to make an award of costs and attorney fees. <em>Id. </em>at 258, 939 P.2d at 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>In this case, however, the issue of attorney fees was not a \u201csubsidiary issue fairly comprised therein.\u201d In <em>Hummer I, </em>we held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Au7\">The district court\u2019s conclusion that Hummer\u2019s termination was a violation of public policy is affirmed. She is entitled to the initial award of damages and costs. The district court\u2019s grant of additur damages is reversed. Each party has prevailed in part on appeal. No costs or attorney fees are awarded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b881-4\"><em>Hummer, </em>129 Idaho at 281, 923 P.2d at 988. The Remittitur stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-5\">IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the District Court shall forthwith comply with the directive of the Opinion, if any action is required; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-6\">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that no costs or attorney fees are allowed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">After the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hummer I, </em>the only action within the jurisdiction of the district judge was the ministerial act of entering any amended judgment necessary as a result of this Court\u2019s ruling reversing the damages award. The district judge did not, as Hummer appears to argue, have the power to revisit discretionary issues of the case simply because the Remittitur allowed the district judge to comply with \u201cthe directive of the Opinion, if any action is required.\u201d Indeed, the language of the Remittitur provides that the opinion of the Court directs whether any continuing jurisdiction of the district judge exists. In this ease, our ruling did not open the door for the district judge to address substantive issues in the case. This case is unlike <em>Chemetics, </em>where our reversal of the verdict in the first appeal in and of itself changed the prevailing party and thus granted the district judge jurisdiction to address any issue, like attorney fees, that was related to the result in the appeal. In contrast, the implicit holding of <em>Hummer I </em>was that the district judge would have no jurisdiction to do anything other than enter an amended judgment. Jurisdiction to address a subsidiary issue such as attorney fees did not arise as a result of our holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">As we recently noted in <em>Walters v. Industrial Indemnity Company, </em>130 Idaho 836, 949 P.2d 223 (1997):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-9\">Where the appellate court remands a cause with directions to enter judgment for one of the parties, the judgment of the appellate court is a final judgment in the cause, and the entry thereof in the lower court is a <em>purely ministerial act. </em>... A trial court has no authority to enter any judgment or order not in conformity with the order of the appellate court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b881-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 837, 949 P.2d at 224 (quoting <em>Mountain Home Lumber Co. v. Swartwout, </em>33 Idaho 737, 740-41, 197 P. 1027, 1028 (1921)) (emphasis added). Accordingly, the trial court did not have jurisdiction to address any issues following our decision in <em>Hummer I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b881-11\">B. Attorney fees on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-12\">Hummer requests attorney fees on appeal pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3). Section 12-120(3) of the Idaho Code requires that the court hearing any action arising out of a contract for services award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party. This Court has interpreted I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3) to mandate the award of attorney fees on appeal as well as at trial. <em>Chemetics, </em>130 Idaho at 258, 939 P.2d at 577. Here, Hummer is not the prevailing party on appeal and therefore, we decline to award her attorney fees on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-13\">Evans also asserts a right to attorney fees and costs on appeal based on I.A.R. 40, I.A.R. 41, I.C. \u00a7 12-120 and I.C. \u00a7 12-121. As stated above, this Court has held that I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3) mandates the award of attorney fees on appeal to the prevailing party. Additionally, costs are properly awarded to the prevailing party on appeal pursuant to I.A.R. 40. <em>Sammis v. Magnetek, Inc., </em>130 Idaho 342, 353, 941 P.2d 314, 325 (1997). Evans is the prevailing party on appeal and thus attorney fees and costs on appeal are appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-14\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-15\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b881-16\">The district judge was without jurisdiction to address Hummer\u2019s request for attorney fees following our decision in <em>Hummer I. </em>Accordingly, we affirm the ruling of the district judge. We award costs and attorney fees on appeal to Evans.</p>\n<judges id=\"b882-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>Justices SILAK, SCHROEDER, KID WELL and Justice Pro Tem McDermott, concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
