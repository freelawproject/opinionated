Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b845-25\">Respondent Charles Doan (Doan) was convicted of burglary and manufacturing a controlled substance on November 20, 1990, and was sentenced to three years in prison in Lemhi County Case No. 289. (Lemhi I). That same day, Doan was also sentenced to three years indeterminate for a felony escape charge, Lemhi County Case No. 298. (Lemhi II). While on parole in 1995, Doan was charged with one count of grand theft by possession of stolen property and one count of felony eluding in Elmore County Case No. 96-00008. (Elmore I). While facing these charges, Doan escaped from the Elmore County Jail on March 3, 1996. Doan was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>apprehended that same day and charged once again with felony escape in Elmore County Case No. 96-00020. (Elmore II).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">On March 5,1996, Doan entered a Rule 11 plea agreement with prosecutors in which he would serve a one-year fixed, four-year indeterminate sentence for each of the Elmore I charges. These two sentences were to \u201crun concurrent.\u201d The judgment and commitment executing the plea agreement was entered on April 4, 1996. On September 18, 1996, Doan was given an eighteen-month fixed sentence for the Elmore II escape conviction. The judgment and commitment stated that this sentence was \u201cto run consecutive to his present confinement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">Doan\u2019s sentence schedule was subsequently recalculated by IDOC. According to IDOC\u2019s official time computation report, dated March 26, 1997, the fixed portion of the Elmore I sentence would interrupt the remainder of the Lemhi II escape sentence and run from April 4, 1996 to April 4, 1997. The Lemhi II sentence would then resume, expiring on September 25, 1997. Upon the completion of Lemhi II, Doan would then serve the indeterminate portion of the Elmore I sentence; which would run until September 25, 2001. The Elmore II escape sentence would then commence, expiring March 25, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">On March 14, 1997, Doan filed a pro se motion for correction of the Elmore II sentence, which he claimed was illegal. On March 21, 1997, District Judge Joel D. Horton, who presided over the Elmore II proceedings, issued a memorandum opinion and order clarifying the judgment of conviction. Judge Horton, while noting that the motion was \u201cunclear\u201d as to the relief Doan sought, amended the judgment of conviction to reflect that the sentence in Elmore I would run consecutive to \u201cany other sentence for which defendant was incarcerated as of April 4, 1996.\u201d The order also stated; \u201cPursuant to statute, the [Elmore II] escape charge ... in which a sentence of eighteen months fixed was imposed, shall run consecutive to any other sentence for which he was imprisoned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">According to this order, Doan would finish serving his Lemhi II sentence, followed by his Elmore I and II sentences, each to be served consecutively. Judge Horton also stated that if Doan continued to be dissatisfied, the appropriate remedy would be an application for a writ of habeas corpus, rather than a motion for correction of sentence under Idaho Criminal Rule 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">B. Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b846-10\">Doan commenced the present litigation by filing a petition for writ of habeas corpus on April 24, 1997. In the petition, Doan argued that he should serve the Elmore II escape sentence consecutive to the Lemhi II escape sentence. Doan alleged that IDOC was \u201cattempting to manipulate his sentence structure\u201d to require that Doan serve the sentence from Elmore I before serving the eighteen-month Elmore II sentence. Doan argued that this sentence was improper because he \u201cwas sentenced to serve those sentences consecutive to the turm [sic] I have completed, not consecutive to eachother [sic].\u201d Doan further argued that the Elmore I and II sentences were given neither consecutive nor concurrent to each other, but were nonetheless intended to \u201ccommence on the same date and time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b846-11\">The state objected to Doan\u2019s petition, arguing that IDOC\u2019s sentence calculations were correct because section 18-2505 of the Idaho Code required that the escape sentence commence at the time Doan \u201cwould have otherwise been discharged.\u201d The state further argued, in response to the magistrate court\u2019s request for clarification, that the term \u201cdischarged\u201d contemplated \u201cthe full completion of all legal obligations by a prisoner, including incarceration and parole.\u201d The state supported this interpretation of I.C. \u00a7 18-2505 by calling upon \u201cgeneral principles of statutory construction,\u201d including the doctrine of <em>in pari materia. </em>By considering how the term \u201cdischarge\u201d was defined in other criminal statutes, the state concluded that \u201cthe sentencing of a defendant in a criminal case to a fixed sentence for the crime of escape has the effect of \u2018fixing\u2019 the indeterminate portion of any other sentence he would serve before serving the escape sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b847-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>On, September 23, 1997, the magistrate court issued an order granting partial habeas corpus relief. The court ordered IDOC to \u201crevise\u201d their calculations to reflect that the fixed eighteen-month Elmore II sentence would expire on September 25, 1997. The magistrate reached this result by following Attorney General Opinion No. 92-1, which states that when a person is sentenced to consecutive sentences for multiple offenses, with a fixed and indeterminate term in each sentence, the two fixed terms are served first. The indeterminate terms are then added together, during which the prisoner is eligible for parole consideration. Since the fixed portion of Elmore I would have expired just two days after the magistrate division issued its decision, the magistrate did not address the issue of whether the Elmore I sentence interrupted the remainder of the Lemhi II sentence. The magistrate held that the eighteen-month sentence for Elmore II would commence on September 25, 1997, and expire on March 25,1999. At that point, the four-year indeterminate sentence would commence and expire on March 3, 2003. Doan would be eligible for parole throughout the indeterminate term of the Elmore I sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\">On October 3,1997, the state filed a motion to alter or amend judgment under Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e). Judge Hay denied the motion on October 20, 1997. One week later, the state filed a notice of appeal to the district court, under I.R.C.P. 83(f). The issue on appeal was whether the magistrate court erred \u201cwhen it granted habeas corpus relief to [Doan] based on the magistrate\u2019s finding that [Doan\u2019s] sentence for escape, pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 18-2505 ... need not be served consecutive to the entirety, including fixed and indeterminate portions, of [Doan\u2019s] concurrent sentences\u201d imposed in Elmore II.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">On February 3, 1998, District Judge Robert G. Newhouse, who presided over the appeal, issued a Memorandum Decision and Order. Judge Newhouse held the following: \u201cIt is this court\u2019s determination that the magistrate erred as a matter of law in not holding that Lemhi II runs concurrently with Elmore I. The Parole Commission has the authority to release the Petitioner from further service on his Elmore I sentence after serving the one year fixed. After Elmore I has been satisfied, the Petitioner will begin serving his fixed term pursuant to Elmore II.\u201d Judge Newhouse remanded to the magistrate court for recalculation of Doan\u2019s sentences. On February 12,1998, the state filed a Notice of Appeal from the district court\u2019s decision and order.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">ISSUES ON APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b847-10\">The issues on appeal are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-11\">1. Whether the district court erred in finding that the grand theft sentence from Elmore County was to be served concurrently with the escape sentence from Lemhi County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-12\">2. Whether a fixed escape sentence imposed under I.C. \u00a7 18-2505 automatically \u201cfixes\u201d the indeterminate portion of the sentence imposed for the felony during which the escape occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b847-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-14\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b847-15\">When reviewing the decision of a district court acting in its appellate capacity over a magistrate court, the Supreme Court reviews the magistrate\u2019s decision independently of, but with due regard for, the district court\u2019s intermediate appellate decision. <em>See Henderson v. Smith, </em>128 Idaho 444, 447, 915 P.2d 6, 9 (1996); <em>Balderson v. Balderson, </em>127 Idaho 48, 51, 896 P.2d 956, 959 (1995). The findings of the magistrate will be upheld by this Court, if they are supported by substantial, competent evidence in the record. <em>See Balderson, </em>127 Idaho at 51, 896 P.2d at 959. Issues of law encountered on such review are freely considered by the Supreme Court. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b847-16\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-17\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b847-18\">A. The District Court Erred In Holding That The Grand Theft Sentence From Elmore County Was To Be Served Concurrently With The Escape Sentence From Lemhi County.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-19\">On appeal from the magistrate court, the district court held that the sentences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>from Lemhi II and Elmore I run concurrent to each other because \u201cwithin Elmore I there is no provision by the Court to have the sentence served after the Lemhi II escape sentence.\u201d The district court erred in considering this issue. The only issue on appeal to the district court was whether the magistrate erred by not ruling that the entire Elmore I sentence, \u201cincluding determinate and indeterminate portions\u201d be served before the Elmore II escape sentence could' begin. The issue of whether the Elmore I and Lemhi II sentences should be served concurrently was not raised on appeal. This Court holds that the district court erred when it held the Elmore I sentence should be served concurrently with the Lemhi II sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">The district court remanded the case to the magistrate division with instructions to recalculate Doan\u2019s sentence. The magistrate court issued an order recalculating the sentence on February 18, 1998, after the state had filed its notice of appeal on February, 12, 1998. Since the order was entered after the notice of this appeal was filed, the order recalculating the sentence is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">B. The Magistrate Court Correctly Determined That The Escape Sentence Did Not \u201cFix\u201d The Indeterminate Portion Of The Grand Theft And Felony Eluding Sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">The magistrate court held that Doan would first serve the fixed portions of his consecutive sentences, followed by the indeterminate portion imposed for his conviction in Elmore I. The magistrate relied on Attorney General Opinion 92-1, which states that under the Unified Sentencing Act, section 19-2513 of the Idaho Code, a person who is sentenced to consecutive sentences for multiple offenses, with a fixed and indeterminate term in each sentence, should serve the two fixed terms first. The indeterminate sentences would then follow, during which the prisoner may become eligible for parole at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">The state contends this ruling was erroneous. The state argues that this issue revolves around the \u201cinterplay\u201d between the escape statute, I.C. \u00a7 18-2505, and the Unified Sentencing Act, I.C. \u00a7 19-2513. The Unified Sentencing Act, in pertinent part, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-10\">[I]f consecutive sentences are imposed for multiple offenses, the court shall, if required by statute, direct that ... each consecutive sentence contain a minimum period of confinement; in such event, all minimum terms of confinement shall be served before any indeterminate periods commence to run.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b848-11\">I.C. \u00a7 19-2513. In other words, where consecutive sentences are imposed, the fixed portions are to be served together, followed by any indeterminate terms of imprisonment. Meanwhile, I.C. \u00a7 18-2505 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-12\">Every prisoner charged with, convicted of, or on probation for a felony who is confined in any jail or prison ... who escapes or attempts to escape ... shall be guilty of a felony, and upon conviction thereof, <em>any such second term of imprisonment shall commence at the time he ivould otherwise have been discharged.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b848-13\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-14\">The state argues that there is a conflict between the two statutes, and that in such cases the more specific statute should govern. <em>See City of Sandpoint v. Sandpoint Indep. Highway Dist., </em>126 Idaho 145, 149, 879 P.2d 1078, 1082 (1994). The state further argues that the Unified Sentencing Act is a general statute governing all offenses, while I.C. \u00a7 18-2505 is a more specific statute governing sentences for felony escape. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>Therefore, the state argues that the language from I.C. \u00a7 18-2505 should govern.</p>\n<p id=\"A2A2\">In order for the language of I.C. 8 18-2505 to be satisfied, the state contends, \u201cthe imposition of a fixed sentence for Escape has the <em>effect of </em>\u2018fixing\u2019 the indeterminate portion of any other sentence the prisoner is required to serve before the escape sentence.\u201d The state argues the indeterminate sentence becomes fixed because I.C. 8 18-2505 states that the \u201csecond term of imprisonment shall commence at the time [the prisoner] would otherwise have been discharged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AiT\">The state further contends that the proper interpretation of the escape statute \u201chinges upon the meaning of \u2018discharge.\u2019 \u201d The state correctly observes that I.C. \u00a7 18-2505 does not define \u201cdischarge,\u201d and there are no cases defining the term in this context.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The state argues under the principle of <em>in pari materia </em>that the use of the term \u201cdischarge\u201d in other criminal statutes contemplates \u201cthe full completion of a prisoner\u2019s sentence, including imprisonment as well as successful completion of probation or parole.\u201d The state provides four examples of criminal statutes discussing \u201cdischarge\u201d in a number of contexts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The state claims it seeks \u201cto do no more than follow the legislature\u2019s intent and purpose in applying I.C. \u00a7 18-2505 to Doan\u2019s sentence calculation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Axq\">The state argues that by using the term \u201cdischarge,\u201d the legislature clearly intended 1.C. \u00a7 18-2505 to imply the following: \u201cIf the sentence imposed by a court under this section is a fixed sentence, then any underlying indeterminate sentence shall automatically become a fixed sentence. If, however, the court imposes an indeterminate sentence for a conviction under this section, the underlying indeterminate sentence will remain indeterminate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ApJ\">In fact, the language in I.C. \u00a7 18-2505 has been construed more narrowly. In <em>State v. Mendenhall, </em>the Court of Appeals held, in view of substantial legislative history, that I.C. \u00a7 18-2505 requires \u201cany confinement under an escape sentence, and any confinement upon the felony for which the defendant was in custody when he escaped, to be consecutive.\u201d 106 Idaho 388, 393, 679 P.2d 665, 670 (Ct.App.1984). The Court of Appeals also noted that the mandate of I.C. \u00a7 18-2505 would be satisfied indirectly \u201cby making the sentence for the felony consecutive to the escape sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, the statute requires the sentence for escape to be consecutive, or non-concurrent, to the sentence for the felony during which the escape occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"AFJv\">Out of fairness to the accused, \u201c[c]riminal statutes are strictly construed in their substantive elements and in their sanctions.\u201d <em>State v. McKaughen, </em>108 Idaho 471, 473, 700 P.2d 93, 95 (Ct.App.1985) (citing <em>State v. Thompson, </em>101 Idaho 430, 614 P.2d 970 (1980)). Additionally, \u201c[a]mbiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity.\u201d <em>McKaughen, </em>108 Idaho at 473, 700 P.2d at 95 (citing <em>Rewis v. United States, </em>401 U.S. 808, 812, 91 S.Ct. 1056, 1059, 28 L.Ed.2d 493, 497 (1971); <em>Thompson, </em>101 Idaho at 437, 614 P.2d at 977). The state\u2019s interpretation of I.C. \u00a7 18-2505 would give a second judge the power to retroactively increase the penalty for an offense which the original trial court, in its discretion, deemed appropriate. Sentencing is a matter generally committed to the discretion of the trial judge. <em>See State v. Pratt, </em>125 Idaho 594, 600, 873 P.2d 848, 854 (1994); <em>State v. Jones, </em>125 Idaho 477, 489, 873 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>122, 134 (1994); <em>State v. Brown, </em>121 Idaho 385, 394, 825 P.2d 482, 491 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">Trial judges may retroactively impose a harsher penalty on resentencing, but only if \u201cjustified by reference to conduct of the defendant occurring subsequent to the original sentencing.\u201d <em>Rewak v. United States, </em>512 F.2d 1184, 1186 (9th Cir.1975); <em>see also State v. McGonigal, </em>122 Idaho 939, 941, 842 P.2d 275, 277 (1992). In this case, however, the escape occurred <em>before </em>the sentence was entered. The trial judge in Elmore I imposed the indeterminate sentence even though he was aware of Doan\u2019s escape from the Elmore County jail. The sentence imposed by another judge for an escape conviction should not automatically abrogate the first judge\u2019s sentencing discretion. Section 18-2505 makes no specific provision requiring that result. The state\u2019s proposed interpretation of the statute seems to retroactively punish the defendant twice for the same crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">The Elmore I court determined that after Doan served a one year fixed sentence, the parole board would have the authority to determine when Doan had satisfied his obligation to society on the grand theft conviction. The state argues that the indeterminate sentence creates only \u201cthe possibility of parole, not a guarantee that [Doan] would actually ever be paroled.\u201d The state also argues that while the parole commission would normally have the discretion to determine whether Doan were to be paroled, the commission\u2019s discretion \u201chas been effectively removed\u201d by the imposition of the fixed escape sentence. The state cites no statutory or case law supporting the abrogation of the parole commission\u2019s jurisdiction over the indeterminate portion of Doan\u2019s sentence. This Court holds that the magistrate did not err in resolving this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">C. This Court\u2019s Interpretation Of The Unified Sentencing Act Does Not Violate The Separation Of Powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">Article II, Section 1 of the Idaho Constitution provides for the separation of powers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-8\">The powers of the government of this state are divided into three distinct departments, the legislative, the executive and judicial; and no person or collection of persons charged with the exercise of powers properly belonging to one of these departments shall exercise any powers properly belonging to either of the others, <em>except as in this constitution expressly directed or permitted.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b850-11\">(emphasis added). While our holding today allows IDOC, a department of the executive branch, to insert a sentence between the fixed and indeterminate portions of another sentence imposed by the judiciary, it does not violate Article II, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-12\">Our interpretation of I.C. \u00a7 19-2513 has an effect similar to section 20-228 of the Idaho Code, which states that where the conditions of parole are violated, time spent on parole \u201cshall not be deemed a part [of the sentence].\u201d For example, pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 20-228, an indeterminate three-year sentence might expire four years after being imposed if the prisoner is out on parole for one year and the parole is subsequently revoked. Section 20-228 has been held not to violate the separation of powers, even though it may increase the amount of time required to serve a sentence. <em>See Flores v. State, </em>109 Idaho 182, 184, 706 P.2d 71, 73 (Ct.App.1985). Section 20-228 is constitutional because the Idaho Constitution expressly gives the Board of Corrections authority over \u201cthe control, direction, and management of the penitentiaries of the state ... and of adult probation and parole, <em>with such compensation powers, and duties as may be prescribed by law.\u201d Id. </em>(quoting Article X, Section 5 of the Idaho Constitution) (emphasis in original). The expiration of Doan\u2019s Elmore I sentence will be similarly delayed because of the insertion of Doan\u2019s Elmore II escape sentence, pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 19-2513. Because our holding today has an effect analogous to that of I.C. \u00a7 20-228, it does not implicate the separation of powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-14\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-15\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b850-16\">The language from I.C. \u00a7 18-2505 does not create a \u201csuperconsecutive\u201d sentence for felony escape that automatically fixes any inde<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>terminate terms. It merely requires the sentence for escape to be served consecutively, i.e. non-concurrently, to the sentence imposed for the felony during which the escape occurred. Under I.C. \u00a7 19-2513, when consecutive sentences are imposed, the fixed terms are to be served before the indeterminate terms. Accordingly, the order of the magistrate court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b851-4\">Chief Justice TROUT, Justices SCHROEDER, WALTERS and KIDWELL, CONCUR.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b848-7\">. Even if this issue had been properly raised on appeal, the district court's finding would still be erroneous. While the district judge who presided over Elmore I did not specify when the sentence was to commence, the Rule 11 plea agreement upon which the judgment was based clearly states that the sentence was to \"run consecutive to any sentence\u201d that defendant was then serving with IDOC. At the time Doan entered the agreement, he was serving his Lemhi II sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-15\">This issue was considered by Judge Horton, who presided over the Elmore II case. Judge Horton, in an order dated March 21, 1997, noted that the Elmore I judgment failed \"to reflect the court\u2019s intention that the sentence ... should run consecutive to any sentence for which Doan was in confinement as agreed by the parties in the Rule 11 plea agreement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AXFF\">.
