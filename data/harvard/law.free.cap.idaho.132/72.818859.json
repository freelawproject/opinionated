We uphold the trial court\u2019s denial of motions to suppress evidence because the State did not obtain any evidence from the defendant that could be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-22\">THE BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b120-23\">On July 9, 1995, members of the Rathdrum police department (the officers) blocked part of a highway to permit clean up of fallen trees, power lines, and debris following a storm. While the highway was blocked by the officers and their marked cars, James McGovern (McGovern) drove up to the scene in a motor vehicle. One of the officers (the citing officer) recognized McGovern and remembered that a week earlier he had determined that McGovern\u2019s driving privileges were suspended. The citing officer detained McGovern, had police dispatch run a \u201cdriver\u2019s check\u201d on McGovern through a statewide computer system, and was advised by police dispatch that McGovern\u2019s driving privileges were suspended. The citing officer issued McGovern a citation for operating a motor vehicle while suspended. Four days later, on July 13, 1995, the citing officer again saw McGovern driving a motor vehicle, had dispatch again run a computer check on the status of McGovern\u2019s driver\u2019s license, determined that McGovern\u2019s license was still suspended, and issued McGovern a second citation for operating a motor vehicle while suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-24\">With regard to each of the citations, McGovern sought to have the magistrate judge (the trial court) suppress \u201call evidence and the fruits thereof obtained by the State\u2019s illegal search and seizure of [McGovern\u2019s] person and property.\u201d At the hearing on the motions, McGovern contended there was no reasonable suspicion to stop him on July 9, 1995. Apparently he contended that the stop on July 13, 1995 was \u201ctainted\u201d by the July 9, 1995 stop. The trial court denied the mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>tions, and McGovern pleaded guilty to the two offenses, reserving the right to appeal the denial of his motions to suppress. McGovern appealed to the district judge asserting that the blocked road in question was established in violation of section 19-621 of the Idaho Code (I.C.) and that the police lacked reasonable suspicion to seize McGovern. The district judge affirmed the magistrate judge\u2019s rulings. McGovern then appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">During oral argument before this Court, in response to the questioning of the Court, McGovern\u2019s attorney advised the Court that McGovern sought to suppress what the citing officer learned from dispatch about the suspension of McGovern\u2019s driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT COULD BE SUPPRESSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">McGovern asserts that the trial court should have suppressed what the citing officer learned from dispatch about the suspension of McGovern\u2019s driver\u2019s license. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">The purpose of the exclusionary rule is to prevent the use of evidence that was illegally obtained in violation of the defendant\u2019s right not to be subjected to an unreasonable search or seizure. <em>E.g., State v. Guzman, </em>122 Idaho 981, 989, 842 P.2d 660, 668 (1992). In the present case, even if the citing officer had seized McGovern without reasonable articulable suspicion, the citing officer did not obtain the evidence McGovern seeks to suppress from McGovern, but from the police dispatcher. Therefore, there is no evidence that could be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b121-11\">We affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of McGovern\u2019s motions to suppress.</p>\n<judges id=\"b121-12\">TROUT, C.J., and SILAK, SCHROEDER and WALTERS, concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
