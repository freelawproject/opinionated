We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-19\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b952-20\">A. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b952-21\">On January 30, 1990, appellant Kerby Van Tine (Van Tine) was injured during the course of his employment with the Idaho Department of Transportation when the vehicle he was driving was struck by a semi-truck. Van Tine submitted a worker\u2019s compensation claim to his employer\u2019s worker\u2019s compensation surety, respondent Idaho State Insurance Fund (SIF). The SIF made payments on certain of Van Tine\u2019s medical bills, but refused payment on others. Van Tine also filed suit against the third-party tortfeasor, the driver of the semi-truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-22\">In March 1992, Van Tine and the tortfeasor reached a settlement whereby the tortfeasor paid Van Tine $125,000, which Van Tine\u2019s attorney placed in his trust account. The SIF thereafter claimed subrogation. Van Tine disputed the subrogation claim, arguing that the SIF interfered with the tort litigation thereby causing Van Tine to recover less than that to whieh he was entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-23\">In July 1992, Van Tine filed suit against the SIF in Nez Perce County alleging breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing and breach of a fiduciary duty, and claiming that the SIF waived subrogation rights to the proceeds of the third party tort recovery. The next day the SIF filed suit against Van Tine\u2019s attorney, Darrel Aherin, in Nez Perce County for its subrogation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-24\">In November 1993, the Idaho Industrial Commission (Commission) approved a lump sum settlement agreement for the worker\u2019s compensation case. The total amount of all benefits, including medical benefits, income benefits, and consideration for settlement was $45,532.05. In the agreement, the parties also agreed that the issue of the SIF\u2019s subrogation claim would be resolved in one of the two suits filed in Nez Perce County. Van Tine\u2019s suit eventually came before this Court which held that the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to decide the subrogation issue, but rather that the Commission had exclusive jurisdiction to de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>cide this issue as it came under the worker\u2019s compensation law. <em>Van Tine v. Idaho State Ins. Fund, </em>126 Idaho 688, 690, 889 P.2d 717, 719 (1994) <em>(Van Tine I). </em>The Court also held that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to decide whether the SIF breached the duty of good faith and fair dealing. The SIF\u2019s suit against Van Tine\u2019s attorney was subsequently dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"Ang\">In February 1996, the SIF petitioned the Commission for a declaratory ruling on the subrogation issue. The Commission ruled that it lacked authority to review the lump sum agreement as the petition was not timely filed and no other statutory basis for review existed. The SIF filed a second petition with the Industrial Commission seeking a declaratory ruling which the Commission again denied in April 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"AFD\">B. Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"AA1\">In June 1996, the SIF instituted the present action by filing a complaint for declaratory judgment on the subrogation issue. Van Tine filed a counterclaim alleging that the SIF waived the subrogation claim (Count I), that it would be unconstitutional for the SIF to maintain a claim for subrogation since the SIF engaged in conduct which reduced the amount of Van Tine\u2019s recovery received from the tortfeasor (Count II), and that the SIF breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing (Count III). The district court granted Van Tine\u2019s summary judgment motion on the basis that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The SIF did not appeal. The district court also granted the SIF\u2019s summary judgment motion on Van Tine\u2019s counterclaim ruling that Count I of the counterclaim was moot by virtue of prior orders of the court, and that the court lacked jurisdiction to decide Counts II and III. The district court thereafter awarded Van Tine certain costs as a matter of right, but denied his request for discretionary costs and attorney fees with respect to the granting of Van Tine\u2019s summary judgment motion against the SIF. Van Tine appeals the dismissal of his counterclaim and the denial of his request for discretionary costs and attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"AiGb\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"AFU\">ISSUES ON APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"Atd\">1. Whether the district court improperly granted the SIF\u2019s summary judgment motion on Van Tine\u2019s counterclaim based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"AN3\">2. Whether the constitutional rights of Van Tine were violated by a blanket denial of a cause of action for bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"AY2\">3. Whether the district court improperly denied Van Tine\u2019s request for discretionary costs and attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"A81\">4. Whether Van Tine is entitled to costs and attorney fees on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"AxTx\">The SIF raises the following additional issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"A7z\">1. Whether the SIF is entitled to costs and attorney fees on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"AcE\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqj\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AjK\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"ArU\">In an appeal from an order granting summary judgment, this Court applies the same standard of review as that used by the district court when originally ruling on the motion. <em>Mitchell v. Bingham Memorial Hosp., </em>130 Idaho 420, 422, 942 P.2d 544, 546 (1997); <em>State v. Rubbermaid, Inc., </em>129 Idaho 353, 355-56, 924 P.2d 615, 617-18 (1996). Upon review, all disputed facts are to be construed liberally in favor of the non-moving party, and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the record are to be drawn in favor of the non-moving party. <em>Mitchell, </em>130 Idaho at 422, 942 P.2d at 546; <em>Rubbermaid, </em>129 Idaho at 356, 924 P.2d at 618. Summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>McCoy v. Lyons, </em>120 Idaho 765, 769, 820 P.2d 360, 364 (1991). Because the construction and application of a legislative act are pure questions of law, this Court exercises free review over such questions. <em>Mitchell, 130 </em>Idaho at 422, 942 P.2d at 546. The Court also exercises free review over constitutional issues as they, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>too, are purely questions of law. <em>Meisner v. Potlatch Corp., </em>131 Idaho 258, 260, 954 P.2d 676, 678 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">B. The District Court Properly Dismissed Count III Of Van Tine\u2019s Counterclaim Alleging Breach Of The Duty Of Good Faith And Fair Dealing On The Basis That It Lacked Subject Matter Jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">This issue falls squarely within our holding of <em>Van Tine I, </em>and as such, we affirm the district court\u2019s order dismissing Count III of Van Tine\u2019s counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">In <em>Van Tine I, </em>Van Tine filed suit against the SIF alleging breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing and breach of fiduciary duty.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Van Tine listed six specific allegations in his complaint which explicitly related to the SIF\u2019s failure to pay certain of Van Tine\u2019s medical expenses. Additionally, Van Tine listed the three following allegations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-7\">7. SIF used its position with the Commission to have a position of superiority over Van Tine and other workers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-8\">8. SIF authorized a suit to be filed against the Van Tines\u2019 attorney in an attempt to disrupt the Van Tines\u2019 relationship with their attorney and apply pressure to the Van Tines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-9\">9. SIF lobbies for changes that are beneficial to SIF and detrimental to Van Tine and other workers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b954-10\"><em>Van Tine I, </em>126 Idaho at 690, 889 P.2d at 719.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-11\">The Court in <em>Van Tine I </em>first held that all questions arising under the worker\u2019s compensation law are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Industrial Commission. <em>Id. </em>at 689, 889 P.2d at 718 (quoting I.C. \u00a7 72-707 (1989)). <em>See also Walters v. Indus. Indem. Co. of Idaho, </em>127 Idaho 933, 908 P.2d 1240 (1996) (holding that complaint alleging that insurer intentionally and unreasonably denied worker\u2019s compensation benefits arose under worker\u2019s compensation law and thus was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Commission.). The Court noted that if any of Van Tine\u2019s claims against the SIF arose under. the worker\u2019s compensation law, the district court would not have subject matter jurisdiction to decide them. <em>Van Tine I, </em>126 Idaho at 689, 889 P.2d at 718.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-14\">Secondly, with respect to the first six allegations of Van Tine\u2019s bad faith claim, the Court held that they came within the purview of I.C. \u00a7 72-804 of the Worker\u2019s Compensation Act and that, therefore, the Commission had exclusive jurisdiction over them. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b954-15\">I.C. 72-804 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-16\">Attorney\u2019s fees \u2014 Punitive costs in certain cases. \u2014 If the commission or any court before whom any proceedings are brought under this law determines that the employer or his surety contested a claim for compensation made by an injured employee or dependent of a deceased employee without reasonable ground, or that an employer or his surety neglected or refused within a reasonable time after receipt of a written claim for compensation to pay to the injured employee or his dependents the compensation provided by law, or without reasonable grounds discontinued payment of compensation as provided by law justly due and owing to the employee or his dependents, the employer shall pay reasonable attorney fees in addition to the compensation provided by this law. In all such cases the fees of attorneys employed by injured employees or their dependents shall be fixed by the commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b954-17\">The Court concluded that because those first six allegations explicitly related to contested claims for compensation without reasonable ground, SIF\u2019s refusal to pay compensation within a reasonable time, and discontinued payment of compensation justly due and owing without reasonable ground, they arose under I.C. \u00a7 72-804 and the district court thus did not have jurisdiction. <em>Van Tine I, </em>126 Idaho at 689, 889 P.2d at 718.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>With respect to Van Tine\u2019s three remaining allegations listed above, the Court in <em>Van Tine I </em>held that they implicitly related to the award of attorney fees pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 72-804 and thus the district court did not have jurisdiction to decide these allegations either. The basis for the Court\u2019s holding was that those allegations were made a part of Van Tine\u2019s request for damages for the SIF\u2019s breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing. The Court noted that pursuant to <em>White v. Unigard Mut. Ins. Co., </em>112 Idaho 94, 730 P.2d 1014 (1986), in order to have a claim for bad faith, a claimant must allege that the insurer intentionally and unreasonably denied or delayed payment on a claim, and in the process harmed the claimant in such a way that the claimant cannot be fully compensated at contract. <em>Van Tine I, </em>126 Idaho at 690, 889 P.2d at 719. The Court then held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-4\">Based on this description in <em>White, </em>any claim the Van Tines have for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing must relate to SIF\u2019s intentional and unreasonable denial of or delay in paying workers\u2019 compensation benefits. To the extent that allegations 7, 8, and 9 above support a claim for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, they must be considered to allege an intentional and unreasonable denial of or delay in paying benefits to Van Tine. Otherwise, they would not support a claim for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">\n<em>Id,</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">In the present case, Count III of Van Tine\u2019s counterclaim provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-7\">The Fund has breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing owed to defendant in the following respects:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-8\">(a) Continues to harass Van Tine with lawsuits even though plaintiff has lost its subrogation rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-9\">(b) Authorized a suit to be filed against the Van Tines\u2019 attorney in an attempt to disrupt Van Tine\u2019s relationship with his attorney and apply pressure to Van Tine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-10\">(c) The Fund owes a duty of good faith and fair dealing to Van Tine and has deprived Van Tine the right to monies which are rightfully his.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b955-11\">In his brief on appeal, Van Tine asserts that his counterclaim for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing relates to actions of the SIF after July 1992 (the date his lawsuit was filed in <em>Van Tine I), </em>and that, therefore, it is a wholly different claim than that decided in <em>Van Tine I </em>and thus does not arise from I.C. \u00a7 72-804. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-12\">Subsection (c) of Count III states that the SIF deprived Van Tine of funds that were rightfully his. This allegation clearly falls under I.C. \u00a7 72-804 pursuant to our holding in <em>Van Tine I, </em>as Van Tine is essentially arguing that the SIF contested a claim for compensation without reasonable ground. According to <em>Van Tine I, </em>that type of allegation explicitly relates to the premises for an award of attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 72-804. <em>Van Tine I, </em>126 Idaho at 690, 889 P.2d at 719.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-13\">Subsection (b) of Count III also clearly falls under I.C. \u00a7 72-804 pursuant to <em>Van Tine I </em>as it was a listed allegation in Van Tine\u2019s complaint in the <em>Van Tine I </em>suit. As stated above, the Court held in that case that this allegation implicitly related to the premises for the award of attorney fees pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 72-804, thus presenting a question arising under I.C. \u00a7 72-804. <em>Id .</em></p>\n<p id=\"b955-14\">Subsection (a) of Count III also implicitly falls under I.C. \u00a7 72-804 pursuant to <em>Van Tine I </em>based on the Court\u2019s analysis and discussion regarding <em>White v. Unigard Mut. Ins. Co., </em>and the necessary underlying basis for bad faith claims. Pursuant to <em>White, </em>by definition there is no claim for bad faith unless it relates to an insurer intentionally and unreasonably failing to pay a claim or compensate the insured. Such a claim must relate to the failure to pay monies that the insured claims he is owed. If the allegation does not relate to the insurer\u2019s unreasonable failure to pay the insured, either explicitly or implicitly, the insured has not stated a claim for bad faith. Thus, in order for Van Tine to maintain the allegation that the SIF breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing by continuing to harass Van Tine with lawsuits even though the SIF has lost its subrogation rights, by definition under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number><em>White v. Unigard, </em>the claim- must at least implicitly relate to an assertion that the SIF intentionally and unreasonably either denied or delayed compensation. If it does not, then there is no bad faith claim. If the claim does relate to the SIF\u2019s unreasonableness in failing to compensate Van Tine, then it falls under I.C. \u00a7 72-804 and the exclusive jurisdiction of the Commission and the worker\u2019s compensation law. We hold that this claim indeed falls under I.C. \u00a7 72-804.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">Further, pursuant to <em>White v. Unigard, </em>a claim against an insurer for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing is only available to first party insureds:,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-5\">The tort of bad faith breach of insurance contract, then, has its foundations in the common law covenant of good faith and fair dealing and is founded upon the unique relationship of the insurer and the insured, the adhesionary nature of the insurance contract including the potential for overreaching on the part of the insurer, and the unique, \u201cnon-commercial\u201d aspect of the insurance contract. Accordingly, we hold that there exists a common law tort action, distinct from an action on the contract, for an insurer\u2019s bad faith in settling the <em>first party claims of its insured.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b956-7\">112 Idaho at 100, 730 P.2d at 1020 (emphasis added). In the present case, the first party insured of the SIF is the Idaho Department of Transportation, not Van Tine. Thus, be-' cause Van Tine is a third party claimant, even out of the context of the worker\u2019s compensation law, he would not be able to maintain a bad faith action'against the SIF.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-8\">Thus, we hold that the district court properly dismissed Count III of Van Tine\u2019s counterclaim alleging breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing on the basis that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-9\">C. The District Court Properly Dismissed Van Tine\u2019s Constitutional Claim Based On A Lack Of Subject Matter Jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-10\">In its order granting the SIF\u2019s summary judgment motion on Van Tine\u2019s counterclaim, with respect to Count II, Van Tine\u2019s constitutional challenge, the district court simply ruled that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear the allegations. During the telephonic hearing on the motion, the court stated as follows with respect to Count II:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-12\">With respect to the constitutional argument of count one [sic \u2014 count two], I recognize the argument, but I would say having been forced into a decision on count three, that I think that the constitutional argument bumps right along with it. And that constitutional argument is preserved, can be made before the Industrial Commission and bumps up to the supreme court along with the argument there, or can bump up along with the argument here, but it is \u2014 it would be improper, I think, given the clear declaration in Van-tine I, to attempt an end run around the Supreme Court by visiting the constitutional issue. And so I decline to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b956-13\">Van Tine argues that the district court did have jurisdiction to decide the constitutional issue, especially over the Industrial Commission. We agree. This Court has indicated that the courts are the proper forum for the determination of the constitutionality of statutes. <em>See Lynn v. Kootenai County Fire Protective Dist. </em>#1, 97 Idaho 623, 624, 550 P.2d 126, 127 (1976); <em>State v. Evans, </em>73 Idaho 50, 59, 245 P.2d 788, 797 (1952); <em>Wanke v. Ziebarth Const. Co., </em>69 Idaho 64, 202 P.2d 384 (1949). Further, the Court recently held that the Industrial Commission in particular does not have jurisdiction to decide such constitutional challenges. <em>Tupper v. State Farm Ins., </em>131 Idaho 724, 729, 963 P.2d 1161, 1166 (1998). Thus, we hold that the district court did have subject matter jurisdiction to address Van Tine\u2019s constitutional challenge. However, because this Court exercises free review over constitutional issues, <em>Meisner, </em>131 Idaho at 260, 954 P.2d at 678, we will decide the merits of the issue rather than remanding the case to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-14\">Van Tine argues that I.C. \u00a7 72-804 is unconstitutional if it precludes him, an injured worker, from bringing a bad faith action against his employer\u2019s surety. Although Van Tine argues that such an interpretation of I.C. \u00a7 72-804 would deprive him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>of due process and equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, he provides argument and authority for only the equal protection claim. Therefore, the Court\u2019s focus will be limited to the equal protection question. <em>Weaver v. Searle Bros., </em>131 Idaho 610, 616, 962 P.2d 381, 387 (1998) (holding that pursuant to I.A.R. 35(a)(6), issues on appeal must be supported by propositions of law, authority or argument in the argument section of a party\u2019s brief or they will not be considered); <em>State v. Zichko, </em>129 Idaho 259, 263, 923 P.2d 966, 970 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-4\">Van Tine argues that it is \u201cunconstitutional to exclude an injured worker, insured by a worker\u2019s compensation policy, from bringing a bad faith claim while allowing all other persons insured by contracts of insurance to have as a remedy a bad faith cause of action against the insurer.\u201d Van Tine contends that if his counterclaim allegations relating to the SIF\u2019s breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing must be characterized as stemming from the SIF\u2019s unreasonable denial of benefits and thus falling under I.C. \u00a7 72-804 of the worker\u2019s compensation law, then I.C. \u00a7 72-804 is unconstitutional as it precludes him from bringing a tort action against the SIF for bad faith. Van Tine argues that the worker\u2019s compensation act was never intended to shield the type of harassing conduct exhibited by the SIF, and that such an interpretation would deny him equal protection under the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">This Court has held that when a statute is constitutionally challenged, it will make every presumption in favor of constitutionality, and that the burden of establishing unconstitutionality rests upon the challengers. <em>Tupper, </em>131 Idaho at 730, 963 P.2d at 1167; <em>Rhodes v. Indus. Comm\u2019n, </em>125 Idaho 139, 142, 868 P.2d 467, 470 (1993). The Court has also held that its inquiry is not concerned \u201c \u2018with the accuracy as to the legislative finding, but only with the question of whether it so lacks any reasonable basis as to be arbitrary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tupper, </em>131 Idaho at 730, 963 P.2d at 1167 (quoting <em>Sellmer v. Ruen, </em>115 Idaho 700, 701, 769 P.2d 577,578 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">In the present case, Van Tine\u2019s constitutional challenge of I.C. \u00a7 72-804 should be tested under the rational basis test of equal protection review since the statute creates \u201c\u2018no suspect or invidiously discriminatory classification\u2019 and implicated] \u2018no fundamental right,\u2019 but rather involved] \u2018economic and social welfare legislation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tupper, </em>131 Idaho at 730, 963 P.2d at 1167 (quoting <em>Rhodes, </em>125 Idaho at 142, 868 P.2d at 470). In order to pass the rational basis test, the statute must bear a rational relationship to a legitimate legislative purpose. <em>Id. </em>Under the rational basis test, a classification will withstand an equal protection challenge if there is any conceivable state of facts which will support it. <em>Meisner, </em>131 Idaho at 262, 954 P.2d at 680.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-10\">\u201cWorker\u2019s compensation statutes must be considered in the context of the entire act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 72-201 and \u00a7 72-707, it is clear that the legislature intended, in order for the worker\u2019s compensation law to achieve its purpose of providing sure and certain relief for injured workers and their families, that all claims, issues and civil actions relating in any manner to the injury of a worker, whether procedural or substantive, be decided under the worker\u2019s compensation act by the Commission. This would also include subrogation issues, I.C. \u00a7 72-223(3), and issues involving the unreasonable denial or delay of compensation by the <em>employer or </em>his surety, I.C. \u00a7 72-804. We believe that the legislature did not intend for a worker to be able to bring a bad faith tort action against his employer\u2019s surety in courts of general jurisdiction, but rather that a worker could receive attorney fees and sometimes punitive costs if the employer or surety acts unreasonably. Thus, Van Tine has failed to show why I.C. \u00a7 72-804 does not bear a rational relationship to the above stated purpose of the worker\u2019s compensation act. We therefore hold that Van Tine\u2019s equal protection rights have not been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-11\">D. The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion In Denying Van Tine\u2019s Request For Discretionary Costs And Attorney Fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-12\">On May 11, 1998, the district court entered an order awarding Van Tine $56.00 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>for costs as a matter of right pursuant to I.R.C.P. 54(d)(1)(C), but denying his request for discretionary costs and attorney fees pursuant to I.R.C.P. 54(d)(1)(D). This order was a result of the court granting Van Tine\u2019s summary judgment motion on the SIF\u2019s claim for subrogation. Van Tine argues that he should have been awarded all his costs and fees because of the frivolous nature of the SIF\u2019s suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">\u201cThe grant or denial of discretionary costs is \u2018committed to the sound discretion of the district court,\u2019 and will only be reviewed by an appellate court for an abuse of that discretion.\u201d <em>Fish v. Smith, </em>131 Idaho 492, 493, 960 P.2d 175, 176 (1998) (quoting <em>Zimmerman v. Volkswagen of America, Inc., </em>128 Idaho 851, 857, 920 P.2d 67, 73 (1996)). This Court affirms the district court\u2019s denial of Van Tine\u2019s request for discretionary costs and attorney fees. Although the court did grant Van Tine\u2019s summary judgment motion, it also granted the SIF\u2019s motion on Van Tine\u2019s counterclaim for the very same reason \u2014 lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Further, Van Tine has failed to provide any argument or authority as to why the district court abused its discretion in denying his request.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">E. The SIF Is Not Entitled To Attorney Fees On Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">The SIF requests that it be awarded its attorney fees incurred in this appeal. However, the SIF provides no argument or authority as to why it is entitled to such fees. As stated above, this Court will not consider issues listed on appeal unless they are supported by propositions of law, authority or argument in the argument section of the party\u2019s brief. I.A.R. 35(a)(6); <em>Weaver, </em>131 Idaho at 616, 962 P.2d at 387. Thus, we will not consider the SIF\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b958-9\">We hold that the district court did not err in dismissing Count III of Van Tine\u2019s counterclaim alleging breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing. Pursuant to the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Van Tine I, </em>Van Tine\u2019s claim relates to the SIF\u2019s unreasonableness in failing to compensate him, thus falling under I.C. \u00a7 72-804 and the exclusive jurisdiction of the Commission. We further hold that, in any event, Van Tine cannot maintain a bad faith action against the SIF because he is a third party claimant, and pursuant to <em>White v. Unigard, </em>such action may only be brought by first party insureds.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-11\">With respect to Van Tine\u2019s constitutional challenge on equal protection grounds, we hold that although the district court did have jurisdiction to decide this issue, Van Tine has failed to show that his equal protection rights have been violated under the rational basis test.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-12\">We further hold that Van Tine has failed to show that the district court abused its discretion in denying Van Tine\u2019s request for discretionary costs and attorney fees below.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-13\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-14\">No attorney fees on appeal. Costs on appeal to respondent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b958-15\">Justices SCHROEDER, WALTERS, KIDWELL and Justice Pro Tem CARLSON, concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b954-12\">. In <em>Van Tine I, </em>Van Tine also alleged that the SIF waived its subrogation right to any of the third party torL recovery proceeds. The Court held that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to decide this issue. In the present case, Van Tine raised the issue again in Count I of his counterclaim. The district court ruled that the issue was moot because of prior orders and Van Tine does not appeal that ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
