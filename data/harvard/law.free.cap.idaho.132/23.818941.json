(Preco). The district court held that sums of deferred incentive compensation payable to Bilow pursuant to an employment contract were (1) \u201cwages\u201d pursuant to section 45-601(4) of the Idaho Code (I.C.), and (2) the Employment Retirement Income Security Act did not preempt Enow\u2019s claim of treble damages. Bilow has cross-appealed the district court\u2019s denial of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-20\">BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b73-21\">In 1983 Bilow became the president of Santa Clara Plastics, a division of Preco. On August 11,1988, he executed an employment agreement with Preco to take effect on December 31, 1988. Under the agreement Bi-low received base compensation of $150,000 per year, paid weekly, and \u201cincentive compensation\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of 6.25% of Preco\u2019s monthly \u201cpre-tax profit\u201d as defined in the agreement. Preco paid out 20% of the 6.25% each month (or 1.25% of Preco\u2019s monthly \u201cpre-tax profit\u201d) as a \u201ccurrent incentive compensation payment\u201d for that month. The remaining 80% (or 5% of Preco\u2019s \u201cpre-tax profit\u201d) was allocated to a deferral account. The amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>allocated to the deferral account was to be paid to Bilow over a rolling four-year period, with l/48th of the account balance being paid each month, beginning in January of 1990.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The purpose of the incentive compensation plan was to average Bilow\u2019s income over a four-year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Under the 1988 agreement, if Bilow had died or voluntarily terminated his employment, he would have forfeited the amount allocated to the deferral account. If Preco terminated Bilow\u2019s employment at any time in 1989, he was to receive a cash settlement equal to 150% of the balance of the deferral account, adjusted to present value at a 6% discount rate. If Preco terminated Bilow\u2019s employment on or after January 1, 1990, he was to receive a cash settlement equal to the balance of the deferral account calculated as of the date of termination and adjusted using the same discount factor. If Bilow were disabled, he was to receive 50% of the balance of the deferral account (later amended to 100%) payable monthly during the four-year deferral term.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">On June 29, 1990, the parties executed an agreement entitled \u201cAmended and Restated Employment Agreement.\u201d The relevant changes to the 1988 agreement were: (1) Bilow would forfeit the accrued amount in the deferral account if he resigned before July 1, 1995, but if he terminated his employment with Preco on or after that date he would be entitled to the full deferral account balance, paid over as if his employment had continued; (2) if Bilow died, regardless of the date, his estate would receive the amount allocated to the deferral account, paid over four years as if his employment had continued; and (3) Preco agreed not to terminate Bilow\u2019s employment before July 1, 1995, except for \u201cextreme misconduct,\u201d but if Preco terminated Bilow\u2019s employment at any time, he was entitled to a cash settlement equal to the balance of the deferral account, calculated as of the date of termination and adjusted to present value at a 6% discount rate.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-7\">For example, in the event that Bilow has been an employee of Preco pursuant to this Agreement through the month of January of 1990, Bilow shall be paid as incentive compensation for the month of January 1990 any positive total of the following positive and/or negative amounts: (a) 1.25% of the January 1990 Preco \u201cpre-tax profit,\u201d (b) l/48th of 5% of the 1989 Preco \u201cpre-tax profit\u201d from the Bilow \"deferral account,\u201d (c) l/48th of 5% of the 1988 Preco \"pre-tax profit\u201d from the Bilow \"deferral account,\u201d (d) l/48th of 5% of the 1987 Preco \"pre-tax profit\u201d from the Bilow \"deferral account,\u201d and (e) l/48th of 5% of the 1986 Preco \"pre-tax profit\" from the Bilow \u201cdeferral account.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">Early in 1995 the parties agreed that Bi-low would leave his employment with Preco and negotiated an agreement that his resignation would be treated as occurring on July 1, 1995, which meant that he would be entitled to receive the balance accrued in the deferral account as of July 1, 1995, payable ninety days thereafter. He had the option to receive the account balance in a discounted lump sum or paid out as if his employment continued. Bilow informed Preco that he wished to receive the account balance in a lump sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">On July 27, 1995, Preco advised Bilow that the account balance as of July 1, 1995, was $1,644,295 and stated that this amount would be paid, with some possible adjustments, on September 29, 1995. Bilow disagreed with Preco\u2019s calculation of the account balance, and the parties began an exchange of documents in an attempt to determine the proper amount of payout. On September 29, 1995, Preco informed Bilow that it would only pay him if he executed a release of all present and future claims he had against Preco. Bi-low refused. Preco made no payment on September 29,1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-11\">In December of 1995, Bilow requested that Preco pay him $1.5 million and that the parties then try to amicably resolve the dispute over a possible remainder due. Preco refused this offer by way of a letter in January 1996 and stated that the July 1995 figure which they had quoted was incorrect. Preco asserted that the properly calculated deferral account balance was $1,127,449 and stated that nothing would be paid to Bilow until the parties came to an agreement regarding the entire amount owed. Bilow filed suit in February 1996, seeking $2,334,778 in damages, trebled to $7,004,334, pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 45-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>617(4), plus interest and attorney fees. On August 19, 1996, Preco paid Bilow $1,733,-068.71, without requiring or obtaining any form of release.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">Bilow moved for partial summary judgment, asserting that the amount due and owing him was \u201cwages\u201d as that term is defined in I.C. \u00a7 45-601(4), and that he was entitled to treble damages under I.C. \u00a7 45-617(4). Preco filed a cross motion for partial summary judgment, arguing that the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) preempted Show's state law claim for treble damages. Preco also contended that Bilow\u2019s claim was not one for wages. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Bilow. Preco appeals. Bilow cross-appeals the denial of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">This Court applies the same standard of review as that used by the district court when originally ruling on a motion for summary judgment. <em>Avila v. Wahlquist, </em>126 Idaho 745, 747, 890 P.2d 331, 333 (1995); <em>Farm Credit Bank of Spokane v. Stevenson, </em>125 Idaho 270, 272, 869 P.2d 1365, 1367 (1994). The Court must liberally construe the facts in the existing record in favor of the nonmoving party and draw all reasonable inferences from the record in favor of the nonmoving party. <em>Avila, </em>126 Idaho at 747, 890 P.2d at 333; <em>Bonz v. Sudweeks, 119 </em>Idaho 539, 541, 808 P.2d 876, 878 (1991). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201c \u2018if the pleadings, depositions, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>McCoy v. Lyons, </em>120 Idaho 765, 769, 820 P.2d 360, 364 (1991) (quoting I.R.C.P. 56(c)). If there are conflicting inferences contained in the record or reasonable minds might reach different conclusions, summary judgment must be denied. <em>Bonz, </em>119 Idaho at 541, 808 P.2d at 878.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">hi.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">THE DISTRICT COURT DID NOT ERR IN REFUSING TO CONSIDER EXTRINSIC EVIDENCE IN ORDER TO CLARIFY THE INTENT OF THE PARTIES.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-11\">Preco contends that the district court should have considered the following extrinsic evidence to determine the intent of the parties to the agreements: (1) a letter from Bilow to his divorce attorney which explained his employment agreement with Preco, (2) the affidavit of Preco\u2019s chief financial officer, Anthony Oliveri, which explained how the incentive compensation was calculated, and (3) the affidavit of Mark Peterson, a member of the Board of Directors at Preco describing the discussions and negotiations between Bi-low and Preco which occurred prior to the formation of the 1988 agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-12\">A. The Bilow Letter and the Affidavit of Anthony Oliveri</p>\n<p id=\"b75-13\">The court\u2019s objective in constructing a contract is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the parties. <em>George v. University of Idaho, </em>121 Idaho 30, 35, 822 P.2d 549, 554 (Ct.App.1991). \u201cIf the contract is clear and unambiguous, the court gives effect to the language employed according to its ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Dille v. Doerr Distributing Co., </em>125 Idaho 123, 125, 867 P.2d 997, 999 (Ct.App.1993). In construing unambiguous terms of a contract, the court ascertains the parties\u2019 intent from the language contained in the contract. <em>George, </em>121 Idaho at 35, 822 P.2d at 554. If the contract is ambiguous, extrinsic evidence may be considered to discern the true intent of the parties. <em>Dille, </em>125 Idaho at 125, 867 P.2d at 999; <em>International Eng\u2019g Co. v. Daum Indus., Inc., </em>102 Idaho 363, 365, 630 P.2d 155, 157 (1981). Therefore, unless the employment agreement is ambiguous, it is improper to consider extrinsic evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-14\">\u201cWhether a contract is ambiguous is a question of law, and this court is not bound by the decision of the trial court, but is free to draw its own conclusions from the evidence.\u201d <em>Dille, </em>125 Idaho at 125, 867 P.2d at 999 (citing <em>Clark v. St. Paul Property &amp; Liab. Ins. Cos., </em>102 Idaho 756, 757, 639 P.2d 454, 455 (1981)). \u201c \u2018A contract is ambiguous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>if it is reasonably subject to conflicting interpretations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dille, </em>125 Idaho at 126, 867 P.2d at 1000 (quoting <em>Murr v. Selag Corp., </em>113 Idaho 773, 781, 747 P.2d 1302, 1310 (Ct. App.1987)). Preco has stated that the contact in this case is unambiguous. Counsel for Preco made this clear during the hearing on the cross-motions for summary judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AxC\">As to the affidavit there is one point that we need to clear up on the parol evidence rule. Our position and what was stated in the response to the motion to strike where they said Preco had not agreed that the contract is ambiguous. Unfortunately, that\u2019s a typo. What we meant to say is they have not argued that the agreement is ambiguous. If you take it in context that is what we\u2019re saying, because we think the contract is clear. And we\u2019ve argued that all along....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">Furthermore, Preco has not asserted on appeal that the contract is ambiguous. Therefore, both the letter and the affidavit of Anthony Oliveri are inadmissible to discern the intent of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">B. The Affidavit of Mark Peterson</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">Preco also argues that the court should have considered the affidavit of Mark Peterson. However, the negotiations that occurred prior to the formation of the 1988 agreement constitute parol evidence. Parol evidence is \u201cany ... written or oral agreements or understandings ... made-prior to or contemporaneously with the written \u2018contract.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chapman v. Haney Seed Co., </em>102 Idaho 26, 28, 624 P.2d 408, 410 (1981). If the language of a contract is plain and unambiguous the intention of the parties must be determined from the contract itself, and parol evidence will not be admissible to show intent. <em>See McCoy v. McCoy, </em>125 Idaho 199, 204, 868 P.2d 527, 532 (Ct.App.1994). Preco did not argue that the employment agreement was ambiguous. Therefore, the affidavit of Mark Peterson is inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">THE DISTRICT COURT DID NOT ERR IN ITS DECISION THAT THE DEFERRAL ACCOUNT CONSTITUTES WAGES UNDER I.C. \u00a7 45-601(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">Idaho Code \u00a7 45-601(4) defines \u201cwages\u201d as \u201ccompensation for labor or services rendered by an employee, whether the amount is determined on a time, task, piece or commission basis.\u201d Idaho courts have held that a bonus or a commission is a \u201cwage\u201d as contemplated by I.C. \u00a7 45-601(4). <em>Goff v. H.J.H. Co., </em>95 Idaho 837, 840, 521 P.2d 661, 664 (1974); <em>Neal v. Idaho Forest Indus., Inc., </em>107 Idaho 681, 683, 691 P.2d 1296, 1298 (Ct.App.1984). Bilow argues that the deferral account was a bonus and, therefore, meets the definition of \u201cwages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-11\">Preco maintains that the deferral account is similar to the cash value of a life insurance policy, which the Idaho Court of Appeals has held does not meet the definition of \u201cwages.\u201d <em>Whitlock v. Haney Seed Co., </em>114 Idaho 628, 634, 759 P.2d 919, 925 (Ct.App.1988). The Court of Appeals held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-12\">We do not believe [the] language [of I.C. \u00a7 45-601(4) ] encompasses the cash value of a life insurance policy payable to an employee where, as here, the proceeds of the policy were to be paid to the employee at retirement or to his heirs upon his death. The policy is a fixed benefit of employment status. As such, it is compensatory in a generic sense; but it is not compensation earned in increments as services are performed. In this respect it is unlike wages. It is also unlike compensation paid in direct consideration of services rendered, in amounts over and above an employee\u2019s regular \u201cpaychecks.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 634-35, 759 P.2d at 925-26. Preco takes the position that the amount in the deferral account is similar to the cash value of a life insurance policy because the account is a \u201cfixed benefit of employment status.\u201d The district court, however, distinguished the deferral account from a life insurance policy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-14\">Bilow earned, as payment for services rendered over the course of seven years, the balance of the funds in the deferral account. They were part and parcel of his incentive compensation agreement, and were paid out over a rolling four year period. These funds represent compensation paid in direct consideration of services rendered, over and above Bilow\u2019s \u201cregular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>paychecks\u201d rather than \u201ca fixed benefit of employment status,\u201d as Preco argues. Unlike the cash value of the insurance' policy, the funds in the deferral account were constantly being paid out to Bilow and replenished. The account cannot be said to be a \u201cfixed benefit of employment status.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">Preco contends that the district court misconstrued the term \u201cfixed,\u201d as the court used it in <em>Whitlock, </em>to mean that the <em>amount </em>of the benefit must be \u201cfixed\u201d in order to be a \u201cfixed benefit of employment status.\u201d Preco maintains that the term \u201cfixed\u201d means that the entitlement to the benefit was \u201cfixed\u201d in the sense that it was vested.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Even if the Court in <em>Whitlock </em>used the term \u201cfixed\u201d to mean \u201cvested,\u201d the district court\u2019s analysis focused on the fact that the deferral account differs from a life insurance policy because funds from the deferral account were paid to Bilow every month. The beneficiaries of a life insurance policy do not have the right to receive benefits until the death of the policy holder. Bilow was entitled to the funds of the deferral account upon the happening of certain events \u2014 termination, death or disability \u2014 Bilow was still entitled to the funds even if those events did not occur. According to the employment agreement, \u201cduring each month of this Agreement, Bilow shall be paid ... the amounts previously allocated to the \u2018deferral account\u2019 for that month from \u2018pre-tax profits\u2019 of the prior four (4) years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Preco also relies on <em>Johnson v. Allied Stores Corp., </em>106 Idaho 363, 679 P.2d 640 (1984), to establish that the amount in the deferral account did not constitute \u201cwages.\u201d In <em>Johnson, </em>the Court interpreted I.C. \u00a7 45-608 (now I.C. \u00a7 45-614), a wage collection statute which contains two periods of limitations, to determine which limitation period applies in an action to collect severance pay. The former version of I.C. \u00a7 45-608 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-7\">Any person shall have the right to collect salary, wages, overtime compensation, penalties and liquidated damages provided by any law or pursuant to a contract of employment, but any action thereon shall be commenced in a court of competent jurisdiction within two (2) years after the cause of action shall have accrued, provided, however, that in the event salary or wages have been paid to any employee and such employee claims additional salary, wages, overtime compensation, penalties or liquidated damages, because of work done or services performed during his employment for the <em>pay period </em>covered by said payment, any action therefor shall be commenced within six (6) months from the accrual of the cause of action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-10\"><em>Johnson, </em>106 Idaho at 367, 679 P.2d at 644 (quoting I.C. \u00a7 45-608) (emphasis added). The Court held that the two-year period of limitation applied \u201c[bjecause severance pay is not attributed to, or earned in a specific pay period, but, is earned over the entire course of the employment relationship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The six-month period is inapplicable to a claim for severance pay because it \u201crefers to a claim for additional salary for a <em>specific pay period </em>from which an employee has already received some payment of salary or wages.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b77-11\">Wages, as defined by <em>Whitlock, </em>constitute \u201ccompensation earned in increments as services are performed.\u201d <em>Whitlock, </em>114 Idaho at 634, 759 P.2d at 925. According to Preco, since the district court characterized the deferral account as \u201cpayment for services rendered over the course of seven years,\u201d it is severance pay, rather than a wage. Bilow did earn payment for services rendered over the course of seven years. However, as noted by the district court, \u201cthe funds in the deferral account were constantly being paid out to Bilow and replenished.\u201d As the employment agreement stated, <em>each month </em>Bi-low earned 6.25% of Preeo\u2019s pre-tax profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-12\">Finally, Preco relies on <em>Latham v. Haney Seed Co., </em>119 Idaho 412, 807 P.2d 630 (1991), to support its contention that the amount in the deferral account does not constitute \u201cwages.\u201d In <em>Latham, </em>an employee sought to recover treble the value of a life insurance policy that his employer faded to transfer at the time of his termination. The issue was not whether the life insurance policy constituted \u201cwages,\u201d but whether the claim was barred by the two-year statute of limitations under I.C, \u00a7 45-608. The Court held that at the time the employee filed the action, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>definition of wages under I.C. \u00a7 45-609(3) (now I.C. \u00a7 45-601(4)) \u201cdid not apply to I.C. \u00a7 45-608.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 414, 807 P.2d at 632. As a result, the Court\u2019s decision was not controlled by I.C. \u00a7 45-601(4). The Court in <em>Latham </em>distinguished <em>Whitlock, </em>which was controlled by I.C. \u00a7 45-601(4), and in doing so, stated that \u201c[t]he rationale of the Court of Appeals in holding that the benefits of the life insurance policy that were at issue in <em>Whitlock </em>were not \u2018wages\u2019 was that it was not <em>\u2018compensation earned in increments as services are performed.\u2019\u201d Id. </em>at 415, 807 P.2d at 633 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">The deferral account in this case was \u201ccompensation earned in increments as services are performed.\u201d The portion of the pre-tax profits that Bilow received each month was based upon past years performance, 5% of the current month\u2019s profits being deferred for payment as compensation in the years ahead using the same year averaging formula. Bilow had already earned the money in the deferral account. Furthermore, he earned it in monthly increments.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Finally, the purpose of deferring the incentive compensation is explained in the employment agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-6\">During each month of this Agreement, Bi-low shall be paid any positive total of the following positive and/or <em>negative </em>amounts: (a) 1. 25% of that month\u2019s pre-tax profit, and (b) the amounts previously allocated to the deferral account for that month from pre-tax profits of the prior four years. The effect of such calculation should be to offset a negative pre-tax profit for any month by the positive amount from the deferral account.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">(Emphasis added). In other words,' since it was possible that Preco could experience a negative pre-tax profit, Preco funded the deferral account \"with prior pre-tax profits to ensure that even if Preco did not profit during certain months, Bilow would still receive incentive compensation each month. The fact that there was a balance in the deferral account when Bilow terminated his employment does not mean that it was intended as retirement or similar post-employment benefits. Bilow had already earned that money. The timing of the payment does not change the character of the money paid. The deferral account constitutes wages as contemplated by I.C. \u00a7 45-601(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">THE EMPLOYMENT INCENTIVE AGREEMENT IS NOT WITHIN THE SCOPE OF ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-11\">Preco argues that the employment agreement is a \u201ctop hat\u201d pension benefit plan under ERISA. ERISA contains a broad preemptive clause which states that it \u201cshall supersede any and all State laws insofar as they ... relate to any employee benefit plan.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a). Idaho\u2019s Wage Act conflicts with ERISA. Therefore, if the agreement is within the scope of ERISA, I.C. \u00a7 45-617 is preempted and Show\u2019s wages are not subject to trebling.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-12\">An ERISA pension benefit plan is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-13\">any plan, fund or program ... established or maintained by an employer ... to the extent that by its express terms or as a result of surrounding circumstances such plan, fund or program\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-14\">(i) provides retirement income to employees, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-15\">(ii) results in a deferral of income by employees for periods extending to the termination of covered employment or beyond,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-16\">regardless of the method of calculating the contributions made to the plan, ... or the method of distributing benefits from the plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-17\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(2)(A). In addition to meeting the requirements of an ERISA pension benefit plan, a top hat plan must also be \u201cunfunded and is maintained by an employer primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(1). Bilow does not dispute that the incentive compensation agreement meets the requirements of a top hat plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-18\">Bilow argues, however, that the incentive compensation agreement is a bonus which is exempt from ERISA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>For purposes of title I of the Act and this chapter, the terms \u201cemployee pension benefit plan\u201dand \u201cpension plan\u201d shall not include payments made by an employer to some or all of its employees as bonuses for work performed, unless such payments are systematically deferred to the termination of covered employment and beyond, or so as to provide retirement income to employees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2510.3-2(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">In <em>Hagel v. United Land Co., </em>759 F.Supp. 1199 (E.D.Va.1991), the court sought to determine whether an employment compensation plan was a bonus or a pension plan under ERISA. The plan at issue provided that the employee would receive a bonus based upon the net profits derived from development deals. The payments of the bonuses were spread out over five years. The court held that the agreement was outside the scope of ERISA because the \u201cpayments ... were not systematically deferred____ They were, on the contrary, received by plaintiff during his employment....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1202. Bilow also received his payments during the course of his employment. The <em>Hagel </em>court explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-8\">[a] more natural reading of \u00a7 1002(2)(A)(ii)\u2019s requirement that there be a \u201cdeferral of income ... to the termination of covered employment or beyond\u201d is that the statute requires that a plan generally defer the receipt of income to the termination of employment. The statute is not satisfied when, under the facts of a particular case, a portion of withheld income happens to become due after termination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-10\"><em>Id. </em>In this case, the purpose of the deferral account, as explained above, was to provide Bilow with income even when Preco did not produce a pre-tax profit for the month. The components of the agreement which provide that the deferral account would be payable in the event of retirement, termination, death or disability are incidental to the incentive compensation agreement. Therefore, the agreement was not within the scope of ERISA and is subject to trebling pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 45-617.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-11\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-12\">THE DISTRICT COURT DID NOT ERR IN REFUSING TO AWARD BILOW ATTORNEY FEES.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-14\">Bilow contends he is entitled to attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 45-617(4) which provides, in part, that \u201c[a]ny judgment rendered by a court ... for the plaintiff in a proceeding pursuant to this chapter shall include all costs and attorney fees reasonably incurred.\u201d The district court refused to grant Bilow attorney fees because he failed to file a demand for the fees as required by I.C. \u00a7 45-615.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-15\">In <em>Barth v. Canyon County, </em>128 Idaho 707, 918 P.2d 576 (1996), this Court noted that \u201cIdaho Code \u00a7 45-615 requires an employee who seeks attorney fees in a suit for wages to make a demand \u2018for a sum not to exceed the amount so found due.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 713, 918 P.2d at 582. Bilow argues that <em>BaHh </em>is not controlling because the issue was not whether an employee <em>must </em>make a demand in order to recover attorney fees. While this is true, the Court held that the manner in which the employee made the demand \u201cdestroyed] the effect of the demand\u201d and refused to award him attorney fees. <em>Id. </em>It is clear from <em>Barth, </em>therefore, that unless the employee has made a demand pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 45-615, attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 45-617(4) are not available.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-16\">Bilow also seeks attorney fees pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3), arguing that I.C. \u00a7 45-615 does not provide the exclusive remedy for a party asserting a claim for unpaid wages. Bilow relies on <em>Property Management West, Inc. v. Hunt, </em>126 Idaho 897, 894 P.2d 130 (1995) and <em>Atwood v. Western Constr., Inc., </em>129 Idaho 234, 923 P.2d 479 (Ct.App.1996), holding that I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3) applies in actions between employers and employees to recover contractual compensation. However, neither <em>Property Management </em>nor <em>Atwood </em>involved a claim for unpaid wages under Idaho\u2019s treble damage wage claim law.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-17\">The Idaho Court of Appeals specifically addressed the issue presented in <em>Hutchison </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number><em>v. Anderson, </em>130 Idaho 936, 950 P.2d 1275 (Ct.App.1997):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-4\">Count one of [Hutchisons\u2019] complaints is a breach of contract claim in which the Hutchisons claim a right to attorney fees pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-120. Count two of the complaints is a wage claim filed pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 45-617(4) in which the Hutchisons sought treble damages and attorney fees pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 45-615. The district court awarded the Hutchisons treble damages pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 45-617(4), but then, rather than awarding attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 45-615 as was pled in count two, awarded attorney fees pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-120, which was the attorney fee requested in count one. The district court\u2019s decision to award treble damages indicates that the Hutchisons prevailed at trial on count two. Thus, the district court\u2019s reaching back into count one to award attorney fees is inconsistent with the remaining judgment. Moreover, the Hutchisons concede that they did not meet the criteria for an award of attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 45-615. However, rather than deciding the issue solely based on this procedural point, <em>we will address the substantive question of whether the Hutchisons could be awarded attorney fees pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-120 when the underlying cause of action is a wage claim pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 45-617(4).</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-5\">The Idaho Supreme Court has held that attorney fee awards in suits for wages should be based upon I.C. \u00a7 45-615 (then I.C. \u00a7 45-605). <em>Schoonover v. Bonner County, </em>113 Idaho 916, 923, 750 P.2d 95, 102 (1988). The Court overturned the decision of the district court which had given an award of attorney fees pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-121. That Court also declined to award a plaintiff both treble damages and attorney fees on appeal under I.C. \u00a7 12-121 when the plaintiff had brought a claim for wages. <em>Rodwell v. Serendipity, Inc., </em>99 Idaho 894, 895, 591 P.2d 141, 142 (1979). The Supreme Court held that an award of attorney fees in addition to treble damages would constitute an unreasonable windfall to the employee and would punish the employer too harshly. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, we hold that I.C. \u00a7 45-615 is the <em>exclusive </em>code section under which an employee can recover attorney fees when the employee properly brings a claim for wages and treble damages under I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 45-61[5], - 617.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 942-43, 950 P.2d at 1281-82 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">Bilow criticizes the <em>Hutchison </em>opinion as \u201cjudicial legislation,\u201d arguing that there is no express provision in the wage claim statutes that states that I.C. \u00a7 45-615 is an exclusive source to recover attorney fees. Consequently, he is free to exercise his pre-existing common-law right to sue for breach of contract and seek all the attendant remedies thereto. There are two flaws in this argument. First, where \u201cstatutory provisions are silent as to whether the remedies should be cumulative or mutually exclusive,\u201d the court is free to apply general rules of statutory construction to ascertain the legislative intent behind the statutes. <em>Lawless v. Davis,. </em>98 Idaho 175, 177, 560 P.2d 497, 499 (1977). In <em>Lawless, </em>this Court addressed the issue of whether a plaintiff could recover damages under I.C. \u00a7 45-606 and have that recovery trebled under I.C. \u00a7 45-617(4) (then I.C. \u00a7 45-615(4)). The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-9\">An obvious ambiguity appears when I.C. \u00a7 45-606 and I.C. \u00a7 45-615(4) are considered together. The legislature has not indicated whether it intended the remedies to be available cumulatively or alternatively. We therefore are at liberty to consider the practical consequences of both interpretations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 178, 560 P.2d at 500. The Court further noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-11\">[w]hen choosing between alternative constructions, courts should presume that a statute was not enacted to work a hardship or to effect an oppressive result---[A]ny ambiguity in a statute should be resolved in favor of a reasonable operation of the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-14\"><em>Id. </em>at 177, 560 P.2d at 499. The Court concluded that the legislature intended I.C. \u00a7 45-606 and I.C. \u00a7 45-615(4) to be alternative remedies, noting that cumulative application of the remedies would impose extreme results. <em>Id. </em>(\u201c[A]pplying the two statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>together would give Lawless a recovery equivalent to fourteen times the amount of his withheld wages\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">The practical consequence of determining that I.C. \u00a7 45-617(4) and I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3) are alternative remedies would be that the demand requirement in I.C. \u00a7 45-615 would be pointless. The purpose of imposing a demand requirement for attorney fees in I.C. \u00a7 45-615 would be meaningless if it were possible to avoid the requirement by simply seeking attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3) based on a breach of contract theory. A \u201ccommon sense appraisal of what the legislature intended,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 176, 560 P.2d at 498, leads to the conclusion that I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 45-615 and 45-617 are the exclusive code sections under which an employee can recover attorney fees when the employee brings a claim for wages and treble damages. This conclusion is consistent with this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Schoonover v. Bonner County, </em>113 Idaho 916, 750 P.2d 95 (1988) which disapproved an award of attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-121 and held: \u201cAttorney fee awards in suits for wages are properly awarded pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 45-605 [now I.C. \u00a7 45-615].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 923, 750 P.2d at 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The argument that enactment of Idaho\u2019s wage claim statutes does not bar an employee\u2019s right to also recover common law remedies is flawed. It is true that a breach of contract claim is a pre-existing right of action that Bilow pursued. However, he sought in relation to his breach of contract claim a statutory remedy, not a common law remedy. The Court is free to apply rules of statutory construction when an obvious ambiguity appears between two statutory provisions. <em>Lawless, </em>98 Idaho at 178, 560 P.2d at 500. The Court of Appeals correctly analyzed the issue in <em>Hutchison. </em>Idaho Code \u00a7\u00a7 45-615 and 45-617 are the exclusive code sections under which an employee can recover attorney fees whenever the underlying cause of action is a wage claim pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 45-617(4). Dhow\u2019s claim for attorney fees pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3) is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">The district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to Bilow is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b81-9\">TROUT, C.J., JOHNSON and WALTERS, JJ., and MORFITT, J.
