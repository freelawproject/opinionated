We conclude that section 56-218(1) of the Idaho Code (I.C.), as it existed at times applicable to this case, authorized the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare (the Department) to recover from the available estate of a surviving spouse the balance of Medicaid payments received by an individual who was fifty-five years old or older when receiving the payments if the individual\u2019s estate is inadequate to repay the entire amount. We conclude, however, that federal law applicable to this case prohibited this recovery, except from any community property the spouses may have accumulated after a marriage settlement agreement transmuting their community property into separate property of each. We remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-18\">THE BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b262-19\">Barbara Jackman (Jackman) was the niece of an elderly couple, Hildor and Lionel Knudson (the- Knudsons). Jackman was also Hildor\u2019s guardian and held a durable power of attorney for Lionel. On behalf of the Knudsons, Jackman signed a \u201cMarriage Settlement Agreement\u201d (the agreement) on March 8, 1993. The agreement transmuted most of the Knudsons\u2019 community property into Lionel\u2019s separate property. By the agreement, Hildor received as her separate property her personal property and household effects in her possession, her irrevocable burial trust, and $1,900 in cash. The purpose of the agreement was to make Hildor eligible for Medicaid assistance. Hildor received $41,600.55 in Medicaid payments (the Medicaid payments) prior to her death on October 27,1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-20\">After Hildor\u2019s death, Jackman collected Hildor\u2019s estate pursuant to the procedures for small estates contained in I.C. \u00a7 15-3-1201. After paying Hildor\u2019s funeral expenses and legal fees, Jackman delivered the balance of Hildor\u2019s estate, $1,638.03, to the Department on August 10, 1995. The Department accepted this as a partial settlement of its claim for recovery of the Medicaid payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-21\">Lionel died two weeks after Hildor on November 11, 1994. After Lionel\u2019s death, Jackman initiated probate proceedings for his estate and became Lionel\u2019s personal representative. Lionel\u2019s estate was valued at $40,798.35. The Department sought allowance of a claim against Lionel\u2019s estate to recover the remaining balance of the Medicaid payments (the balance of the Medicaid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>payments). Jackman objected to the Department\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">The magistrate judge denied the Department\u2019s claim against Lionel\u2019s estate because Hildor had an estate, and the Department received the remainder of the estate after expenses. The Department appealed to the district judge, who affirmed the magistrate judge\u2019s decision. The Department appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">I.C. \u00a7 56-218 AUTHORIZED RECOVERY OF THE BALANCE OF THE MEDICAID PAYMENTS FROM LIONEL\u2019S ESTATE.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">The Department asserts that I.C. \u00a7 56-218, as it existed at times applicable to this case, authorized recovery of the balance of the Medicaid payments from Lionel\u2019s estate. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">I.C. \u00a7 56-218 provides that medical assistance \u201cpaid on behalf of an individual who was fiftyfive (55) years of age or older when the individual received such assistance may be recovered from the estate, or if there be no estate the\u2019 estate of the surviving spouse, if any, shall be charged for such aid paid to either or both.... \u201d I.C. \u00a7 56-218(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">In <em>George W. Watkins Family v. Messenger, </em>118 Idaho 537, 797 P.2d 1385 (1990), the Court pointed out: \u201cThe plain meaning of a statute will prevail unless clearly expressed legislative intent is contrary or unless plain meaning leads to absurd results.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 540, 797 P.2d at 1388.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">If we were to read I.C. \u00a7 56-218(1) not to allow recovery from Lionel\u2019s estate of the balance of the Medicaid payments because there was $1,638.03 in Hildor\u2019s estate, our reading would be contrary to expressed legislative intent and would lead to \u201cabsurd results.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This reading would mean that if the estate of a spouse who received Medicaid assistance had even one cent, or a toothbrush, the Department could collect nothing from the estate of the surviving spouse. As acknowledged by Jackman\u2019s attorney at the oral argument of this case, this reading of the statute would mean that there is no circumstance in which the legislative intent to recover from the estate of a surviving spouse would be fulfilled. This result is contrary to the expressed legislative intent that the Department recover from the estate of the surviving spouse under some circumstances. The statute should not be read as preventing recovery from the surviving spouse\u2019s estate even if the recipient\u2019s estate is inadequate for the full recovery of Medicaid payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-15\">From this analysis we conclude that the correct reading of I.C. \u00a7 56-218(1) is that if the estate of the individual who received Medicaid assistance is inadequate to repay the full amount of the assistance received, the Department can recover the balance from the estate of the surviving spouse. Stated in terms of the circumstances of this case, when the Department received the balance of Hildor\u2019s estate, there was \u201cno estate\u201d of Hildor remaining from which the Department could recover the balance of the Medicaid payments. .</p>\n<p id=\"b263-16\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-17\">FEDERAL LAW PREEMPTS THE AUTHORITY GRANTED TO THE DEPARTMENT BY I.C. \u00a7 56-218 TO RECOVER FROM LIONEL\u2019S ESTATE, EXCEPT FROM ANY COMMUNITY PROPERTY OF LIONEL AND HIL-DOR.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-18\">Jackman asserts that federal law applicable to this case does not permit recovery from Lionel\u2019s estate. We agree, except to the extent of any community property Lionel and Hildor accumulated after the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-19\">The pertinent portions of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396p(b)(l)(B) and (4), as enacted in 1993, provide, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-20\">(b) Adjustment or recovery of medical assistance correctly paid under a State plan</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-21\">(1) No adjustment or recovery of any medical assistance correctly paid on behalf of an individual under the State plan may be made, except that the State shall seek adjustment or recovery of any medical assistance correctly paid on behalf of an indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>vidual under the State plan in the case of the following individuals:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-4\">(B) In the case of an individual who was 55 years of age or older when the individual received such medical assistance, the State shall seek adjustment or recovery from the individual\u2019s estate, but only for medical assistance consisting of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-5\">(I) nursing facility services,____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-6\">(4) For purposes of this subsection, the term \u201cestate\u201d, with respect to a deceased individual\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-7\">(A) shall include all real and personal property and other assets included within the individual\u2019s estate, as defined for purposes of State probate law; ----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">This amended statute applied to Medicaid payments for calendar quarters beginning on or after October 1, 1993. Pub.L. 103-66, \u00a7 13612(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">I.C. \u00a7 15-1-201(15) defines \u201cestate,\u201d as follows: \u201c\u2018Estate\u2019 means all property of the decedent, including community property of the surviving spouse subject to administration, property of trusts, and property of any other person whose affairs are subject to this code as it exists from time to time during administration.\u201d The agreement, in addition to transmuting the community property Lionel received into his separate property, contained the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-10\">3. We further specifically agree that the income, rents, issues, profits, capital gains, and other earnings or increases on our separate property as described above and the proceeds from any disposition thereof constitute the separate property of the person owning such property and are not community property. The forgoing [sic] also shall apply to all property that may be separately acquired hereafter by either of us in any manner whatsoever.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Azn\">As authorized by I.C. \u00a7 32-906(1), this provision maintained the separate character of the assets transmuted into Lionel\u2019s separate property by the agreement, as well as \u201cthe income, rents, issues, profits, capital gains, and other earnings or increase\u201d on this separate property. The agreement did not prevent the accumulation of other community property by Lionel and Hildor after the date of the agreement and before Hildor\u2019s death. The record before us does not disclose whether Lionel and Hildor had any community property at the time of Hildor\u2019s death. If they did, Lionel\u2019s interest in that community property may be part of Lionel\u2019s estate, and may therefore be part of Hildor\u2019s \u201cestate\u201d that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396p(b)(l)(B) and (4) authorizes the Department to recover and apply against the balance of the Medicaid payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-12\">The Department contends that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396p(e)(l)(B), enacted in 1993, broadens the \u201cassets\u201d from which it may recover the balance of the Medicaid payments. This portion of the federal law provides, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGi\">(e) Definitions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-13\">In this section, the following definitions shall apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-14\">(1) The term \u201cassets\u201d, with respect to an individual includes all income and resources of the individual and of the individual\u2019s spouse, including any income or resources which the individual or such individual\u2019s spouse is entitled to but does not receive because of action\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-15\">(B) by a person, including a court or administrative body, with legal authority to act in place of or on behalf of the individual or such individual\u2019s spouse,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-16\">We conclude that this definition of \u201cassets\u201d is not applicable to the agreement, which Jack-man signed on behalf of Lionel and Hildor on March 8, 1993. The definition of \u201cassets\u201d contained in the 1993 amendments to the federal statute does not apply \u201cwith respect to assets disposed of on or before the date of the enactment of this Act [Aug. 10, 1993].\u201d Pub.L. 103-66, \u00a7 13611(e). Therefore, it does not apply to the agreement and does not allow the Department to recover the balance of the Medicaid payments from Lionel\u2019s separate property. This is true even though 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396p(b)(4), which applies to Medicaid payments for calendar quarters beginning on or after October 1, 1993, authorizes the Department to recover the Medicaid payments from \u201cother assets.\u201d Without the definition of \u201cassets\u201d contained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396p(e)(1), \u201cother assets\u201d are only those included within Hildor\u2019s estate, as defined by I.C. \u00a7 15-1-201(15). Lionel\u2019s separate property, including the community property transmuted by the agreement, is not part of Hildor\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">We vacate the magistrate judge\u2019s denial of the Department\u2019s claim against Lionel\u2019s estate and remand the case to the magistrate judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">We do not address Jackman\u2019s contention that pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 15-3-720 she is entitled to receive from Lionel\u2019s estate her necessary expenses and disbursements including reasonable attorney fees. This is a question the magistrate judge must consider on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">We award no costs or attorney fees on appeal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b265-9\">TROUT, C.J., and SILAK, SCHROEDER and WALTERS, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
