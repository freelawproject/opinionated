The construction contract was entered into by Northwest Pipeline Corporation (NWP) and Great Plains Pipeline Construction, Inc. (GPPC), and required GPPC to build a new pipeline, compressor pumping stations and related facilities between Pocatello and Burley, Idaho. Delays in the completion of the contract forced GPPC to quit the job, leaving numerous subcontractors, equipment lessors, insurance providers, and other vendors unpaid. GPPC eventually was forced into involuntary bankruptcy, and the subcontractors filed liens against NWP for the unpaid amounts. All but seventeen of these subcontractors settled with NWP before trial. Following trial in the district court,- sixteen of the remaining seventeen subcontractors were awarded judgment against NWP on all or a substantial portion of their claims on alternative legal theories based on Idaho\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien statute, Utah\u2019s bond statute and alleged unjust enrichment. The final judgment and decree against NWP in favor of the successful claimants collectively exceeded $3 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">NWP timely appealed from the judgment, and the subcontractors cross-appealed for the purpose of challenging the trial court\u2019s decision not to allow recovery of any punitive damages. In addition, the remaining subcontractor-claimant, Kirkpatrick &amp; O\u2019Donnell Construction Equipment Co. (K &amp; 0), separately appealed from the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to NWP against K &amp; 0. The appeals were consolidated for disposition. For the following reasons, we affirm in part, and vacate in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-12\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b805-13\">NWP, a regulated utility company, distributes natural gas to customers from New Mexico to the pacific northwest and Canada. In 1992, after review of its customers\u2019 needs, NWP applied to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), for a permit to expand its mainstream transmission line capacity. The entire expansion project consisted of 378 miles of new pipeline loops on NWP\u2019s existing mainline and lateral systems, together with ten new compressor stations, modifications at thirteen more compressor stations, and construction of or additions to thirty-five communication sites. The system expansion was divided into seven different \u201cspreads.\u201d Spread 2 covered a span of seventy-six miles beginning south of Pocatello in Bannock County and running west across Power County to Burley in Cassia County, Idaho. Due to environmental concerns, the FERC approval required construction on Spread 2 to occur during the off-irrigation season.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-14\">After NWP invited bids to construct Spread 2, GPPC of Lubbock, Texas, submitted the lowest bid. Although NWP initially was concerned because GPPC\u2019s bid was significantly lower than any of the other bids, NWP\u2019s concerns were resolved on further investigation when NWP concluded that GPPC had sufficient assets to complete the job as bid. The contract between NWP and GPPC was entered into in Utah and explicitly required the application of Utah law. Utah has a bond statute (Utah Code \u00a7 14-2-2) that operates parallel to a mechanic\u2019s lien law. NWP did not require GPPC to post a bond under the Utah statute, thus waiving the requirement and reducing the contract costs by the sum of $160,000 representing the bond premium.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>The construction was to begin in October of 1992, but FERC\u2019s notice to proceed was not issued until November 16, 1992, three weeks later than expected. At that time GPPC began the mobilization of men and equipment, and actual construction started in early December of 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">In January of 1993, GPPC notified NWP that Spread 2 could not be completed as originally bid due to delays in starting, extreme weather, conditions, and underestimations in the cost of the project. NWP obtained bids to complete construction from several other contractors, but elected to have GPPC complete the job since GPPC\u2019s cost to complete the project was far less than the other contractors\u2019 bids. Thereafter, NWP and GPPC renegotiated the contract, and construction continued through April of 1993. However, in May of 1993, GPPC halted construction, leaving subcontractors, equipment lessors, insurance providers, and other vendors unpaid in amounts exceeding $6 million. NWP refused to make further payments to GPPC, but did pay Precision Blasting and Smackover Pressure Testing from the retain-age.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">Thereafter, GPPC filed a claim of lien against NWP and the pipeline and informed the subcontractors to do the same, because GPPC was unable to pay them. Approximately fifty subcontractors, equipment lessors, insurance providers, and other vendors filed claims of lien against NWP. In addition, on May 8, 1993, NWP filed suit against GPPC in Utah state court for breaching the prime contract. In July of 1993, the subcontractors, equipment lessors, insurance providers and vendors, including GPPC, filed complaints against NWP in the district court in Idaho in Bannock County in the Sixth Judicial District. Those actions included foreclosure of mechanics\u2019 liens, claims under Utah\u2019s bond statute, and allegations of unjust enrichment.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-9\">On August 5, 1993, GPPC was dismissed from the Idaho suit; however, the other various claims remained in Idaho and were consolidated into the present litigation regardless of the county in which the work on Spread 2 may have been accomplished. The ease was eventually removed to federal court where GPPC was forced by NWP into involuntary bankruptcy. Some of the pending claims were settled in the bankruptcy action. In January of 1994, the Idaho and Utah state court actions were removed to federal district eourt, but in August of 1994, the federal court remanded the subcontractors\u2019 claims to the Idaho state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-10\">On September 16, 1994, following remand to the state court, the district court in Bannock County issued a memorandum decision determining several of the initial, controlling issues. The district court held that NWP\u2019s waiver of the Utah bond requirement allowed the subcontractors and vendors to invoke the Utah private payment bond statute as a remedy. The district court also held that Idaho\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien statutes applied to those claimants who had supplied tools and equipment, and who had supplied rental equipment and machinery but did not apply to those claimants who had supplied repair parts. In a later memorandum decision, the district court also held that suppliers of insurance have a lien claim under I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 45-501 to -524 and a claim under Utah Code \u00a7 14-2-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-11\">Consistent with its memorandum decisions, the district, court granted NWP summary judgment on March 13, 1995, as to K &amp; O\u2019s lien claim for repair parts. Thereafter, the district court dismissed K &amp; O\u2019s Utah bond statute claim, and eventually dismissed K &amp; O\u2019s unjust enrichment claim as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-12\">After most of the claims against NWP were settled and K &amp; O\u2019s action dismissed, sixteen claimants remained. Of those sixteen, fourteen were represented by Louis Racine, Jr. (Racine Subcontractors).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>quently, the district court bifurcated the claims, holding that the Idaho lien claims and the unjust enrichment claims were equitable in nature and thus were not proper for determination by a jury. The district court concluded that the bond claims would be tried to a jury, but because the bond and lien claims were identical both would be tried together with the jury\u2019s verdict being advisory to the court as to the lien claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\">The trial on the remaining bond and lien claims lasted from April 27,1995, to June 23, 1995. On June 26, 1995, the jury returned a special verdict on the sixteen claims under the Utah payment bond statute theory and found in favor of thirteen claimants. Cowboy Oil, V-1 Oil, and GPE did not recover from the jury on the bond statute theory. The district court reserved decision on the lien claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">Following a trial on the unjust enrichment claims, on January 8, 1996, the district court entered a memorandum decision and findings of fact regarding the lien claims and the unjust enrichment claims. The district court held in favor of the sixteen remaining claimants. On March 15, 1996, the district court entered an <em>errata </em>memorandum decision to correct the amounts awarded to the claimants under the unjust enrichment theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">All parties moved for attorney fees, costs and prejudgment interest, and on July 19, 1996, the district court awarded fees and costs to the prevailing claimants totaling more than $800,000 against NWP. NWP was awarded just over $5,000 in costs and fees against K &amp; O. Consistent with the jury verdict and various decisions, the final judgment and decree of foreclosure was entered against NWP. The collective amount of the final judgment and decree of foreclosure against NWP exceeded $3 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-10\">ISSUES ON APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b807-11\">A.

Whether the district court erred in awarding attorney fees and costs to NWP.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">Before we address the issues raised, we note that this Court must defer to findings of fact based upon substantial evidence but will review freely the conclusions of law reached by stating legal rules or principles and applying them to the facts found. <em>Sun Valley Shamrock Resources, Inc. v. Travelers Leasing Corp., </em>118 Idaho 116, 118, 794 P.2d 1389, 1391 (1990). Accordingly, we exercise free review over the district court\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>Kawai Farms, Inc. v. Longstreet, </em>121 Idaho 610, 613, 826 P.2d 1322, 1325 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">\n<em>A</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b808-9\"><em>NWP\u2019S </em>ISSUES'</p>\n<p id=\"b808-10\">1. WHETHER THE DISTRICT COURT ERRED IN DETERMINING THAT SUPPLIERS OF LEASED EQUIPMENT, INSURANCE AND FUEL ARE COVERED UNDER IDAHO\u2019S LIEN STATUTES.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-11\">a. Suppliers of leased equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-12\">We first consider whether the district court erred in allowing lien claims for equipment lessors. The claims sought recovery of unpaid rental charges on leased equipment. NWP contends that Atlas, CRC-Evans, Darby, GPE, Rocky Mountain, Rasmussen and Cate-Idaho should not have been allowed to pursue liens pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 45-501 because the statute does not encompass lessors of equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-14\">The right to acquire and enforce a mechanic\u2019s or materialman\u2019s lien was unknown at common law and originally was also not allowed in equity. R.Y. Liang, Annotation, <em>Charge for Use of Machinery, Tools, or Appliances Used in Construction as Basis for Mechanic\u2019s Lien, </em>3 A.L.R.3d 573 (1965). Because such a right exists solely as a result of statutory enactment, it depends entirely upon application of the statute involved. <em>Id. </em>at 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-15\">Idaho Code \u00a7 45-501 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-16\">Right to lien. \u2014 Every person performing labor upon, or furnishing materials to be used in the construction, alteration or repair of any mining claim, building, wharf, bridge, ditch, dike, flume, tunnel, fence, machinery, railroad, wagon road, aqueduct to create hydraulic power, or any other structure, or who grades, fills in, levels, surfaces or otherwise improves land ... and every professional engineer or licensed surveyor under contract who prepares or furnishes designs, plans, plats, maps, specifications, drawings, surveys, estimates of cost, on site observation or supervision, or who renders any other professional service whatsoever for which he is legally authorized to perform in connection with any land or building development or improvement, or to establish boundaries, has a lien upon the same for the work or labor done or professional services or materials furnished.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b808-17\">NWP asserts that I.C. \u00a7 45-501 applies only to persons \u201cperforming labor upon\u201d or \u201cfurnishing materials to be used in\u201d construction projects, and does not apply to lessors of equipment. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-18\">When applying this statute, this Court has held the provisions are to be liberally construed in the favor of the persons who perform labor upon or furnish materials to be used in the construction, alteration, or repair of a building or structure. <em>Pierson v. Sewell, </em>97 Idaho 38, 539 P.2d 590 (1975); <em>Dybvig v. Willis, </em>59 Idaho 160, 82 P.2d 95 (1938). The rule of liberal construction of statutory hens, however, does not permit the court to create a lien where none exists or was intended by the legislature. <em>Boone v. P </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number><em>&amp; B Logging Co., Inc., </em>88 Idaho 111, 397 P.2d 31 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">In determining who may assert a hen against a landowner\u2019s property pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 45-501, this Court has stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-5\">Under this statute the legislature evidently intended to grant the right to claim a hen to any person who contributes labor or materials for the construction, alteration, or repair of a building or structure upon real property____ [I]t was clearly the intent of the legislature to grant an absolute hen direct upon the property, to the person who performs labor upon, or furnishes materials to be used in a building, structure or other improvement without reference to whether such person performing such labor, or furnishing material, is an original contractor or subcontractor, or a laborer or a materialman, and without reference to whether there is anything due the original contractor from the person or corporation constructing such building or other improvement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-7\"><em>Hill v. Twin Falls Water Co., </em>22 Idaho 274, 279, 125 P. 204, 206 (1912). Referring to I.C. \u00a7 45-501, this Court has also held that the statute</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-8\">grant[s] the right to claim a lien for \u201cthe value of the labor or material furnished and used in or about the construction, alteration or repair of the building, structure or other works.\u201d That right of lien is based on the theory that the claimant has, either by his labor or by the materials furnished and used, contributed to the construction or improvement of the property against which the hen is asserted. Hence, where the labor is not used or the materials are not incorporated into the building, structure or improvement, no hen on land or building results.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-9\"><em>Chief Industries, Inc. v. Schwendiman, </em>99 Idaho 682, 687, 587 P.2d 823, 828 (1978) <em>{quoting Chamberlain v. City of Lewiston, </em>23 Idaho 154, 163, 129 P. 1069, 1071 (1912)) (citations omitted, emphasis deleted). In the <em>Chamberlain </em>case, a hen was claimed for the construction of an extension into the Clear-water River of the intake pipe servicing the pumping plant of the water system of the City of Lewiston. A portion of the claim of hen was for labor and material furnished to build a coffer-dam in the river preparatory to construction of the pipe extension. The coffer-dam subsequently washed out and was swept away by a flood. On appeal, the city argued that the coffer-dam was not part of the contract in the case, and its loss therefore was beyond the liability of the city. In response, the Court held that construction of the pipe extension necessitated the building of the coffer-dam or some similar method in order to do the work. As to the loss of the labor and materials that went into the dam, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-11\">When a man contracts to have a building erected, he knows that the contractors and builders will be obliged to have scaffolding and other material that does not actually go into the building, but which may practically be used and consumed and destroyed in the course of the work. Such material and the labor incident thereto is as much a part of the contract as if it were specified and set forth in the contract itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-12\">23 Idaho at 165, 129 P. at 1072. Accordingly, the Court allowed recovery for the labor and materials that went into the coffer-dam before it was destroyed.</p>\n<p id=\"ALz\">The use of equipment in carrying out labor or providing materials is analogous to the use of tools discussed in two prior Idaho cases. In <em>Naylor v. Lewiston &amp; S.E. Elec. Ry. Co., </em>14 Idaho 789, 96 P. 573 (1908), this Court addressed whether a supplier of tools would be entitled to a claim of hen. The Court held that the charge for the use of tools consumed in construction work is a lienable item. <em>Id. </em>at 802, 96 P. at 576. The Court stated that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABef\">if a person furnishes tools which are used and consumed in the construction of work, such person would be entitled to a lien for the same reason that gives a lien for the use and consumption of material. The use and consumption of tools ought to give the same right as the use and consumption of materials.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-15\"><em>Id. </em>Likewise, while addressing the opposite situation, the Court in <em>Ninneman v. City of Lewiston, </em>23 Idaho 169, 129 P. 1073 (1912), disallowed a hen for tools that were not used or consumed in the pipe extension repair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>work discussed in <em>Chamberlain. </em>The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-4\">It will be necessary, however, for the judgment to be modified in this case so as to eliminate therefrom the value of tools and appliances which did not go into or become a part of the work or improvement, and were not used or consumed in or about the work. A lien cannot be allowed for tools and appliances which are the property of the contractors and may be used from time to time in other works <em>or which do not go as a part of the building or improvement and necessarily enter therein.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">23 Idaho at 171, 129 P. at 1073 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">Similarly here, the leased equipment was not incorporated into, or consumed and destroyed by, the construction project. The district court below, however, adopted the reasoning of the Wyoming Supreme Court in <em>United Pacific Ins. Co. v. Martin &amp; Luther General Contractors, Inc., </em>455 P.2d 664 (1969), and concluded that rented equipment is \u201cconsumed\u201d to the extent that its measurable useful life is diminished while the equipment is put to use on a project. In essence this reasoning allows for the assertion of a hen based upon a theory of partial consumption of the asset.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">We are not persuaded to follow the lead of the Wyoming court, and we reject the suggestion that there may be a partial consumption of equipment as a basis for permitting a claim of lien under I.C. \u00a7 45-501. Consistent with the previous expressions of this Court about the consumption or destruction of items which may serve as the basis for a lien, we find enlightening the decision of the Rhode Island Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-8\">There is little doubt that Logan contributed to the value of the construction project by leasing equipment to the Lawrence Group. The contribution of value, however, is not what the statute requires. Rather, the furnishing of labor or materials forms the basis for a mechanic\u2019s lien.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-9\">\u201cIt is generally held under applicable lien laws that machinery not (a) totally depreciated by use on the property or (b) incorporated into the improvement, or (c) in connection with which labor was also supplied could not be the basis of a valid lien.\u201d <em>Air Service Co. v. Cosmo Investments, Inc., </em>115 Ga.App. 596, 597, 155 S.E.2d 413, 414 (1967). The excavation equipment in question was not totally depreciated by its use, nor was it incorporated into the improvement. Therefore, it does not satisfy the definition of materials.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-11\">Logan\u2019s appeal now turns on a contention that he did work. \u201cIt is well settled that the rental or the value of the use of machinery cannot be the basis for the claim of a mechanic\u2019s lien.\u201d <em>Wilkinson v. Pacific Midi-West Oil Co., </em>152 Kan. 712, 714, 107 P.2d 726, 727 (1940). Fifty years later, this statement still represents the majority view. Some jurisdictions have amended their statutes to include expressly the rental of equipment as the basis for a lien. But when the statute speaks only in terms of work done or materials furnished, as does our own law, jurisdictions generally deny recovery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-12\"><em>Logan Equipment v. Profile Constr. Co., </em>585 A.2d 73, 74-75 (R.I.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-13\">Like the Rhode Island court, the New Mexico Supreme Court held that rent for equipment used in excavation and comparable construction work was not a lienable item. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-14\">While we may feel that in view of our changed methods and construction work generally, and the increased and ever-increasing use of machinery to replace manual labor, the rental of such machinery might well be the basis of a claim of lien, we do not find such to be the law as it exists in New Mexico today; nor do we believe we should enlarge the scope of our present lien law by judicial construction, but that the wisdom and necessity of so doing should be determined by and left to the legislature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-15\"><em>Lembke Constr. Co., Inc. v. J.D. Coggins Co., </em>72 N.M. 259, 382 P.2d 983, 989 (1963)</p>\n<p id=\"b810-16\">Similar to the conclusions reached by the Rhode Island and New Mexico courts with regard to their lien statutes, we hold that under I.C. \u00a7 45-501 a rental charge for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>equipment used in construction will not serve as the basis for a mechanic\u2019s or material-man\u2019s lien. Although this proposition may appear inequitable in light of the value contributed to the construction project by the use of the claimants\u2019 equipment, we cannot supply new statutory meaning where the legislature has not clearly spoken. If the legislature wishes to extend the protection of the mechanic\u2019s and materialman\u2019s lien statute to lessors of equipment, then the legislature may amend the statute as other jurisdictions have done. Until then, this Court is constrained by the present terms of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">The district court\u2019s decision, allowing recovery by way of mechanic\u2019s liens under I.C. \u00a7 45-501 of unpaid rental charges for leased equipment, is set aside. The judgment is vacated insofar as directing the foreclosure of the lien claims of Atlas Copco Rental, CRC-Evans Pipeline, Darby Enterprises, Great Plains Equipment, Rocky Mountain Machinery, and Cate-Idaho.</p>\n<p id=\"ABa\">b. Suppliers of Insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">We next consider whether Idaho\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien statute applies to the recovery of unpaid insurance premiums by a supplier of insurance. Only one insurance provider, Pickard Tate &amp; Allen (PTA), was permitted by the district court to foreclose its claim for a lien under I.C. \u00a7 45-501. PTA had contracted with GPPC to provide general liability and equipment insurance for the Spread 2 project. The district court concluded that PTA contributed to the construction of the Spread 2 project by providing insurance coverage to the general contractor. The district court held that \u201c[a] portion of each [insurance] contract was consumed during the construction of [NWP\u2019s] pipeline.\u201d Consequently, the district court held that PTA had a valid lien claim for its unpaid insurance premiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">NWP contends that PTA cannot recover under the lien statutes because the insurance provided continues beyond the completion of the project. Thus, the insurance is not labor and is not consumed within the project.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-10\">As previously stated, the underlying purpose of Idaho\u2019s lien statutes is to protect those who perform labor or furnish material to the extent of the value that the owner\u2019s property is improved. The providing of liability insurance coverage is neither labor nor material that is consumed in the process of structurally improving real property. As with the claim for recovery of rental payments due for the lease of equipment, the liability insurance premium claim fails because it is not within the mechanic\u2019s lien statute. <em>Compare </em>I.C. \u00a7 45-517, which provides that the cost of worker\u2019s compensation insurance shall be considered \u201clabor\u201d for the purpose of collecting under Idaho\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien statute. While the legislature has provided protection for the recovery of worker\u2019s compensation security in the mechanic\u2019s lien laws, it has not so provided for any other form of insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-11\">We therefore hold that PTA\u2019s claim for unpaid premiums relating to general liability and equipment insurance relating to the Spread 2 project is not protected by Idaho\u2019s lien statutes. The district court\u2019s decision to the contrary is set aside, and the judgment allowing foreclosure of PTA\u2019s claim of lien is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-12\">c. Suppliers of Fuel.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-13\">NWP contends that the district court erred in holding that suppliers of fuel and lubrication products used for construction equipment and passenger vehicles, such as was provided to GPPC by Beard Oil, can recover under Idaho\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien statute. Moreover, NWP asserts that Beard Oil essentially acted as a lender to GPPC by arranging to extend a general line of credit to GPPC for fuel and that lenders have no lien rights. NWP\u2019s lender theory traces the following path: Beard Oil, of Michigan, would contract with local suppliers for delivery of fuel to tanks and GPPC\u2019s construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>yard; Beard Oil would then add on its 30% mark-up to the cost of the fuel, carry the account as a receivable and bill it, with the mark-up, to GPPC. This process, opined NWP, made Beard Oil a lender of credit to GPPC. The district court rejected NWP\u2019s theory and again followed the Wyoming court in <em>United Pacific Ins. Co. v. Martin &amp; Luther General Contractors, Inc., supra, </em>by holding that because fuel and oil were materials used and consumed in the construction of Spread 2, Beard Oil\u2019s charges were the proper subject of a lien claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">For the same reasons stated above with regard to the rental of equipment and providing of liability insurance, we conclude that Beard Oil was not entitled to claim a lien for its fuel and oil account. We reach this conclusion with some guidance from the decisions of this Court in <em>State ex rel. Modem Motor Co., Inc. v. H &amp; K Construction Co., </em>75 Idaho 492, 274 P.2d 1002 (1954), and <em>People ex rel. White v. Storm, </em>49 Idaho 246, 287 P. 689 (1930). In each of those cases, the Court decided that costs for gasoline and oil supplied in highway construction are recoverable under Idaho\u2019s public contractor\u2019s bond statute as indirectly contributing to the work, while recognizing that similar claims for recovery for fuel are not permissible under the mechanic\u2019s lien statute because such is not \u201clabor and materials that are lienable under the mechanic\u2019s lien law in its relation to private structures.\u201d <em>Modem Motor, </em>75 Idaho at 495, 274 P.2d at 1003; <em>White, </em>49 Idaho at 246, 287 P. at 692. Accordingly, we set aside the district court\u2019s decision that permitted Beard Oil to pursue a claim of lien for supplying fuel products, and we vacate that portion of the judgment allowing foreclosure of Beard Oil\u2019s claim of lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">2. WHETHER THE DISTRICT COURT ERRED IN DETERMINING THAT THE CLAIMS OF LIEN ADEQUATELY DESCRIBE THE PROPERTY.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">In addition to directly challenging the underlying bases asserted by the various plaintiffs claiming lien rights, NWP contends that the lien claims failed to sufficiently describe the property pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 45-507. NWP submits that the claimants did not provide descriptions by metes and bounds, but rather described the property as \u201cthe pipeline,\u201d which is underground and cannot be found in the public records. As a-result of our conclusions that liens could not be claimed for equipment rental, for fuel and oil products or for liability and equipment insurance, this challenge is reduced to consideration of the lien of only one claimant\u2014 Miehetti Pipe Stringing.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">Idaho Code \u00a7 45-507 provides that the notice of a claim of lien must contain \u201ca description of the property to be charged with the lien, sufficient for identification.\u201d If the \u201cclaim of lien has a fatally defective description, there can be no valid lien.\u201d <em>Chief Industries, Inc. v. Schwendiman, </em>99 Idaho at 685, 587 P.2d at 826. Where there is no building or structure that can be properly identified, the claim of lien must contain a sufficient description in order for the court or an interested third person to identify the property against which the lien is asserted. <em>Id. </em>at 686, 587 P.2d at 827. The description will be sufficient if it enables \u201ca party familiar with the locality to identify the premises intended to be described with reasonable certainty, to the exclusion of others.\u201d <em>Turnboo v. Keele, </em>86 Idaho 101, 105, 383 P.2d 591, 593 (1963). Whether the description in any particular case is sufficient for identification is a question of fact to be determined by the jury or the court upon a consideration of the circumstances of the case, and \u201cwhere the controversy involves only the rights of the lien claimants and the owners, \u2018unless the description was such as to mislead the owner, any mere lack of accuracy therein is not available as a defense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 106, 383 P.2d at 594 <em>(quoting Union Lumber Co. v. Simon, </em>150 Cal. 751, 89 P. 1077 (1906)).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">The sufficiency of the description in the liens was determined by the district court, as the trier of fact concerning the claims of liens, upon motions by the parties for summary judgment. <em>Riverside Development Co. v. Ritchie, </em>103 Idaho 515, 650 P.2d 657 (1982). The district court concluded with respect to this issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-10\">[The] Plaintiffs have demonstrated by affidavit that, through the use of the prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>erty descriptions contained in the liens, two different people familiar with the locality have been able to identify the property with reasonable certainty. Due to the unique nature of the project at issue, it is apparent that any person familiar with the surrounding area, accompanied by the maps and diagrams provided and referenced in plaintiffs\u2019 lien, would be able to locate the liened property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-4\">This Court concludes as a matter of law that the property descriptions contained in the liens filed by all of the plaintiffs are sufficient for purposes of identification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">We agree and hold that the property descriptions contained in the claims of lien substantially complied with I.C. \u00a7 45-507 and sufficiently identified the liened property.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">3. WHETHER THE DISTRICT COURT ERRED IN ALLOWING CLAIMS BASED ON UTAH\u2019S PRIVATE BOND STATUTE.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">\u2019 We turn next to whether the district court erred in allowing recovery to several of the plaintiffs who asserted claims based on Utah\u2019s private bond statutes, Utah Code \u00a7\u00a7 14-2-1 and 14-2-2, as an alternative theory for recovery of the unpaid amounts due the subcontractors when GPPC terminated construction of the pipeline. The district court agreed with the plaintiffs and held that-those parties whose claims of lien were determined to be defective could pursue a cause of action under the Utah statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-16\">The contract between NWP and GPPC contained a provision stating: \u201cThis Contract and the rights and obligations of the parties shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Utah.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court held that this provision permitted the plaintiffs to invoke the Utah private bond statutes as third party beneficiaries to the arrangement between NWP and GPPC. In particular, Utah Code \u00a7 14-2-1 requires a landowner to secure a bond from a contractor for certain construction projects on his property.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under Utah Code \u00a7 14-2-2, if the owner fails to secure the bond required by Utah Code \u00a7 14-2-1, a person who performed a labor or service, or supplied equipment or materials to the construction project, has a private cause of action against the property owner for the reasonable value of the labor or service performed or the equipment or materials furnished.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Notwithstanding their reference to \u201cthe laws of the State of Utah\u201d in their contract, NWP and GPPC decided to waive the bond that otherwise would have been required by \u00a7 14-2-1, thereby saving the sum of $160,000 for the cost of the bond. The district court held that NWP\u2019s failure to obtain the payment bond referred to in -the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>Utah statutes rendered it liable to the subcontractors whose claims were unsecured by liens, as intended third party beneficiaries of the construction project.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">In reaching its decision, the district court stated that <em>Seubert Excavators, Inc. v. Eucon Corp., </em>125 Idaho 744, 753, 874 P.2d 555, 564 (Ct.App.1993), <em>review granted, modified on other grounds, </em>125 Idaho 409, 871 P.2d 826 (1994), \u201cdemonstrate that the plaintiffs are properly regarded as third party beneficiaries of the contract under <em>Idaho Code </em>\u00a7 29-102 (1980)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and are allowed to enforce the provisions of the contract and rely on it for protection.\u201d We disagree with the district court\u2019s application of <em>Seubert.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">The <em>Seubert </em>case involved a claim by a subcontractor against the surety on a public works contract bond required by the state of Washington. The surety argued that an unpaid subcontractor cannot maintain a third party beneficiary cause of action against the surety. On appeal, the Idaho Court of Appeals determined that the subcontractor could proceed under I.C. \u00a7 29-102 as a third party beneficiary of a contract made for its direct benefit as an intended result of Washington\u2019s public contracts bond statute because the bond had been issued for the protection and benefit of subcontractors. The court applied I.C. \u00a7 29-102 because Washington law had not been pled as a basis for relief, and the case was tried under Idaho law. 125 Idaho at 753, n. 7, 874 P.2d at 564, n. 7. On review, however, this Court bypassed determining the application of I.C. \u00a7 29-102 and simply stated that: \u201c[T]his Court has long held that unpaid subcontractors are third party beneficiaries of performance and payment bonds which are virtually identical to the one at bar and which are executed by guarantors in favor of the owners of particular projects.\u201d 125 Idaho at 417, 871 P.2d at 832. Thus, <em>Seubert </em>stands for the proposition that, where a performance or payment bond exists, a subcontractor is a third party beneficiary of the bond as a matter of law and can bring a direct action against the surety or guarantor on the bond. <em>Seubert </em>does not stand for the proposition that a subcontractor is the third party beneficiary of any other type of contract or that failure to require or to obtain a private contractor\u2019s bond places the subcontractor, who would otherwise have been protected with the bond, in the status of a third party beneficiary of a contract between the general contractor and the property owner.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-7\">Enforcement by beneficiary\u2014 A contract, made expressly for the benefit of a third person, may be enforced by him at any time before the parties thereto rescind it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b814-9\">Here, it appears that the Utah code provisions were adopted by the Utah legislature as measures intended to apply to construction contracts in the state of Utah. There is no indication in the Utah statutes that they should have any extraterritorial effect. The Utah statutes were not \u201ccontracts\u201d made for the benefit of third persons. The statutes contemplated the existence of a payment bond which could be resorted to by subcontractors in Utah for payment of sums due them. Failure to obtain the payment bond would render the owner liable to a subcontractor in Utah \u2014 not because the subcontractor was the third party beneficiary of a contract \u2014 but by virtue of the terms of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-10\">As noted, Idaho Code \u00a7 29-102 provides that a contract made expressly for the benefit of a third person may be enforced by the third person at any time before the parties thereto rescind it. Here, the contract entered into between NWP and GPPC was not made expressly for the benefit of any of the plaintiffs as third parties to the arrangement between NWP and GPPC. The contract merely referenced Utah law, and sofar as applicable, \u00a7 14-2-2 of the Utah Code protects subcontractors in Utah, not because of a status as contractual third party beneficiaries, but by virtue of statutory grace.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-11\">We hold that the generalized statement in the NWP-GPPC contract, that the contract and the rights and obligations of the parties shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Utah, does not suffice to invoke the terms of I.C. \u00a7 29-102, as \u201ca contract made expressly for the benefit of a third person.\u201d The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>court\u2019s decision that the plaintiffs who did not have valid liens could recover under the Utah bond statutes, as an alternative theory, is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\">4. WHETHER THE DISTRICT COURT ERRED IN ALLOWING THE UNJUST ENRICHMENT CLAIMS.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">We next address the viability of the unjust enrichment claims. NWP contends that the subcontractors, not in privity with NWP, cannot recover under an implied contract claim. The district court acknowledged that a subcontractor cannot sue an owner for quantum meruit based on an implied promise to pay, but held that an unjust enrichment claim is not based on an implied promise to pay. In this regal\u2019d, the district court misapplied <em>Dale\u2019s Service Co., Inc. v. Jones, </em>96 Idaho 662, 534 P.2d 1102 (1975), and incorrectly created a distinction between an action for quantum meruit and unjust enrichment because both quantum meruit and unjust enrichment do involve claims based on an implicit promise to pay.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In <em>Continental Forest Products, Inc. v. Chandler Supply Co., </em>95 Idaho 739, 518 P.2d 1201 (1974), this Court recognized three types of contractual arrangements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-6\">First is the express contract wherein the parties expressly agree regarding a transaction. Secondly, there is the implied in fact contract wherein there is no express agreement but the conduct of the parties implies an agreement from which an obligation in contract exists. The third category is called an implied in law contract, or quasi contract. However, a contract implied in law is not a contract at all, but an obligation imposed by law for the purpose of bringing about justice and equity without reference to the intent or the agreement of the parties and, in some cases, in spite of an agreement between the parties. It is a non-contractual obligation that is to be treated procedurally <em>as if </em>it were a contract, and is often referred to as quasi contract, unjust enrichment, implied in law contract or restitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 743, 518 P.2d at 1205 (citations omitted; emphasis in original). In <em>Smith v. Smith, </em>95 Idaho 477, 511 P.2d 294 (1973), the Court noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-11\">\u201cRestitution\u201d and \u201cunjust enrichment\u201d are the modern designations for the older doctrine of \u201cquasi contracts.\u201d The substance of an action for unjust enrichment <em>lies in a promise, implied by law, </em>that a party will render to the person entitled thereto that which in equity and good conscience belongs to the latter. (Citations omitted; emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-12\">The two theories, quantum meruit and unjust enrichment, are simply different measures of recovery as equitable remedies. The doctrine of quantum meruit permits recovery, on the basis of an implied promise to pay, of the reasonable value of the services rendered or the materials provided. <em>Peavey v. Pellandini, </em>97 Idaho 655, 551 P.2d 610 (1976). Unjust enrichment, as a fictional promise or obligation implied by law, allows recovery where the defendant has received a benefit from the plaintiff that would be inequitable for the defendant to retain without compensating the plaintiff for the value of the benefit. <em>Continental Forest Products, Inc., </em>95 Idaho at 743, 518 P.2d at 1205.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-13\">Neither of these two theories allows <em>recovery </em>by a subcontractor who lacks a contractual relationship directly with a property owner. While couched in terms of discussing a claim for recovery on the basis of quantum meruit, this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Dale\u2019s Service </em>is equally dispositive as to a subcontractor\u2019s claim for recovery on a theory of unjust enrichment arising from an implied obligation. There the Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>We do not believe that T &amp; J [the subcontractors] have a basis for recovery against O.K. [the landowner] under a quantum meruit theory. The general rule in this area is that a subcontractor who furnishes material or labor pursuant to an agreement with, or upon the order and credit of a general contractor cannot recover against the property owner upon the basis of an implied promise to pay arising from the owner\u2019s receipt and acceptance of the benefit of the material and labor furnished. Thus it is said that a landowner will not be held liable for work or material furnished by a subcontractor to a contractor, pursuant to a contractual arrangement between the contractor and subcontractor, where the landowner is not a party to this contractual arrangement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-4\">It is true that there is an exception to this general rule under the mechanic\u2019s lien laws, where if a subcontractor is not paid, he may enforce his claim for compensation directly against the landowner. However, T &amp; J did not avail themselves of this remedy, and therefore this exception is inapplicable to the case at hand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b816-5\"><em>Dale\u2019s Service, </em>96 Idaho at 666-67, 534 P.2d at 1106-07. In the present case, the plaintiff subcontractors, who did not have express contracts directly with NWP, were limited to recovery upon their claims under the mechanic\u2019s lien statute. Absent that right of recovery, they have no cause of action directly against NWP for alleged unjust enrichment.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">The decision of the district court allowing recovery to the subcontractors as plaintiffs on the grounds of unjust enrichment are set aside, and the judgments entered on those theories are vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">5. WHETHER THE DISTRICT COURT ERRED IN REVERSING THE JURY VERDICT ON MICHETTI\u2019S CLAIMS.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">Michetti contracted with GPPC to load, haul and string eighty-foot sections of pipe along NWP\u2019s Spread 2 pipeline expansion project. On Michetti\u2019s Utah bond claims, the jury returned a verdict for Michetti on its contract at $1.10 per foot but did not award Michetti additional costs because the jury found that the contract had not been modified. The district court held that the evidence was clearly insufficient to support the jury verdict and granted a new trial as to the Utah bond claims. Holding that the jury\u2019s verdict was advisory as to the lien and unjust enrichment claims, the court then awarded Michetti additional costs because the court found that the contract was modified as to Michetti\u2019s lien and unjust enrichment claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-10\">On appeal, NWP argues that the district court incorrectly rejected the jury\u2019s verdict and determined that Michetti\u2019s contract with GPPC was modified. NWP asserts that the jury\u2019s verdict should be upheld and that the contract was not modified because there was no new consideration, the new contract price was not included in any modification, and there was no impossibility preventing performance. Furthermore, NWP asserts that the district court erred in granting Michetti a new trial as to the Utah bond claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-11\">We agree that the district court erred in granting a new trial on the alternative cause of action based upon the Utah bond statute, for the reasons stated in part IV(A)(3), above. The issue remains, however, whether the contract between Michetti and GPPC was modified, thus allowing Michetti to recover additional amounts over those found by the advisory jury on the lien claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-12\">Michetti\u2019s original bid to string the pipe was for $1.27 per foot of pipe installed. However, Michetti eventually lowered its bid to $1.10 per foot based on the projection that Michetti could string 13,000 feet per day and complete the project in thirty-five days. The bid included a projected profit of $50,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-13\">GPPC then awarded Michetti the contract and notified Michetti that the stringing was to begin during the week of December 2, 1992. On December 1, 1992, Michetti sent its foreman to the job site to mobilize equipment and personnel. However, the combination of the mountainous terrain and extreme weather conditions caused Michetti\u2019s personnel to conclude that the project was possible but not for the prices quoted in Miehetti\u2019s bid. Michetti asserted that its vice-presi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>dent, Ralph McKinstry, met with GPPC, and the parties modified the $1.10 per foot contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\">NWP argued that no modification took place. NWP conceded that Michetti was entitled to recover on its lien claim for the amount due under the original contract of $1.10 per foot, but contended that Michetti was not to recover extra compensation beyond the original contract price because of the alleged late start and weather conditions. Following a jury trial on the Utah bond claims, the jury returned a verdict for Michetti for $1.10 per foot, but did not award additional costs because the jury found that the contract was not modified. Thus, the jury found the unpaid amount on the original contract between Michetti and GPPC to be $284,288.85. The district court held that the evidence was clearly insufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict and ordered a new trial as to the Utah bond claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">In <em>Ore-Ida, Potato Products, Inc. v. Larsen, </em>83 Idaho 290, 296, 362 P.2d 384, 387 (1961), this Court stated that the general rule in Idaho is that \u201cparties to an unperformed contract may, by mutual consent, modify [the contract] by altering, excising or adding provisions, and such modification may be by parol agreement though the contract is in writing.\u201d The Court further observed that \u201cthe party asserting the parol modification of the written contact ... has the burden of proving the modification by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 293-94, 362 P.2d at 385. One party to a written contract cannot alter the terms of the contract,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFd\">without the assent of the other [party] and that the minds of the parties must meet as to any proposed modification. The fact of agreement may be implied from a course of conduct in accordance with its existence and assent may be implied from the acts of one party in accordance with the terms of a change proposed by the other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b817-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 296, 362 P.2d at 385.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">Furthermore, general principles of contract law require that a contract modification, like the formation of any contract, must be supported by valid consideration. <em>Brand S Corp. v. King, </em>102 Idaho 731, 733, 639 P.2d 429, 431 (1981). It is well established \u201cthat a promise to do, or the doing of, what one is already bound by contract to do, is not valid consideration.\u201d <em>Dashnea v. Panhandle Lumber Co., Ltd, </em>57 Idaho 232, 238, 64 P.2d 390, 393 (1937) <em>(citing </em>1 Williston on Contracts, \u00a7\u00a7 130, 130A). Conversely, the doing by one of the parties of something that he is not legally bound to do constitutes consideration for the other\u2019s promise to modify the terms of the original agreement. <em>Dashnea, </em>57 Idaho at 238, 64 P.2d at 393.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">Relying on the above stated principles, the district court held that clear and convincing evidence established that the original contract between Michetti and GPPC had been modified. The evidence included testimony that GPPC understood that the pipe stringing could not be accomplished as originally bid. The district court found that GPPC was aware of the treachei\u2019ous weather conditions and knew the job would cost more than originally bid. Moreover, once Michetti informed GPPC that the job could not be done as bid for the original price, GPPC did not commence or threaten to commence any action legal or otherwise. The district court found that, instead, GPPC\u2019s president stated that the job could not be put off because NWP wanted the job done by April 1, and GPPC was not willing let NWP down. GPPC\u2019s president assured Michetti that GPPC would take care of the extra costs beyond the original $1.10 per foot bid. In fact, when Michetti prepared a job cost summary disclosing that Michetti lost a total of $187,524.04, GPPC tendered a cheek to Michetti for that amount. The check was later voided. Lastly, on projects completed by Michetti in the past, GPPC always modified the original agreements and paid any excess expenses incurred by Michetti. Based on this evidence, the district court held that the parties had modified the contract to include amounts in excess of the original $1.10 per foot bid.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-10\">Additionally, the district court concluded that the amount GPPC would eventually pay was sufficiently definite for the court to determine the acts to be performed by Michetti and GPPC under the modified contract. In consideration of Michetti staying on the job <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>and completing the pipe stringing before April 1, GPPC would pay the additional costs incurred. Thus, the district court concluded that Miehetti was entitled to the additional costs incurred of $187,524.04. Moreover, because the additional costs consumed Michetti\u2019s anticipated profit amount of $50,000, the district court held that Miehetti was also entitled to the lost profit amount of $50,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">We conclude that the district court\u2019s order determining that the original contract between Miehetti and GPPC was modified is supported by substantial competent evidence. Moreover, the amount of Michetti\u2019s charges were reasonable, and we affirm the district court\u2019s award of additional costs, plus Michetti\u2019s original bid and profit.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">6.WHETHER THE DISTRICT COURT ERRED IN CALCULATING HARTFORD\u2019S LIEN CLAIM.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">Hartford supplied worker\u2019s compensation insurance to GPPC for the Spread 2 project. The district court determined that the value of the insurance provided by Hartford on the Spread 2 project amounted to $987,118. The district court credited $643,932.43 in premiums paid by GPPC, leaving an unpaid amount of $343,185.57. Thus, the district court held that it would be unjust for NWP to retain the benefit of the insurance provided by Hartford and awarded Hartford $332,-478.18. Additionally, the jury credited the premiums paid by GPPC on the bond statute claims and awarded Hartford $378,220. However, the district court did not credit the premiums paid by GPPC on Hartford\u2019s lien claims and held that for purposes of Hartford\u2019s lien claim, the unpaid amount of its contract with GPPC on the Spread 2 project amounted to $987,118. However, the district court determined that the open account defense barred Hartford\u2019s lien claim and awarded nothing to Hartford on its lien claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">On appeal, NWP submits that if this Court reinstates Hartford\u2019s lien claim, then the district court erred in calculating the amount of Hartford\u2019s claim for worker\u2019s compensation premiums. NWP contends that Hartford did not credit NWP for $644,483 in premiums paid on NWP\u2019s project, and the district court erred in holding that Hartford was not required to credit those portions of its claim that had already been paid. We conclude that this issue need not be resolved because the open account defense barred Hartford\u2019s lien claims. <em>See infra </em>Part IV(B)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-10\">7. WHETHER THE DISTRICT COURT IMPROPERLY FOUND IN FAVOR OF GPE ON ITS LIEN AND UNJUST ENRICHMENT CLAIMS.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-11\">NWP asserts as a separate issue that the district court erred in finding for GPE on its mechanic\u2019s lien and unjust enrichment claims, contending that the open account defense bars GPE\u2019s lien claims, that GPE was paid by GPPC for the use of its rental equipment on the Spread 2 project, and that the district court erred in not allowing an offset to NWP for the amount that GPE owed to GPPC. Because we have held that GPE was entitled neither to a lien for the rental of its equipment nor to any recovery on the theory of unjust enrichment, we need not address the questions separately raised by NWP as possible defenses in regard to these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-12\">8. WHETHER THE DISTRICT COURT ERRED IN REFUSING TO GIVE PRECLUSIVE EFFECT TO THE JURY\u2019S VERDICT.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-13\">NWP asserts that the district court erred in making findings inconsistent with the jury\u2019s verdict as to the following claimants: Miehetti, GPE, PTA, V-l Oil, Atlas, Beard Oil, Hartford and Rocky Mountain. NWP contends that the bond statute claims and lien claims involved the same issues; therefore, the district court should have given preclusive effect to the jury\u2019s findings. Additionally, NWP asserts that the district court erred in awarding to GPE, Miehetti and PTA more than the reasonable value of the unjust enrichment claims because the jury\u2019s factual findings placed a cap on damages for the unjust enrichment claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>Again, because we have set aside the judgments on the Utah bond statute claims and all of the lien foreclosures except for the Michetti claim, we need not address these issues other than to state that we find no error with regard to the district court\u2019s refusal to give preclusive effect to the jury\u2019s findings concerning the Michetti lien. The jury\u2019s verdict was purely advisory with respect to the Michetti claim of lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\">9. WHETHER THE DISTRICT COURT ERRED IN REFUSING TO ALLOW AND CONSIDER NWP\u2019S EQUITABLE DEFENSES.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">NWP asserts that the district court erred in refusing to allow NWP to present equitable defenses by way of evidence that several of the claimants did not follow reasonable business practices that could have mitigated their damages. It appears from NWP\u2019s argument that these defenses relate to the lien claims, Utah bond claims and claims for unjust enrichment which we have held are not proper bases for relief. Accordingly, we need not reach the merits of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">10. WHETHER THE DISTRICT COURT ERRED IN AWARDING ATTORNEY FEES, COSTS AND PREJUDGMENT INTEREST AGAINST NWP.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">In Idaho, we adhere to the \u201cAmerican rule\u201d which requires the parties to bear their own attorney fees absent statutory authorization or a contractual right. <em>Idaho Dep\u2019t of Law Enforcement v. Kluss, </em>125 Idaho 682, 684, 873 P.2d 1336, 1338 (1994); <em>see also </em>I.R.C.P. 54(e)(1). Here, the district court awarded attorney fees to the prevailing parties on their lien claims pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 45-513, to the prevailing parties on their Utah bond claims pursuant to Utah Code \u00a7 14-2-2(3), and to the prevailing parties on their unjust enrichment claims pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3). NWP argues that the district court erred in making these awards and in also awarding prejudgment interest to the claimants.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">With the exception of Michetti\u2019s lien claim, we agree with NWP. The awards of fees, costs and prejudgment interest to each of the plaintiffs except Michetti must be vacated on the ground that none of the parties, except Michetti, was entitled to such awards under the statutes cited. It is well settled that in lien foreclosure actions, the recovery of attorney fees is incidental to the foreclosure. \u201cWhere the lien fails, no fee can be allowed.\u201d <em>Boone v. P &amp; B Logging Co., Inc., </em>88 Idaho 111, 117, 397 P.2d 31, 34 (1964). Thus, with the exception of Michetti, none of the plaintiffs who claimed liens has been successful in this action. Furthermore, we have held that neither the Utah bond statute nor the theory of unjust enrichment provide relief to any of the plaintiffs. Thus there can be no award under Utah Code \u00a7 14-2-2(3), and, under I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3), one must be a prevailing party in order to receive an award of fees. The district court\u2019s awards to the plaintiffs under these statutes are not appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-10\">Accordingly, with the exception of Michetti, all awards of attorney fees, costs and prejudgment interest to the plaintiffs are vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-11\">\n<em>B</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b819-12\">\n<em>SUBCONTRACTORS\u2019 CROSS-APPEAL ISSUES</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b819-13\">1. WHETHER THE DISTRICT COURT ERRED IN REFUSING TO ALLOW THE CLAIMS FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-14\">During various stages of the litigation in this case, the plaintiffs moved to add a claim for punitive damages. The district court denied the motions on the basis that the motions were untimely. On appeal, Racine Subcontractors, B.D. Holt, and K &amp; 0 argue that the district court abused its discretion in not allowing the punitive damage claims. Because we hold that the subcontractors \u2014 except for Michetti \u2014 did not have viable underlying claims of lien, claims for recovery on the Utah bond statute or upon the theory of unjust enrichment, the district court\u2019s conclusion with respect to the timeliness of the motions to add punitive damage claims need not be addressed. As to Michettis\u2019 claim, we uphold the district court\u2019s conclusion. I.C. \u00a7 6-1604(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>2. WHETHER THE DISTRICT COURT ERRED IN DENYING CRC-EVANS\u2019 AND COURTESY FORD\u2019S CLAIMS FOR \u201cREPAIR PARTS.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">CRC-Evans and Courtesy Ford argue that the district court erred in denying their individual claims for repair parts. As with the other plaintiff-subcontractors, these claims were asserted as claims of liens, as claims under the Utah bond statute or as allegations under the theory of unjust enrichment.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">For the reasons stated in Part IV(C)(1), we uphold the district court\u2019s decision that suppliers of repair parts are not entitled to claim liens under I.C. \u00a7 45-501. We have already determined the inapplicability of the Utah bond statute and the unavailability of unjust enrichment as a form of recovery to the plaintiffs in this case. Accordingly we affirm the district court\u2019s decision to deny CRC-Evans\u2019 and Courtesy Ford\u2019s claims of lien, Utah bond and unjust enrichment claims without further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">3. WHETHER THE DISTRICT COURT ERRED IN DETERMINING THAT THE \u201cOPEN ACCOUNT\u201d DEFENSE BARRED VALLEY OFFICE SYSTEMS AND HARTFORD\u2019S LIEN THEORY CLAIMS.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-10\">Valley Office Systems and Hartford Insurance assert that the district court erred in denying their claims because of NWP\u2019s open account defense. The district court held that the open account defense raised by NWP barred the claims of Valley Office and Hartford both for foreclosure of their claims of lien and for recovery under the Utah bond statute. Because we have held the Utah bond statute inapplicable to this case, we will discuss this issue only with respect to the claims of lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-11\">Valley Office rented equipment to GPPC. The district court held that Valley Office never relied, to any extent, on NWP or its land for the rental payment but relied exclusively on GPPC for payments. On appeal, Valley Office contends that the district court disregarded uncontroverted testimony that Valley Office first relied on GPPC for payment, but also relied on NWP for payment if GPPC did not pay. We need not decide whether the district court erred in applying the open account defense to Valley Office\u2019s claim of lien. The lien fails because Valley Office sought recovery, as a subcontractor, for equipment rented to the contractor, GPPC. <em>See </em>Part IV(A)(l)(a), <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b820-13\">Hartford submits that it is entitled to the full value of its lien claim because the open account defense does not apply to worker\u2019s compensation claims. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-14\">In <em>Layrite Products Co. v. Lux, </em>91 Idaho 110, 416 P.2d 501 (1966), this Court recognized the \u201copen account\u201d defense to be applicable: in situations when a person furnishing material relies exclusively on the general credit of the purchaser, and does not look to the land, structure or building as additional security for the materials sold on credit, then the supplier is not entitled to a lien. <em>Id. </em>at 115, 416 P.2d at 506. Idaho\u2019s lien statutes, specifically I.C. \u00a7 45-501, allow a lien for materials furnished to be used in a construction project, but do not allow a lien for furnishing material for \u201cgeneral or unknown purposes, or an ordinary sale in the usual course of trade, or on a general open account, or a sale without reference as to what shall be done with the materials sold.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 113, 416 P.2d at 504. Accordingly, the Court summarized the open account doctrine by stating that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-15\">it is essential that the materials shall have been sold or furnished for the specific purpose of being used in the particular building on which the lien is claimed. Additionally, the materials must have been furnished on the credit of the building, and not merely on the general and personal credit of the owner, contractor or some other person. Where materials are furnished for use in a particular building, the fact that the materialman looks first or primarily to the contractor for payment and only subsequently to the building for security, would not itself defeat the lien.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqr\"><em>Id. </em>at 113-14, 416 P.2d at 504-05.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-16\">As to Hartford\u2019s claims, we conclude that sufficient evidence supports the district court\u2019s decision. We also affirm the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>court\u2019s decision to grant NWP\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict pursuant to I.R.C.P. 50(b). When determining whether a judgment notwithstanding the verdict should have been granted, we apply the same standard as the trial court, which is to determine whether no substantial competent evidence supports the jury verdict. <em>Quick v. Crane, </em>111 Idaho at 764, 727 P.2d at 1192; <em>Brand S Corp. v. King, </em>102 Idaho 731, 639 P.2d 429. Here, the district court concluded that Hartford\u2019s recovery on its claim of lien was barred by the open account defense because the evidence demonstrated that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-4\">[n]o substantial evidence was presented that Hartford, in providing worker\u2019s compensation insurance to the [Spread 2 project], relied to any extent on [NWP] or its land for payment. The evidence presented at trial overwhelmingly demonstrated that Hartford did not know that GPPC was performing work in Idaho until well after the commencement of that work. GPPC\u2019s policy with Hartford was not endorsed to include Idaho as a covered state on that policy. Hartford attributed none of GPPC\u2019s premium payments, made during the course of [NWP\u2019s] job, to GPPC\u2019s work in Idaho.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">Furthermore, Hartford\u2019s argument that the open account defense does not apply to claims under I.C. \u00a7 45-517, which is a specific statute for insurance claims, is without merit. We conclude that the open account defense applies to those claimants attempting to recover under Idaho\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien statutes, even those parties who assert a mechanic\u2019s lien in the worker\u2019s compensation context. Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision that the open account defense barred Hartford\u2019s lien claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">4. WHETHER B.D. HOLT\u2019S CLAIM OF A MECHANIC\u2019S LIEN WAS UNTIMELY RECORDED.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">B.D. Holt asserts that the district court erred in dismissing its mechanic\u2019s lien claim. B.D. Holt bought a Caterpillar D8N tractor in 1991 and began leasing it to GPPC in July of 1992 to use on the Spread 2 project. However, due to GPPC\u2019s failure to make lease payments, the parties agreed in March of 1993 for GPPC to buy the equipment. B.D. Holt eventually recorded its lien on June 28, 1993. The district court denied B.D. Holt\u2019s lien claim pursuant to Idaho Code \u00a7 45-507 because it was recorded more than sixty days after B.D. Holt provided the tractor, as equipment, to be used on the Spread 2 project. B.D. Holt contends the district court was in error, because the lien was recorded within sixty days after GPPC stopped using the tractor when GPPC shut down the project in May, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-10\">We conclude that we need not decide whether the district court erred in rejecting B.D. Holt\u2019s claim of lien for untimeliness. The claim clearly arose either from a rental arrangement, or as a purchase agreement relating to equipment supplied to GPPC by B.D. Holt. B.D. Holt\u2019s status as a creditor of GPPC under either arrangement does not entitle it to the benefit of the mechanic\u2019s and materialman\u2019s lien laws for equipment that was not incorporated into, consumed or destroyed by the project. <em>See </em>Part IV(A)(1) <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b821-11\">\n<em>C</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b821-12\">\n<em>K &amp; O\u2019S SUMMARY JUDGMENT ISSUES</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b821-13\">1. WHETHER THE DISTRICT COURT ERRED IN GRANTING SUMMARY JUDGMENT AS TO K &amp; O\u2019S CLAIMS.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-14\">K &amp; 0 appeals from the district court\u2019s summary judgment dismissing K &amp; O\u2019s claims. NWP moved for summary judgment to dismiss K &amp; O\u2019s claims because Idaho\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien statutes do not apply to suppliers of \u201crepair parts.\u201d The district court agreed, granted summary judgment as to K &amp; O\u2019s lien claims, and then subsequently dismissed, as a matter of law, K &amp; O\u2019s unjust enrichment and Utah bond statute claims. Thus, most of the issues raised are the same as discussed above, however, the standard of review for all of K &amp; O\u2019s claims are based on summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-15\">Summary judgment must be granted when \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d I.R.C.P. 56(c); <em>Friel v. Boise City Housing Authority, </em>126 Idaho 484, 485, 887 P.2d 29, 30 (1994). This Court\u2019s review of a district court\u2019s decision on a motion for summary judgment is the same as that required of the district court when originally ruling on the motion. <em>East Lizard Butte Water Corp. v. Howell, </em>122 Idaho 679, 681, 837 P.2d 805, 807 (1992). As when the judgment is initially considered by the district court, this Court on review liberally construes the record in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion, drawing all reasonable inferences and conclusions in that party\u2019s favor. <em>Friel, </em>126 Idaho at 485, 887 P.2d at 30 <em>(citing Farm Credit Bank of Spokane v. Stevenson, </em>125 Idaho 270, 272, 869 P.2d 1365, 1367 (1994); <em>Harris v. Dep\u2019t of Health and Welfare, </em>123 Idaho 295, 298, 847 P.2d 1156, 1159 (1992)). If a reasonable person could reach different conclusions or draw conflicting inferences from the evidence, a motion for summary judgment must be denied. <em>Stevenson, </em>125 Idaho at 272, 869 P.2d at 1367. However, if the evidence reveals no disputed issues of material fact, what remains is a question of law, over which this Court exercises free review. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">a. Repair Parts are Not Covered Under Idaho\u2019s Mechanic\u2019s Lien Statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">K &amp; O asserts that the district court\u2019s holding that \u201cthe parts and repairs supplied by K &amp; O contributed, primarily, to the repair of the equipment and not to the construction of Northwest\u2019s pipeline\u201d was erroneous. K &amp; O contends that the repair parts which allowed two link-belt machines to keep working on the Spread 2 project benefited NWP, and whether the repair parts were used and consumed on the NWP job is debatable.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">As previously stated, Idaho Code \u00a7 45-501 applies to persons performing labor upon or furnishing materials to be used in the construction, alteration, or repair of a building or structure. Moreover, although this Court has approved a lien for \u201ctools and appliances\u201d in <em>Naylor, supra, </em>the claimant must still prove that the tools and appliances were used and consumed in the construction project. <em>Ninneman v. City of Lewiston, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">Here, K &amp; O supplied repair parts to maintain equipment, rented by GPPC, and used to construct NWP\u2019s Spread 2 project. The specific parts supplied by K &amp; O included: hex screws and nuts, rod end, pawl rod and screw, back up rings, O-rings, washers, clutch shoes, lining kits, rivets, ball bearings, oil seals, bushing, dowel, piston ring, gaskets, shims, snap ring, roller chain, lock nut, spacers, a service manual, sprockets, bevel gear and a shaft. However, K &amp; O\u2019s parts never became a part of the pipeline and were not used, consumed or destroyed in the course of the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-9\">Like leased equipment used on the Spread 2 project which would not be totally consumed, parts supplied to repair leased equipment would only enhance and add to the useful life of the leased equipment. <em>Accord Johnson v. Starret, </em>127 Minn. 138, 149 N.W. 6, 8 (1914) (holding that parts and repairs for excavating machinery were not lienable because they were not consumed within the improvement, but merely became part of the contractor\u2019s personal property). The parts and repairs were not actually used and consumed in the construction of the Spread 2 project. Instead, the equipment\u2019s need for parts and repairs was based, at least in part, on the equipment\u2019s use prior to its service on the Spread 2 project. Additionally, the parts and repairs would certainly add to the equipment\u2019s future use. Thus, to allow K &amp; O a lien for parts and repairs to rental equipment used on the Spread 2 project would essentially force NWP to pay for repairs and parts that would benefit the owner of the equipment well beyond the equipment\u2019s use on the Spread 2 project. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision to grant NWP\u2019s motion for summary judgment as to K &amp; O\u2019s lien claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-10\">b. Repair parts are not covered under Utah\u2019s private bond statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-11\">K &amp; O asserts that the district court erred in concluding that repair parts are not covered by the Utah bond statute. Because we have concluded that the Utah bond statute provides no relief in this case, we affirm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>the district court\u2019s decision to grant NWP\u2019s motion for summary judgment and deny K &amp; O\u2019s bond claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\">c. Repair parts are not covered under unjust enrichment law.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">K &amp; O contends that genuine issues of material fact exist as to its unjust enrichment claim, which would preclude the district court from denying the claim by summary judgment. Because we conclude that the subcontractors cannot recover on the theory of unjust enrichment, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment to NWP on this issue, albeit on other grounds. <em>Anderson &amp; Nafziger v.

We conclude that the affidavit of Ronald E. Bush, setting forth NWP\u2019s costs and attorney fees covers all of the requirements of I.R.C.P. 54(d)(5).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision to award attorney fees and costs to NWP on K &amp; O\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b823-10\">For the above stated reasons, we set aside the judgment and decree regarding foreclosure of the mechanic\u2019s liens, the Utah bond claims and unjust enrichment claims, with the exception of the judgment <em>permitting </em>foreclosure of Michetti\u2019s claim of lien. We also vacate the awards of prejudgment interest, attorney fees and costs entered in favor of the plaintiffs, except for the awards of those items to Michetti on its claim of lien foreclosure.

The bond shall become binding upon the award of the contract to the contractor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-18\">(3)The payment bond shall be with a surety or sureties satisfactory to the owner for the protection of all persons supplying labor, services, equipment, or material in the prosecution of the work provided for in the contract in a sum equal to the contract price.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b813-19\">.Utah Code \u00a7 14-2-2 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-20\">(1) Unless exempted under Section 14-2-1, an owner who fails to obtain a payment bond is liable to each person who performed labor or services or supplied equipment or materials under the contract for the reasonable value of the labor or service performed or the equipment or materials furnished up to but not exceeding the contract price.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-21\">(3) In an action for failure to obtain a bond, the court may award reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees to the prevailing party. These shall be taxed as costs in the action.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b814-6\">. Idaho Code \u00a7 29-102 provides:</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b815-7\">. The district court distinguished the present case from <em>Dale's Service </em>on the ground that the action in <em>Dale\u2019s Service </em>was based solely on quantum meruit. In addition, the court concluded that unjust enrichment was available to the plaintiffs under <em>Idaho Lumber, Inc. v. Buck, </em>109 Idaho 737, 710 P.2d 647 (Ct.App.1985). The <em>Buck </em>case is inapposite. It involved a claim of unjust enrichment brought against a landlord by the contractor who had contracted with the tenant to remodel the demised premises. The case did not address a claim for unjust enrichment brought by a subcontractor who had not been paid by its contractor, as occurred in <em>Dale\u2019s Service.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b818-8\">. As to whether the district court erred in determining that the jury\u2019s verdict was only advisory, we affirm the district court. <em>See infra </em>Part IV(A)(8) of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b823-11\">. Bush\u2019s affidavit was filed with the district court but was not included initially in the record on appeal. However, NWP filed a motion to augment the record which was subsequently granted on September 9, 1997.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b823-18\">Justice SCHROEDER,</author>\n<p id=\"AXK\">CONCURS in part and DISSENTS in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-19\">I respectfully dissent from that portion of the opinion which determines that the district court erred in allowing claims based upon Utah\u2019s private bond statute. GPPC and NWP entered into the contract in Utah and specified that Utah law would apply. Each acted pursuant to the agreement. GPPC and NWP waived the bond requirement. Under these circumstances Utah\u2019s private bond statute should be applied, as determined by the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
