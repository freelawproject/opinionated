Section 12-120(3) requires a court to award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party in any \u201ccivil action to recover in ... any commercial transaction.\u201d Additionally, this Court must determine whether I.C. \u00a7 41-1839(4) bars the application of \u00a7 12-120 in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b631-11\">J.R. Simplot Co. (Simplot) hired Don Green (Green) to apply fertilizer to fields owned by Tuk and Ty Nedrow (the Ned-rows). Green agreed to indemnify Simplot for all claims arising from Green\u2019s misapplication of chemicals and fertilizers. To that end, Green purchased a $500,000 commercial liability insurance policy from Western. Western sent Simplot a certificate of insurance on that policy. Green misapplied the fertilizer, and the Nedrows sued Simplot for their resulting crop loss. When Simplot requested that Western defend the action, Western claimed that a special endorsement on the policy limited its liability in that action to $25,000, which Western then contributed toward settling the claim. To achieve final settlement with the Nedrows, Simplot contributed $103,000, and subsequently sued Western seeking reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-14\">Simplot filed its initial complaint on February 6, 1996. Western answered, and both parties moved for summary judgment. Because Simplot was not the named insured under the policy, some doubt arose as to Simplot\u2019s standing to sue. Thus, on July 3, 1996, Simplot entered into an assignment agreement with Green whereby Simplot agreed to release Green from liability on the Nedrows\u2019 claim in exchange for an assignment of certain causes of action Green might have against Western and Cecil Armstrong, Green\u2019s insurance agent. Western stipulated to, and the district court granted, Simplot\u2019s request to amend its complaint, which Simplot filed on July 26, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-15\">Again, all parties filed motions for summary judgment. After a hearing on March 12, 1997, the trial court granted Western\u2019s motion and dismissed Simplot\u2019s claim without prejudice. The court found that because Green was never personally sued or otherwise found liable for the Nedrows claim, Green had no claim to assign Simplot. It was the district court\u2019s opinion that Green\u2019s insurance contract'required, as a predicate to Western\u2019s potential liability, that Green first be sued and that Green tender that suit to Western requesting its defense. Instead Green settled with Simplot without Western\u2019s consent. Consequently, the trial court found that Green did not have a claim to assign to Simplot. Western filed a motion for costs and attorney fees, promptly objected to by Simplot. The trial court awarded Western attorney fees based upon the provisions of I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3). In so ruling, the district court relied on <em>Continental Casualty Co. v. Brady, </em>127 Idaho 830, 907 P.2d 807 (1995) where this Court held that I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3) applied in an insurer\u2019s action for declaratory judgment to determine its liability under a policy. <em>Id. </em>Additionally, the district court reasoned that the underlying dispute between Simplot and Western was a web of commercial transactions beginning with the initial indemnification agreement between Simplot and Green. The trial court found this web of transactions sufficient to mandate the award of attorney fees under \u00a7 12-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>120(3). The district court further reasoned that, although I.C. \u00a7 41-1839(4) explicitly states that \u00a7 12-120 shall not apply to actions between insureds and insurers involving disputes arising under any policy, that provision took affect after Simplot filed its initial complaint and did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">Simplot appeals arguing that the trial court erred in finding a commercial transaction between Simplot and Western sufficient to support an award of attorney fees under \u00a7 12-120(3). Moreover, Simplot asserts that the trial court erred in ruling that \u00a7 41-1839(4) did not bar the application of \u00a7 12-120. Western asks this Court to affirm the trial court\u2019s award of attorney fees and to award attorney fees on appeal under \u00a7 12-120(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">Under I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3), a court must award the prevailing party in a dispute over a commercial transaction reasonable attorney fees. Section 41-1839(4) bars the application of \u00a7 12-120 in disputes between insurers and insureds. The determination of which party prevails on what issues and to what extent is within the discretion of the trial court. <em>Zimmerman v. Volkswagen of America, Inc., </em>128 Idaho 851, 857, 920 P.2d 67, 73 (1996). Simplot and Western do not dispute the district court\u2019s determination of who prevailed nor the dollar amount awarded. Simplot\u2019s claim centers around whether the district court properly awarded attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3) in the first instance and whether \u00a7 41-1839(4) prevents the application of \u00a7 12-120. Determining the meaning of a statute and its application is a matter of law over which this Court exercises free review. <em>Mitchell v. Bingham Memorial Hospital, </em>130 Idaho 420, 422, 942 P.2d 544, 546 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AhP\">A. Attorney Fees Below</p>\n<p id=\"b632-10\">Idaho Code \u00a7 12-120(3) mandates the award of attorney fees to the prevailing party in a \u201ccivil action to recover ... in any commercial transaction.\u201d However, I.C. \u00a7 41-1839(4) expressly provides that \u00a7 12-120 shall not apply in any action between an insured and the insurer involving a \u201cdispute arising under any policy of insurance.\u201d Western simply claims that because Simplot is not the named insured on the policy in question, \u00a7 41-1839 has no application to the present case. Simplot argues that based upon its amended complaint, it was asserting the rights of Green, an insured. Therefore, I.C. \u00a7 41-1839(4) applies, barring the operation of I.C. \u00a7 12-120. We agree, and, therefore, need not address whether the trial court had a proper basis for finding a commercial transaction and awarding attorney fees under 12-120(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-12\">Simplot argues that I.C. \u00a7 41-1839(4) became effective July 1, 1996. Because Simplot filed its amended complaint on July 26, 1996, Simplot maintains that the statute barred the application of \u00a7 12-120. However, the trial court ruled that Simplot\u2019s action relates back to its initial complaint, filed February 6, 1996, and I.C. \u00a7 41-1839(4) does not apply. While we agree with the trial court\u2019s determination that the operative date is the original date of filing this action, the parties overlooked the date on which the amendment went into effect. When amending I.C. \u00a7 41-1839 by adding subsection four, the Idaho Legislature declared an emergency and expressly stated that the amendment was retroactive applying to all cases pending at the time of its \u201cpassage and approval.\u201d 1996 Idaho Sess. Laws 1307, 1308, 1309; <em>see also Union Warehouse and Supply v. Illinois R.B. Jones, Inc., </em>128 Idaho 660, 669, 917 P.2d 1300, 1309 (1996) (noting the retroactive effect of the 1996 amendment). The amendment was approved March 20, 1996, while this litigation was pending. Consequently, \u00a7 41-1839(4) applies if Simplot can be characterized as an insured in its action against Western.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-13\">In ruling on the parties\u2019 motions for summary judgment based on the amended complaint, the district court granted Western\u2019s motion because Green had never been found liable for the Nedrows\u2019 loss. The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>court reasoned that Western could only become liable on the policy once Green is found liable. Western\u2019s obligation to defend begins only after Green is sued and Green was never personally sued nor found liable. Consequently, Green had no claim against Western which Simplot could assert, so the district court granted Western\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">Nonetheless, Simplot still acquired at least the ability to assert Green\u2019s rights as the insured based on the assignment and, therefore, should be treated as the insured under the provisions of I.C. \u00a7 41-1839(4). When an insured assigns rights to recover proceeds under an insurance policy, the assignee, when attempting to recover from the insurer, should be in the same position as the named insured when it comes to awarding attorney fees. Further, an assignment does not fail merely because the rights assigned are not ripe at the time of assignment. Our Court of Appeals has correctly stated that \u201c[A] right to future performance of an obligation may be assigned.... An assignment may properly relate to a conditional right which is adequately identified.\u201d <em>Bonanza Motors, Inc. v. Webb, </em>104 Idaho 234, 236, 657 P.2d 1102, 1104 (Ct.App.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Consequently, Green effectively assigned to Simplot his rights as an insured to collect the money due under the policy and to sue Western for breach despite whether such claims existed at the time of the assignment. Had Green brought the action against Western himself, I.C. \u00a7 41-1839(4) would have barred the application of I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3) regardless of whether Green had a valid claim at the time. Based on the assignment, Simplot\u2019s action against Western should lead to the same result. Therefore, the litigation underlying this appeal falls under the ambit of I.C. \u00a7 41-1839(4). Western is an insurer and Simplot, through the assignment, is an insured. The dispute arose under Green\u2019s insurance policy. Consequently, the trial court erred in awarding attorney fees to Western under I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">B. Attorney Fees on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">Western requests this Court to award attorney fees for this appeal pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3). For the reasons just indicated, such an award would be impermissible, even if Western were determined to be the prevailing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-12\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b633-13\">For the reasons stated above, the trial court\u2019s grant of Western\u2019s request for attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3) is reversed. Costs are awarded to Simplot pursuant to I.A.R. 40.</p>\n<judges id=\"b633-14\">Justices SILAK, SCHROEDER, WALTERS and Justice Pro Tem JOHNSON; concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
