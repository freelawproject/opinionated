Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">On July 19, 1996, at approximately 2:30 a.m., Donald Karl Holton (Holton) was stopped by Officer Ware of the Boise City Police Department on suspicion that Holton was driving while intoxicated. Officer Bones, a DUI task force specialist for the Boise City Police Department, was called to assist Officer Ware in conducting field sobriety tests. Holton exited his car when Officer Bones arrived, pursuant to Officer Ware\u2019s direction, so that Officer Bones could conduct the tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">In speaking with Holton, Officer Bones detected the odor of an alcoholic beverage and noticed that Holton\u2019s eyes were glazed and bloodshot. Officer Bones then conducted a horizontal gaze nystagmus test and noticed that Holton\u2019s pupils reacted slowly to the light from Officer Bones\u2019 flashlight and \u201cwere dilated above what would be normal.\u201d Holton\u2019s eyes also demonstrated a lack of convergence. Officer Bones determined that these responses were an indication that Holton was under the influence of a drug other than alcohol. In conformity with standard procedure, Officer Bones then asked Holton to open his mouth in order to look for signs of drug ingestion, such as discoloration of the tongue, debris, burns or boils on the gums or top of mouth.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">Holton did not open his mouth as requested, but started chewing. When Officer Bones asked Holton what was in his mouth, Holton indicated that it was gum. Holton refused to comply with further requests to spit the object out. Instead, he started chewing more vigorously. At that point, Officer Bones saw the corner of something that looked like a piece of plastic in Holton\u2019s mouth. Again, Holton refused to comply with requests to spit the object out. Officer Ware then grabbed Holton\u2019s arm, ordering him to spit the object out. A struggle ensued between both officers and Holton, during which the officers informed Holton that he was under arrest and repeatedly ordered him to spit out the object. After trying to swallow the object and gagging, Holton spit out a plastic bag. A subsequent test on the contents revealed that the bag contained methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-13\">Holton was charged on July 19, 1996 with possession of a controlled substance, assault and battery on a police officer, obstructing and resisting an officer, possession of drug paraphernalia, and possession of an open container of alcohol in a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-14\">On September 4, 1996, Holton filed a motion to suppress evidence. Holton argued that the warrantless search of his mouth conducted by the officers violated his rights under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Art. I, \u00a7 17 of the Idaho Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-15\">On February 13, 1997, after a hearing on the motion, the district court issued its oral findings and decision. It found that Officer Ware was justified in making the traffic stop and that he had the authority to ask the defendant to step out of the car to undergo field sobriety tests. Holton does not contest this finding. In addition, the district court found that there was sufficient evidence to raise a reasonable suspicion that Holton may have been drinking and may have been under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The district court also found that Officers Ware and Bones \u201chad reasonable and articulable suspicion to take this case a step further than just issuing a ticket.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-16\">In denying the motion, the district court held that police may conduct a warrantless search of the defendant\u2019s mouth where police have a reasonable and articulable belief that the defendant is in the process of chewing and swallowing evidence. It held that since this was a reasonable DUI investigation, there was nothing inappropriate or unconstitutional with asking the defendant to open <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>his mouth. The court likened that request to asking a person to do a heel-to-toe test or asking the person how many drinks he has had. It found that the officers had a reasonable, articulable belief and suspicion that Holton was in the process of chewing and swallowing evidence. The court noted that since these events all occurred \u201cright in front of\u2019 the officers and the plastic bag was \u201cin plain sight,\u201d there was no violation of a constitutional right \u201cunder the reasonable exigencies of the situation.\u201d The district court further stated that the search was reasonably justified by the circumstances because the police used reasonable means to extract the object for the purposes of \u201cpreserving the evidence\u201d and preventing a \u201cpossible overdose situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">B. Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">On March 7, 1997, the district court entered its order denying the motion to suppress. Subsequently, the State and Holton entered into a plea agreement, pursuant to Idaho Criminal Rule 11(a)(2). Under the agreement, the police dropped the assault and battery charge, and Holton entered a conditional guilty plea to. the remaining charges, reserving the right to appeal the order denying the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">On April 24, 1997, the district court entered its Judgment of Conviction and Commitment on the drug possession charge, sentencing the defendant to a fixed term of one year and four years indeterminate, for an aggregate of five years, and the court retained jurisdiction for one hundred and eighty days. Also on April 24, 1997, the district court entered its Judgment on Plea of Guilty (Misdemeanor) and Commitment on the remaining charges, sentencing the defendant on each count to one hundred and eighty days concurrent with the prior sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">The defendant filed a notice of appeal on April 30, 1997 and an amended notice of appeal on July 21,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-12\">ISSUE ON APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b551-13\">Did the district court commit error in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b551-14\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-15\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b551-16\">When reviewing a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress, this Court will overturn factual findings made by the trial court only if they are clearly erroneous. <em>See State v. Julian, </em>129 Idaho 133, 135, 922 P.2d 1059, 1061 (1996). However, the Court may freely review the trial court\u2019s application of constitutional standards to the facts found by the trial court. <em>See id.; State v. Bush, </em>131 Idaho 22, 951 P.2d 1249 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-17\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-18\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b551-19\">A. The District Court Did Not Err In Denying The Motion To Suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-20\">1. Because of exigent circumstances, the retrieval of evidence from the defendant\u2019s mouth violated neither the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution nor Article I, Section 17 of the Idaho Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-21\">\u201cThe Fourth Amendment\u2019s proper function is to constrain, not against all intrusions, but against intrusions which are not justified in the circumstances, or which are made in an improper manner.\u201d <em>Schmerber v. State of California, </em>384 U.S. 757, 768, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908 (1966). Like the Fourth Amendment, the purpose of Art. I, \u00a7 17 is to protect Idaho citizens\u2019 reasonable expectation of privacy against arbitrary governmental intrusion. <em>See State v. Thompson, </em>114 Idaho 746, 749, 760 P.2d 1162, 1165 (1988); <em>State v. Christensen, </em>131 Idaho 143, 146, 953 P.2d 583, 586 (1998).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cTo this end, warrantless searches are presumed to be un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>reasonable unless the search can be justified under one of the exceptions to the warrant requirement.\u201d <em>Id,.; State v. Reimer, </em>127 Idaho 214, 899 P.2d 427 (1995). Among the recognized exceptions to the warrant requirement is the exigent circumstances exception. <em>See State v. Johnson, </em>110 Idaho 516, 522, 716 P.2d 1288, 1294 (1986). The United States Supreme Court has found the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment inapplicable in cases where the \u201c\u2018exigencies of the situation\u2019 make the needs of law enforcement so compelling that the warrantless search is objectively reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Mincey v. Arizona, </em>437 U.S. 385, 394, 98 S.Ct. 2408, 57 L.Ed.2d 290 (1978). The United States Supreme Court has long recognized the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement. <em>See, e.g., Michigan v. Tyler, </em>436 U.S. 499, 509, 98 S.Ct. 1942, 56 L.Ed.2d 486 (1978); <em>Warden v. Hayden, </em>387 U.S. 294, 298-300, 87 S.Ct. 1642, 18 L.Ed.2d 782 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">The exigent circumstances exception \u201crefers broadly to fact patterns \u2018sufficient to excuse an officer from the requirement of obtaining a warrant to conduct a search for which he has probable cause.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Rusho, </em>110 Idaho 556, 559, 716 P.2d 1328, 1331 (1986) (quoting 1 W. RINGLE, SEARCHES &amp; SEIZURES, ARRESTS AND CONFESSIONS, p. 10-1 (1985)). For example, under the \u201cexigencies of the circumstances\u201d exception, an otherwise illegal search may be justified by the \u201cneed to protect or preserve life or avoid serious injury.\u201d <em>State v. Monroe, </em>101 Idaho 251, 254, 611 P.2d 1036, 1039 (1980), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>451 U.S. 1014, 101 S.Ct. 3001, 69 L.Ed.2d 385 (1981). Other circumstances that have been held to constitute an exigency include the removal or destruction of evidence. <em>See United States v. Young, </em>909 F.2d 442, 446 (11th Cir.1990); <em>State v. Kelly, </em>131 Idaho 774, 776, 963 P.2d 1211, 1213 (Ct.App. 1998); <em>State v. Wren, </em>115 Idaho 618, 624-25, 768 P.2d 1351, 1357-58 (CLApp.1989). Courts in our sister states have held that a warrantless search of a suspect\u2019s mouth is justified by exigent circumstances if the circumstances give the police reason to believe that the suspect is attempting to dispose of drugs. <em>See State v. Jacques, </em>225 Kan. 38, 587 P.2d 861 (1978); <em>State v. LeuAs, </em>115 Ariz. 530, 566 P.2d 678 (1977); <em>Hernandez v. State, </em>548 S.W.2d 904 (Tex.Crim.App.1977); <em>State v. Santos, </em>101 N.J.Super. 98, 243 A.2d 274 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">2. The circumstances gave the officers a reason to believe that Holton would destroy evidence before a warrant could be issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">In the instant case, there is no contention that the initial stop was unreasonable. Neither is there any contention that the officers had no authority to conduct a DUI investigation. The only legitimate point of contention is at what point the DUI investigation should have been terminated. While Holton argues that the officers violated constitutional provisions by asking him to open his mouth, that argument is misplaced. The officers made no attempt to enforce the request until they had probable cause to believe that Holton was destroying evidence. In light of the circumstances involved, the officers did not run afoul of any constitutional protection by making the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">In determining whether the officers reasonably feared imminent destruction of evidence, the appropriate inquiry is whether the facts, as they appeared at the precise moment in question, would lead a reasonable, experienced officer to believe that evidence might be destroyed before a warrant could be secured. <em>See Young, </em>909 F.2d at 446; <em>United States v. Rivera, </em>825 F.2d 152, 156 (7th Cir.), <em>cert denied, </em>484 U.S. 979, 108 S.Ct. 494, 98 L.Ed.2d 492 (1987). Additionally, the risk that Holton might asphyxiate on the plastic bag or suffer from a massive overdose of methamphetamine likewise contributed to the exigent circumstances. <em>See Monroe, </em>101 Idaho at 254, 611 P.2d at 1039. The district court correctly decided that the exigencies of this situation justified the officers\u2019 retrieval of the evidence. The district court\u2019s rationale is persuasive: \u201c[I]t takes no great feat of logic and imagination and reasonableness to assume that people don\u2019t ordinarily eat little plastic baggies and that ... anyone on the beat in this day and age knows that little baggies may well contain controlled sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>stances. That\u2019s how they\u2019re carried. That\u2019s how they\u2019re used. That\u2019s how they\u2019re ingested.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">Considering the odor of alcohol, the appearance of Holton\u2019s eyes, the results of the horizontal gaze nystagmus test, and the detection of the plastic bag in Holton\u2019s partially open mouth as he vigorously chewed, we hold that the officers had a reasonable basis to believe that Holton was attempting to destroy contraband and that the circumstances revealed a compelling need for immediate action.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The district court\u2019s finding that the officers reasonably believed that Holton may have been attempting to swallow the evidence is not clearly erroneous. The officers acted on a reasonable belief that Holton was attempting to destroy the evidence. We hold that the officers\u2019 conduct in this case did not violate any constitutional protections.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">We hold that the search which produced the plastic bag containing methamphetamine was justified by the exigent circumstances of the situation. The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b553-9\">Chief Justice TROUT, Justices SCHROEDER, WALTERS, and Justice Pro Tem JOHNSON, CONCUR.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b551-8\">.
