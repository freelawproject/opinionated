Smith (Smith) who was discharged from her employment. The Commission determined that the discharge was not for misconduct relating to her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-11\">BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b930-12\">Smith was employed with Zero Defects in its production department from September 20, 1994, to December 4,1995. Zero Defects manufactures electronics equipment. It has a \u201czero tolerance\u201d drug policy (the policy) that provides, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay58\">2. Being at work under the influence of alcohol or drugs may result in discharge for the first offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-13\">F. \u201cUNDER THE INFLUENCE\u201d means being unable to perform work in a safe, efficient and productive manner; being in a physical or mental condition which creates a risk to the safety and well-being of the individual, other employees, the public, or company property; <em>and/or having any detectable level of alcohol or illegal drugs in the body.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b930-15\">(Emphasis added). The policy requires employees to submit to urine tests on a random basis. Zero Defects\u2019 stated philosophy behind the policy is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-16\">Zero Defects believes that a healthy and productive work force that is free from the effects of illegal drugs and alcohol is important not only to Zero Defects, but also to our employees, our customers, and the local community. The abuse of drugs and alcohol creates a variety of workplace problems including increased injuries, absenteeism, theft, added cost to benefit plans, a decrease in employee morale, productivity and safety, and a decline in quality of products and services. This drug and alcohol testing policy and procedure is intended to meet our objective of safeguarding Zero Defects and its employees and customers, and the local community, and to encourage employees to seek professional assistance for substance abuse problems.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b930-17\">Smith admitted that she received, read and signed a copy of the policy, and that she understood that she could be terminated under the terms of the policy if she tested positive for drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-18\">Smith, along with several other employees, was selected at random for a urinalysis drug screening. Her urine sample tested positive for amphetamines in the amount of 2,799 ng., with a cutoff level of 500 ng. She was discharged as a result of her positive drug test.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-19\">Smith filed a claim for unemployment benefits. During a hearing to determine her eligibility, she claimed that her urine sample had been tampered with prior to the test. Initially Smith was determined to be eligible for unemployment benefits, but Zero Defects challenged that decision, and the Redetermination Examiner reversed the decision, concluding that there was no evidence that Smith\u2019s urine sample had been tampered with and that Zero Defects had \u201csatisfactorily established that [Smith] violated a known company policy, constituting misconduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b931-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>The Redetermination Examiner\u2019s decision was reversed by the Appeals Examiner. The Appeals Examiner determined that because Zero Defects did not provide information indicating how far above its cutoff level the amphetamines in Smith\u2019s urine sample was, Zero Defects had failed to meet its burden of proving that Smith violated its drug policy. The Examiner concluded that Zero Defects\u2019 determination that \u201cany\u201d level of drugs found in an employee\u2019s urine sample constituted misconduct was an \u201carbitrary\u201d determination and was not a valid basis to deny unemployment benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-4\">Zero Defects appealed to the Commission, requesting an opportunity to present additional evidence regarding Smith\u2019s test results. The Commission remanded the case to the Appeals Examiner to take the testimony of Dr. Paul Teynor, who supervised the testing of Smith\u2019s urine sample, and to accept additional test result documentation. Dr. Teynor is a medical doctor who routinely reviews workplace drug test results to determine whether a medical explanation might cause a positive test.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">Dr. Teynor testified to the procedures he employed and the opinion he had regarding the cause of Smith\u2019s positive test result. He stated that after testing the urine sample, he telephoned Smith to ask her if she was on any medication. She told him that she had been on several medications for a cold and back pain at the time of the testing. Dr. Teynor testified, however, that he believed these medications \u201cwould not have caused this positive test,\u201d and he expressed his opinion to Smith during their telephone conversation. According to Dr. Teynor, Smith then told him that she remembered taking her sister-in-law\u2019s prescription diet pill the weekend before the test. The diet pill would account for the amphetamines in her urine sample. Smith did not have a prescription for the diet pill. Dr. Teynor concluded that Smith had a positive test for amphetamines and reported his findings to Zero Defects. Prescription diet pills are controlled substances, and under section 37-2732(c) of the Idaho Code (I.C.), consumption by a person other than the one for whom the controlled substance is prescribed is illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">The Appeals Examiner concluded that: (1) Smith\u2019s \u201ctampering\u201d allegations were not supported by any competent evidence; (2) Zero Defects\u2019 policy to provide a drug-free work place was a reasonable policy and Smith was aware of this policy; and (3) Zero Defects met its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that Smith was discharged for misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">Smith appealed the decision to the Commission. The Commission adopted the findings of fact made by the Appeals Examiner, but reversed the Appeals Examiner\u2019s decision, concluding that, while Zero Defects\u2019 drug policy was reasonable in most respects, its \u201czero tolerance\u201d standard was inconsistent with its stated philosophy and, thus, the policy was unreasonable. Relying on <em>Marriott v. Shearer Lumber Products, </em>127 Idaho 620, 903 P.2d 1317 (1995), the Commission concluded that a reasonable interpretation of Zero Defects\u2019 policy required a showing of impairment. Because Zero Defects did not provide any evidence that Smith was actually \u201cimpaired\u201d on the job, the Commission concluded that Zero Defects had not sustained its burden of proof that Smith was discharged for misconduct in connection with her employment. Consequently, the Commission determined that Smith was eligible for unemployment benefits. Zero Defects filed a timely appeal from the Commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-9\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b931-10\">The proper standard of review was set forth in <em>Merriott:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-11\">This Court reviews decisions of the Industrial Commission for errors of law, and to determine whether the Commission\u2019s findings are supported by substantial and competent evidence. Whether an employee\u2019s behavior constitutes misconduct, rendering that employee ineligible for unemployment benefits under I.C. \u00a7 72-1366(e), is a question of fact. The Commission\u2019s conclusion in this regard will therefore be upheld if it is supported by substantial and competent evidence in the record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b932-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>127 Idaho at 621-22, 903 P.2d at 1318-19 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">THE COMMISSION ERRED IN DETERMINING SMITH WAS NOT DISCHARGED FOR MISCONDUCT IN HER EMPLOYMENT.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">Unemployment benefits are not available to an employee \u201cdischarged for misconduct in connection with his employment.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 72-1366(e) (1995).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Misconduct in connection with employment means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-8\">1. A willful, intentional disregard of the employer\u2019s interest;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-9\">2. A deliberate violation of the employer\u2019s reasonable rules; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-10\">3. A disregard of the standards of behavior which the employer has a right to expect of his or her employees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b932-11\"><em>Folks v. Moscow Sch. Dist. No. 281, </em>129 Idaho 833, 837, 933 P.2d 642, 646 (1997). The Commission must consider all three grounds to determine if there has been misconduct. <em>Dietz v. Minidoka County Highway Dist., </em>127 Idaho 246, 248, 899 P.2d 956, 958 (1995). \u201cThe burden of proving employment-related misconduct lies with the employer.\u201d <em>Folks, </em>129 Idaho at 837, 933 P.2d at 646.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-12\">\u201c[T]he test for misconduct in standard-of-behavior cases [the third ground] is as follows: (1) whether the employee\u2019s conduct fell below the standard of behavior expected by the employer; and (2) whether the employer\u2019s expectation was objectively reasonable in the particular case.\u201d <em>Merriott, </em>127 Idaho at 622, 903 P.2d at 1319 (quoting <em>Puckett v. Idaho Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>107 Idaho 1022, 1023-24, 695 P.2d 407, 408-09 (1985)). \u201cThe employee\u2019s disregard of a standard of behavior need not be subjectively intentional or deliberate.\u201d <em>Folks, </em>129 Idaho at 837, 933 P.2d at 646.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-13\">The first issue is whether Zero Defects\u2019 \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy is an objectively reasonable policy. The second issue is whether having \u201cany\u201d detectable level of illegal drugs in the body while being at work, which is an express violation of Zero Defects\u2019 policy, constitutes misconduct in connection with employment such that Smith should be denied unemployment compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-16\">A. Zero Defects\u2019 Policy Is Reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-17\">The Commission concluded that Zero Defects\u2019 policy was unreasonable because it defines the term \u201cunder the influence\u201d to mean <em>\u201cany </em>detectable level of alcohol or illegal drugs in the body,\u201d and that by defining \u201cunder the influence\u201d in this manner, the policy is inconsistent with the goals and objectives expressed in Zero Defects\u2019 statement of philosophy. Relying on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Merriott, </em>the Commission concluded that a reasonable interpretation of the term \u201cunder the influence\u201d requires a showing of impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-18\">The question of whether an employer\u2019s expectation is objectively reasonable in a particular case is generally a question of fact, and the Commission\u2019s determination in this regard will not be disturbed on appeal if it is supported by substantial and competent evidence in the record. <em>See Folks, </em>129 Idaho at 838, 933 P.2d at 647. The question of whether the Commission correctly interpreted this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Merriott, </em>however, is a question of law which is subject to free review. <em>See Matthews v. Bucyrus-Erie Co., </em>101 Idaho 657, 659 n. 1, 619 P.2d 1110, 1112 n. 1 (1980). A review of the <em>Merriott </em>opinion indicates that its holding that proof of impairment was necessary to show misconduct was limited to the specific facts of that case and was not meant to be applied generally in all discharge cases. In <em>Merriott </em>this Court concluded that the employer\u2019s substance abuse policy expressly prohibited employees from being impaired during working hours, and because the employer had failed to provide evidence that the claimant was impaired while at work, the claimant was eligible for unemployment compensation benefits. 127 Idaho at 622, 903 P.2d at 1319. The <em>Merriott </em>policy provided in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-19\">Employees are prohibited from being under the influence of any chemical substance or alcohol during working hours. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>Such substance [sic] can <em>impair </em>the fitness of an employee to perform their work. Any violation of this policy will subject the employee to immediate discharge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b933-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 621, 903 P.2d at 1318 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">Unlike the <em>Merriott </em>policy, there is no language regarding impairment in Zero Defects\u2019 policy. Zero Defects\u2019 policy expressly defines the term \u201cunder the influence\u201d to include \u201cany detectable level of alcohol or drugs in the body.\u201d It does not require that the detectable level be at a level that impairs the employee\u2019s ability to perform work safely. The employer in <em>Merriott </em>was required to provide evidence of impairment because impairment was an express condition in its drug policy. There is no such express condition in Zero Defects\u2019 policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-9\">The Court also held in <em>Merriott </em>in regard to the particular policy that \u201cit was necessary for the employer\u2019s expectations to be communicated to the employee to be reasonable.\u201d Id. at 622-23, 903 P.2d at 1319-20. <em>See also Folks, </em>129 Idaho at 838, 933 P.2d at 647; <em>Campbell v. Bonneville County Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, </em>126 Idaho 222, 226, 880 P.2d 252, 256 (1994). The <em>Merriott </em>court concluded that the employer had failed to communicate its expectation to its employee that use of a controlled substance during non-working hours would be a violation of the employer\u2019s drug policy. 127 Idaho at 622, 903 P.2d at 1319. The only expectation actually communicated to the employee was that being impaired while at work would be a violation of the employer\u2019s drug policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-10\">Unlike <em>Merriott, </em>Zero Defects clearly communicated its rule that being at work with \u201cany detectable level of alcohol or drugs in the body\u201d would constitute a violation of its drug policy and could result in a discharge. Smith admits that she read, understood and signed Zero Defects\u2019 policy which contained this express rule. Zero Defects\u2019 \u201czero tolerance\u201d rule was clearly communicated to Smith and was a reasonable expectation of the employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-11\">The Commission also determined that Zero Defects\u2019 \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy was unreasonable because it was inconsistent with the goals and objectives stated in Zero Defects\u2019 statement of philosophy. As previously noted, Zero Defects\u2019 statement of philosophy is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-13\">Zero Defects believes that a healthy and productive work force that is free from the effects of illegal drugs and alcohol is important not only to Zero Defects, but also to our employees, our customers, and the local community. The abuse of drugs and alcohol creates a variety of workplace problems including increased injuries, absenteeism, theft, added cost to benefit plans, a decrease in employee morale, productivity and safety, and a decline in quality of products and services. This drug and alcohol testing policy and procedure is intended to meet our objective of safeguarding Zero Defects and its employees and customers, and the local community, and to encourage employees to seek professional assistance for substance abuse problems.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b933-14\">Maintaining a completely drug-free workplace is consistent with Zero Defects\u2019 goals in reducing absenteeism and theft and maintaining employee morale and productivity. The Commission improperly focused on safety concerns by requiring Zero Defects to provide evidence of impairment. Safety concerns are not the only goals and objectives set forth in Zero Defects\u2019 philosophy statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-15\">Zero Defects communicated its \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy to Smith. Its \u201czero tolerance\u201d standard is consistent with the stated objectives and goals behind Zero Defects\u2019 policy. The policy is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-16\">B. Smith\u2019s Actions Do Constitute \u201cMisconduct\u201d Such That She Should Be Disqualified From Receiving Unemployment Compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-17\">Other than the holding in <em>Merriott, </em>this Court has not addressed whether discharge for a positive drug test, without proof of impaired work performance, is a sufficient basis to disqualify a claimant from unemployment benefits. Other jurisdictions have addressed the specific question, but have reached different conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>Some states require proof of impairment. <em>See, e.g., Weller v. Arizona Dep\u2019t of Econ. Sec., </em>176 Ariz. 220, 860 P.2d 487, 492-94 (App.1993); <em>National Gypsum Co. v. State Employ. Sec. Bd. of Review, </em>244 Kan. 678, 772 P.2d 786, 793 (1989); <em>Stone Forest Indus., Inc. v. Employment Div., </em>127 Or.App. 568, 873 P.2d 474, 475 (1994); <em>Crain v. Employment Sec. Dep\u2019t, </em>65 Wash.App. 51, 827 P.2d 344, 347 (1992). Other states have concluded that as long as an employer\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d drug policy is communicated to its employees and the policy is reasonably related to the employer\u2019s interests, evidence of impairment is not required in order to show misconduct. <em>See, e.g., Dolan v. Svitak, </em>247 Neb. 410, 527 N.W.2d 621, 626 (1995); <em>Nevada Employ. Sec. Dep\u2019t v. Holmes, </em>112 Nev. 275, 914 P.2d 611, 617 (1996); <em>Clevenger v. Nevada Employ. Sec. Dep\u2019t, </em>105 Nev. 145, 770 P.2d 866, 869 (1989); <em>Farm Fresh Dairy, Inc. v. Blackburn, </em>841 P.2d 1150, 1153 (Okla. 1992); <em>Johnson v. Department of Employ. Sec., </em>782 P.2d 965, 971 (Utah Ct.App.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">This Court has previously held the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-5\">A rule laid down by the employer governing off-duty conduct of his employees must have a reasonable relationship to the employer\u2019s interests in order that [a] violation thereof will constitute misconduct barring eligibility for unemployment compensation benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b934-6\"><em>O\u2019Neal v. Employment Sec. Agency, </em>89 Idaho 313, 317, 404 P.2d 600, 602 (1965). In <em>O\u2019Neal, </em>the claimant was a U.S. Post Office employee who had been charged with, and had pled guilty to, several serious felonies. The incidents leading to the employee\u2019s felony convictions occurred while the employee was off duty. <em>Id. </em>at 315, 404 P.2d at 601. The Post Office discharged the employee on the basis that his convictions violated a postal regulation which prohibited \u201cinfamous, dishonest, immoral, or notoriously disgraceful conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Commission held that the employee had not been discharged for misconduct in connection with his employment and determined that he was eligible to receive unemployment benefits. The employment agency appealed. This Court reversed the Commission\u2019s decision, holding that the employee\u2019s actions did amount to misconduct barring him from receiving unemployment benefits. The Court recognized the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-8\">An employee\u2019s conduct off the working premises or outside the course or scope of his employment is generally not considered as misconduct in connection with the employment. There are recognized circumstances, however, as where the conduct is so closely connected with the business interests of the employer as to warrant disqualification for unemployment benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-9\">Here ... claimant admitted violating the cited postal regulation which forbids infamous, dishonest, immoral or notoriously disgraceful conduct. An employer, be he public or private, has the right to expect his employees to refrain from acts which would bring dishonor on the business or the institution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b934-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 319, 404 P.2d at 603-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-11\">Zero Defects has a right to expect its employees to refrain from conduct that may bring dishonor on the business. Testing positive for illegal drugs while manufacturing highly technical electronics equipment is the type of conduct that could bring dishonor to a business like Zero Defects that stakes its reputation on an image of \u201czero tolerance\u201d for error. Zero Defects has a right to ensure that its customers are confident that they will receive a quality product. Zero Defects\u2019 objective in preserving customer confidence was expressed in a letter written by its president to its employees, which stated in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5U\">Our primary objectives [in adopting this policy] are employee health and safety, along with fulfilling obligations to the public and customers, protecting private and public property, and preserving the confidence placed in us.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b934-12\">The \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy it adopted is reasonably related to that interest. The policy was clearly communicated to Smith. Smith\u2019s conduct is sufficiently connected with the business interests of Zero Defects to warrant disqualification for unemployment benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-13\">The Court\u2019s decision in <em>Beaty v. City of Idaho Falls, </em>110 Idaho 891, 719 P.2d 1151 (1986) does not affect the Court\u2019s decision in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>this case. The <em>Beaty </em>court held that an employee\u2019s conviction for possession of illegal guns and marijuana during non-working hours was not \u201cso closely connected with the [employer\u2019s] interests as to warrant disqualification for unemployment benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 893, 719 P.2d at 1153. The basis for the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Beaty, </em>however, was that there was no evidence that the employee had deliberately violated the employer\u2019s code of conduct (prohibiting commission of a felony) or the spirit of the rule. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b935-4\">Unlike <em>Beaty, </em>the evidence in this case is that Smith\u2019s violation of Zero Defects\u2019 \u201czero tolerance\u201d standard was deliberate. She admits that she knew that she could be terminated if a drug test revealed any detectable level of alcohol or drugs in her system while at work. Despite this knowledge, she ingested a prescription diet pill that was not prescribed for her use. The fact that she claims she did not know it was illegal to ingest another person\u2019s prescription pill does not vitiate the fact that she deliberately took a pill that under the law was illegal for her to use. <em>See State v. Fox, </em>124 Idaho 924, 926, 866 P.2d 181, 183 (1993) (ignorance of the law is not a defense).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">Smith\u2019s actions constitute misconduct because: (1) she deliberately violated Zero Defects\u2019 reasonable rule, and (2) her conduct fell below the standard of behavior expected by Zero Defects, and Zero Defects\u2019 expectation was objectively reasonable in the particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b935-8\">The decision of the Industrial Commission awarding Smith unemployment benefits is reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b935-9\">Justices SILAK, WALTERS and KIDWELL, concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b932-14\">. Section 72-1366(e), as it read in 1995, is now codified as \u00a7 72-1366(5).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b935-10\">Chief Justice TROUT,</author>\n<p id=\"AWai\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-11\">Because I believe the record provides substantial and competent evidence to support the Commission\u2019s findings, I must respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-12\">The sole issue before this Court is whether Zero Defects discharged Smith for misconduct in connection with her employment. Following a random drug test, Zero Defects terminated Smith for violating its drag and alcohol policy. The specific rule in question provides: \u201cBeing at work under the influence of alcohol or drugs <em>may </em>result in discharge for the first offense.\u201d (emphasis added). The policy defines \u201cunder the influence\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-13\">\u201cUNDER THE INFLUENCE\u201d means being unable to perform work in a safe, efficient and productive manner; being in a physical or mental condition which creates a risk to the safety of the individual, other employees, the public, or company property; <em>and/or </em>having <em>any detectable level </em>of alcohol or illegal drugs in the body.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b935-14\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-15\">Whether an employee\u2019s behavior constitutes misconduct or, more specifically here, whether an employer\u2019s rules and expectations are reasonable is a question of fact. <em>Folks v. Moscow Sch. Dist. No. 281, </em>129 Idaho 833, 838, 933 P.2d 642, 647 (1997). If supported by substantial and competent evidence, this Court will not disturb the Commission\u2019s factual findings on appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 836, 933 P.2d at 645.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-16\">The Commission did not, as the majority finds, rely on <em>Merriott v. Shearer Lumber Products, </em>127 Idaho 620, 903 P.2d 1317 (1995) in concluding that Zero Defects\u2019 policy required a showing of impairment. Instead, the Commission found the \u201cany detectable level\u201d provision in the policy\u2019s definition of \u201cunder the influence\u201d to be \u201cunreasonable as it relateds [sic] to the stated Philosophy of the Policy.\u201d The Commission then struck that language, and applying the remainder of the definition, the Commission found that there was no evidence that Smith was unable to perform her work \u201cin a safe, efficient and productive manner.\u201d The definition, as modified by the Commission, clearly required a showing of impairment which the Commission merely found to be \u201cconsistent with the holding in <em>Merriott.\u201d </em>Absent such a showing, Zero Defects failed to prove Smith was discharged for misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>The Commission\u2019s findings are supported by substantial and competent evidence and should not be disturbed. Zero Defects related to Smith the \u201cphilosophy\u201d behind its policy as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-4\">Zero Defects believes that a healthy and productive work force that is <em>free from the effects </em>of illegal drags and alcohol is important not only to Zero Defects, but also to our employees, our customers, and the local community. The <em>abuse </em>of drags and alcohol creates a variety of workplace problems including increased injuries, absenteeism, theft, added cost to benefit plans, a decrease in employee morale, productivity and safety, and a decline in quality of products and services. This drag and alcohol testing policy and procedure is intended to meet our objective of safeguarding Zero Defects and its employees and customers, and the local community, and to encourage employees to seek professional assistance for substance abuse problems.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">(emphasis added). The policy also allowed employees to voluntarily admit \u201cto a substance abuse problem.\u201d An employee doing so may be given leave pending successful completion of a rehabilitation program. Moreover, the rule only provided that an employee \u201cmay\u201d be terminated for a first offense. Consequently, the Commission could reasonably find that Zero Defects did not truly have a zero tolerance policy, and, therefore, the \u201cany detectable level\u201d provision in the definition of \u201cunder the influence\u201d was unreasonable in light of Zero Defects\u2019 overall drug and alcohol policy. Therefore, the Commission\u2019s decision finding Smith eligible for unemployment insurance benefits should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
