We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-12\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s order affirming the Commissioner\u2019s decision. <em>Tackett v. Apfel, </em>180 F.3d 1094, 1097 (9th Cir.1999). However, the scope of our review is limited: the Commissioner\u2019s decision must be affirmed if it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b651-14\">On appeal, Bryant claims the vocational expert\u2019s testimony was \u201cflawed\u201d and does not provide substantial evidence supporting the Commissioner\u2019s decision. His challenge is two-pronged. First, he argues the vocational expert erroneously testified that ticket taker and crossing guard jobs do not require the use of both arms. Second, Bryant concedes that he can perform the tasks of a surveillance systems monitor, but citing a quarterly employment journal, he maintains the vocational expert overestimated the number of these jobs in the local economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-15\">We do not need to reach the question of whether Bryant can perform the duties of a ticket taker or crossing guard because substantial evidence supports the Commissioner\u2019s finding that significant numbers of surveillance monitoring jobs exist in the national economy. The vocational expert estimated the number of surveillance jobs to be five thousand countywide and thirty thousand statewide. At most, Bryant casts doubt on the vocational expert\u2019s estimate of the number of jobs in the county. His evidence does not undermine the vocational expert\u2019s statewide estimate or the Commissioner\u2019s determination of the number of surveillance jobs in the national economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b651-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
