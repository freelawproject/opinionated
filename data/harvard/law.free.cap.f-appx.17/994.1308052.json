Mar-so, seeks disability and indemnity compensation (\u201cDIC\u201d) benefits under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1318(b) (1994). In determining her entitlement to benefits, Mrs. Marso argues that the plain language of \u00a7 1318(b) requires that the Department of Veterans Affairs (\u2018VA\u201d) undertake a de novo determination of the veteran\u2019s disability, that is, the VA would not be bound by lifetime rating decisions. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs (\u201cthe Secretary\u201d), however, argues that the VA is bound by lifetime rating decisions', except where there has been a clear and unmistakable error (\u201cCUE\u201d). <em>See </em>38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.22(a)(2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-13\">The court has reviewed this case in light of its opinion in <em>National Organization of Veterans\u2019 Advocates, Inc. v. Principi, </em>No. 00-7095, -7096, -7098 (August 16, 2001). In <em>National Organization, </em>we directed the Secretary to stay all proceedings involving claims for DIC benefits under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1318 whose outcome is dependent on the CUE limitation of 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.22.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-14\">The outcome of this case is dependent on whether it was permissible for the Secretary to impose a CUE limitation for DIC benefits under \u00a7 1318(b). Because Mr. Marso did not actually receive a total disability rating for the requisite period of time required by \u00a7 1318(b) and because there is no allegation of CUE in a rating decision, Mrs. Marso could only be entitled to DIC benefits if the VA conducts a de novo review of her husband\u2019s entitlement to a total disability rating for the statute\u2019s requisite period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-15\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-16\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-17\">In light of <em>National Organization, </em>we remand to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (\u2018Veterans Court\u201d). The Veterans Court may remand to the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals as appropriate.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
