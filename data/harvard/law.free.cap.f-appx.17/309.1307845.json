The district court did so because in its view White\u2019s Guideline criminal history category of VI failed to represent adequately White\u2019s actual criminal history and because of the strong likelihood of recidivism. The district court had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-18\">We employ a three-prong test in reviewing a district court\u2019s upward departure from the Guidelines: (1) we review de novo whether the circumstances of the case are sufficiently unusual to warrant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>departure; (2) we review for clear error whether the circumstances that justify departure actually exist; and (3) we determine whether the degree or range of departure was reasonable, giving \u201cdeference to the trier of fact\u2019s superior feel for the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Little, </em>61 F.3d 450, 453 (6th Cir.1995) (internal quotation marks omitted). White\u2019s arguments on appeal fall within the third prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">We have explained that \u201cour deference depends upon the district court\u2019s providing a reasoned statement of the specific reasons for its departure in language relating to the Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Kennedy, </em>893 F.2d 825, 827 (6th Cir. 1990) (internal quotation marks omitted). White argues that the district court failed to provide such a \u201creasoned statement.\u201d In conjunction with this argument. White asserts that Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(c) precludes us from considering the district court\u2019s reasoning provided during a second hearing held on July 24, 2000. We do not reach this argument, however, for we hold that the reasons provided in the original June 26, 2000 sentencing hearing meet the requirements of <em>Kennedy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">In <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>24 F.3d 829, 833-34 (6th Cir.1994), we explained that the requirement of a \u201creasoned statement\u201d could be met by a \u201cshort, written or reasoned statement from the bench identifying the aggravating factors and the court\u2019s reasons for connecting them to permissible grounds for departure.\u201d We also clarified in <em>Thomas </em>that, \u201c[i]n a case such as the one before us, however, when criminal history category VI is inadequate, there is no \u2018next higher criminal history category\u2019 for the sentencing court to use as a reference.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 834. We held that <em>United States v. Lassiter, </em>929 F.2d 267 (6th Cir.1991), was inapplicable under these circumstances. <em>Thomas, </em>24 F.3d at 835. Instead, where a defendant is already at criminal history category VI, we read U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 as requiring \u201ca court to continue moving down offense-level ranges only until it finds a range which would provide an appropriate sentence for the defendant, but no further.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 834. We do not require \u201cthe court to move only one level, or to explain its rejection of each and every intervening level.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">The district judge supported his decision to depart upward by referring to a prior experience he had with Wnite while on the bench, including a recollection of White not being entirely candid with him. White\u2019s prior involvement with firearms was also troubling to the court. The district court stated that White had a \u201chistory of either being convicted of or apparently in violent crimes to the extent that he was charged with them and has had apparently from the record frequently been given reduced charges.\u201d Because of the extent and character of White\u2019s past illegal activity, the court decided that the criminal history category \u201csignificantly under represents the annual prior criminal conduct and propensity for future unlawful activity.\u201d We hold that on June 26, 2000, the district court adequately explained its reasons for the departure. Although the district court stated that it was relying on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.3, it was clear from the context and to the parties that the court was in fact relying on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">White argues that even if the district court adequately explained its reasons on June 26, 2000, its decision was still unreasonable. We have explained, however, \u201cunless there is little or no basis for the court\u2019s actions in making an upward departure, the sentence should be upheld.\u201d <em>Little, </em>61 F.3d at 454 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). White has been involved in the criminal justice system for most of his adult life. Between just 1997 and 1999, White was charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>with six crimes involving violence and/or the use or possession of weapons. Further, the sentence White received thirty-seven months of imprisonment is still far below the statutory maximum of fifteen years on each count. We hold that the district court\u2019s decision to depart upward three levels was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
