We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we deny leave to proceed in forma pauperis, deny a certificate of appealability, and dismiss the appeal on the reasoning of the district court. <em>Crowell v. Virginia, </em>No. CA-01-152-2 (E.D.Va. Apr. 30, 2001). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-22\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b223-24\"> Generally, dismissals without prejudice are not appealable. <em>Domino Sugar Corp. v. Sugar Workers Local Union 392, </em>10 F.3d 1064, 1066 (4th Cir. 1993). We find, however, that the district court\u2019s order is a final, appealable order because the defect identified by the district court must be cured by something more than an amendment to the complaint. <em>Id. </em>at 1066-67.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
