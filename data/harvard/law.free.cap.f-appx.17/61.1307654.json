New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), even though the district court\u2019s finding did not impose a sentence above the statutory maximum. We have held that under <em>Apprendi, </em>it is not unconstitutional for judges to impose sentencing enhancements when those enhancements do not lead to punishment above the statutory maximum. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Breen, </em>243 F.3d 591, 598-599 (2d Cir.2001). Accordingly, we reject Mota\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-11\">We have considered Mota\u2019s argument that the information is invalid and find it to be without merit. Mota formally and explicitly waived indictment before the district court at the plea allocution. The subsequent amendment to the information was proposed by defense counsel and ratified by both government and defense counsel before the district court at the plea allocution. Accordingly, we find no error. <em>See United States v. Ferguson, </em>758 F.2d 843, 851-852 (2d Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-12\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
