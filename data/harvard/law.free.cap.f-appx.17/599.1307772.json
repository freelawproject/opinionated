We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2000), and AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-19\">Because the parties are familiar with the facts of the case, we recount them here only where necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-20\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b628-21\">We review for clear error a magistrate judge\u2019s decision to issue a search warrant. <em>See United States v. Fulbright, </em>105 F.3d 443, 453 (9th Cir.1997). We must uphold the warrant if, under the totality of the circumstances, the magistrate judge had a \u201csubstantial basis\u201d for concluding that the affidavit in support of the search warrant established probable cause. <em>See Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 238, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983); <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>937 F.2d 1490, 1494 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>B. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Reviewing the affidavit at issue in this case, Judge Manella applied <em>Gates </em>\u2019 totality of the circumstances inquiry and observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-6\">We have three unrelated informants, one of whom provided his name and address, and all of whose evidence was consistent with and corroborative of each other providing three different officers on three separate occasions within a period of approximately three weeks evidence from which a reasonable person, and particularly an officer like Officer Anderson experienced in narcotics and stolen property investigations, could infer that illegal activity was being conducted at the defendant\u2019s residence... Certainly there must be some \u2014 something that would cause one to' believe these accounts, but here the corroboration was the cumulative evidence provided by the sequential increasingly detailed and specific reports of three people, none of whom appeared to be in a position to have collaborated with the others to concoct a false story, nor have the courts required the police to engage in time-consuming activities which are not necessary to provide an adequate basis for believing illegal activity is afoot at a certain location.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">We agree with Judge Manella\u2019s observations and her conclusion that the state magistrate judge had a \u201csubstantial basis\u201d for concluding that the affidavit in support of the search warrant established probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">The informants\u2019 veracity was amply established through corroboration. <em>See United States v. Landis, </em>726 F.2d 540, 543 (9th Cir.1984) (\u201cInterlocking tips from different confidential informants enhance the credibility of each.\u201d). Three separate informants independently provided information to three different officers on three distinct occasions, and the informants\u2019 accounts dovetailed in several material respects. Rabaca identified no evidence even remotely suggesting collusion on the part of the tipsters.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">The informants were reliable notwithstanding the fact that none previously had provided information to authorities. <em>See United States v. Canfield, </em>212 F.3d 713, 719 (2d Cir.2000) (quotation omitted) (\u201c[I]t is improper to discount an informant\u2019s information simply because he has no proven record of truthfulness or accuracy.\u201d). Here, all three informants were identified and gave information to police face-to-face. Informant # 3, in fact, was a citizen informant, who voluntarily came to the police station and personally provided to authorities his name, address, and other identifying information. We have held that when citizen informants without criminal records provide information, \u201cfurther corroboration was unnecessary to a determination of probable cause.\u201d <em>United States v. Mi-chaelian, </em>803 F.2d 1042, 1045-46 (9th Cir. 1986); <em>see also United States v. Heman-dez-Escarsega, </em>886 F.2d 1560, 1566 (9th Cir.1989) (\u201c[T]he detailed nature of many of [the informants\u2019] statements and the interlocking nature of their stories enhanced their credibility.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-11\">Finally, the affidavit sufficiently established the informants\u2019 bases of knowledge. Most important, Informant #2 expressly stated \u201cthat he was inside of \u2018Dreamer\u2019s\u2019 residence approximately one week ago and saw four (4) uzi-machine guns and three (3) .38 caliber pistols in \u2018Dreamer\u2019s\u2019 bedroom closet.\u201d In this way, Informant # 2 clearly indicated that he personally entered 1207 W. 22nd Street and witnessed seven firearms and their precise location in the residence. Arguably, Informant # 2\u2019s information, <em>by itself, </em>establishes probable cause in light of our statement that \u201c[a] detailed eye-witness report of a crime is self-corroborating; it supplies its own indi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>da of reliability.\u201d <em>United States v. Elliott, </em>898 F.2d 220, 223 (9th Cir.1990) (quotation omitted), <em>amended in non-relevant part by United States v. Elliott, </em>904 F.2d 25 (9th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">C. Condusion</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">It may be true that \u201c[n]o single piece of evidence ... is conclusive^ but] the pieces fit neatly together and, so viewed, support the Magistrate\u2019s determination that there was a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime would be found\u201d at 1207 W. 22nd Street. <em>Massachusetts v. Upton, </em>466 U.S. 727, 733, 104 S.Ct. 2085, 80 L.Ed.2d 721 (1984) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order denying Rabaca\u2019s motion to suppress evidence is</p>\n<p id=\"aiz-dedup-0\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b628-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
