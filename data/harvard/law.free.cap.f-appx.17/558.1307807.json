The order was entered on January 22, 1999, but no separate judgment was filed or entered. On July 16, 1999, Plaintiffs filed a motion to set aside the dismissal order, which was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b587-11\">In <em>Carter v. Beverly Hills Sav. and Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>884 F.2d 1186, 1189 (9th Cir. 1989), we held that \u201cthe time requirements of Rule 60(b) only commence running upon \u2018entry5 of a final judgment that complies with Rule 58 [of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure] .\u201d Rule 58 \u201crequires that every judgment must be set forth on a separate document.\u201d <em>Carter, </em>884 F.2d at 1189. We have \u201cheld fast to a mechanical application of the \u2018separate judgment\u2019 rule, requiring all formalities to be observed.\u201d <em>Corrigan v. Bargala, </em>140 F.3d 815, 818 (9th Cir. 1998) (citation omitted). A separate document is \u201ca sheet containing the judgment,\u201d which is \u201cdistinct from any opinion or memorandum.\u201d <em>Allah v. Superior Ct., </em>871 F.2d 887, 890 (9th Cir.1989) (internal quotation omitted). \u201c[T]he entry of an order in the civil docket outlining the facts, law, and legal analysis is not sufficient to satisfy the requirement of Rule 58 that a separate document be filed by the clerk setting forth the judgment.\u201d <em>Corrigan, </em>140 F.3d at 818. Rule 58 further requires that the judgment 1) indicate that it is an order, 2) be mailed to counsel, 3) be signed by the clerk or deputy clerk who prepared it, and 4) be entered on the docket sheet showing that a separate order was filed. <em>See Carter, </em>884 F.2d at 1189-1190. The civil docket sheet in this case does not reflect that any of these requirements have been met. As the time for filing a Rule 60(b) motion had not commenced, the district court erred in ruling that the Plaintiffs\u2019 Rule 60(b) motion was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-14\">Additionally, because no judgment was entered, Plaintiffs have not waived then-right to appeal the merits of the district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of prosecution, even though they did not raise that issue in this appeal. <em>See Corrigan, </em>140 F.3d at 818 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-15\">Accordingly, we VACATE the district court\u2019s denial of Plaintiffs\u2019 Rule 60(b) motion and REMAND with direction that the district court consider the merits of the motion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b587-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
