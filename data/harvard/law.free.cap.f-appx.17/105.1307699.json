Kyle contends the district court erred in denying him an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3E1.1 (2000). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-26\">Kyle argues the district court erred by denying him an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility because he tested positive for cocaine after his guilty plea. Kyle asserts he provided substantial assistance to the Government and presented evidence of post-offense rehabilitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>that should merit an adjustment. A district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to USSG \u00a7 3E1.1 is a factual determination reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Miller, </em>77 F.3d 71, 74 (4th Cir.1996). The determination of the district court is entitled to great deference. USSG \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.5). Continued drug use is an appropriate reason to deny an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. <em>See United States v. Kidd, </em>12 F.3d 30, 34 (4th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Underwood, </em>970 F.2d 1336, 1339 (4th Cir.1992). We find the district court did not clearly err by denying an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Accordingly, we affirm Kyle\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
