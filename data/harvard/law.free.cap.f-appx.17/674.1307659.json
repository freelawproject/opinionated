R.App. P. 34(a)(2).

We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-22\">Aviles-Garcia contends that the district court erred by finding that an unconvicted drug seizure was relevant conduct for purposes of determining the attributable quantity of marijuana, resulting in an increase to her offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 and a violation of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). We review a district court\u2019s interpretation of the guidelines de novo and factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Castillo, </em>181 F.3d 1129, 1134-35 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-23\">The district court here determined beyond a reasonable doubt that marijuana seized in a prior drug seizure was relevant conduct pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3 because it involved an ongoing course of behavior within a short time interval and, therefore, Aviles-Garcia was accountable for a combined total of 73.94 kilograms of marijuana making her base offense level 22. Because inclusion of the 33.14 kilograms of marijuana from the prior seizure did not increase the actual sentence beyond the statutory maximum of five years, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(4), any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Velasco-Heredia, </em>249 F.3d 963, 968 (9th Cir.2001) (stating that sentence imposed in violation of <em>Apprendi </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>stands where district court error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt); <em>United States v. Garcia-Guizar, </em>234 F.3d 483, 488-89 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b702-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9 th Cir.
