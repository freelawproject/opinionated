We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-15\">Derington contends the district court abused its discretion in executing the writ by failing to follow the procedures set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 985, entitled <em>Civil forfeiture of real property. </em>Derington\u2019s property was not civilly forfeited, rather he was ordered to pay restitution as part of his criminal sentence. Accordingly, section 985 is inapplicable and this argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-16\">Derington\u2019s remaining contentions, raised for the first time on appeal, challenge the validity of the restitution order imposed as part of his criminal judgment. <em>See Bolker v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>760 F.2d 1039, 1042 (9th Cir. 1985) (\u201cAs a general rule, this Court will not consider an issue raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d). Derington failed to challenge the restitution order in his direct criminal appeal and we decline to address such claims here.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b614-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
