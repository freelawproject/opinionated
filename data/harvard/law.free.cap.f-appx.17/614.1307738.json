Specifically, Houser argues that the district court should not have enhanced his sentence for making a \u201cthreat of death\u201d under U.S. Sentencing Guideline (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(f) because he was unarmed, despite the fact that Houser wrote a note promising not to use a gun if the bank teller cooperated. Houser also claims the district court erred in concluding that it lacked the authority to make a diminished capacity downward <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>departure on the basis that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.13 makes such a departure unavailable when there is a \u201cserious threat of violence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">The threat of gun use during a robbery or similar offense counts as a threat of death. <em>See, e.g., U.S. v. Eaton, </em>934 F.2d 1077, 1079 (9th Cir.l991)(threat to shoot a gun during a bank robbery amounts to a \u201cthreat of death\u201d as defined in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)). A threat to use deadly force can trigger an increase in the offense level even where the defendant does not explicitly state that the use of such force will occur unless the target complies with the defendant\u2019s demands. <em>U.S. v. France, </em>57 F.3d 865, 866-67 (9th Cir.l995)(upholding the two-level enhancement under Section 2B3.1 where defendant sought to intimidate robbery victim by writing \u201cI have dynamite\u201d on a note). The court in <em>France </em>emphasized that it was unnecessary for the defendant making such an implied threat to explicitly state that deadly force would be used \u201cif you don\u2019t give me the money.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 868; <em>see also U.S. v. Strandberg, </em>952 F.2d 1149, 1151 (9th Cir.l991)(holding that a Section 2B3.1 adjustment \u201cdoes not require that the defendant state that he intends to kill the teller if his demands are not met\u201d). The threat to use deadly force is functionally no different than a promise not to use a gun if cooperation is forthcoming.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Houser also claims the district court erred in denying him the benefit of a downward departure on the basis of diminished capacity pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.13. Such a departure is not, however, available where the court concludes that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-13\">[T]he facts and circumstances of the defendant\u2019s offense indicate a need to protect the public because the offense involved actual violence or a serious threat of violence....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.13(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">The district court concluded that its determination that Houser\u2019s unarmed bank robbery involved a threat of death foreclosed any downward departure under this guideline, because a threat of death was akin to a \u201cserious threat of violence.\u201d Where an offense is a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d this court has concluded that a diminished capacity departure under Section 5K2.13 is unavailable. <em>U.S. v. Borrayo, </em>898 F.2d 91, 94 (9th Cir.1990). A defendant who threatens physical force cannot avail himself of Section 5K2.13. <em>Id. </em>In an unusual case we held that an indirect threat did not rise to the level of a \u201cserious threat of violence.\u201d <em>See U.S. v. Walter, </em>256 F.3d 891, 893 (9th Cir.2001) (holding that the district court erred in finding that defendant seriously threatened violence when he sent a letter threatening the President over the forged signature of someone on whom he wanted revenge; defendant evinced no actual intent to threaten the President himself, but only to make trouble for the object of his revenge). This is not such a case. Houser made a threat of death in the course of a robbery; the fact that he was unarmed does not diminish the seriousness of that threat. As a result, Section 5K2.13 is not available to Houser to support a departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b642-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
