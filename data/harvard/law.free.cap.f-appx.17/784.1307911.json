The district court determined it lacked jurisdiction to consider Mr. Scott\u2019s motion, ostensibly brought pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(e). Our jurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm for substantially the same reasons given by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">On June 2, 1997, Mr. Scott pled guilty to possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and money laundering. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(l)(A)(i). Mr. Scott did not appeal his conviction. Approximately three years later, Mr. Scott filed a motion to withdraw his plea under Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(e). The district court lacked jurisdiction to consider Mr. Scott\u2019s motion because it was filed post-sentence. Mr. Scott could have brought his motion only under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>United States v. Todaro, </em>982 F.2d 1025, 1028 (6th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Davis, </em>954 F.2d 182, 184 (4th Cir.1992). Though such an action would appear to be barred under the one-year limitation period contained in \u00a7 2255, we express no opinion on that.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b812-28\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>This court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir.R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
