Cir. R. 27(f) and to dismiss Robert J. Frierson\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Frierson responds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-23\">The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims dismissed Frierson\u2019s appeal of a Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals decision on the ground that Frierson failed to file a timely notice of appeal. Frierson appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-24\">Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292, not every decision entered by the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims is appealable. Section 7292(a) provides that a party may only seek review of a decision of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims with respect to the validity or interpretation of any statute or regulation relied on by the court in making its decision. Further, except to the extent that an appeal presents a constitutional issue, this court may not review \u201c(A) a challenge to a factual determination, or (B) a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2). If an appellant's case does not meet these criteria, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d) requires this court to dismiss the appeal. <em>See In re Bailey, </em>182 F.3d 860 (Fed.Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-25\">In his informal brief, Frierson responds \u201cno\u201d to the question whether the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims\u2019 decision involved the validity or interpretation of a statute or regulation, and also responds \u201cno\u201d to the question whether the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims decided constitutional issues. Frierson does not address the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims\u2019 dismissal of his appeal, but instead challenges only the factual determinations made by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-26\">Accordingly, because Frierson does not challenge the validity or interpretation of a specific statute or regulation relating to his claim or a specific constitutional issue relating to his claim, this court\u2019s limited jurisdiction does not permit appellate review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>of the decision of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. <em>See Livingston v. Der-winski, </em>959 F.2d 224, 225-26 (Fed.Cir. 1992); 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-6\">(1) The Secretary\u2019s motion to waive the requirements of Fed. Cir. R. 27(f) is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-7\">(2) The Secretary\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-8\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
