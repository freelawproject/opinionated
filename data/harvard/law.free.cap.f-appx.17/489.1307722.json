He last worked in 1997. Stanton was involuntarily admitted to a mental health center that year, and was treated for depression. Stanton applied for social security benefits based on his back pain, ulcers, and mental illness. An administrative law judge (ALJ) found Stanton suffered from back problems, an affective disorder, and borderline intellectual functioning, but concluded Stanton\u2019s testimony about his impairments and his ability work was not completely credible. Athough the ALJ believed Stanton could not return to his past relevant work, the ALJ held Stanton retained the ability to perform sedentary work. Based on the medical evidence as posed in a hypothetical question, a vocational expert testified there were jobs Stanton could perform. The ALJ denied benefits, and the Appeals Council and district court <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> affirmed. On appeal, Stanton asserts the ALJ failed properly to consider his mental impairments. Having carefully reviewed the record, we conclude substantial evidence on the record as a whole supports the ALJ\u2019s factual findings, and the ALJ\u2019s decision is not based on legal error. <em>See Gwathney v. Chater, </em>104 F.3d 1043, 1045 (8th Cir.1997). The ALJ properly evaluated and discounted Stanton\u2019s subjective complaints under <em>Polaski v. Heckler, </em>739 F.2d 1320, 1322 (8th Cir.1984), and properly considered and discredited the opinion of Stanton\u2019s treating psychiatrist based on inconsistencies between the opinion, the psychiatrist\u2019s records, and Stanton\u2019s own statements. The ALJ also presented the vocational expert with a proper hypothetical question, so the expert\u2019s response that there were sedentary jobs Stanton could perform supports the ALJ\u2019s decision that Stanton was not disabled. We thus affirm the district court. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-14\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b518-12\"> The Honorable Ortrie D.
