We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we resubmit the case concurrently with the filing of this disposition, and we affirm. By separate memorandum decision previously filed we affirmed Greene\u2019s underlying conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">Greene contends that because he was acquitted on count 44, the district court erred by applying the loss alleged in that count toward its calculation of his offense level. We review 1) the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo; 2) the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines to the facts of this case for abuse of discretion; and 3) the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Barnes, </em>125 F.3d 1287, 1290 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2), relevant conduct for purposes of determining a defendant\u2019s sentencing guideline range includes all acts and omissions \u201cthat were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.\u201d A sentencing court may consider conduct even though the defendant was acquitted, so long as it has been proven by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Watts, </em>519 U.S. 148, 153-54, 117 S.Ct. 633, 136 L.Ed.2d 554 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">We previously upheld Greene\u2019s conviction based on a fraudulent scheme he devised involving HIV test kits. In furtherance of this scheme Greene defrauded Empyrean Diagnostics, Inc. (\u201cEDI\u201d) of approximately $132,560, he fraudulently obtained some $200,000 worth of components for HIV test kits from EDI, and he received approximately $3,256 from the sale of HIV and hepatitis test kits. Greene\u2019s involvement with EDI was substantially related to the conduct supporting his conviction, all of which involved common victims, common accomplices, and the common goal of marketing bogus test kits. The district court did not err by relying on this relevant conduct in imposing an eight-level enhancement. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Fine, </em>975 F.2d 596, 600 (9th Cir.1992) (money involved in twelve dismissed counts could be considered in determining defendant\u2019s offense level).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-11\">Greene next argues that the district court erred by applying a two-level upward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.3 for extreme psychological injury. Greene asserts that the departure cannot apply because there was no evidence that anyone \u201csuffered\u201d any \u201cemotional impact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-12\">Upward departures are authorized when the Government proves that the defendant\u2019s conduct caused psychological harm greater than that \u201cnormally\u201d resulting from the crime of conviction. <em>United States v. Chatlin, </em>51 F.3d 869, 874 (9th Cir.1995). Greene posed a substantial threat to public health because he purported to provide reliable HIV screening when in fact there was no scientific basis for the test \u201cresults\u201d he sent to customers. The Government presented testimony and letters by victims describing the psychological harm they experienced, including the statements of one person who unwittingly put a new partner at risk, and another who has lost faith in all types of mail order test kits. These psychological injuries are far more serious and lasting than those normally resulting from losing money to mail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>and wire fraud. We affirm the upward departure. <em>See also United States v. Barnes, 125 </em>F.3d 1287 (9th Cir.1997) (affirming two-level enhancement for psychological harm where defendant fraudulently impersonated a doctor).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Greene disputes the two-level enhancement he received for more than minimal planning under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(2). This enhancement applies if \u201cthe offense involved (A) more than minimal planning, or (B) a scheme to defraud more than one victim.\u201d Green qualifies on both grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lBl.l(f) \u201cmore than minimal planning\u201d means \u201cmore planning than is typical for commission of the offense in a simple form.\u201d Greene\u2019s conduct falls squarely within this definition and, additionally, the district court did not err because his scheme sought to defraud multiple victims. Greene\u2019s claim of impermissible double-counting fails because we have held that enhancements for more than minimal planning and a leadership role in the offense may be applied simultaneously. <em>United States v. Kelly, </em>993 F.2d 702, 705 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">Greene next contests the district court\u2019s application of a two-level enhancement for conscious or reckless risk of serious bodily injury pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(4)(A). The district court\u2019s decision on whether an offense involved conscious or reckless risk of serious bodily injury under this guideline is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Karlic, </em>997 F.2d 564, 568 (9th Cir.1993). The district court did not err in finding that Greene consciously and recklessly put his customers (and their sexual partners) at risk of seriously bodily injury. Despite Greene\u2019s assertion to the contrary, there is no requirement of proof that any victim actually suffered injury. <em>Id. </em>(enhancement may apply even where no one was injured).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">The district court also did not err by increasing Greene\u2019s offense level because he was \u201can organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). Evidence in the record supports a finding that Greene supervised his wife, Tsou, and his former employee, Alvarez, in furtherance of his criminal scheme. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Leung, </em>35 F.3d 1402, 1405-06 (9th Cir.1994) (preponderance of the evidence standard applies to district court\u2019s finding that defendant played a leadership role).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">Greene disputes the special assessment applied by the district court pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3013. The special assessment of $100 per felony went into effect for convictions on or after April 24, 1996, and Greene was convicted on all sixteen counts after that effective date. The district court did not err in imposing a special assessment of $1600.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-10\">Greene objects to various conditions of supervised release imposed pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583. \u201cA district court has broad discretion to impose supervised release conditions.\u201d <em>United States v. Lopez, 258 </em>F.3d 1053, 2001 WL 877287*3 (9th Cir. Aug. 6, 2001). The district court is free <em>to </em>impose conditions on supervised release which may not be related to the offense of conviction if they satisfy the other factors in the guidelines. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>998 F.2d 696, 697 (9th Cir.1993). We test the validity of a particular condition of release by asking \u201cwhether the condition imposed can reasonably be said to contribute significantly both to the rehabilitation of the convicted person and to the protection of the public.\u201d <em>United States v. Bahe, </em>201 F.3d 1124, 1127-28 (9th Cir.2000) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-11\">The district court\u2019s conditions on supervised release were reasonable in light of Greene\u2019s unstable behavior and the nature and degree of his criminal conduct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>The requirements of mental health counseling and drug testing, for example, are appropriate in light of Alvarez\u2019s testimony that Greene had become irate and had threatened him. The district court did not err by imposing these conditions on Greene\u2019s supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">Greene\u2019s motion to submit an over length reply brief is GRANTED and his sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b752-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
