Jestine appeals from a judgment of conviction entered on March 7, 2000 by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, after Jestine pleaded guilty to one count of illegal reentry following the commission of an aggravated felony, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2). Jestine asserts that the District Court committed plain error when it sentenced him to 78 months\u2019 imprisonment because he had not allocuted to the element of \u00a7 1326(b)(2) that he was deported following commission of an aggravated felony. Accordingly, Jestine argues that under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the District Court should have imposed a sentence not in excess of two years, pursuant to \u00a7 1326(a) only.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">Jestine\u2019s claim is without merit. This Court concluded in <em>United States v. La-torre-Benavides, </em>241 F.3d 262 (2d Cir.) (per curiam), <em>cert, denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 121 S.Ct. 2013, 149 L.Ed.2d 1014 (2001), that the issue raised by Jestine is directly governed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), which held that \u00a7 1326(b) \u201cdoes not set out a separate offense but rather is a penalty provision.\u201d <em>Latorre-Benavides, </em>241 F.3d at 264. <em>Ap-prendi v. New Jersey </em>does not control, and we, accordingly, affirm Jestine\u2019s conviction on the basis of <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
