In March, 1996, she was dismissed from that program. As a result of her dismissal from the program, Mercer, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, brought suit on June 11,1996, in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. The named defendants were the Board of Trustees for UNC, who were not identified by name, Janice Martin, Rik D\u2019Amato, Ellis Copeland, Judith Praul, and John and Jane Doe, employees of UNC.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-17\">In her complaint, Mercer identified the defendants and under the heading \u201cGeneral Allegations,\u201d set forth in great detail a chronology of the problems she had at UNC. Mercer then asserted eight claims for relief. The first claim for relief was against all defendants for deprivation of a liberty interest without due process of law pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. A second claim for relief was against the Board of Trustees for deprivation of a property interest pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The third claim for relief was against all defendants and alleged a conspiracy pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The fourth claim for relief was a pendent state claim against Martin for defamation. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367. The fifth claim was also a pendent claim against the Board of Trustees for breach of contract. The sixth claim for relief was against Martin \u201cin her individual capacity for outrageous conduct.\u201d The seventh claim for relief was against Martin, Copeland, D\u2019Amato and Praul in their individual capacities and John and Jane Doe for tor-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>tious interference with a contractual relationship. The eighth claim for relief was against Martin, Copeland, D\u2019Amato and Praul for \u201cconspiracy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b943-4\">All defendants filed motions to dismiss pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) and (6). On September 13, 1996, Mercer filed an amended complaint in which she again alleged the eight claims for relief previously pled, but indicated that she only sought equitable relief from the Board of Trustees (not monetary damages) and that the individual defendants were being sued only in their individual capacities. On January 22, 1997, all parties consented to the dismissal of Praul as a defendant. Thereafter, on March 13, 1997, Martin filed a renewed motion to dismiss and for summary judgment, and, on April 4, 1997, the other defendants filed a motion for summary judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">After oral argument, the district court on June 15, 1998, granted the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment as to Mercer\u2019s first claim for relief, i.e., deprivation of a liberty interest without due process of law under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and also on Mercer\u2019s fourth claim for relief against Martin for defamation. A jury trial on Mercer\u2019s six remaining claims began on June 15, 1998. After Mercer concluded her presentation of evidence, the district court granted the Board of Trustees\u2019 motion under Fed. R Civ. P. 50 and dismissed UNC from the case. The jury thereafter found for the defendants on all claims except Mercer\u2019s seventh claim against Martin for tortious interference with a contract, and on that claim the jury awarded Martin $7,500.00 in damages. On June 30, 1998, Martin filed a motion for judgment n.o.v. Almost two years later, the district court on March 29, 2000, granted Martin\u2019s motion and entered judgment in favor of all defendants on all claims. Mercer appeals that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-8\">On appeal, Mercer in her brief sets forth five issues to be resolved: (1) whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment on her defamation claim (fourth claim); (2) whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment on her deprivation of liberty interest (first claim); (3) whether the form of verdict on her procedural due process claim was \u201caccurate;\u201d (4) whether the jury\u2019s award of only $7,500.00 for tortious interference with a contract (seventh claim) was supported by the evidence, or was it inadequate; and (5) whether the district court erred in granting Martin\u2019s post-trial motion for judgment n.o.v. for failure to comply with the Colorado Governmental Immunity Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-9\">At the outset we note that we are here concerned with only three of the defendants named in the complaint, i.e., Martin, D\u2019Amato and Copeland. The Board of Trustees for UNC and Praul were dismissed by the district court, and on appeal there is no challenge to such dismissals. John and Jane Doe, named in the complaint as defendants, are still John and Jane Doe, and have not been further identified. So, we are only concerned with defendants Martin, D\u2019Amato and Copeland.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-10\">Counsel first argues that the district court erred in granting Martin summary judgment on Mercer\u2019s fourth claim for relief, which was a defamation claim under state law against Martin only. This claim was based on the fact that Martin, who was Mercer\u2019s first faculty advisor, had accused Mercer of plagiarism in her presentation of a so-called \u201cresource guide\u201d paper. In granting Martin summary judgment on the defamation claim, the district court held that, on the evidence before it, the \u201caccusation\u201d of plagiarism was true and that Martin \u201cdid not \u2018publish\u2019 the accusation within the meaning of the law of defamation.\u201d In this latter connection, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>district court noted that the charge of plagiarism was not circulated \u201cto anyone beyond the Psychology faculty,\u201d and that circulation of a statement within an institution or agency does not, by itself, constitute publication, citing <em>Asbill v. Housing Auth. of Choctaw Nation, </em>726 F.2d 1499, 1503 (10th Cir.1984). We are in general accord with the district court\u2019s analysis of this particular matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">Counsel next argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment for Martin, D\u2019Amato and Copeland on Mercer\u2019s first claim for relief. In her first claim, Mercer alleged that the defendants acting under the color of state law deprived her of constitutional rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution by \u201cimpugning ... [her] honesty and integrity by accusing her of plagiarism,\u201d which accusations, she said, were false. In connection with this particular claim, the district court concluded, as it did in connection with Mercer\u2019s fourth claim for relief against Martin for defamation, that, on the record before it, Mercer had plagiarized portions of her \u201cresource guide\u201d paper and that accordingly, Martin\u2019s accusation of plagiarism was not false nor had there been any \u201cpublication\u201d thereof, again citing <em>Asbill. </em>Again, we are in general accord with the district courts analysis of this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">In her \u201cStatement of the Issues\u201d at the beginning of her brief, counsel suggests that the form of verdict submitted to the jury in connection with \u201cMercer\u2019s Procedural Due Process Claim\u201d was \u201cnot accurate.\u201d Mercer has not indicated with any degree of specificity the \u201cinaccuracy\u201d in the verdict form. There is a suggestion \u2022 that the district court erred in holding that Mercer\u2019s termination from the program was for \u201cacademic\u201d reasons, as opposed to \u201cbehavioral\u201d reasons, and therefore, according to counsel, Mercer was entitled to \u201cmore due process\u201d than she would otherwise be entitled to. How much more \u201cdue process\u201d is conjectural. Be that as it may, we are not inclined to further speculate on this particular matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-7\">Counsel next asserts that the jury\u2019s award of only $7,500.00 against Martin on Mercer\u2019s claim of tortious interference with her \u201ccontractual relationship\u201d was inadequate and not supported by the record. We disagree. A jury\u2019s award of damages should not be overturned on appeal \u201cunless it is clearly erroneous and there is no evidence to support the award.\u201d <em>Greene v. Safeway Stores, Inc., </em>210 F.3d 1237, 1245 (10th Cir.2000). The amount of damages was a jury question and in this regard the jury was not required to believe Mercer\u2019s testimony as to the extent of her damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-8\">As indicated, on June 30, 1998, Martin filed a motion for judgment n.o.v. under Fed.R.Civ.P. \u00a7\u00a7 12(b)(1) and 50(b) alleging that Mercer had failed to comply with the Colorado Governmental Immunity Act (\u201cAct\u201d), C.R.S. \u00a7 24-10-101, <em>et seq. </em>That Act reads, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-9\">Any person claiming to have suffered an injury by a public entity or by an employee thereof while in the course of such employment, whether or not by a willful and wanton act or omission, shall file a written notice as provided in this section within one hundred eighty days after the date of the discovery of the injury, regardless of whether the person then knew all of the elements of a claim or of a cause of action for such injury. Compliance with the provisions of this section shall be a jurisdictional prerequisite to any action brought under the provisions of this article, and failure of compliance shall forever bar any such action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b944-10\">C.R.S. \u00a7 24-10-109(l)(2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-11\">Martin stated in her motion that Mercer had not filed her \u201cnotice of claim\u201d until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>January 12,1996, that Mercer had \u201cdiscovered her injury\u201d within the meaning of the Act no later than June 20, 1995, and that Mercer\u2019s notice was not filed within 180 days after such discovery. Mercer filed a response to Martin\u2019s motion, alleging that the 180 day provision of the Act did not commence to run on June 20, 1995, but later, possibly in August, 1995, and that the notice was filed within 180 days after her discovery of \u201ctortious interference,\u201d which, as she indicated, was, at the earliest, around the end of August, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-4\">In Martin\u2019s motion for judgment n.o.v., mention is made of a \u201cletter dated June 16, 1995, which would constitute interference with plaintiff\u2019s contract with the University of Northern Colorado.\u201d In this regard, it appears that on June 16, 1995, Martin wrote a memorandum, distributed to the School Psychology Faculty, concerning Mercer. In that memorandum, Martin stated that she had \u201ccontinued concerns about Ms. Kenna Mercer\u2019s behavior as a school psychology practicum student.\u201d Martin then listed her several \u201cconcerns,\u201d one of which was related to \u201cA District 6 Resource Guide that she turned in as her own work.\u201d Immediately after that statement, Martin wrote as follows: \u201c(This is plagiarism.).\u201d In support of Martin\u2019s motion for judgment n.o.v., counsel argues that no later than June 20, 1995, Mercer became aware of the June 16 letter by Martin which would trigger the 180 day period prescribed by C.R.S. \u00a7 24-10-109. As indicated, Mercer\u2019s notice of intent was not filed until January 12, 1996, well beyond 180 days from June 20,1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-9\">In her response to Martin\u2019s motion for judgment n.o.v., Mercer alleged that she did not become aware of the June 16 letter until August, 1995, and did not \u201creview\u201d it until September 1,1995, and that therefore her \u201cnotice\u201d filed on January 12, 1996, was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-10\">Some time later, the district court, on March 29, 2000, entered an order granting Martin\u2019s motion for judgment n.o.v. Apparently that order was entered on the basis of the motion and response thereto, without oral argument. In so doing, the district court noted that \u201cthere is no dispute that the alleged tortuous [sic] interference arose from a June 15, 1995, memorandum authored by Martin accusing plaintiff of plagiarism and other wrongs.\u201d The district court then went on to state that \u201cplaintiffs own verified complaint establishes that she knew of Martin\u2019s charges against her no later than June 20, 1995,\u201d and that January 12, 1996, was more than 180 days later than June 20, 1995.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In so doing, the district court rejected Mercer\u2019s suggestion that the notice period did not begin to run until she discovered the ultimate consequences of Martin\u2019s tortious acts, namely either when she received notice of the termination of her degree program in March, 1996, or, at the earliest, when she actually received a copy of the June 16 memorandum in August of 1995. The district court noted that the Act itself ties the 180 days to the \u201cdate of discovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>of the injury,\u201d but concluded that under Colorado law, an aggrieved party may not wait to file notice until all the elements of the claim mature and the 180 day period begins to run when a claimant knows of, or through the exercise of reasonable diligence should have known of, or discovered, the <em>wrongful act, </em>citing <em>Trinity Broadcasting of Denver, Inc. v. City of Westminster, </em>848 P.2d 916, 928 (Colo.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">C.R.S. \u00a7 24-10-109 requires any person claiming to have suffered an injury as a result of a tort committed by a public employee committed in the course of her public employment, to file notice of her claim within 180 days of the date of discovery of the injury. The burden of proof is on the plaintiff to show compliance with the Act\u2019s notice requirement and a failure to substantially comply with the notice requirement is a \u201ccomplete defense____\u201d <em>State Personnel Board v. Lloyd, </em>752 P.2d 559, 562 (Colo.1988). As the district court indicated in its grant of Martin\u2019s motion for judgment n.o.v., the district court had previously deferred ruling on pretrial motions to dismiss for failure to comply with the notice requirements of the Act until after trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">In considering this particular matter, it should be emphasized that we are only concerned with Mercer\u2019s seventh claim for relief,, i.e., a state claim for tortious interference with Mercer\u2019s contractual relationship with UNC. In that claim for relief, Mercer alleged that Martin wantonly and intentionally interfered with UNC\u2019s performance of a contract she had for \u201cmatriculation through the Ed. S. program at the University of Northern Colorado.\u201d As we understand it, the parties agree that Martin\u2019s memorandum of June 16, 1995, wherein she accused Mercer of several improprieties, including that of plagiarism, constituted, if untrue, \u201ctortious interference\u201d with Mercer\u2019s contractual relationship with UNC. Accordingly, Mercer\u2019s meeting with Praul and Copeland on June 20,1995, becomes critical.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-8\">As we understand it, at the meeting of June 20, 1995, Mercer became fully aware of Martin\u2019s various complaints about her school performance, including the accusation of plagiarism. Accordingly, the legal \u201cinjury\u201d was discovered by Mercer no later than June 20, 1995, when she met with Copeland and Praul. On that occasion, Mercer became fully aware of the fact that Martin, in her letter of June 16, 1995, accused her of plagiarism and circulated the letter to members of the school faculty. From our reading of the record, which includes the allegations contained in Martin\u2019s verified complaints, the June 20 meeting definitely involved, <em>inter alia, </em>a discussion concerning Martin\u2019s accusation of plagiarism, which the district court held triggered the notice requirement in the Act. January 12, 1996, is more than 180 days from June 20, 1995. In such circumstance, the district court, in our view, was justified in concluding that the notice requirements of the Act had not been met. In sum, on this particular matter we are not inclined to disturb the district court\u2019s understanding of Colorado law.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b942-13\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b945-5\">. Paragraphs 38 and 39 of Mercer\u2019s verified complaint reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-6\">38. On, or about, June 16, 1995, Defendant Copeland telephoned Plaintiff to inform her of a meeting between himself, Plaintiff and Defendant Praul, on June 20, 1995. During that telephone conversation Plaintiff was informed that Defendant Martin had accused her of plagiarism. In fact, Plaintiff had not plagiarized any work, and Defendant Martin either knew, or recklessly disregarded the truth, of Plaintiff\u2019s innocence of this allegation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-12\">39. On, or about, June 20, 1995, Plaintiff met with Defendant Copeland and Defendant Praul. Discussed was Plaintiff\u2019s concerns regarding her grade in PPSY 680 and the plagiarism charges. During this meeting, Plaintiff was told that she had wrongly created a \u201cdual relationship\u201d with Defendant Martin.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b946-10\">EBEL, Circuit Judge, dissenting in part</author>\n<p id=\"b946-11\">I agree with the majority\u2019s disposition of every issue except the last: whether the district court was correct to grant Martin\u2019s post-trial motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on Mercer\u2019s successful claim for $7,500 against Martin for tortious interference of contract. The district court entered judgment n.o.v. because it found that Mercer had failed to comply with the notice requirement of the Colorado Governmental Immunity Act (\u201cCGIA\u201d). <em>See </em>Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 24-10-109(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-12\">Unlike the majority, I would hold that Mercer complied with the notice provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>of the CGIA, and thus that the district court\u2019s entry of judgment n.o.v. should be reversed. Because it would have been impossible for Mercer to know or discover, in June 1995, that Martin\u2019s memorandum would ultimately lead to Mercer\u2019s dismissal from UNC, I believe the district court clearly erred in finding that Mercer had actual or constructive knowledge in June 1995 that she had been \u201cinjured\u201d sufficient to trigger the CGIA. <em>See Quintana v. City of Westminster, 8 </em>P.3d 527, 529 (Colo.App. 2000) (\u201c[T]he trial court\u2019s findings of fact supporting a determination under the [CGIA] will not be reversed unless clearly erroneous.\u201d). I would conclude that Mercer knew Martin had tortiously interfered with the contract between Mercer and UNC only when Mercer had actually been dismissed, <em>i.e., </em>on January 12, 1996. Since she filed her notice of intent to sue on that date, I would therefore find her notice timely under the CGIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-4\">The Colorado Supreme Court has interpreted the CGIA such that \u201cthe 180-day provision beg[ins] to run ... [when the complainant] ha[s] all the information necessary to fulfill the notice requirement of section 24-10-109(2).\u201d <em>City of Lafayette v. Barrack, </em>847 P.2d 136, 139 (Colo.1993). That section requires, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201ca concise statement of the factual basis of the claim, including the date, time, place, and circumstances of the act, omission, or event complained of\u2019 and \u201cthe name and address of any public employee involved.\u201d Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 24-10-109(2)(b), (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">Mercer could not have known or discovered that Martin\u2019s actions would lead to Mercer\u2019s termination until the faculty decided that academic probation had faded and she should be dismissed. That decision was not made until January 1996. Consequently, it was impossible for Mercer to give \u201ca concise statement of the factual basis of the claim, including the date, time, place and ... event complained of\u2019 and \u201cthe name and address of any public employee involved\u201d until she had in fact been expelled.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The 180-day provision began to run at that time, and it is undisputed that she filed her notice of intent to sue on January 12, 1996, making her filing unquestionably timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-8\">The district court\u2019s finding that \u201c[Mercer\u2019s] knowledge of the allegedly false charge of plagiarism in June 1995 was the date of discovery of injury under Section 24-10-109(1)\u201d is not supportable by the facts. This is most clearly shown by an example: Had Mercer, in early July 1995, shortly after the \u201cdate of discovery\u201d attributed to her by the district court, filed notice of intent to sue Martin for tortious interference of contract, her notice would have been so premature as to seem bizarre or paranoid. The reason is that during the summer and early fall of 1995, the program\u2019s faculty were still trying to help Mercer attain her degree. For instance, in a letter to Mercer dated August 29, 1995, Copeland explained that if, by December 8, 1995, she completed two outstanding conditions from the remedial plan on which the Department had placed her at the end of the Spring 1995 semester, she would be removed from academic probation and could sit for her comprehensive exams. <em>(See </em>App. at 1745.) In addition, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>a memorandum dated September 19, 1995, Copeland offered to place Mercer on another, slightly modified, remedial plan. <em>(See </em>App. at 1749.) Thus, three months after the June 20, 1995, meeting of Praul, Copeland, and Mercer, the underlying basis of Mercer\u2019s claim against Martin \u2014 that Martin wrongfully interfered with the contract between Mercer and UNC \u2014 had still not come to pass. While Mercer might have known of a defamation injury in June 1995, she could not have known of a tor-tious interference with contract injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">It was not until mid-October 1995 that members of the Department were recommending that Mercer be expelled from the program. <em>(See </em>App. at 1760.) And it was not until January 12, 1996, that Copeland sent Mercer a letter formally stating that the Department had recommended to UNC that Mercer be terminated \u2014 the event supporting Mercer\u2019s cause of action for tortious interference of contract. <em>(See </em>App. at 1786.) Thus, only at that point did Mercer have the information required to file properly a notice of intent to sue under the CGIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">For this reason, I would conclude the district court erred in granting Martin\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and would order the district court to reinstate the jury\u2019s award of $7,500. I respectfully dissent on this issue.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b947-6\">. While it is true that in mid-October 1995 the faculty was seriously considering whether to expel Mercer, <em>see </em>App. at 1760, this fact does not change the outcome. First, Mercer\u2019s claim against Martin for tortious interference of contract arose only after the faculty <em>actually decided </em>to terminate Mercer; the faculty might have decided not to expel Mercer even after seriously considering it. For instance, Mercer could not identify precisely <em>who </em>was involved in her termination, as required by \u00a7 24-10-109(2)(c), prior to the faculty\u2019s taking definitive action. Second, even if the 180-day clock began to run in mid-October 1995, Mercer\u2019s notice, filed in January 1996, would still be timely.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
