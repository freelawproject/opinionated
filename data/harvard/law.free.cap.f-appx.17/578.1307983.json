R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b606-17\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-18\">Amel Andrews appeals his conviction and 92-month sentence following his guilty plea to armed bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) and (d). Defendant\u2019s attorney has moved to withdraw pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and Andrews has not filed a supplemental pro se brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-22\">The <em>Anders </em>brief identifies and rejects four potential issues. First, counsel correctly acknowledges that there is no indication that Andrews\u2019 guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary. <em>See United States v. Aguilar-Muniz, </em>156 F.3d 974, 976-77 (9th Cir.1998) (discussing district court\u2019s compliance with Rule 11).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-23\">Second, counsel concludes that the district court provided an adequate statement of reasons for Andrews\u2019 sentence. The district court\u2019s explanation for sentencing Andrews to the low end of a 23-month guideline range was more than sufficient. <em>See United States v. Howard, </em>894 F.2d 1085, 1092 (9th Cir.1990) (stating that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1) requires a statement of reasons only where the guideline range is greater than 24 months).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-24\">Third, counsel raises, and correctly rejects as an issue for appeal, the district court\u2019s denial of a downward departure for overrepresented criminal history. That discretionary ruling is unreviewable. <em>See United States v. Wetchie, </em>207 F.3d 632, 636 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 854, 121 S.Ct. 134, 148 L.Ed.2d 87 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-25\">Finally, to the extent that counsel seeks review of Andrews\u2019 criminal history score, we see no plain error in the district court\u2019s calculation. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Cavasos, </em>915 F.2d 474, 475 (9th Cir.1990) (applying plain error review).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-26\">Our independent review of the record pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 83, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988) discloses no issues for review. Counsel\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and the district court\u2019s judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b606-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
