Fairchild\u2019s claim under California Business and Professions Code section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>17200 for unfair business practices. Defendants argue that the district court erred in finding that Plaintiffs claim did not require interpretation of the parties\u2019 contract and was not arbitrable.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">The contract at issue here involves a transaction in interstate commerce and is subject to the Federal Arbitration Act. <em>Allied-Bruce Terminix Companies, Inc. v. Dobson, </em>513 U.S. 265, 273-75, 115 S.Ct. 834, 130 L.Ed.2d 753 (1995). We have jurisdiction under 9 U.S.C. section 16(a)(1)(B). <em>See Three Valleys Municipal Water District v. E.F. Hutton &amp; Company, Inc., </em>925 F.2d 1136, 1138 (9th Cir.1991) (acknowledging jurisdiction over appeal from the portion of district court\u2019s order refusing to compel arbitration of plaintiffs\u2019 federal securities laws claims).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">We review a denial of a motion to compel arbitration <em>de novo. United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Union, Local 770 v. Geldin Meat Co., </em>13 F.3d 1365, 1368 (9th Cir.1994). Like any interpretation of a contractual provision, a determination regarding arbitrability is subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>Simula, Inc. v. Autoliv, Inc., </em>175 F.3d 716, 719 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">As the parties are familiar with the facts, we discuss only those necessary to our determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">Fairchild, doing business as Fairchild Construction (\u201cBuilder\u201d), entered into a contract with Home Buyers Warranty Corporation, doing business as Home Buyers Warranty (\u201cService\u201d), entitled \u201cBuilder Proposal and Agreement\u201d (\u201cBPA\u201d). Once accepted into the Service\u2019s structural coverage program, Fairchild was able to enroll its homebuyer(s) in the program. The Service would provide insurance-backed Structural Warranty Coverage to the Builder, which would benefit the Builder\u2019s homebuyer(s). Defendant National Home Insurance Company was an express third party beneficiary to the terms and conditions of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-11\">Two provisions of the Builder Proposal and Agreement address arbitrability. The BPA provides in the introductory \u201cGeneral Concept\u201d section: \u201cIf any dispute arises between the Homebuyer(s),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Builder and the Service or Insurance Company as to satisfactory compliance with the warranty documents, construction standards or any resulting repairs, all such disputes shall be resolved through, conciliation between the parties or arbitration .... \u201d Section VII of the Structural Defect Limited Warranty Coverage section, moreover, requires conciliation or arbitration \u201c[sjhould the Builder or Homebuyer(s) disagree with the Insurer\u2019s decision to deny the claim as recommended by the Service <em>if</em></p>\n<p id=\"b660-13\">Although the district court quoted both provisions in the BPA, it appeared to rely only on the first one, finding that Plaintiffs unfair business practices claim did not require interpretation of the contractual relationship between defendants and plaintiff, and thus was not arbitrable, citing <em>Tracer Research Corp. v. National Environmental Services Company, </em>42 F.3d 1292 (9th Cir.1994) (addressing \u201carising under\u201d and \u201carising out of\u2019 language in arbitration provision).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-14\">In <em>Tracer, </em>we relied on our earlier decision in <em>Mediterranean Enterprises, Inc. v. Ssangyong Corp., </em>708 F.2d 1458 (9th Cir. 1983), which \u201cnarrowly circumscribe[d] the interpretation to be given this clause.\u201d 42 F.3d at 1295. In <em>Mediterranean, </em>we found the clause requiring arbitration of \u201c[a]ny disputes arising hereunder\u201d to be narrower than one requiring arbitration of a dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>pute \u201carising out of or relating to this agreement.\u201d 708 F.2d at 1464. Noting the Supreme Court\u2019s view in <em>Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood &amp; Conklin Mfg. Co., </em>388 U.S. 395, 398, 87 S.Ct. 1801, 18 L.Ed.2d 1270 (1967), that \u201carising out of or relating to this agreement\u201d was a \u201cbroad arbitration clause[,]\u201d we found the omission of those disputes \u201crelating to\u201d the agreement to be significant. Thus, the phrase \u201carising hereunder,\u201d without more, covers \u201ca much narrower scope of disputes, <em>ie., </em>only those relating to the interpretation and performance of the contract itself.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">In <em>Tracer, </em>the claim for misappropriation of trade secrets, a tort, did not constitute a wrong independent of any breach of the licensing and nondisclosure agreements involved in that case. As a result, the claim did not require interpretation of the contract and was not arbitrable under <em>Mediterranean Enterprises. </em>42 F.3d at 1295.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">The district court here found the language \u201carising] ... as to\u201d to be as limiting as that in <em>Tracer. </em>Order at 12. The court stated that it could \u201conly compel arbitration of allegations in plaintiffs complaint that necessitate interpretation of the contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Plaintiff had alleged in the unfair competition claim \u201cthat defendants routinely fail to provide builders with coverage under similar policies[,]\u201d and did not require \u201cinterpretation of the contractual relationship between defendants and plaintiff. ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">Since <em>Tracer, </em>we have held that the clause \u201carising in connection with,\u201d unlike <em>Tracer\u2019s </em>\u201carising under\u201d or other clauses stating \u201carising out of,\u201d should and would be interpreted broadly. Once it was decided that the arbitration clause should be interpreted broadly, the factual allegations in the complaint \u201cneed only \u2018touch matters\u2019 covered by the contract containing the arbitration clause and all doubts are to be resolved in favor of arbitrability.\u201d <em>Simu-la, Inc. v. Autoliv, Inc., </em>175 F.3d at 721 (quoting <em>Mitsubishi Motors v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., </em>473 U.S. 614, 624 n. 13, 105 S.Ct. 3346, 87 L.Ed.2d 444 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">We find that under the General Concept provision addressing conciliation and dispute resolution, Fairchild\u2019s claim for unfair competition must be ordered to arbitration. Although this provision in the BPA does not contain the broadest possible terms, that is, \u201carising out of or related to,\u201d \u201cregarding,\u201d \u201cconcerning,\u201d or, as noted above, \u201cin connection with,\u201d the language \u201carises ... as to\u201d is not unduly narrow. By the same token, however, the relevant provisions contain limiting language, requiring that the dispute arise \u201cas to satisfactory compliance with the warranty documents, construction standards or any resulting repairs[.]\u201d In contrast, the arbitration clause in <em>Tracer </em>covered any controversy or claim arising out of \u201cthis Agreement.\u201d 42 F.3d at 1295. In <em>Simula, </em>the clause also covered all disputes arising in connection with \u201cthis Agreement.\u201d 175 F.3d at 720. In <em>Mediterranean Enterprises, </em>the arbitration listed any disputes arising hereunder \u201cor following the formation of joint venture.\u201d 708 F.2d at 1461. The arbitration clause here thus ends up midway on the continuum, broader in one respect, limiting in the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">Here, we conclude that Plaintiff has pleaded his unfair competition cause of action so as to require reference to, if not outright interpretation of, the terms of the BPA. Fairchild alleges that HBW and NHIC have violated Business and Professions Code section 17200 by failing to provide builders with \u201cthe coverage afforded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>under the Policy and other similar policies issued to other builder insureds\u201d despite the fact the claims \u201care clearly covered.\u201d Defendants are also alleged to have \u201crais[ed] policy language\u201d to exclude coverage and that defendants\u2019 \u201cinterpretation of the Policy makes coverage illusory.\u201d Complaint, 1133. Unlike the situation in <em>Tracer, </em>where the misappropriation of trade secrets count was not predicated on any breach of the licensing agreement between the parties, the gravamen of Fair-child\u2019s unfair competition claim is defendants\u2019 improper interpretation of the BPA and refusal to perform their obligations thereunder. More than merely \u201ctouching matters\u201d covered by the BPA, the factual allegations in Fairchild\u2019s unfair competition cause of action are integrally related to defendants\u2019 \u201ccompliance with the warranty documents.\u201d We conclude that the unfair competition claim falls within the scope of the first arbitration provision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We therefore reverse the district court\u2019s order denying Defendants\u2019 motion to compel arbitration of the third cause of action and remand for further proceedings consistent with this disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b659-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b660-8\">. The homebuyers are not parties to this action. Their lawsuit against plaintiff prompted the claim for defense and indemnification that plaintiff submitted to defendants, the denial of which gave rise to the instant action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b662-6\">. Our conclusion obviates the need to decide whether the claim falls within the scope of the provision in Section VII of the BPA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
