For the reasons that follow, we affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">McCrorey alleges that the district court erred by allowing the prosecution to enter into evidence the fact that some of its witnesses were testifying pursuant to plea agreements. We do not find that the district court abused its discretion by admitting this evidence. <em>United States v. Henderson, </em>717 F.2d 135, 137-38 (4th Cir. 1983). Neither do we find that the Government improperly vouched for or bolstered the testimony of these witnesses. <em>United States v. Sanchez, </em>118 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1997). Finally, we do not find that the district court abused its discretion in sustaining the Government\u2019s objection to limit inquiry into witness Clifford Hoyles\u2019 pending forgery charges. <em>United States v. Bostain, </em>59 F.3d 474, 480 (4th Cir.1995) (stating standard of review). McCrorey does not contest the validity of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">Accordingly, we affirm McCrorey\u2019s conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
