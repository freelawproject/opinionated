Carey, </em>194 F.R.D. 476 (S.D.N.Y.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">On January 2, 1996, Selletti brought suit in district court, claiming that defendant-appellee Mariah Carey had plagiarized in her song \u201cHero\u201d an unpublished poem Sel-letti had allegedly written. On June 26, 1997, the district court dismissed Selletti\u2019s complaint as a sanction for Selletti\u2019s failure to pay previous monetary sanctions \u2014 -a $5,000 sanction and $50,000 security bond for litigation costs \u2014 imposed for Selletti\u2019s violation of the district court\u2019s discovery orders. On appeal from that dismissal and the underlying order of monetary sanctions, we held that the monetary sanctions were within the district court\u2019s discretion, but that the district court erred in dismissing the action for failure to pay the sanctions without first considering Selletti\u2019s ability to pay. <em>See Selletti v. Carey, </em>173 F.3d 104, 111 (2d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">On remand, the district court directed Selletti to produce a host of documents as evidence of his financial circumstances and thus the extent of his ability to pay the monetary sanctions. Selletti produced only some of the required documents and did so after the deadline imposed by the district court. In an order dated July 27, 2000, the district court again dismissed Selletti\u2019s complaint, citing three independent grounds: (1) Selletti\u2019s misconduct throughout the proceedings, independent of his failure to pay the monetary sanctions; (2) his conduct in response to the court\u2019s order to produce financial records; and (3) the court\u2019s conclusion that, based on the records produced by Selletti and his own admissions, he was financially able to pay the monetary sanctions. <em>See Selletti, </em>194 F.R.D. at 478-79. Selletti appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">We review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s use of dismissal as a sanction. <em>See Selletti </em>173 F.3d at 110. We review any underlying findings of fact for clear error. <em>See Mackler Prods., Inc. v. Cohen, </em>225 F.3d 136, 141 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-10\">Whether viewed individually or collectively, the grounds cited by the district court would justify the present dismissal. In our prior decision, we noted that Sellet-ti\u2019s conduct in continuously delaying the proceedings in the district court, abusing the discovery process, and otherwise failing to expeditiously prosecute his case would be sufficient to justify dismissal as a sanction. Our concern lay only with the district court\u2019s refusal to consider Selletti\u2019s plea of poverty as an excuse for his failure to pay the monetary sanctions. <em>See Sellet-ti, </em>173 F.3d at 111-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-11\">The district court\u2019s justifications for its dismissal more than adequately addresses the concerns raised in our prior opinion. Indeed, all of the reasons for dismissal advanced by the district court fall within the allowable bases of dismissal that we indicated in our opinion: \u201cOn remand, the district court may consider whether dismissal is appropriate based on a finding that plaintiff was in fact able to pay the sanctions or post the required bond; [or] based on plaintiffs overall conduct apart from his noncompliance with those requirements ....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>Given the evidence that Selletti\u2019s income and assets were ample, even without reliance on the records that Selletti improperly withheld from the court, Sellettti cannot show that the court clearly erred in concluding that Selletti was able to pay the $5,000 sanction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Moreover, Selletti\u2019s longstanding and egregious pattern of delay, obstruction, and simple inaction, which we found previously to \u201cweigh heavily in favor of dismissal,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 111, also put the district court well within the bounds of its discretion in dismissing the complaint. That pattern is only reinforced by Selletti\u2019s conduct after our remand, which, whether considered alone or in the aggregate with his previous conduct, would justify the district court\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">We have considered the balance of Sel-letti\u2019s arguments and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b49-7\">. We believe that the finding that Selletti could have paid the $5,000 sanction was sufficient to justify dismissal, whether or not he could also have obtained the $50,000 bond.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
