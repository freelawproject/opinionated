Coombe, </em>90-CV-252 (N.D.N.Y. May 4, 2000). Selby alleges that defendants-ap-pellees violated his Eighth Amendment rights (as secured by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985) by failing to give him adequate medical treatment for his hernia and HIV. On July 31, 2000, this Court remanded Selby\u2019s appeal; it was unclear whether the district court\u2019s judgment was a final ap-pealable order, as the district court had previously consolidated Selby\u2019s case with an ongoing class action alleging deficient medical treatment for New York prisoners with HIV. On August 21, 2000, the district court held that its May 4 grant of summary judgment was a final appealable order. We subsequently reinstated Selby\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-19\">In <em>Chance v. Armstrong, </em>143 F.3d 698 (2d Cir.1998), we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-20\">In order to establish an Eighth Amendment claim arising out of inadequate medical care, a prisoner must prove deliberate indifference to [his] serious medical needs. The standard of deliberate indifference includes both subjective and objective components. First, the alleged deprivation must be, in objective terms, \u201csufficiently serious.\u201d Second, the defendant must act with a sufficiently culpable state of mind. An official acts with the requisite deliberate indifference when that official knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety; the official must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also draw the inference.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-21\"><em>Id. </em>at 702 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-22\">Even assuming that the alleged deprivation of medical care is \u201csufficiently serious\u201d, we agree with the district court that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether the defendants-appellees treated Selby\u2019s medical problems with \u201cdeliberate indifference.\u201d Our review of the record confirms that Selby received regular and capable medical care. <em>See id. </em>at 703 (\u201cSo long as the treatment given is adequate, the fact that a prisoner might prefer a different treatment does not give rise to an Eighth Amendment violation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
