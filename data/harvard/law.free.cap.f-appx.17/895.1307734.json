R.App. P. 34(a)(2);' 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-13\">Manuel Edmundo Sanchez-Dominguez, a federal prisoner proceeding pro se, requests a certificate of appealability to appeal the denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 habeas petition. We deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-14\">In 1994, Sanchez-Dominguez was deported from the United States to Mexico following a drug conviction. In 1998, he was convicted of illegal reentry after deportation, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2), and was sentenced to eighty-four months\u2019 imprisonment. Sanchez-Dominguez did not file a timely notice of appeal, but on July 15, 1999, he wrote to the district court inquiring whether his attorney had filed a notice of appeal. On September 27, 1999, his attorney filed a motion to allow the filing of an untimely notice of appeal, which was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-17\">Sanchez-Dominguez filed his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 petition on August 7, 2000, asserting (1) ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to object to the indictment on double jeopardy grounds, failure to move for a jury trial, failure to challenge his prior state conviction, failure to challenge his prior deportation order, failure to investigate and assert extraordinary circumstances as a basis for downward departure, and failure to appeal the denial of the request for downward departure; (2) his conviction and sentence violated the ruling in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000); and (3) his conviction and sentence did not comply with the provisions of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 850 for charging prior convictions for defendants charged with having prior drug convictions. The district court found Sanchez-Dominguez failed to satisfy either prong of the test to review ineffective assistance of counsel claims set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). The court further determined his claim under <em>Apprendi </em>lacked merit because his sentence was enhanced on the basis of a prior conviction. <em>See </em>530 U.S. at 487-88. The court determined that Sanchez-Dominguez apparently intended to cite 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 in his final allegation, but that \u00a7 851 applied \u201conly to charging and proving prior drug offenses for statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>penalty enhancement purposes in connection with new drug offenses.\u201d Order at 8. The court denied the petition and subsequently denied a certificate of appealability-</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">In his opening brief, Sanchez-Dominguez contends his \u201c[c]ounsel\u2019s performance was deficient for failing to raise [the] issue of \u2018cultural assimilation\u2019 \u201d as a ground for downward departure on appeal, and \u201c[a]p-pellant was prejudiced thereby because [the] issue was not appealed.\u201d Br. at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">To establish substantial denial of a constitutional right based on ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJy\">[f]irst, ... [that] counsel committed serious errors so as to not be functioning as the \u201ccounsel\u201d provided by the Sixth Amendment. To determine whether counsel\u2019s performance comported with the Sixth Amendment, the inquiry is whether the attorney\u2019s conduct is reasonable in light of all the circumstances of the case. This is an objective standard based on whether the reasonable defense attorney would act in the same manner as the defense counsel in the situation being analyzed. Second, it must be shown that counsel\u2019s performance was prejudicial to the defense. The defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b925-7\"><em>United States v. Voigt, </em>877 F.2d 1465, 1467-68 (10th Cir.1989) (citing <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687-88, 694) (internal quotations omitted). While Sanchez-Dominguez asserted several ineffective assistance arguments in the district court, his only assertion on appeal is counsel\u2019s failure to appeal the court\u2019s denial of a downward departure based on cultural assimilation. Therefore, the other ineffective assistance arguments are deemed waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">\u201cOur review of a sentencing court\u2019s refusal to grant a downward departure is narrow.\u201d <em>United States v. Browning, </em>252 F.3d 1153, 1160 (10th Cir.2001).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-9\">[Cjourts of appeals cannot exercise jurisdiction to review a sentencing court\u2019s refusal to depart from the sentencing guidelines except in the very rare circumstance that the district court states that it does not have any authority to depart from the sentencing guideline range for the entire class of circumstances proffered by the defendant.... This exception does not apply when a sentencing court concludes under the defendant\u2019s particular circumstances that it does not have the authority to depart.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b925-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 1160-61 (citing <em>United States v. Castillo, </em>140 F.3d 874, 887 (10th Cir.1998)). Here, the district court recognized that it had the authority to grant a downwai\u2019d departure based on cultural assimilation but elected not to do so. The court\u2019s decision not to grant the motion for downward departure was therefore not appeal-able. <em>See id. </em>Counsel\u2019s failure to engage in a frivolous appeal cannot be considered ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-11\">Sanchez-Dominguez has not \u201cmade a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). We DENY a certificate of appealability and DISMISS the appeal. The motion to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal is DENIED. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b924-15\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
