On July 27, 1998, appellant perfected his state post-conviction proceeding application in state court. After multiple additional filings by appellant, the state finally responded to appellant\u2019s post-conviction application on March 10, 1999. Shortly thereafter, on April 6, 1999, appellant filed a reply to the state\u2019s response.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>Frustrated with the length of time the state court was taking in assessing his post-conviction application, appellant sought to file a petition for writ of mandamus in the state court. Appellant received a letter dated July 8, 1999, from the clerk of the Tulsa County courthouse informing him that his petition had been received and filed that day and that the clerk was \u201cconfused by the summons and did not issue or serve it.\u201d (R. Doc. 10 Ex. D.) The letter further explained that the clerk was under the impression that appellant wanted to file a criminal suit, not a civil one, and that summonses are not employed in criminal suits. Additionally, the letter stated that although \u201cour office can issue a summons for you, we do not serve them.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Thompson promptly wrote back, and in a letter of July 19,1999, he informed the clerk that he wished the mandamus petition to be filed \u201cinto the records of the civil court procedure\u201d and that he needed the clerk to issue a summons. <em>(Id. </em>Ex. E.) The clerk responded two days later, informing appellant that he needed to complete a pauper\u2019s affidavit, enclosing the proper forms for his completion, and directing him to the Oklahoma Pleading Code, OMa.Stat.Ann. tit. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 2001 <em>et seq., </em>for assistance in litigating his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">On August 2, 1999, appellant\u2019s petition for writ of mandamus was filed with the Tulsa County district court. Seven days later, on August 9, 1999, appellant submitted the petition for writ of mandamus, along with the summonses issued by the court, to the mail room at the OMahoma State Penitentiary (\u201cOSP\u201d) and requested that they be sent out by certified mail. According to appellant, the mail room denied his request for use of certified mail, informed him the documents would be sent by first class mail, and sent him a \u201cverbal message stating that there will be a legal showing upon the penitentiary mail log, that the petitions were mailed.\u201d (R. Doc. 2 at 4.) After a series of grievances and requests to staff filed by appellant asserting his need for certified mail and a series of responses by prison officials informing appellant, essentially, that the relevant prison regulation does not provide for free certified mailing privileges in appellant\u2019s circumstances, appellant brought the instant suit in federal district court against Gary Gibson, OSP Warden, in his individual or official capacity alleging violations of his constitutional rights. Specifically, he alleged that (1) defendant deliberately denied him meaningful access to the courts in violation of his rights under the Eighth Amendment<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (2) defendant discriminated against appellant on the basis of Ms indigent status in violation of Ms right to equal protection' under the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">In an October 2000 order, the federal district court for the Eastern District of OMahoma dismissed appellant\u2019s case as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e) because appellant failed to allege actual injury and his complaint was vague and eonclusory. The court also held that appellant\u2019s claims against the defendant m his official capacity were barred by the Eleventh Amendment. It is the federal district court\u2019s dismissal of appellant\u2019s civil constitutional action that is at issue in the rnstant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b783-10\">In this Court, appellant argues (1) that the district court deprived him of due process of law and (2) that the district court abused its discretion m dismissing his case as frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>Appellant\u2019s first claim arises from appellee\u2019s failure to file a response to appellant\u2019s Summary Judgment motion of October 24, 2000, and the district court\u2019s alleged failure to consider appellee\u2019s lack of response in the proper light according to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(e). This argument is meritless. By its express terms, Rule 56(e) does not require a response from the adverse party in every instance. The Rule states, \u201cIf the adverse party does not so respond, summary judgment, <em>if appropriate, </em>shall be entered against the adverse party.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e) (emphasis added). In other words, even if the adverse party does not respond, summary judgment in favor of the moving party may still be inappropriate. Moreover, in its order dismissing appellant\u2019s complaint, the court explicitly noted that the action was before it \u201con defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, plaintiffs motion for summary judgment, and the court\u2019s own motion to consider dismissal of the case as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915.\u201d (R. Doc. 12 at 1.) Five months before appellant filed his summary judgment motion, appel-lee filed a motion to dismiss. It was upon this earlier motion and the court\u2019s own motion that appellant\u2019s suit was dismissed. As a matter of basic civil procedure, in order for a court to rule on a summary judgment motion, the suit must first make it past the pleadings stage. Because appellant\u2019s suit was dismissed on the pleadings, the court did not violate appellant\u2019s rights by allegedly failing to handle the summary judgment motion and appellee\u2019s lack of response to such motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">Regarding appellant\u2019s second claim, we first note that we review the district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted de novo. <em>Curley v. Perry, </em>246 F.3d 1278, 1281 (10th Cir.2001).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Employing that standard, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of appellant\u2019s suit. Appellant argues, inter alia, that he was denied access to the courts because under OMa.Stat.Ann. tit. 28, \u00a7 152, indigent inmates are permitted to litigate without costs and thus the court clerk should have served his summons for him. Additionally, appellant claims that appellee hindered his efforts to seek meaningful access to court by failing to inform him of his options \u2014 i.e., the option to seek a court order stating that he needed certified mail to serve the defendants \u2014 and that appellee discriminated against appellant on the basis of his indigent status.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">In order to state a claim for denial of access to the courts and means to effectuate such access in violation of the Constitution, <em>Bounds v. Smith, </em>430 U.S. 817, 828, 97 S.Ct. 1491, 52 L.Ed.2d 72 (1977), a prisoner must demonstrate actual injury, <em>Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 349, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996). After carefully reviewing the record and appellant\u2019s brief, it appears that his asserted injuries are delay in access to the courts and inability to effectuate proper service by mail according to OMa.Stat.Ann. tit. 12, \u00a7 2004(C)(2). We conclude the delay was due in large part to appellant\u2019s own actions. Although it is true the court clerk informed appellant she would not serve his summons, she told him this when she thought he was trying to file the mandamus petition in his criminal action. Despite the fact that the clerk later informed appellant his pauper\u2019s affidavit was deficient and sent him the proper forms to complete, the record does not show he completed those forms so as to establish his indigence for purposes of \u00a7 152. Instead, appellant apparently resorted pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>maturely to the OSP grievance procedure \u2014 this is neither the fault of the clerk nor of appellee. Appellant also fails to allege actual injury from appellee\u2019s refusal to mail his summons from the petition for mandamus by certified mail. He does not allege \u2014 and the record does not establish \u2014 that service by first class mail was actually ineffective, nor that defendant challenged the summons as ineffective because it was served via first class mail instead of certified mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">We have liberally construed plaintiffs pro se briefs and the record before us; like the district court, we are unable to conclude plaintiff alleged actual injury sufficient to support his claim of denial of access to the courts. We therefore AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of appellant\u2019s \u00a7 1983 suit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Finally, we remind appellant that he is obligated to continue making partial payments on his costs and fees pursuant to the district court\u2019s February 9, 2001, order.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b782-13\">The case is unanimously ordered submitted without oral argument pursuant to Fed. R.App.P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir.R. 34.1(G). This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The Court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir.R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b783-6\">. Appellant listed as a separate count emotional injuries from his denial of access to the courts in violation of the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b784-6\">. Appellant's statement of the issue indicates his belief that we review the district court\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion. The de novo standard of review provides appellant with a greater chance for relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b785-9\">. Because we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of appellant\u2019s complaint as vague and conclusory, we need not address whether the Eleventh Amendment bars appellant\u2019s suit against appellee in his official capacity.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
