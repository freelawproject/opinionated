Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b699-22\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b699-23\">Defendant Jose Alfredo Estrada (\u201cEstrada\u201d) appeals his 120-month sentence. We dismiss his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-24\">Estrada contends that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing because his attorney suffered from an actual conflict of interest. Estrada claims that but for the conflict, he would have received a significant reduction in sentence. The government responds that Estrada is barred from bringing this appeal because Estrada waived his right to appeal his sentence in his plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>An examination of the plea agreement shows that Estrada waived his right to directly appeal his sentence. Estrada does not allege that his attorney\u2019s alleged conflict of interest adversely affected his decision to plead guilty, or otherwise resulted in an unknowing and involuntary waiver of his right to appeal. <em>See United States v. Mett, </em>65 F.3d 1531, 1534 (9th Cir.1995) (stating that the alleged conflict of interest must \u201cadversely affect[ ] ... lawyer\u2019s performance\u201d). Estrada\u2019s plea agreement, therefore, is valid and his appeal waiver enforceable. <em>See United States v. Petty, </em>80 F.3d 1384, 1386-87 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">By entering into the valid plea agreement, Estrada waived his right \u201cto argue ineffective assistance of counsel involving the sentencing issue on direct appeal, because an appeal that includes an ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing argument is still an appeal from one\u2019s sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Nunez, </em>223 F.3d 956, 959 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Under the terms of the plea agreement, Estrada may argue ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing in collateral proceedings. This dismissal is without prejudice to any such proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b699-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
