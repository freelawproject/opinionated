The district court found that \u201cno show cause order to respondents [was] required\u201d and dismissed the petition. R. doc. 4, at 2. We have jurisdiction under \u00a7 2253(a) and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-15\">While imprisoned in a Kansas state prison, Mr. Bridges was charged with four counts of violating federal drug laws. The federal district court issued a writ of habe-as corpus ad prosequendum on May 29, 1998. On June 1 or 2, the U.S. Marshals Service filed a detainer against Mr. Bridges with the Kansas Department of Corrections. Pet. Br. ex. A. Mr. Bridges pleaded guilty to three of the four counts and received 175 months of imprisonment for the first two counts and 120 of months imprisonment for the third count, to be served concurrently. His sentence was affirmed. <em>United, States v. Bridges, </em>216 F.3d 1088, 2000 WL 796079, at *1 (10th Cir.2000). According to Mr. Bridges, he began serving his federal sentence in the El Reno, Oklahoma federal prison, but was then transferred back to Kansas state prison. R. doc. 1, at 3-4, 5-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-16\">In his petition, Mr. Bridges requested that he be \u201cset at liberty\u201d because both his state and federal convictions were of no \u201cfurther cause and effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9. Mr. Bridges argued that his federal conviction should be vacated under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act (\u201cIADA\u201d); K.S.A. \u00a7 22-4401 (Kansas version), 18 U.S.C.App. 2 \u00a7 2 (federal version), because he was not immediately returned to state prison after sentencing. He also argued that he was constructively pardoned of his federal conviction when he was returned to state prison. Finally, Mr. Bridges asserted that Kansas lost custody once the federal government obtained temporary custody.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b848-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>The district court treated Mr. Bridges\u2019 petition as brought by a federal prisoner.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court found that Mr. Bridges was returned to state prison after his federal sentence was imposed, R. doc. 4, at 1, and held that the IADA was not applicable because Mr. Bridges\u2019 appearance in federal court was secured by a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum, not a detainer. <em>Id. </em>at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">We review the district court\u2019s dismissal of Mr. Bridges\u2019 \u00a7 2241 petition de novo. <em>Patterson v. Knowles, </em>162 F.3d 574, 575 (10th Cir.1998). Having reviewed Mr. Bridges\u2019 petition, the district court\u2019s order, the record, and Mr. Bridges\u2019 brief on appeal, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Mr. Bridges\u2019 petition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The IADA is not applicable to Mr. Bridges\u2019 claim. While the federal government was required to return Mr. Bridges to the Kansas state prison \u201c[a]t the earliest practicable time,\u201d 18 U.S.C.App. 2 \u00a7 2, Art. V(e); <em>see also </em>K.S.A. \u00a7 22-4401, Art. V(e), and had temporary custody of Mr. Bridges \u201conly for the purpose of permitting prosecution on the ... charges contained in [the] indictment ],\u201d 18 U.S.CApp. Art. V(d); <em>see also </em>K.S.A. \u00a7 22-4401, Art. V(d), the IADA does not require that Mr. Bridges\u2019 conviction be vacated merely because he allegedly served a portion of his federal sentence before being transferred back to state prison. <em>Cf. Alabama v. Bozeman, </em>121 S.Ct. 2079, 2082, 150 L.Ed.2d 188 (2001) (holding that literal language of Article IV(e) of IADA bars further criminal proceedings where prisoner is brought to receiving state for arraignment and returned to the sending state the following day).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">Mr. Bridges\u2019 remaining two claims are meritless. The federal government did not constructively pardon Mr. Bridges or commute his federal sentence when he was returned to state prison. <em>Cf. Shields v. Beto, </em>370 F.2d 1003, 1005-06 (5th Cir.1967) (a pre-IADA case cited by Mr. Bridges; holding that \u201cthe extraditing of [the prisoner] to Louisiana authorities and the release by Texas of the prisoner before expiration of his sentence constituted a waiver of jurisdiction over [the prisoner], especially where the surrendering sovereign (Texas) showed no interest in the return of the prisoner, either by agreement between the sovereigns, by detainer, or any other affirmative action taken by it following his release in Louisiana. A prisoner cannot be required to serve his sentence in installments.\u201d (citation omitted)). Nor did Kansas relinquish any rights when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>it turned Mr. Bridges over to the federal government. Not surprisingly, Mr. Bridges has failed to cite any pertinent authority for either proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">Accordingly, Mr. Bridges\u2019 petition is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b847-17\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. This court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b847-18\">. Mr. Bridges also appears to have com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>plained of First, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment violations during his incarceration in federal prison. R. doc. 1, at 7-8. Because these claims do not challenge the fact or duration of custody, but rather the conditions of Mr. Bridges\u2019 confinement, they are \"properly raised under <em>Bivens </em>and not in habeas.\u201d <em>Boyce v. Ashcroft, </em>251 F.3d 911, 918 (10th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b848-6\">. Because Mr. Bridges also challenges the fact or duration of his state sentence, R. doc. 1, at 7, his petition could be treated as brought by a state prisoner. If Mr. Bridges' petition is so treated, a certificate of appeala-bility (\"COA\u201d) is required. <em>Montez v. McKin-na, </em>208 F.3d 862, 867 (10th Cir.2000). Because the district court did not address whether a COA should issue, the district court is deemed to have denied the COA. Emergency General Order of October 1, 1996. To obtain a COA on appeal, Mr. Bridges is required to make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). He has failed to make this showing. Accordingly, whether Mr. Bridges\u2019 petition is treated as brought by a state prisoner or a federal prisoner, as explained <em>infra, </em>our conclusion is the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b848-11\">. We decline to consider Mr. Bridges\u2019 argument that \"he should be credited for time served since his arrival at C.C.A. on his federal case,\u201d Pet. Br. at 4, because he failed to raise the argument before the district court. <em>Walker v. Mather (In re Walker), </em>959 F.2d 894, 896 (10th Cir.1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
