Kesling entered a guilty plea to possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (West Supp. 2000), and received a sentence of thirty months\u2019 imprisonment. He contends on appeal the district court erred in finding his prior West Virginia conviction for first degree sexual abuse in violation of W. Va.Code \u00a7 61-8B-7 was a crime of vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>lence and in increasing his base offense level as a result. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">The federal sentencing guidelines applicable to a \u00a7 922(g)(1) conviction provide a base offense level of twenty if the defendant has one prior felony conviction that is a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A)(1998). The term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d, as used in USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A), is defined in USSG \u00a7 4B1.2(a), as \u201cany offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or ... otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d \u00a7 4B1.2(a). The determination as to whether an offense is a crime of violence is a question of law that this Court reviews de novo. <em>United States v. Martin, </em>215 F.3d 470, 472 (4th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Kesling was convicted of sexual contact without consent and by forcible compulsion with a fourteen or fifteen year old boy. We find the district court correctly held this offense, considered in the abstract, is a crime of violence within the meaning of \u00a7 4B1.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Kesling also contends he was entitled to the six-level downward specific characteristic adjustment for possession of a weapon for lawful sporting or collection purposes pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(2). The district court correctly found Kesling was ineligible for this adjustment, since it is unavailable to one convicted of a prior crime of violence under \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">Accordingly, we affirm Kesling\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in- the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
