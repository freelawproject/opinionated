We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">Mr. Paalan, a former petty officer of the United States Navy, is currently serving a life sentence for murder and other offenses at the United States Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Doc. 32 at 1; Doc. 30, Ex. 4(B) at 2; Doc. 26, Ex. D. The following chronology sets forth all facts relevant to our analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-7\">\u2022 February 12, 1991: Mr. Paalan extends his term of service, postponing his anticipated End of Active Obligated Service (\u201cEAOS\u201d) date to November 28, 1995. Doc. 26, Ex. A at 2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-8\">\u2022 Early August 1995: Mr. Paalan takes terminal leave and receives a Certificate of Discharge, which lists his separation date as October 31, 1995. Doc. 26, Ex. B.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-9\">\u2022 October 11,1995: Mr. Paalan is apprehended by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (\u201cNCIS\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-10\">\u2022 October 16,1995: Mr. Paalan is placed on \u201clegal hold\u201d status. <em>See </em>Doc. 32 at 3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-11\">\u2022 November 28, 1995: Anticipated EAOC. Mr. Paalaris service is \u201cinvoluntarily extended ... pending trial by court-martial.\u201d Doc. 26, Ex. C; <em>see also id., </em>Ex. E.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-16\">\u2022 April 17, 1995: Mr. Paalan pleads guilty and is sentenced to life in prison. <em>Id., </em>Ex. D.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-17\">\u2022 January 29-July 3, 1997: Prison officials allegedly withhold necessary heart medication from Mr. Paalan, resulting in a variety of physical problems and culminating in a heart attack. Doc. 1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-18\">\u2022 December 17, 1998: Pursuant to <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), Mr. Paalan files this action in federal court. Doc. 1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b959-19\">Mr. Paalaris complaint sought $2,000,000 in damages, transfer to a medical facility, and a court order reporting the prison officials\u2019 allegedly wrongful actions \u201cto Federal and State Authorities for the purposes of criminal prosecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5. The district court denied all three prayers for relief, holding, <em>inter alia, </em>that Mr. Paalaris damages claim was barred by <em>Feres v. United States, </em>340 U.S. 135, 71 S.Ct. 153, 95 L.Ed. 152 (1950). Doc 4 at 2-3. We affirmed in part, but held that the factual record was insufficient to determine the applicability of <em>Feres. Paalan v. Nickels, </em>No. 99-3283, 2000 WL 177416, at *1 (10th Cir. Feb. 16, 2000). Accordingly, we remanded the damages claim for a determination of Mr. Paalaris military status at the time the alleged injuries oc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>curred. <em>Id. </em>On remand, the district court found that Mr. Paalan was on active duty during the relevant time period and again dismissed his damages claim. Doc. 32. On appeal, Mr. Paalan contends that his active duty ended upon delivery of the Certif\u00edcate of Discharge, thereby invalidating the subsequent involuntary extension of his service. Accordingly, he maintains that <em>Feres </em>is inapplicable. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">\u201c[T]he Government is not liable ... for injuries to servicemen where the injuries arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service.\u201d <em>Feres v. United States, </em>340 U.S. at 145, 71 S.Ct. 153. Although originally articulated in the context of the Federal Torts Claims Act, the Supreme Court has affirmed that the <em>Feres </em>doctrine applies with equal force in <em>Bivens </em>actions. <em>United States v. Stanley, </em>483 U.S. 669, 684, 107 S.Ct. 3054, 97 L.Ed.2d 550 (1987) (\u2018We hold that no <em>Bivens </em>remedy is available for injuries that \u2018arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Feres, </em>340 U.S. at 146). \u201cIncident to service\u201d is an expansive concept, which \u201cencompasses, at a minimum, all injuries suffered by military personnel that are even remotely related to the individual\u2019s status as a member of the military.\u201d <em>Pringle v. United States, </em>208 F.3d 1220, 1223-24 (10th Cir. 2000) (internal quotations, citation, and alteration omitted). This court has specifically held that injuries sustained by active duty servicemembers as a result of military medical care are \u201cincident to service\u201d for <em>Feres </em>purposes, <em>e.g., Maddick v. United States, </em>978 F.2d 614, 615 (10th Cir. 1992); <em>Madsen, </em>841 F.2d at 1013; <em>see also Quintana v. United States, </em>997 F.2d 711, 712 (10th Cir.1993) (reserve status), as are injuries arising out of incarceration in a military facility. <em>Walden v. Bartlett, </em>840 F.2d 771, 774 (10th Cir.1988). <em>Feres </em>is inapplicable, however, to injuries sustained after the completion of an individual\u2019s military service. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>348 U.S. 110, 112-13, 75 S.Ct. 141, 99 L.Ed. 139 (1954). Accordingly, the only question before us is whether Mr. Paalan\u2019s service had been completed at the time he was allegedly deprived of his medication. <em>See Madsen, </em>841 F.2d at 1014.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-6\">We must consider Mr. Paalan\u2019s early discharge claim in light of established military case law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-7\">[T]hree elements [must] be satisfied to accomplish an early discharge. First, there must be a delivery of a valid discharge certificate.... Second, there must be a final accounting of pay made----Third, appellant must undergo the \u201cclearing\u201d process required under appropriate service regulations to separate him from military service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b960-9\"><em>United States v. King, </em>27 M.J. 327, 329 (C.M.A.1989) (citations omitted). Mr. Paalan has failed to establish these three elements. We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that the Certificate of Discharge indicates a \u201ccommand intent\u201d that Mr. Paalan\u2019s separation from the Service occur no sooner than October 31,1995. Doc. 26, Ex. B; <em>United States v. Batchel-der, </em>41 M.J. 337, 339 (C.A.A.F.1994). His receipt of the Certificate of Discharge in early August 1995 did not negate that intent. <em>See Batchelder, </em>41 M.J. at 339; <em>see also King, </em>27 M.J. at 329 (\u201cThe mere physical transfer of the discharge certificate to appellant was not \u2018delivery\u2019 of the discharge as required by law____\u201d). The fact that Mr. Paalan took terminal leave prior to his scheduled separation date is also insufficient to accelerate his discharge. <em>See Madsen v. United States, </em>841 F.2d 1011, 1013 (10th Cir.1987) (\u201c[T]ermi-nal leave can be cancelled at any time and the serviceman ordered to report to duty.\u201d). Nor does the record support Mr. Paalan\u2019s claim that he received a final accounting of his pay on September 12, 1995. <em>Compare </em>Doc. 6 at 2-3 (alleging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>that final accounting occurred on Sept. 12, 1995); <em>with </em>Doc. 26, Ex. F (showing payments posted in Oct. 1995, Nov. 1995, Dec. 1995, and Jan. 1996). Regardless, there is no evidence that Mr. Paalan underwent the requisite clearance process. Due to Mr. Paalan\u2019s inability to satisfy either of the latter two elements required by <em>King, </em>the videotaped \u201cdelivery\u201d ceremony to which he repeatedly refers in his pleadings would not affect our disposition of his claim. <em>See, e.g., </em>Doc. 6 at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">Accordingly, we agree that Mr. Paalan\u2019s receipt of his Certificate of Discharge in August 1995 did not effect an early discharge. The imposition of \u201clegal hold\u201d status on October 16, 1995, effectively preserved the status quo from that date until November 28, 1995, his scheduled EAOS. <em>See United States v. Douse, </em>12 M.J. 473, 478 (C.M.A.1982); <em>United States v. Clay, </em>48 C.M.R. 334, 337, 1973 WL 14935 (N.C.M.R.1973). At that point, Mr. Paal-an\u2019s service was involuntarily extended pending court-martial, pursuant to Article 1050155.1(h) of the Military Personnel Manual. Doc. 26, Ex. C &amp; E. Because there is no indication in the record of any subsequent change in status, we conclude that Mr. Paalan was on active military duty at the time of the alleged injuries. Accordingly, the <em>Feres </em>doctrine, as extended by <em>Stanley, </em>bars his damages claim and that claim was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b959-13\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.
