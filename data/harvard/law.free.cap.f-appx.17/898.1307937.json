R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">State prisoner Ibn Omar-Muhammad seeks to appeal the dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-9\">On October 28, 1987, following two reversals and remands for new trials, Petitioner was convicted of first degree depraved mind murder in Curry County District Court, New Mexico. On May 25, 1995, Petitioner filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico, challenging his conviction for depraved mind murder. On April 8, 1996, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s finding that Petitioner had substantial unexhausted claims that could be raised in state habeas court and dismissed the claim without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-10\">On April 17, 1997, Petitioner gave a state habeas petition to prison authorities to be mailed to the Curry County District Court; however, the petition was not received until April 23, 1997. That petition was denied, and the New Mexico Supreme Court denied certiorari on July 24, 1997. On July 30, 1997, Petitioner filed the habe-as petition in this case. However, the magistrate judge recommended dismissing the petition as untimely under the one-year limitations period provided by the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). After considering Petitioner\u2019s objections, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s proposed findings, dismissed the petition, and denied Petitioner a certificate of appealability. Petitioner now seeks a certificate of appealability to appeal the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-15\">In order for this court to grant a certificate of appealability, Appellant must make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). Where, as here,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-Y\">the district court denies a habeas petition on procedural grounds without reaching the prisoner\u2019s underlying constitutional claim, a [certificate of appeal-ability] should issue ... if the prisoner shows, at least, that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right, and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b927-16\"><em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 478, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-17\">April 24, 1996, was the effective date of the AEDPA, which created a one-year statute of limitations period for federal habeas petitions under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). Because Petitioner\u2019s conviction was final before AEDPA\u2019s enactment, the one-year statute of limitations did not begin to run until that date. <em>See Hoggro v. Boone, </em>150 F.3d 1223, 1225-26 (10th Cir.1998) (recognizing judicially-created grace period). Thus, Petitioner\u2019s time to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>file this petition was due to expire on April 24,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">However, AEDPA also provides that the limitations period may be tolled: \u201cThe time during which a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending shall not be counted toward any period of limitation under this subsection.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2). Thus, Petitioner\u2019s state ha-beas petition, which was received by the clerk of the Curry County District Court on April 23, 1997, tolled the statute of limitations \u2014 however, only one day remained in his federal habeas period. When the New Mexico Supreme Court denied certiorari on Petitioner\u2019s habeas claim, the limitations period began to run again and expired before Petitioner could resubmit his federal habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">Petitioner argues here, as he did to the district court, that his petition was timely by virtue of the mailbox rule of <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988). The rule would have permitted us to consider Petitioner\u2019s state petition filed as of the day he handed his petition to prison authorities. However, the district court correctly noted that we have rejected that argument for proceedings in New Mexico. <em>See Adams v. LeMaster, </em>223 F.3d 1177, 1181-83 (10th Cir.2000). In <em>Adams, </em>we held that the definition of \u201cproperly filed\u201d for state habeas petitions under \u00a7 2244(d)(2) is based on the reviewing state\u2019s rules of procedure, <em>id. </em>at 1181, and New Mexico would hold petitions properly filed upon receipt by the clerk. <em>See id. </em>at 1182. We thus held that the mailbox rule did not apply to state habeas petitions in New Mexico. <em>See id. </em>at 1183. Since <em>Adams, </em>we have not been otherwise directed by the New Mexico courts. Absent en banc rehearing, we are bound to uphold a prior panel\u2019s decision. <em>See Eberl\u2019s Claim Serv., Inc. v. Comm\u2019r, </em>249 F.3d 994, 1003-04 (10th. Cir.2001). Therefore, we reject Petitioner\u2019s mailbox rule argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">Petitioner further argues that the circumstances in this case warrant equitable tolling of the \u00a7 2244(d) limitation. He contends that his reliance on counsel for assistance in his pro se petition, his belief in the application of the mailbox rule, and the prison\u2019s delay in mailing his filing constitute extraordinary circumstances warranting equitable tolling. However, equitable tolling only applies when an inmate diligently pursues his claims. <em>See Miller v. Marr, </em>141 F.3d 976, 978 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>525 U.S. 891, 119 S.Ct. 210, 142 L.Ed.2d 173 (1998). The prison\u2019s delay and the application of the mailbox rule could only have affected the last eight days of Petitioner\u2019s one-year limitations period; \u201creliance on counsel\u201d for the remaining 357 days does not constitute extraordinary circumstances sufficient to justify equitable tolling. It is Petitioner\u2019s delay in filing his state habeas claim that overwhelmingly contributed to his untimely federal filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-8\">After a careful review of the petition, the magistrate judge\u2019s opinion, and the relevant record, we conclude that Petitioner does not present a debatable question for reasonable jurists as to whether his petition was timely filed under the AED-PA. <em>See Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 478, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). Because we hold that there is no debatable issue as to \u201cwhether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling,\u201d we decline to consider substantively \u201cwhether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b928-9\">Thus, we DENY Petitioner a certificate of appealability and DISMISS the case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b927-11\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
