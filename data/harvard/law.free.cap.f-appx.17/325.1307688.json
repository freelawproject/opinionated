Plaintiffs filed suit against Cheme-tals Incorporated, the owner of the premises where Ferguson, the employee of an independent contractor, was working at the time of the incident. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Chemetals and Plaintiffs filed a timely appeal. For the reasons stated below, we REVERSE AND REMAND.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-19\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b354-20\">At the time of the June 7, 1995, incident at issue in this case, Plaintiff Bobby Ferguson worked for Arnold\u2019s Fabricating and Machine Shop (\u201cArnold\u2019s\u201d), a metal fabricator and machine shop that performs field work, plant maintenance, and project work. On the date in question, Ferguson was installing an overhead pipe at Cheme-tals\u2019 facility. Arnold\u2019s contracted work with Chemetals on a regular basis, maintained a trailer at Chemetals, and stationed its own supervisor at Chemetals. While Ferguson was installing - the over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>head pipe the reducer in a nearby pipe exploded, spraying hot liquid on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">On April 17, 1996, Plaintiffs filed suit against Chemetals, asserting that Cheme-tals had negligently failed to provide Ferguson with a reasonably safe place to work, instruct Ferguson how to safely perform his job duties, warn Ferguson of the dangers related to working in Chemetals\u2019 plant, and provide pipes of sufficient strength and durability to carry the hazardous chemicals.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Chemetals filed a motion for summary judgment. In response to Chemetals\u2019 motion, Plaintiff submitted the affidavit of its expert opining that the reducer that burst was defective. This was the first time Plaintiffs asserted that the reducer at issue was defective. Consistent with their expert\u2019s affidavit, on April 9, 1997, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint against Chemetals, adding claims that Chemetals was negligent in failing to warn Ferguson of the allegedly defective reducers and failing to remove the allegedly defective reducers from the existing pipelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">By agreement of the parties, Chemetals\u2019 motion for summary judgment was referred to the magistrate judge for decision. On April 13, 1999, the magistrate judge issued a Memorandum Opinion granting Chemetals\u2019 motion for summary judgment and dismissing Plaintiffs\u2019 claims with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">We review <em>de novo </em>the magistrate judge\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>See Davis v. Sodexho, Cumberland Coll. Cafe</em>teria, 157 F.3d 460, 462 (6th Cir.1998) (citing <em>Middleton v. Reynolds Metals Co., </em>963 F.2d 881, 882 (6th Cir.1992)). Summary judgment is proper only if the evidence shows that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See id. </em>(citing <em>City Mgmt. Corp. v. U.S. Chem. Co., </em>43 F.3d 244, 250 (6th Cir.1994)). We consider all facts and inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>See id. </em>To survive summary judgment, the non-movant must set forth more than a mere scintilla of evidence in support of its position; there must be sufficient evidence on which a jury could reasonably find for the non-moving party. <em>See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 251, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2512, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-11\">In granting Chemetals\u2019 motion for summary judgment, the magistrate judge found that under Tennessee law, Cheme-tals had a duty to Ferguson to either warn of, or remove, any latent defects or dangers on its premises of which it had notice, and that the allegedly defective reducer constituted a latent danger of which Chemetals had notice. The magistrate judge, however, also found that Ferguson\u2019s employer, Arnold\u2019s, had equal or superior knowledge of the latent danger, <em>i.e., </em>the presence of the defective reducers, and that such knowledge was imputed to Ferguson under Tennessee law. According to the magistrate judge, Ferguson\u2019s imputed knowledge of the dangerous condition, as a matter of law, relieved Chemetals of its duty to warn.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-12\">We find that the magistrate judge erred in granting summary judgment to Cheme-tals. First, we find that genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether Arnold\u2019s possessed equal or superior knowledge regarding the allegedly defective reducers. Second, we find that under Tennessee\u2019s comparative fault law, Ferguson\u2019s imputed knowledge of the latent danger does not act as a complete bar to recovery as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-13\">\n<em>1. A Genuine Issue of Material Fact Exists Regarding Arnold\u2019s Knowledge of the Latent Defect</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b355-14\">It is undisputed that prior to the incident in question, Chemetals had expe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>rienced problems with the \u201cblack\u201d reducers failing and had knowledge that such failures could cause injury to its employees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 1994, Chemetals\u2019 Purchasing Manager, B.R. Buckner, wrote a letter to Fibereast, the reducer manufacturer, stating \u201cwe have recently had [numerous] failures of Fibereast Fig. 34F reducers, <em>one resulting in an employee injury.\u201d </em>(J.A. 88) (emphasis added). Furthermore, due to the failure rate of the black reducers and his corresponding concern for the safety of Chemetals\u2019 employees, in early 1995, Joseph Nash, Chemetals\u2019 Maintenance and Engineering Manager, stopped purchasing black reducers. <em>{Id. </em>at 773). Nash also asked his employees to replace the black reducers that had been previously installed at Chemetals\u2019 facility. (J.A. 779). The task of replacing the black reducers was largely performed by Cheme-tals\u2019 employees, not Arnold\u2019s employees. <em>{Id. </em>779).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">Viewing this evidence in a light most favorable to Plaintiffs, as we must do on a motion for summary judgment, clearly establishes that Chemetals knew that the black reducers were prone to failure and posed a \u201csafety concern.\u201d The magistrate judge therefore correctly concluded that Chemetals\u2019 had a duty to either remove or warn of the allegedly defective reducers. <em>See Rice v. Sabir, </em>979 S.W.2d 305, 308 (Tenn.1998) (stating that premises owner\u2019s duty to exercise reasonable care includes \u201cthe responsibility to remove or warn against latent or hidden dangerous conditions on the premises of which one was aware or should have been aware with reasonable diligence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The magistrate judge, however, also found that Arnold\u2019s on-site supervisor, Phillip Breeden, possessed equal or superi- or knowledge to that of Chemetals, and that such knowledge was imputed to Ferguson, thereby relieving Chemetals of its duty to warn. Although the magistrate judge states several times that the \u201clatent dangers were communicated\u201d to Breeden, we find no evidence in the record to support this statement. The only communication regarding the reducers in the record before us is Nash\u2019s statement that he \u201ctold a couple of foremen\u201d that the black reducers needed to be replaced. (J.A. 781). Breeden testified that Chemetals never informed him of the potential safety concerns surrounding the reducers, or that the black reducers were not to be used anymore. <em>{Id. </em>811). We therefore find <em>Jackson v. Tennessee Valley Authority, </em>413 F.Supp. 1050, 1056 (M.D.Tenn.1976), relied upon by Chemetals, to be distinguishable from this case as it was undisputed in <em>Jackson </em>that the defendant had discussed the dangerous condition with the plaintiffs employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">Furthermore, to the extent that the magistrate judge\u2019s conclusion was based upon Breeden\u2019s independent knowledge of the reducers, we find such conclusion to be erroneous. Breeden testified that he had some knowledge of the problems associated with the black reducers and that \u201c[h]e had seen a couple of them that had cracked and they didn\u2019t bust; they just had a little crack in them.\u201d (J.A. 609). Breeden also stated \u201cthat it [s]eems like the black [reducer] is worse.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>611). According to Breeden, although Arnold\u2019s had replaced some of the black reducers, they only did so if the black reducer cracked. As Breeden stated: \u201cI didn\u2019t say we was going around replacing them. I said we\u2019d change them out right there because they were cracked and we put some green ones in because that\u2019s what we had.\u201d (Id 618).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>The magistrate judge acknowledged that Arnold\u2019s was not systematically replacing every black reducer as if some emergent situation existed; that Breeden would use either a green reducer or a black reducer depending upon availability; and that if he did not have a green reducer and the black reducer looked good, he would use the black one.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">A jury could conclude from this evidence that although Arnold\u2019s had knowledge that some of the black reducers had failed, unlike Chemetals, Arnold\u2019s was not aware that the black reducers posed a \u201csafety concern\u201d for its employees. We are satisfied that genuine issues of material fact exist as to the extent of Arnold\u2019s knowledge regarding the allegedly defective black reducers, and whether Arnold\u2019s knowledge was equal or superior to Chemetals\u2019 knowledge. We therefore conclude that the magistrate judge erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Chemetals.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">In remending this case to the district court, we find unpersuasive Chemetals\u2019 reliance on the argument that \u201c[n]o duty is owed to an independent contractor\u2019s employees when they are injured while engaging in work they were contracted to perform.\u201d Under Tennessee law, a premises owner is relieved of its duty \u201cwhen the contractor is injured while making the specific repairs called for in the contract.\u201d <em>Blair v. Campbell, </em>924 S.W.2d 75, 75 (1996). The magistrate judge specifically found that Ferguson was not sent to repair the reducer that failed and caused his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">We also reject Chemetals\u2019 argument that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are barred under the doctrine of \u201cprimary implied assumption of the risk.\u201d Primary implied assumption of the risk arises where \u201ca plaintiff assumes a known risk that is inherent in a particular activity, such as watching a baseball game from an un-screened seat.\u201d <em>Coln v. City of Savannah, </em>966 S.W.2d 34, 43 (Tenn.1998). Ferguson was not working on the allegedly defective reducer; nor is there any evidence that he knew that the black reducers posed a potential safety concern. Ferguson was installing a new pipeline, not an existing pipeline carrying dangerously hot material. Furthermore, there is no evidence that reducer failures are an \u201cinherent\u201d risk of Ferguson\u2019s occupation. Ferguson cannot be said to have knowingly assumed a risk that he had no knowledge of, and that was not inherent to his line of work. In our opinion, the facts of this case would, at best, involve the doctrine of \u201csecondary implied assumption of risk,\u201d which Defendant acknowledges no longer precludes recovery, but only serves to reduce damages under the comparative fault analysis. (Appellee\u2019s Br. at 25). We therefore reverse the decision of the magistrate judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">\n<em>2. Ferguson\u2019s Imputed Knowledge Regarding the Latent Danger Does Not Preclude Recovery as a Matter of Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Amo\">We also find that the magistrate judge erred in concluding that Ferguson\u2019s imputed knowledge regarding the allegedly defective reducers relieved Chemetals of its duty as a matter of law. Under Tennessee law, the employee of an independent contractor enjoys the status of an invitee while performing work on the premises of the owner-contractee. <em>Dempster Bros. Inc. v. Duncan, </em>61 Tenn.App. 88, 452 S.W.2d 902, 906 (1969). As a result of the employee\u2019s status as an invitee, the premises owner owes the employee \u201cthe duty to exercise reasonable care to see that an employee has a reasonably safe place to work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This duty, based upon premises liability, is limited to a duty to remove, or warn of, latent dangers of which the premises owner has actual or constructive knowledge. <em>Ellis v. Chase Comm\u2019n, Inc., </em>63 F.3d 473, 476 (6th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>1995); <em>see also Blair v. Campbell, </em>924 S.W.2d 75, 76 (Tenn.1996); <em>Dempster, </em>452 S.W.2d at 906. This duty to warn is not unique to the employees of independent contractors; this is the same duty that premises owners owe to all invitees. <em>See Dempster, </em>452 S.W.2d at 906.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">The premises owner\u2019s duty to remove or warn of latent dangers traditionally arose out of the premises owner\u2019s \u201csuperior knowledge\u201d of the dangerous condition and therefore, the premises owner had no duty to warn of \u201cdangers that are obvious, reasonably apparent or as well known to the invitee as to the owner.\u201d <em>Dempster, </em>452 S.W.2d at 906; see <em>also Ellis, </em>63 F.3d at 476; <em>Jackson, </em>413 F.Supp. at 1055-56. Hence, the \u201copen and obvious\u201d doctrine, under which the premises owner had no liability for dangers that were \u201cobvious, reasonably apparent, or as well known to the invitee ... as to the owner.\u201d <em>Coin, </em>966 S.W.2d at 40 (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">In <em>Coin, </em>the Tennessee Supreme Court limited the \u201copen and obvious\u201d doctrine of premises liability, holding that \u201can open and obvious danger does not automatically result in a finding of no duty and therefore no landowner liability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 37. According to the Tennessee Supreme Court, after its adoption of comparative fault in 1992, a premises owner\u2019s duty can no longer be analyzed in terms of whether the danger was obvious or known to the invitee. <em>Id. </em>at 41-42. Rather, a premises owner\u2019s duty must be analyzed \u201cwith regard to foreseeability and gravity of harm, and the feasibility and availability of alternative conduct that would have prevented the harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 42. As explained by the Tennessee Supreme Court, \u201cif the foreseeability and gravity of harm posed from a defendant\u2019s conduct, even if \u2018open and obvious,\u2019 outweighed the burden on the defendant to engage in alternative conduct to avoid harm, there is a duty to act with reasonable care.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">Because a premises owner\u2019s duty to the employee of an independent contractor stems from the traditional duties owed to all invitees, the Tennessee Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Coin </em>is equally applicable in this case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Rice, </em>979 S.W.2d at 308-09. Therefore, even if Chemetals had warned Arnold\u2019s of the allegedly defective reducer or even if Ferguson had knowledge of the allegedly defective reducers, after <em>Coin, </em>such knowledge does not necessarily alleviate Chemetals\u2019 duty, or bar Ferguson from recovering, as a matter of law. Such knowledge on the part of Ferguson, whether actual or imputed, is simply one factor the jury may consider in determining whether Chemetals should have engaged in alternative conduct. As the Tennessee Supreme Court stated in <em>Coin, </em>\u201c[i]f the risk of harm remains unreasonable despite ... knowledge of it by the invitee, then the circumstances may be such that the [defendant] is required to undertake reasonable precautions [and] the issue then ... is for the jury to decide. <em>Coin, </em>966 S.W.2d at 41 (quoting <em>Bertrand v. Alan Ford, Inc., </em>449 Mich. 606, 537 N.W.2d 185, 187 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">In sum, we find, under the facts of this case, that Chemetals had a duty to act with reasonable care to either warn Plaintiff of the danger, or eliminate the danger. Whether Chemetals discharged its duty to exercise reasonable care is for the jury to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b358-11\">For the reasons stated above, we REVERSE AND REMAND to the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>court for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b356-6\">. The parties refer to the allegedly defective reducers as the \"black\u201d reducers, and the allegedly preferable reducers as the \"green\u201d reducers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b358-6\">. We recognize that although <em>Coin </em>was decided well before the parties filed their \"renewed\u201d pleadings in the district court, neither party raised this issue before the magistrate judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
