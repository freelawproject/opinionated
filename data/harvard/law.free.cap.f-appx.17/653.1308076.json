In a consolidated hearing, the district court sentenced Campos-Lozano to 47 months on the new illegal re-entry charge and 18 months on the supervised release violation, to run consecutively. Campos-Lozano appeals only the 18 month sentence. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231, and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-17\">Campos-Lozano contends that the district court erred by imposing consecutive sentences. This contention lacks merit. The record shows that the district court gave due consideration to the factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and that it acted within its discretion when it imposed consecutive sentences. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a), (b) (requiring court to take into account factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)); U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 5G1.3, 7B1.3(f); <em>United States v. Steffen, </em>251 F.3d 1273, 1278 (9th Cir.2001) (stating that sentencing guidelines do not divest sentencing court of its duty to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b682-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
