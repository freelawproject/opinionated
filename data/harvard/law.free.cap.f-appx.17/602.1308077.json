The district court dismissed the motion as barred by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act\u2019s (AED-PA) statute of limitations. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(a) and review the district court\u2019s dismissal de <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>novo. <em>Miles v. Prunty, </em>187 F.3d 1104, 1105 (9th Cir.1999). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Because Gustafson\u2019s conviction was final in 1993, the one-year limitations period expired on April 24, 1997. <em>Patterson v. Stewart, </em>251 F.3d 1243, 1246 (9th Cir. 2001). Gustafson\u2019s motion, filed June 23, 1997, is untimely unless he can show that \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d beyond his control made it impossible for him to file a timely motion. <em>Calderon v. United States Dist. Court (Kelly), </em>163 F.3d 530, 541 (9th Cir.1998) (en banc). The district court properly concluded that Gustafson\u2019s lock-down in disciplinary segregation 23)6 hours a day, limited access to the law library, limited ability to correspond, limited access to news outside of the prison, and counsel\u2019s alleged inaction seven years ago did not make it impossible for Gustafson to file a timely motion. Despite these restrictions, the defendant filed his \u00a7 2255 motion with the court. The record shows that the defendant\u2019s failure to act, rather than extraordinary circumstances beyond his control, caused the delay in filing the \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Calderon v. United States Dist. Court (Beeler), </em>128 F.3d 1283, 1287-89 (9th Cir.1997), <em>overruled on other grounds by Calderon v. United States Dist. Court (Kelly), </em>163 F.3d 530, 540 (9th Cir.1998) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>526 U.S. 1060, 119 S.Ct. 1377, 143 L.Ed.2d 535 (1999).
