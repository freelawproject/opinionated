We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we review, for clear error, the district court\u2019s factual findings during sentencing, <em>see United States v. Maldonado, </em>215 F.3d 1046, 1050 (9th Cir.2000), and we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">McNeal contends that the district court erred by applying a two point enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2, for reckless endangerment during his flight from the bank robbery. We find this contention to be persuasive as the record is devoid of evidence that McNeal was the driver of the vehicle attempting to evade police, or that he was responsible for the driver\u2019s conduct. <em>See United States v. Young, </em>33 F.3d 31, 32-33 (9th Cir.1994) (holding that application of a reckless endangerment enhancement requires that a district court make specific findings regarding a defendant\u2019s culpability for the actual reckless conduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">McNeal\u2019s presentence report did not set forth any evidence that McNeal either drove the vehicle, or \u201caided or abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused\u201d the driver\u2019s conduct, as required by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2, comment. (n.5). The record further shows that no such evidence was adduced at McNeal\u2019s sentencing, and that the district court did not make the findings of fact necessary to allow this court to determine whether application of the enhancement to McNeal\u2019s offense level was clearly erroneous. <em>Young, </em>33 F.3d at 32-33. Accordingly, we remand to the district court to make specific findings as to the conduct on which it based the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">VACATED and REMANDED for RE-SENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b611-32\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
