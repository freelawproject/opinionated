We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion for leave to amend, <em>see Texaco, Inc. v. Ponsoldt, </em>939 F.2d 794, 798 (9th Cir.1991), as well as motions for reconsideration, <em>see Barber v. Hawaii, </em>42 F.3d 1185, 1198 (9th Cir.1994). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-21\">Because a responsive pleading had been filed before Widmer filed his motion for leave to amend, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Widmer\u2019s motion to amend his complaint. <em>See Texaco, </em>939 F.2d at 798. The district court likewise did not abuse its discretion by denying Widmer\u2019s motion for reconsideration. <em>See Barber, </em>42 F.3d at 1198.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b610-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b610-19\">. Because this is the only contention Widmer raises in his brief, the other claims he raised before the district court are deemed abandoned. <em>See Williamson v. General Dynamics Corp., </em>208 F.3d 1144, 1149 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
