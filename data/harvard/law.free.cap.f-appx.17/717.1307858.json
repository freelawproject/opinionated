NELSON and SILVERMAN, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b746-26\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-27\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-28\">A. <em>Mora-Perez\u2019s Confession</em></p>\n<p id=\"b746-29\">We reject Mora-Perez\u2019s argument that the Government was required to corroborate his confession in order to use it at sentencing. \u201cThe procedural safeguards and evidentiary limitations afforded defendants in criminal trials are not required at sentencings.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, the commentary to \u00a7 6A1.3 of the sentencing guidelines states that \u201c[a]ny information may be considered, so long as it has sufficient indicia of reliability.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-30\">Mora-Perez offers no evidence that shows his confession does not bear sufficient indicia of reliability, nor did he do so at the district court. The facts contained within his confession, as present<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>ed in the Government\u2019s investigative report, were included in the presentence report. However, Mora-Perez never even alleged that those facts were untrue or misleading. The investigative report is well-detailed, and on its face, there is no reason to doubt its accuracy. Because Mora-Perez failed to meet his burden of showing unreliability,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that his confession bore sufficient indicia of reliability.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">B. <em>Relevant Conduct Determination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Mora-Perez confessed that, in 1997, he made six trips to Fairbanks to deliver cocaine. These trips periodically continued in 1998 and 1999, the year in which he delivered two kilograms every two weeks in the two months preceding his arrest. Thus, it is clear that the Government did not rely on a solitary drug delivery in Mora-Perez\u2019s past to prove relevant conduct.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">Furthermore, Mora-Perez was arrested while attempting to deliver, via a flight from California, a small quantity of cocaine to a few particular customers in Fairbanks. This was precisely the method of operation for all of his drug deliveries from 1997 up to the date of his arrest in 1999.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In light of this evidence, we cannot say that the district court clearly erred in its relevant conduct determination.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-15\">C. <em>Quantity of Cocaine Involved in the Relevant Conduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b747-16\">For 1997 and 1999, Mora-Perez confessed to the quantities he delivered. Thus, the district court did not err, let alone clearly err,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> in determining drug quantities for those two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-17\">For 1998, the district court accepted the Probation Officer\u2019s estimate. that Mora-Perez delivered 2.5 kilograms.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Section 2D1.1 of the sentencing guidelines specifically gives the district court authority to estimate the quantity of drugs involved in the relevant conduct by considering similar drug transactions by the defendant.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> That is precisely what the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>did here. In addition, the district court sufficiently erred on the side of caution in accepting that estimate.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Mora-Perez made at least ten trips to Fairbanks in 1998, whereas in 1997 and 1999, he made fewer trips, but transported a greater amount of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b746-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b746-19\">. <em>United States v.
