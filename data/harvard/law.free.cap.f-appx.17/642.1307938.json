On appeal, the BIA determined that Herrera-Vargas had not accrued the requisite seven years of continuous physical presence before he was served with an order to show cause and thus was statutorily ineligible for suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Herrera-Vargas contends that he was eligible for suspension of deportation and challenges the BIA\u2019s decision that the \u201cstop-time rule\u201d \u2014 the new continuous physical presence requirement set forth in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 \u2014 bars such relief in his case. Herrera-Vargas\u2019s arguments challenging the application of the stop-time rule are foreclosed by our recent decision in <em>Ram v. INS, </em>243 F.3d 510 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">We do not consider Petitioner\u2019s eligibility, if any, for relief under the class action pending in the district court in accordance with <em>Barahona-Gomez v. Reno, </em>167 F.3d 1228 (9th Cir.1999), <em>affd </em>236 F.3d 1115 (2001). Because the district court\u2019s preliminary injunction in <em>Barahona-Gomez </em>precludes the Attorney General from deporting class members until the class action is resolved, denial of this petition for review does not affect the rights of this class member as to that preclusion or the rights asserted in the class action.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b670-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
