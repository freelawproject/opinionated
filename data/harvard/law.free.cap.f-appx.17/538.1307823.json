(EPIC). The district court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331, 2201, and 2202 and 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1540(c) and (g). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review attorneys\u2019 fees awards for an abuse of discretion, if the district court applied the correct legal standard. <em>Carson-Truckee Water Conservancy Dist. v. Sec\u2019y of Interior, </em>748 F.2d 523, 524 (9th Cir.1984). We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">In awarding EPIC attorneys\u2019 fees the district court relied on its finding that \u201c[EPIC\u2019s] efforts resulted in court orders that established the application of section 7(d) of the [Act] to private [incidental take permit (ITP) ] applications as well as clarification that section 7 of the [Endangered Species Act (Act) ] applied to ITP applications under section 10.\u201d The district court also stated, \u201cthe issues of interpreting and applying section 7(d) of the act and 7(d)\u2019s interactions with section 10 were novel, important and complex and the efforts of plaintiffs did aid in interpreting the [Act].\u201d We have, however, in a related opinion directed the district court to vacate its order of March 15, 1999 (March 15 order) because it was entered without jurisdiction. That order addressed</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aiq\">(1) whether the section 7 consultation requirements apply to ITP applications under section 10(a) of the ESA, and if so, whether the requisite consultation has been initiated to trigger the section 7(d) prohibitions; and (2) whether plaintiffs have made a sufficient showing that PALCO\u2019s timber harvesting in the areas of the proposed THPs is an irreversible or irretrievable commitment of resources in violation of section 7(d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">We have also directed the district court to vacate portions of its order dated May 5, 1999 (May 5 order), in which the district court engaged in an extensive discussion of the interaction between sections 7 and 10 of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">Thus, the district court cannot sustain an attorneys\u2019 fees award by relying on either the March 15 order or its further analysis of the Act contained in the May 5 order. The district cburt shall reconsider the attorneys\u2019 fees issue without reliance on the March 15 order or that part of the May 5 order we have directed be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b566-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
