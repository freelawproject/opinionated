We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Where, as here, the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s decision while adding its own reasons, we review both the BIA\u2019s and the IJ\u2019s decisions for substantial evidence. <em>See Kataria v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 1107, 1112 (9th Cir. 2000). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-25\">Medrano-Cruz testified that he feared persecution from guerrillas, who tried recruiting him into their ranks because of his military experience. Because forced recruitment by guerrillas, without more, does not amount to persecution based on race, religion, nationality, membership in a social group or political opinion, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s orders denying Medrano-Cruz\u2019s application for asylum. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacari-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>as, 502 U.S. 478, 481-82, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">Because Medrano-Cruz has not satisfied the standard required for a grant of asylum, he has failed to meet the higher standard for withholding of deportation. <em>See Aruta v. INS, </em>80 F.3d 1389, 1396 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"AXk\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.

Pursuant to the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d), the transitional rules apply, <em>see Kalaw </em>v. <em>INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir. 1997), and we therefore have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a), as amended by IIRI-RA \u00a7 309(c), <em>see Avetova-Elisseva v.
