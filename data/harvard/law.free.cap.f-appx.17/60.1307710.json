As the District Court noted in its thorough opinion, the United States Postal Service is protected from suit in this case by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. The Federal Tort Claims Act itself states that it retains sovereign immunity over \u201c[a]ny claim arising out of the loss, miscarriage, or negligent transmission of letters or postal matter.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(b) (2001). Zeitschick has not alleged that the mail that was purportedly lost fell within the exceptions to this rule. Having reviewed all of Zeitschick\u2019s contentions on this appeal and finding in them no grounds for reversal, we affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment substantially for the reasons given in Judge Trager\u2019s careful opinion of September 28, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
