Upon a thorough review' of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we agree with the district court that dismissal of the access-to-courts claim was proper based on absolute quasi-judicial immunity, <em>see Martin v. Hendren, </em>127 F.3d 720, 721 (8th Cir.1997), and failure to state a constitutional violation. The district court also properly refused to exercise its supplemental jurisdiction over the pendent negligence claim, which it dismissed without prejudice. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3). So that Berger may pursue whatever state law claims he might have against Vera Reynolds \u2014 against whom he asserted the denial-of-access claim for allegedly refusing to file certain papers \u2014 we modify Reynolds\u2019s dismissal to be without prejudice also.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court as modified. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b531-11\">. The Honorable William R.
