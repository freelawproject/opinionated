Appellees have waived their right to file a brief. After an examination of appellant\u2019s brief and the record, we have concluded that oral argument is unnecessary. See Fed. R.App. P. 34(a); Cir. R. 34(f).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b423-14\">Order</p>\n<p id=\"b423-15\">Samuel Trinidad, who is imprisoned in Wisconsin, contends (among other things) that the prison imposed sanctions for a prayer he included in a letter sent to another prisoner. The district court dismissed the complaint, before service of process was made on defendants, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A. On a prior appeal we reversed with respect to this aspect of Trinidad\u2019s claim. Although the prison apparently believes that the language was employed as a gang slogan, we held that this was not a proper ground of dismissal under \u00a7 1915A and that the prison must substantiate its position. We remanded with instructions that \u201cthe record be supplemented with the necessary documents to determine whether there is \u2018some evidence\u2019 to support the disciplinary action against Trinidad.\u201d <em>Trinidad v. McCaugh-try, </em>No. <em>99-4046, </em>2000 WL <em>868585 </em>(7th Cir. June 26, 2000) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-17\">The district judge failed to carry out this instruction. The judge once again dismissed the complaint under \u00a7 1915A. There is no evidence in the record; the defendants remain unserved. The judge\u2019s explanation for this decision is that our remand was mistaken. The district judge wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-18\">In remanding this matter, the court of appeals assumed that petitioner\u2019s disciplinary hearing implicated due process concerns. I believe this was an oversight by the court. In <em>Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 483-484, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995), the Supreme Court held that liberty interests \u201cwill generally be limited to freedom from restraint ... \u201d. [The district judge then wrote that Trinidad has not alleged a loss within the scope of Sandin.] ... [I]n the absence of a protectable liberty or property interest, the validity of the prison review board\u2019s decision is beyond the reach of the courts\u2019 reviewing power.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1Z\">The district judge then dismissed the complaint a second time.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>Appellate judges are not immune from error. We make plenty of mistakes. There is even an institution in the judicial hierarchy charged with the duty of correcting error by a United States Court of Appeals-but that institution is not the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin. Defendants did not ask the Supreme Court to review our decision. It was (and is) the obligation of the district court to implement our mandate even if unpersuaded by our rationale. \u201cOurs is a hierarchical judiciary, and judges of inferior courts must carry out decisions they believe mistaken. <em>Hutto v. Davis, </em>454 U.S. 370, 375, 102 S.Ct. 703, 70 L.Ed.2d 556 (1982).\u201d <em>Gacy v. Welborn, </em>994 F.2d 305, 310 (7th Cir.1993). See also <em>United States v. Booker, </em>115 F.3d 442 (7th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">For what it is worth, we add that the error is the district court\u2019s, not ours. Trinidad\u2019s claim depends on the first amendment, not the due process clause. No state prison may penalize the freedom of speech just because the coin in which the penalty is exacted does not count as \u201cliberty or property\u201d for purposes of a separate clause in the Constitution. See, e.g., <em>DeTomaso v. McGinnis, </em>970 F.2d 211, 214 (7th Cir.1992); <em>Haymes v. Montanye, </em>547 F.2d 188 (2d Cir.1976). Rights of expression are curtailed in prison, see <em>Shaw v. Murphy, </em>532 U.S. 223, 121 S.Ct. 1475, 149 L.Ed.2d 420 (2001), and perhaps the defendants had a good reason for reacting to Trinidad\u2019s use of the prayer. But that question must be answered through the lens of cases such as <em>Shaw </em>rather than by reference to <em>Sandin </em>and a different part of the Bill of Rights. Our order may have misled the district court by using a phrase (\u201csome evidence\u201d) with due process connotations, but we mentioned the first amendment as the basis of the claim, so this phrase should not have sidetracked the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">Far too much time has elapsed in this case, and we have not yet reached the point of serving process on the defendants. Trinidad filed his first appeal in 1999. He should not have had to file a second to obtain compliance with our decision. The judgment is reversed, the case is remanded, and the district judge must implement our mandate forthwith. The mandate will issue immediately. No petition for rehearing will be entertained.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
