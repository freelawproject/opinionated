The case has been referred to this panel pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. We unanimously agree that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-12\">The district court did not err in denying Young\u2019s motion. Whether the district court had the authority to modify Young\u2019s sentence is a question-of law subject to de novo review. <em>United States v. Ross, </em>245 F.3d 577, 585 (6th Cir.2001). A district court\u2019s authority to resentence a defendant is limited by \u00a7 3582 to specific circumstances, none of which is present in this action. <em>See id. </em>at 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-13\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
