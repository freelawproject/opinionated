R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b742-9\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">Lawrence Broadnax appeals pro se the judgment of the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel (\u201cBAP\u201d) affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s dismissal of an involuntary bankruptcy petition against appellee, Leodis C. Matthews. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-11\">We independently review a bankruptcy court\u2019s rulings on appeal from the BAP. <em>Wolkowitz v. Shearson Lehman Bros. (In re Weisberg), </em>136 F.3d 655, 657 (9th Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-17\">Broadnax contends that the bankruptcy court erred in dismissing his involuntary petition because the court failed to give Broadnax notice that: (1) it was considering dismissal under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 305 rather than 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 303; and (2) it was treating Matthews\u2019 motion to dismiss as a summary judgment motion. <em>See Lucas v. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>66 F.3d 245, 248 (9th Cir. 1995). Both arguments fail because dismissal was proper on the pleadings alone. <em>See Mayer v. Wedgewood Neighborhood Coalition, </em>707 F.2d 1020, 1022 (9th Cir. 1983). Broadnax lacks standing to commence an involuntary case under \u00a7 303 because the petition fails on its face to explain why Matthews should be charged with debts allegedly owed by Westland Architecture and Development Corporation. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 303; <em>Chicago Title Ins. Co. v. Seko Inv., Inc. (In re Seko Inv., Inc.), </em>156 F.3d 1005, 1007 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-18\">The bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Broadnax\u2019s pro se petition without granting leave to' amend because any proposed amendment would be futile. <em>See Lucas, </em>66 F.3d at 248. At best, any amendment would establish that the claims against Matthews are \u201cthe subject of a bona fide dispute,\u201d and therefore not appropriate for resolution in an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding. See 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 303(b)(1); <em>Chicago Title, </em>156 F.3d at 1007.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-19\">Finally, the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Broad-nax\u2019s request to appear at the hearing on Matthews\u2019 motion to dismiss because Broadnax failed to show that his appear-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>anee or testimony was \u201creasonably necessary in the interest of justice.\u201d <em>Price v. Johnston, </em>334 U.S. 266, 278-80, 68 S.Ct. 1049, 92 L.Ed. 1356 (1948). The record provides no indication that Broadnax could add any substance in support of his claims against Matthews.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b742-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
