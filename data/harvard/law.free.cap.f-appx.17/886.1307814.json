R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">Appellant, Francisco Sosa, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of the civil rights complaint he brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. In his complaint, Sosa alleged that defendants violated his Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights by requiring him to provide blood and saliva samples after his conviction. <em>See </em>Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 21-2511. The district court concluded that Sosa\u2019s claim was foreclosed by Tenth Circuit precedent, <em>see Schlicher v.(NFN) Peters, I &amp; I, </em>103 F.3d 940, 943 (10th Cir.1996), and dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">Sosa attempts to amend his complaint to add additional claims. Any proposed amendment of the complaint would not cure its substantive deficiencies and would be futile. The district court, therefore, properly dismissed Sosa\u2019s complaint. <em>See McKinney v. Okla. Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., </em>925 F.2d 363, 365 (10th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">Upon review of Sosa\u2019s complaint and appellate brief, and <em>de novo </em>review of the district court\u2019s order and the entire record on appeal, this court affirms the district court\u2019s dismissal of Sosa\u2019s complaint for substantially those reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s order dated April 9, 2001.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Sosa is reminded that he remains obligated to continue making partial payments until his appellate filing fee is paid in full. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(b). Sosa\u2019s Motion to Appear in <em>Propria Persona </em>is construed as a request for oral argument and is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b915-9\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b915-23\">. This court rotes that the district court\u2019s dismissal of Sosa\u2019s complaint on the ground that it failed to state a claim constitutes a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Jennings v. Natrona County Det. Ctr. Med. Facility, </em>175 F.3d 775, 780 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
