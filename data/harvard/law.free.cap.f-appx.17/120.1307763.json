Gray appeals the district court\u2019s order denying relief on his 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983 (West Supp.2000) complaint. We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>Gray v. Wexford Health Sources, Inc., </em>No. CA-97-1247-5 (S.D.W.Va. Sept. 13, 2000). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
