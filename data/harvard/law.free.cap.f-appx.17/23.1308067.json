(i) denying his motion under Fed.R.Crim.P. 33 for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence and (ii) dismissing as untimely his petition (under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 and, in the alternative, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255) for a writ of habeas corpus on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel. Gallagher was convicted by a jury on four counts of committing violent crimes for the purpose of maintaining or increasing position in a criminal enterprise, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1959, and two weapons charges, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1). The charges arose out of Gallagher\u2019s alleged involvement with one of the warring factions of the Colombo Organized Crime Family. We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Gallagher\u2019s motion for a new trial. We further agree that Gallagher\u2019s petition for habeas relief, which we construe as a motion to vacate his conviction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, was untimely, and affirm its dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">1. <em>Motion for New Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant Gallagher a new trial. The alleged new evidence presented by Gallagher consisted primarily of affidavits of Thomas McLaughlin \u2014 the intended victim of one of the charged crimes of violence, a shooting, which formed the basis for one of the weapons counts \u2014 and Sarah Palazzolo, Gallagher\u2019s former girlfriend. McLaughlin\u2019s affidavit stated that he clearly saw the man who shot at him, as well as the three other individuals accompanying the man, and that he did not recognize any of them as being Gallagher. McLaughlin \u2014 a member of the Colombo Family faction warring with Gallagher\u2019s faction \u2014 refused to testify at Gallagher\u2019s trial because he had pending racketeering charges against him at the time and feared incriminating himself. An affidavit of one of Gallagher\u2019s trial attorneys, Jeffrey Lichtman, established that the defense was aware of the substance of McLaughlin\u2019s affidavit at the time of trial because Licht-man had interviewed McLaughlin as part of the trial team\u2019s pretrial investigation. Palazzolo stated in her affidavit that Gallagher could not have committed one of the charged crimes on the date alleged (June 4, 1992) because she had several phone conversations with him that day and was with him the night of June 4 through June 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-12\">It was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to deny Gallagher a new trial based on this evidence. <em>See United States v.. Ferguson, </em>246 F.3d 129, 133 (2d Cir.2001) (reviewing district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial under Fed.R.Civ.P. 33 for abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-13\">The substance of McLaughlin\u2019s proposed testimony was known to the defense at the time of trial; no effort was made to alert the district court of this fact or secure the testimony notwithstanding McLaughlin\u2019s fear of self-incrimination. <em>See United States v. Siddiqi, </em>959 F.2d 1167, 1173 (2d Cir.1992) (noting new trial under Fed.R.Crim.P. 33 based on newly discovered evidence is warranted if the evidence \u201ccould not have been discovered, exercising due diligence, before or during trial\u201d). There is a difference between evidence that is newly discovered and evidence that was previously known but has become newly available. <em>See United States v. Jacobs, </em>475 F.2d 270, 286 n. 33 (2d Cir.1973) (\u201c[A] court must exercise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>great caution in considering evidence to be \u2018newly discovered\u2019 when it existed all along and was unavailable only because a co-defendant, since convicted, had availed himself of his privilege not to testify.\u201d). Similarly, the identity of Palazzolo, a former girlfriend, was known to Gallagher prior to trial and an individual exercising due diligence would have spoken to close friends or girlfriends at the time of a charged crime to determine whether an alibi defense was available.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">Gallagher has also failed to demonstrate that the testimony of either McLaughlin or Palazzolo would have changed the outcome. <em>See United States v. Sasso, </em>59 F.3d 341, 350 (2d Cir.1995) (new trial based on newly discovered evidence \u201cshould be granted only if the evidence is material to the verdict ... and is not cumulative\u201d); <em>United States v. Gordils, </em>982 F.2d 64, 72 (2d Cir .1992) (new trial should be granted only under \u201cthe most extraordinary circumstances\u201d where the newly discovered evidence \u201cwould probably lead to acquittal\u201d); <em>Siddiqi, </em>959 F.2d at 1173 (evidence must be \u201cso material and non-cumulative that its admission would probably lead to an acquittal\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). Nothing in the testimony of McLaughlin or Palazzolo is directly incompatible with the prosecution\u2019s evidence implicating Gallagher in the charged shooting. The Government established, and the defense conceded, that McLaughlin would have been heavily cross-examined if he had testified at trial, and the jury would have been faced with a credibility contest. In addition, the information offered by Palazzolo fails to establish an alibi because, even if Palazzolo\u2019s affidavit is credited, Gallagher would still have had time enough on June 4, 1992 to commit the alleged crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">2. <em>Petition for Habeas Relief</em></p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">This Court affirmed Gallagher\u2019s conviction and sentence on June 3, 1997, <em>see United States v. Malpeso, </em>115 F.3d 155 (2d Cir.1997), and Gallagher filed his petition for habeas relief on October 14, 1999\u2014 over two years later \u2014 arguing his attorney was ineffective during the plea negotiations stage because he underestimated Gallagher\u2019s sentencing exposure at 20 years, leading Gallagher to reject the government\u2019s plea offer of 10 years. Gallagher ultimately received 39 years, which was upheld by this Court. <em>See id. </em>at 170-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">The district court construed Gallagher\u2019s petition for habeas relief as a petition brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 and, in the alternative, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. To the extent Gallagher sought \u00a7 2255 relief, his motion was untimely under AEDPA\u2019s one-year statute of limitation. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (\u201cA 1-year period of limitation shall apply to a motion under this section.\u201d). In Gallagher\u2019s case, the one-year period began to run from the later of \u201c(1) the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final; ... or (4) the date on which the facts supporting the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">Gallagher argues that the one-year period, which began on the date his conviction became final, should be re-started under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(4) to a date as of early 1999, when he read a summary of this Court\u2019s decision finding an attorney ineffective where the attorney \u201cgrossly underestimated] [the defendant\u2019s] sentencing exposure\u201d, <em>United States v. Gordon, </em>156 F.3d 376, 380 (2d Cir.1998). This argument is unavailing. First, Gallagher knew in June 1997, when this Court affirmed his conviction and sentence, that his trial counsel\u2019s legal reasoning concerning his sentence exposure was flawed. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number><em>Malpeso, </em>115 F.3d at 170-71. Second, the principle that an attorney may be found to be constitutionally ineffective for deficient representation during the plea negotiations stage was well established before this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Gordon. See Boria v. Keane, </em>99 F.3d 492, 497 (2d Cir.1996) (attorney\u2019s advice at plea negotiations stage constitutionally defective where attorney failed to attempt to persuade defendant to accept a desirable plea offer); <em>see also Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 56, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985) (claim of ineffective assistance of counsel applies to counsel\u2019s performance during plea negotiations).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Assuming that the application of an existing legal rule to a new factual predicate can be a \u201cfact[ ] supporting the claim or claims presented\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(4), \u201ca duly diligent person in [Gallagher]\u2019s circumstances would have discovered\u201d prior to October 14, 1998 (one year before Gallagher filed his petition) that he had a claim for ineffectiveness based on his attorney\u2019s conduct at the plea negotiations. <em>Wims v. United States, </em>225 F.3d 186, 190 (2d Cir.2000). The accrual of a particular claim does not depend on the applicability of a legal principle to a factual predicate identical to petitioner\u2019s case. <em>See id. </em>(characterizing \u00a7 2255(4) as resetting the limitations period \u201cto the later date on which the particular claim accrued\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Gallagher does not invoke 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 on this appeal. However, even if such an argument were preserved, \u00a7 2241 would be unavailable. \u201cA motion pursuant to \u00a7 2241 generally challenges the execution of a federal prisoner\u2019s sentence, including such matters as the administration of parole, computation of a prisoner\u2019s sentence by prison officials, prison disciplinary actions, prison transfers, type of detention and prison conditions.\u201d Jiminian <em>v. Nash, </em>245 F.3d 144, 146 (2d Cir.2001) (emphasis added) (citing <em>Chambers v. United States, </em>106 F.3d 472, 474-75 (2d Cir.1997) (articulating instances where a federal prisoner may properly file a \u00a7 2241 petition)). \u201cIn contrast, \u00a7 2255 is generally the proper vehicle for a federal prisoner\u2019s challenge to [the imposition of] his conviction and sentence^]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 146-47. The general rule is that \u201ca federal prisoner must use \u00a7 2255 instead of seeking a writ of habeas corpus under \u00a7 2241\u201d unless \u00a7 2255 provides an \u201c\u2018inadequate or ineffective [remedy] to test the legality of [a federal prisoner\u2019s] detention.\u2019 \u201d <em>Triestman v. United States, </em>124 F.3d 361, 373-74 (2d Cir.1997) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">Here, Gallagher is challenging his conviction and sentence based on the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. This is not a claim that itself falls under \u00a7 2241, and it cannot be said that serious constitutional questions are raised by the denial of \u00a7 2255 review by reason of Gallagher\u2019s failure to timely file a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Triestman, </em>124 F.3d at 377 (noting that \u00a7 2255 may be inadequate or ineffective in circumstances in which \u201cthe petitioner cannot, for whatever reason, utilize \u00a7 2255, and in which the failure to allow for collateral review would raise serious constitutional questions\u201d); <em>see also Jiminian, </em>245 F.3d at 147-48 (holding Section \u201c2255 is not inadequate or ineffective, such that a federal prisoner may file a \u00a7 2241(c)(3) petition, simply because a prisoner cannot meet the AEDPA\u2019s gate-keeping requirements, provided that the claim the prisoner seeks to raise was previously available on direct appeal or in a prior \u00a7 2255 motion\u201d); <em>Triestman, </em>124 F.3d at 376 (noting that if \u201chabeas corpus is preserved whenever a federal prisoner faces a substantive or procedural barrier to \u00a7 2255 relief\u2019, Congress\u2019 attempts \u201cto place limits on federal collateral review\u201d would be undermined).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>Finally, to the extent Gallagher is arguing that the doctrine of equitable tolling should apply, he has failed to demonstrate that \u201cextraordinary circumstances prevented [him] from filing his petition on time\u201d and that he acted with reasonable diligence throughout the period he seeks to toll. <em>Smith v. McGinnis, </em>208 F.3d 13, 17 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 840, 121 S.Ct. 104, 148 L.Ed.2d 63 (2000), (citing <em>Johnson v. Nyack Hosp., </em>86 F.3d 8, 12 (2d Cir.1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
