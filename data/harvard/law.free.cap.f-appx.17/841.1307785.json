Because Mr. Sack has failed to make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2), we deny his request and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">In 1990, Mr. Sack pleaded guilty to second degree murder, Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 21, \u00a7 701.8, and possession of a fictitious driver\u2019s license, <em>id. </em>tit. 47, \u00a7 6-301(2)(c), both after two or more felony convictions. The state court sentenced Mr. Sack to forty years on the second degree murder charge and twenty years on the fictitious driver\u2019s license charge, sentences to run concurrently. Aplt.App. at 22. Mr. Sack did not file a motion to withdraw his guilty plea, nor did he file a direct appeal. He did file a state post-conviction motion which the state court denied as procedurally barred. <em>See Sack v. Champion, </em>133 F.3d 932, No. 97-7017, 1998 WL 3280, at *1 (10th Cir. Jan.7, 1998) (reciting procedural history).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-12\">In 1992, Mr. Sack filed a federal habeas petition asserting several grounds for relief. ApltApp. at 22. The district court dismissed the petition as procedurally barred. This court vacated that decision and remanded the case to the district court in order to address Mr. Sack\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims. <em>See Sack v. Champion, </em>38 F.3d 1220, No. 94-7018, 1994 WL 577526 (10th Cir. Oct.21, 1994). On remand, the district court dismissed the claims once again as procedurally barred. We reversed that dismissal in part and remanded to the district court to consider the merits of Petitioner\u2019s claims regarding his competency at the time he entered his guilty plea and ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Sack v. Champion, </em>1998 WL 3280, at *2-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-13\">On remand, the district court appointed counsel to represent Mr. Sack and assigned the case to a magistrate judge to conduct an evidentiary hearing. The magistrate judge issued Findings and Recommendations (\u201cF &amp; R\u201d) finding/concluding that Mr. Sack was competent to enter his pleas, I R. Doc. 163, at 5, that Mr. Sack had failed to demonstrate any grounds for the setting aside of his pleas, <em>id. </em>at 7, and that he had not received ineffective assistance of counsel because his counsel performed competently under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>the circumstances and Mr. Sack could not demonstrate prejudice from the alleged omissions. <em>Id. </em>at 13,17, 20, 21. Mr. Sack filed objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report. <em>Id. </em>Doc. 167. After consideration of Mr. Sack\u2019s objections, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s F &amp; R, <em>id. </em>Doe. 170, and denied Mr. Sack\u2019s request for a COA. <em>Id. </em>Doc. 172. We construe Mr. Sack\u2019s notice of appeal as a renewed application for a COA, as he urges in his brief, Aplt. Br. at 10. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 22(b)(2); I R. Doc. 171.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">On appeal, Mr. Sack argues that (1) the district court framed the ineffective assistance issue solely as one of attorney competence, and did not address the attorney conflict, not only inherent in the facts, but squarely presented by appellant, (2) the district court\u2019s \u201cfindings and conclusions of attorney competence are clearly erroneous and fail[ ] to consider the egregiousness of a single omission, or failure, or misrepresentation of a law or fact, and in totality, the necessary alteration of the voluntary, knowing and intelligent character the guilty plea must represent,\u201d (3) the State\u2019s imposition of cruel and unusual punishment rendered appellant incompetent to enter a knowing, voluntary and intelligent plea of guilt, and (4) the evidentiary hearing was neither full nor fair. <em>See </em>Aplt. Br. at 11,18, 39, 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">Given our standards of review, Mr. Sack has not demonstrated that \u201creasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). Ineffective assistance of counsel claims are mixed questions of law and fact reviewed de novo. <em>Smith v. Gibson, </em>197 F.3d 454, 461 (10th Cir.1999). Underlying findings of fact made by the magistrate judge and adopted by the district court are accepted unless clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Blackwell, </em>127 F.3d 947, 955 (10th Cir.1997). Likewise, the magistrate\u2019s finding of competency adopted by the district court is accepted unless clearly erroneous. <em>Miles v. Dorsey, </em>61 F.3d 1459, 1472 (10th Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">It does not appear that Mr. Sack raised the ineffective assistance of counsel claim based upon conflict of interest until his objections to the magistrate\u2019s F &amp; R. Regardless, to prevail upon an ineffective assistance of counsel claim due to conflict and obtain a presumption of prejudice, Mr. Sack must demonstrate that counsel represented actively conflicting interests and that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected counsel\u2019s performance. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 692, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 348, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980). Mr. Sack has shown neither \u2014 an ineffective assistance claim does not become a conflict claim merely because Mr. Sack strongly disagrees with counsel\u2019s handling of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">After having thoroughly reviewed the record on appeal and Mr. Sack\u2019s submissions to this court in light of the applicable standards, it is apparent that the findings by the magistrate judge are supported by the record and the legal conclusions follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-10\">Finally, Mr. Sack\u2019s claim that he did not receive a full and fair evidentiary hearing is meritless. He cannot demonstrate that the magistrate judge\u2019s decision to not sequester the witnesses during the hearing was an abuse of discretion or resulted in prejudice. <em>See United States v. Greschner, </em>802 F.2d 373, 376 (10th Cir. 1986). Likewise, Mr. Sack\u2019s objections to an in-chambers conference where his counsel alerted the court to a potential ethical problem (Mr. Sack\u2019s inconsistent testimony) without Mr. Sack\u2019s presence, II R. at 172-74 (transcript of evidentiary hearing), did not render the proceedings fundamen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>tally unfair. The exchange was brief, the magistrate reminded counsel of his attorney-client obligation, and counsel pursued the case competently.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">We DENY Mr. Sack\u2019s request for a COA and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b870-14\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. This court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
