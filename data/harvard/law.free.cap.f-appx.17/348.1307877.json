Pennycuff, finding that he had attained tenurial status prior to the termination of his employment by the Fentress County Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">After the district court\u2019s grant of partial summary judgment, the Tennessee Supreme Court decided the issue of \u201cwhether notification by the superintendent under Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 49-5-504(b) is required before a teacher attains permanent tenure, even when the teacher has satisfied the provisions set forth in Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 49-5-503(2)(A)-(D).\u201d <em>Bowden v. Memphis Bd. of Educ., </em>29 S.W.3d 462, 465 (Tenn.2000). The parties agree that the superintendent did not notify the Board with regard to the effect of PennycufPs rehiring. Of course, the district court did not have the benefit of this opinion, which appears to control at least one of the issues presented here. We therefore REVERSE the judgment of the district court and REMAND for the court to reconsider PennycufPs motion for partial summary judgment in light of <em>Bow-den. </em>The district court may also consider the arguments presented in PennycufPs motion that are unrelated to the application of <em>Bowden.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
