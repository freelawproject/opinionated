The district court disagreed and granted summary judgment to the government holding that equitable subrogation does not apply where the party has actual notice of a preexisting subordinate encumbrance. This appeal followed. The facts and prior proceedings are known to the parties; they are not restated herein except as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-15\">Equitable subrogation is a state-law doctrine and therefore whether it applies here turns on Nevada law. As we have noted, \u201c[tjhere is limited Nevada authority on the doctrine of equitable subrogation.\u201d Mort <em>v. United States </em>86 F.3d 890, 893 (9th Cir.1996). \u201cWhere Nevada law is lacking, its courts have looked to the law of other jurisdictions, particularly California, for guidance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In keeping with this tradition, we too have looked to the law of other jurisdictions, particularly California, to supplement Nevada\u2019s equitable subrogation jurisprudence. <em>See id. </em>at 893-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-16\">In <em>Han v. United States </em>944 F.2d 526 (9th Cir.1991), we noted that under California law \u201cequitable subrogation is denied to a party who has \u2018actual\u2019 knowledge of an existing encumbrance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 530 <em>(citing Smith v. State Savings &amp; Loan Association, </em>175 Cal.App.3d 1092, 1098, 223 Cal.Rptr. 298 (1985)). Because it is undisputed that Home Haven had <em>actual </em>notice of the federal tax hen, Home Haven is, therefore, barred from use of the doctrine of equitable subrogation. Accordingly, the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b541-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b541-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
