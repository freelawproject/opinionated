Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we will not set them out in detail. We have jurisdiction under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153, and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-11\">Petitioners contend there is no regulatory or statutory provision preventing them from removing N1590R\u2019s identification plate and reattaching it after a \u201cnose to tail overhaul.\u201d They are mistaken. Except when necessary during general maintenance procedures, 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 45.13(c) unambiguously prohibits the removal or installation of a plane\u2019s identification plate without prior approval from the Administrator. We agree with the NTSB and the FAA that Petitioner\u2019s \u201coverhaul\u201d of NI590R, which included the wholesale replacement of the engine, wings, and fuselage, cannot be characterized as a maintenance procedure. Petitioners plainly violated \u00a7 45.13(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-14\">With respect to the 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 43.12(a) violation, Petitioners argue the Administrator failed to carry her burden of proving Hollingsworth knowingly falsified N1590R\u2019s maintenance log. The record reflects otherwise. It is undisputed Hollingsworth recorded that N1590R\u2019s frame was replaced \u201cwith a used serviceable frame\u201d having 1022.1 hours of \u201ctotal in service\u201d time. At the hearing, he testified that he could not determine the origin of the replacement frame because the identification plate had been removed. This admission confirms Petitioners\u2019 violation. Absent knowledge of the replacement frame\u2019s flight history, Hollingsworth knew that he could not accurately represent the service time.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-15\">Petitioners also contend that the FAA\u2019s re-issuance of Dan\u2019s Aircraft\u2019s repair station certificate estops the Administrator from defending the emergency revocation orders. We disagree. The only issue before the NTSB was the propriety of the initial revocations. The FAA\u2019s subsequent re-issuance of Dan\u2019s Aircraft\u2019s certificate had no bearing on this inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-16\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b758-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
