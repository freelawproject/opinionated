Reavley, United States Senior Circuit Judge for the Fifth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b842-7\">ORDER AND JUDGMENT <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<author id=\"b842-8\">REAVLEY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-10\">The 1951 and 1953 assignments provided that the overriding royalty would be paid on the value of the gas \u201cat the wells as produced\u201d (1951) or \u201cat the time of production\u201d (1953). As is true of royalty usually, the costs of production from the well are not attributed to the royalty owner. Appellant royalty owner contends that \u201cthe time of production\u201d is when gas is sold at the tailgate of the treatment plant, and that the costs of the treatment should be borne by the lessee. Whatever the chances for that contention, looking only at the bare words of the assignment, they are lost when the circumstances of production and sale in 1953 are considered. Contracts are construed in the context of the existing facts and circumstances, and in 1953 the gas from these properties was being produced and sold to pipelines at the wellhead. Some 30 years later the wells began to produce only coal seam gas, which had to be processed to remove carbon dioxide and water before being sold at the tailgate of the treatment plant. It would be rewriting the assignment to move the \u201ctime of production\u201d from wellhead to tailgate to favor the royalty owner. Appellant\u2019s construction of the 1953 assignment fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-14\">We do agree with the district court that the \u201cmost favored nation\u201d clause creates an ambiguity, and the court\u2019s resolution of that question is supported by the evidence. Appellee clearly states that the royalty paid to appellant has been and will be computed consistently with that paid to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-15\">As for appellant\u2019s contention that the federal royalty valuations should be computed only under the federal regulation in effect at the time of the assignments, the government\u2019s leases expressly provide that they are subject to later reasonable regulation. Appellant stays with the government; and if the government\u2019s royalty changes, so does appellant\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-16\">Appellant objects to tying its rights to the outcome of pending administrative proceedings between appellee and the government. We see no problem. The court was correct to avoid ruling on issues pending before the agency. And the court decided all of appellant\u2019s claims, rendering a final judgment. That judgment is now</p>\n<p id=\"b842-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b842-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
