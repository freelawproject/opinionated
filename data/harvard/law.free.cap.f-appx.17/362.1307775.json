The district court sentenced him according to the recommendations in the presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d), in which the probation officer took into consideration Henderson\u2019s admissions that he had purchased and distributed approximately 3]&amp; ounces of crack cocaine in 1999, and had distributed approximately 8 to 9 ounces between 1995 and 1999. The district court found that those previous dealings were part of the same course of conduct as the charged offenses and held Henderson responsible for distributing a total of 8 ounces of crack cocaine. The court sentenced him to 168 months in prison, to be followed by six years of supervised release. Henderson now appeals his sentence, arguing that the district court erred in considering his admissions as relevant conduct. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-14\">In October of 1997, local law enforcement officers began investigating a group called the \u201cDawg Pound,\u201d which allegedly was responsible for a substantial amount of cocaine trafficking in Lincoln County, Tennessee. On January 23, 1999, defendant Henderson sold .2 grams of cocaine hydrochloride (cocaine powder) to a confidential informant working with the officers, and on March 28, 1999, he sold .6 grams of cocaine base (crack) again to a confidential informant. Based on those sales, Henderson was charged on September 14, 1999, in a two-count indictment for distribution of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-15\">On December 8, 1999, Henderson, being represented by counsel, pled guilty to both counts without a plea agreement. On March 13, 2000, the district court conducted a sentencing hearing and considered the circumstances described in paragraphs 9 and 10 of the presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-16\">9. The defendant was arrested by local authorities on August 26, 1999, in Fayetteville. After being advised of his rights by law enforcement personnel, Mr. Henderson stated that he had been selling cocaine for the previous eight months. He identified his source for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>cocaine and estimated that he had purchased and distributed approximately 31/ ounces (99.2 grams) of crack cocaine in the previous eight months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-4\">10. Mr. Henderson was interviewed again on October 14, 1999, after his arrest on the federal warrant. He again waived liis rights and talked about having sold crack cocaine since 1995, he stated that from 1995 until 1996, he was purchasing crack cocaine from a source in Nashville. He estimated that he purchased 1/4-ounce quantities of crack from this source on 20 to- 30 occasions. He related that he was sent to prison on August of 1996 after being convicted of possession of crack cocaine for resale. He admitted that soon after his release (in about July of 1998), he began selling cocaine again. He confessed that between July of 1998 and August of 1999, he bought about 1/4-ounce of crack cocaine on five or six occasions. He also admitted having purchased about 1/4-ounce of cocaine hydrochloride. He estimated that he sold a total of eight to nine ounces of crack cocaine between 1995 and 1999.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">(Emphasis in original). Based on Henderson\u2019s own statements, the probation officer concluded in the PSR that Henderson should be held accountable for the distribution of eight ounces (226.8 grams) of crack cocaine. Accordingly, using the Drug Quantity Table under United States Sentencing Guideline (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(3), the probation officer set Henderson\u2019s base offense level at 34. After subtracting two level, for acceptance of responsibility (U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a)) and one level for timely notification of his guilty plea (U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b)), the resulting offense level was 31 with a guideline range of 168-210 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">At sentencing, Henderson objected to the PSR\u2019s calculation of drug quantity because he claimed that using drug sales from 1995 was too far removed from the charged offenses, and the government did not corroborate Henderson\u2019s past drug activities through some evidence other than Henderson\u2019s own statements. The district court disagreed, however, and found that the PSR correctly reflected the relevant conduct and that it \u201cproperly figured in th[e] quantity.\u201d The district court sentenced Henderson to concurrent sentences of 168 months, at the low end of the applicable guideline range, to be followed by six years of supervised release. Henderson now appeals his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">We review the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo, </em>and the findings of fact for purposes of sentencing for clear error. <em>United States v. Layne, </em>192 F.3d 556, 578 (6th Cir.1999). \u201cThere are inconsistent opinions in this circuit regarding the proper standard of review in cases where a district court has determined that certain activity qualifies as \u2018relevant conduct.\u201d \u2019 <em>United States v. Shafer, </em>199 F.3d 826, 830 (6th Cir.1999). In a case such as this, where the facts are undisputed and the only question involves an application of law to the facts, our review is <em>de novo. Id.; see United States v. Hill, </em>79 F.3d 1477, 1481 (6th Cir.1996) (finding that whether certain facts warrant the application of a particular guideline provision is a legal question to be reviewed <em>de novo).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">Henderson first argues that the district court erred by considering his pri- or drug trafficking as \u201crelevant conduct\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3 because there was no proof other than his own admissions that such quantities were ever sold. He claims that admissions of a defendant at a sentencing hearing must be corroborated just as if the defendant were at trial. In support of that argument, Henderson relies on <em>Opper v. United States, </em>348 U.S. 84, 75 S.Ct. 158, 99 L.Ed. 101 (1954), in which the Supreme Court held that admissions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>and confessions of a defendant must be corroborated by \u201csubstantial independent evidence which would tend to establish the trustworthiness of the statement.\u201d <em>Opper, </em>348 U.S. at 93, 75 S.Ct. 158. It is \u201csufficient if the corroboration supports the essential facts admitted sufficiently to justify a jury inference of their truth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, Henderson argues, the principle in <em>Opper </em>applies equally at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The government claims that the corroboration rale in <em>Opper </em>is not applicable at the sentencing stage. \u201cThe standard has always been that a sentence may not properly be imposed on the basis of material misinformation, ... but specific procedures, such as are required at trial, are simply not constitutionally mandated, especially when a guilty plea is entered.\u201d <em>United States v. Silverman, </em>976 F.2d 1502, 1508 (6th Cir.1992) (citing <em>Roberts v.. United States, </em>445 U.S. 552, 100 S.Ct. 1358, 63 L.Ed.2d 622 (1980)). The government argues that Henderson\u2019s two separate statements admitting to drug trafficking in large quantities from 1995 through 1999, except for a 23-month period of incarceration, are uncontradicted and are sufficiently reliable for the court to consider in calculating the quantity of drugs to use in determining Henderson\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">We find that the district court did not err in relying on Henderson\u2019s statements described in the PSR without requiring independent corroborating evidence. Henderson\u2019s admissions regarding the quantity of drags sold were made freely, and he does not contest the truthfulness of his statements. \u201cIn most instances, a sentencing court may rely on undisputed facts that are recited in a presentence report to conclude that the defendant committed acts offered as relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Shafer, </em>199 F.3d at 830 n. 1. Henderson has cited no authority for his position that the corroboration requirement described in <em>Opper </em>applies at sentencing. We agree with the government that, on the contrary, the procedures used at trial are generally not applicable at sentencing. <em>See Silverman, </em>976 F.2d at 1508. Under these circumstances, we reject Henderson\u2019s claim that the district court\u2019s reliance on the PSR constitutes reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">Henderson also claims that the district court erred in counting as \u201crelevant conduct\u201d cocaine sales that occurred between 1995 and 1996, almost four years prior to the sales charged in the indictment. As stated above, the PSR indicates that Henderson purchased and distributed approximately 3}\u00e9 ounces (99.2 grams) of crack cocaine in 1999 in the eight months immediately prior to his arrest. Additionally, the PSR indicates that from 1995 to 1996 he purchased crack cocaine from a source in Nashville approximately twenty to thirty times until his incarceration in 1996. Henderson admitted that soon after he was released from jail in July of 1998 he began selling cocaine again. He estimated that between 1995 and 1999 he sold a total of 8 to 9 ounces (226.8 grams to 255.15 grams) of crack cocaine. From those statements, the district court found that Henderson\u2019s past drag dealing was \u201crelevant conduct\u201d pursuant to U .S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3. The court held Henderson accountable for the distribution of 8 ounces (226.8 grams) of crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">Henderson objected to the use of his statements relating to his drag dealing activities between 1995 and 1999. Henderson\u2019s counsel argued, \u201cI think it\u2019s quite a stretch to go back to 1995 and take his statements as to what he did between 1995 and 1999, that hasn\u2019t anything to do with what\u2019s relevant today, what\u2019s the same course of conduct of something that took place in 1999.\u201d The court rejected Henderson\u2019s argument, finding that his 1995-1999 activities related to the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>course of conduct and a common scheme or plan as the counts of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">On appeal, Henderson challenges only the district court\u2019s consideration of his admissions regarding his drug activities that took place prior to his 1996 incarceration, which lasted from August 1996 to July 1998. He claims that his earlier conduct was simply not part of the same course of conduct nor part of a common scheme or plan in relation to the counts of conviction. He argues that the 23 months he spent in prison (presumably refraining from any drug dealing during that time) is a sufficient length of time to break up a course of conduct or interrupt a common scheme or plan. Because, he claims, it is impossible to tell how much of the eight ounces pre-dated his 1996-1998 incarceration, the whole amount should be disregarded and the court should punish him for only the .8 grams total from the counts of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Relevant conduct includes all acts committed by the defendant that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction, in preparation for that offense, or in the course of attempting to avoid detection for that offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(A). Relevant conduct also includes, with respect to offenses of a character for which \u00a7 3D1.2(d) would require grouping of multiple counts, all acts that were part of the same course of conduct, or common scheme or plan, as the offense of conviction. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2). A common scheme or plan means that the offenses are connected by at least one common factor, such as common victims, common accomplices, common purpose, or similar <em>modus operandi. </em>U .S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, applic. note 9(A). The same course of conduct means the offenses are part of an ongoing series of offenses, or \u201cif they warrant the conclusion that they are part of a single episode, spree, or ongoing series of offenses.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, applic. note 9(B). Though \u201ccommon scheme or plan\u201d and \u201csame course of conduct\u201d do not mean exactly the same thing, they do overlap considerably. <em>Hill, </em>79 F.3d at 1483.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">The three factors relevant to determining whether certain activity constitutes the \u201csame course of conduct\u201d are whether the offenses include \u201cthe degree of similarity of the offenses, the regularity (repetitions) of the offenses, and the time interval between the offenses.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, comment (n.9(B)). When one of those factors is weak or absent, a stronger presence of at least one of the other factors is necessary to support a finding that certain activities constitute \u201crelevant conduct.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">Henderson\u2019s history of drug dealing would easily fit into the \u201csame course of conduct\u201d category because of the high degree of similarity and regularity between the offenses. However, the 23-month hiatus in drug dealing arising from Henderson\u2019s 1996 incarceration indicates a significant temporal break in his course of conduct. Nevertheless, \u201ca lapse of time between prior conduct and the offense of conviction does not necessarily indicate that a defendant abandoned a particular course of conduct; rather, such a lapse may result when participants are forced to put the venture \u2018on hold.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hill, </em>79 F.3d at 1483.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">For example, in <em>United States v. Nunez, </em>958 F.2d 196, 198 (7th Cir.1992), a finding of relevant conduct was upheld where a two-year lapse between the uncharged drug sales and the offense of conviction resulted in part because the buyer had been incarcerated during that time. Also, in <em>United States v. Cedano-Rojas, </em>999 F.2d 1175, 1180 (7th Cir.1993), the court upheld a finding that the defendant had engaged in the same course of conduct when the prior drug transactions had oc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>curred approximately two years before the offense of conviction, during which time the supplier was unavailable. <em>See United States v. Jackson, </em>161 F.3d 24, 30 (D.C.Cir.1998) (holding that where four-year lapse between prior drug transaction and offense of conviction resulted from unavailability of suppliers, prior drug transaction constituted relevant conduct because of high degree of similarity to offense of conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Our circuit \u201chas never articulated a precise time bar after which conduct becomes irrelevant for sentencing purposes.\u201d <em>Hill, </em>79 F.3d at 1483. Where the temporal proximity factor is weak, a stronger showing of similarity and regularity can satisfy the elements for the \u201csame course of conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1484 (citing <em>United States v. Hahn, </em>960 F.2d 903, 911 (9th Cir.1992)). In the instant case, Henderson\u2019s drug trafficking activities during 1995 and 1999 are essentially indistinguishable. According to his own statement, Henderson dealt in cocaine in 1995 up until his 1996 incarceration, and he continued to deal similarly soon after his release in 1998. The twenty-three month break in business occurred only because he was \u201cforced to put the venture \u2018on hold.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1483. Under these circumstances, the district court did not err in finding that the guideline factors weigh in favor of a finding that Henderson\u2019s 1995-1996 conduct constituted the \u201csame course of conduct\u201d as the offenses of his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM Henderson\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
