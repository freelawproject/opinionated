Casciano appeals from the district court\u2019s order revoking his supervised release and imposing a sentence of 12 months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by two years\u2019 supervised release. Casciano contends on appeal that the district court clearly erred in determining that the witnesses who testified against him at his revocation hearing were credible when they stated that Casciano threatened them. The government has filed a Motion for Summary Disposition, pursuant to Loc. R. 27(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-10\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s decision to revoke supervised release for abuse of discretion, while the underlying finding that Casciano violated a term of supervised release is reviewed for clear error. <em>See e.g., United States v. Whalen, </em>82 F.3d 528, 532 (1st Cir.1996). The government has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that at least one of the conditions of the defendant\u2019s supervised release was violated. <em>United States v. Portalla, </em>985 F.2d 621, 622 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-11\">\u201cCredibility determinations by the trier of fact are accorded special deference,\u201d <em>United States v. Bouthot, </em>878 F.2d 1506, 1514 n. 8 (1st Cir.1989), particularly because only the trial court can judge a witness\u2019s demeanor or tone of voice, <em>see United States v. Carty, </em>993 F.2d 1005, 1009 (1st Cir.1993) <em>(citing Anderson v. Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 575, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1512, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985)). Where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Marrero Rivera, </em>124 F.3d 342, 347 (1st Cir.1997). Moreover, on appeal of a revocation of supervised release, we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the government. <em>See Portalla, </em>985 F.2d at 622.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-13\">Upon a careful review <em>of the </em>record, we cannot hold clearly erroneous the district court\u2019s decision to credit Watson\u2019s and Ri-opelle\u2019s testimony that Casciano threatened them. The inconsistencies complained of by Casciano on appeal are merely variations in degree of detail the witnesses gave to the various police officers who questioned them. Both witnesses testified that they gave explicit detail about the incident when asked to elaborate by authorities. Both witnesses consistently reported that Casciano had threatened them using obscenities.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-14\">Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that Casciano had made a criminal threat, resulting in a violation of a condition of supervised release, and did not abuse its discretion in deciding to revoke supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-15\">The Government\u2019s Motion for Summary Disposition is <em>granted. </em>Casciano\u2019s sentence is <em>affirmed. See </em>Loe. R. 27(c).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
