We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal of a habeas petition. <em>See McNab v. Kok, </em>170 F.3d 1246, 1247 (9th Cir.1999). However, \u201c[t]o the extent it is necessary to review findings of fact, the clearly erroneous standard applies.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Brewer, </em>923 F.2d 1361, 1364 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-13\">Jenkins was convicted by a jury of second degree murder and use of a rifle in the commission of the offense. Jenkins\u2019 conviction was affirmed by the state appellate court and the California Supreme Court denied review. Jenkins filed successive habeas petitions in state courts, which were denied, as were his motion for writ of habeas corpus in, and a request for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) from, the federal district court. This court issued a COA on one issue: whether his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel was violated by his trial attorney\u2019s failure to impeach witnesses Helen Arias and Dan Sowles with prior inconsistent statements and his failure to call Joseph Arias and Cynthia Moss as witnesses. We do not address Jenkins\u2019 other arguments because we may not consider any issue not specified in the COA. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c); <em>Hiivala v. Wood, </em>195 F.3d 1098, 1103 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-14\">A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in federal habeas petitions filed on or after AEDPA took effect on April 24, 1996 is generally analyzed under the first prong of \u201cunreasonable application\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). <em>Weighall v. Middle, </em>215 F.3d 1058, 1062 (9th Cir.2000). For a state court\u2019s application of federal law to be found unreasonable, it must be clearly erroneous. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b656-15\">The parties agree that <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), is the relevant \u201cclearly established federal law.\u201d In order to make a claim for ineffective assistance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>of counsel, defendant must establish that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that this \u201cdeficient performance\u201d caused prejudice to the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 687-88. In review of a habeas petition, a defendant claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must show that his trial counsel\u2019s deficient performance falls outside a wide range of reasonableness and that he was prejudiced by that performance. <em>See Weighall, </em>215 F.3d at 1062. Because we agree with the state courts\u2019 determinations that the performance of Jenkins\u2019 trial counsel was not unreasonable, we need not address the prejudice prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Five eyewitnesses for the prosecution testified at Jenkins\u2019 trial, all of whose testimony supported the following version of the shooting: After some type of verbal confrontation with Jenkins, the victim left Jenkins\u2019 home and was walking across the lawn to his car, presumably to leave, Jenkins then emerged from the front door of the home with a rifle which was pointed towards the victim, the victim turned around to face Jenkins, and Jenkins shot him from a distance varying between eight to twenty feet. Although Jenkins now portrays the shooting as an accident, he testified that \u201cI don\u2019t honestly know if I meant to pull that trigger or if it just happened that way.\u201d After reading the trial transcripts, the state court judge denied Jenkins\u2019 state court habeas petition, noting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-6\">All of the witnesses other than petitioner testified that he emerged from the duplex with a rifle after [the victim and his girlfriend] began walking away to their car. Indeed, [Jenkins] conceded these facts during his own testimony. Evidence adduced at trial therefore supported a finding that petitioner reignited the confrontation by emerging with his rifle. He is therefore precluded from relying upon any alleged subsequent belligerence on [the victim\u2019s] part-to justify the shooting.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Any impeachment or evidence tending to establish that [the victim] thereafter confronted [Jenkins] is immaterial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">Helen Susan Arias, along with Joseph Arias and Cynthia Moss, witnessed the events of the killing from her home located across the street from Jenkins\u2019 residence. An investigator for the public defender\u2019s office interviewed Helen Susan Arias, Joseph Arias, and Cynthia Moss, noted that the three \u201csubstantially\u201d concurred in their statements and presented an \u201cInvestigation Report,\u201d a single account in the form of a \u201ccompilation\u201d statement. The report stated that after Jenkins came out with a rifle, the victim became belligerent, and \u201cwalked right up to [Jenkins],\u201d at which time Jenkins fired. Helen Susan Arias was the only one of the three to testify at trial. Jenkins claims that she could not remember the details as to the distance between Jenkins and the victim at the time of the shooting, but the record indicates she testified that the men were eight to ten feet apart at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">Apart from the report\u2019s validity and its questionable admissibility to impeach only one party with a \u201ccompilation\u201d statement, the purpose of the impeachment is also questionable. Jenkins may have wanted the jury to infer that he fired in fear of his own well-being, as discussed above by the state court in denying Jenkins\u2019 state habeas petition, but any contra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>dictory evidence tending to establish that the victim provoked or threatened Jenkins after Jenkins emerged with the rifle was immaterial. In addition, the statement also confirmed prosecution testimony that the shooting occurred in Jenkins\u2019 front yard. Introducing this document would have impeached Jenkins\u2019 own testimony that the shooting occurred inside his home. Mere criticism of a counsel\u2019s trial tactic or strategy is not in itself sufficient to support a charge of inadequate representation. <em>See Gustave v. United States, </em>627 F.2d 901, 904 (9th Cir.1980). Impeachment evidence is considered a matter of trial tactics. <em>See id. </em>at 905. Counsel\u2019s decision not to introduce the document to impeach was a reasonable decision of trial strategy.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">Jenkins also argues that his counsel failed to impeach Sowles\u2019 testimony as to the distance between the victim and Jenkins at the time of the shooting. Jenkins claims that Sowles, who testified at trial that the deceased had been shot by Jenkins from approximately fifteen to twenty feet, should have been impeached with a police report, in which Sowles stated that Jenkins shot the victim from approximately five to six feet. Sowles testimony at trial and his statement to the police were the same in every manner except for the distance between the victim and Jenkins at the time of the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">In addition, Jenkins claims that Sowles\u2019 testimony should have been impeached with the testimony of Jenkins\u2019 sister. Jenkins maintains that his sister overheard and tape recorded a telephone conversation between Jenkins and Sowles in which Sowles stated that he had seen the victim lunge at Jenkins, causing Jenkins to step backwards and trip over a lamp, thereby accidently discharging the rifle. However, Jenkins offers no evidence that he discussed using the tape recording at trial or requested that his sister be called as a witness to testify that she had given the tape to the public defender. He has not presented a copy of the alleged tape recording nor has he presented evidence that the tape was ever received by the public defender. The only \u201cevidence\u201d in the record about this tape recording and its contents is a copy of his sister\u2019s \u201cDeclaration,\u201d not a sworn statement, dated April 2,1996, three years after Jenkins\u2019 trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In this declaration, Jenkins\u2019 sister states that she gave the public defender the original tape recording \u201cprior to trial.\u201d Jenkins has offered no evidence that his counsel was made aware of the tape or explanation why he did not use it at trial if he was aware of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">The performance of defense counsel is not rendered ineffective by making a tactical decision to not impeach witnesses\u2019 discrepancies that would have emphasized claims rebutted by the evidence. <em>See Cuffle v. Goldsmith, </em>906 F.2d 385, 388 (9th Cir.1990) (holding that counsel is not required to argue a claim that is refuted by the record). Jenkins\u2019 trial counsel made several such tactical decisions not to impeach witnesses\u2019 testimony that would emphasize a claim refuted by the record, not to use questionable evidence to impeach, and not to impeach with evidence that would then impeach Jenkins\u2019 own statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">Jenkins tried to assert self defense, and now alleges that the shooting was an accident. The jury heard his testimony at trial but chose to believe it was neither. Issues of credibility are for the jury to determine, <em>see United States v. Loya, </em>807 F.2d 1483, 1489 (9th Cir.1987) (holding that contradictory and inconsistent testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>mony is sufficient to support a conviction where the jury \u201cresolved the conflicts of evidence in favor of the prosecution\u2019s factual theory\u201d), and where \u201cthere is conflicting evidence sufficient to support .either outcome, [the appellate court] must affirm the decision actually made.\u201d <em>Rhineharb v. Finch, </em>438 F.2d 920, 921 (9th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">We find that the state court\u2019s application of <em>Strickland </em>concerning Jenkins\u2019 ineffective assistance of counsel claim was not clearly erroneous. The district court correctly determined that the state courts properly applied federal precedent in a reasoned and reasonable way. The district court\u2019s order denying Jenkins\u2019 habeas petition is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b656-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b657-7\">. <em>See </em>California Jury Instructions-Crim., Nos. 5.52, Self-Defense-When Danger Ceases, \"The right of self-defense exists only as long as the real or apparent threatened danger continues to exist.
