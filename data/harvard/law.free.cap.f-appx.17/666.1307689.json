Habib also appeals the district court\u2019s award of sanctions pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 11 to defendants Cruz, Bischoff and Braley. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo dismissals under Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim, <em>Kimes v. Stone, </em>84 F.3d 1121, 1126 (9th Cir.1996), and we review for abuse of discretion Rule 11 sanctions, <em>Buster v. Greisen, </em>104 F.3d 1186, 1189 (9th Cir. 1997). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-14\">Dismissal was proper under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine because Habib\u2019s complaint sought review of issues previously litigated in Guam Superior Court, <em>see Worldwide Church of God v. McNair, </em>805 F.2d 888, 891-92 (9th Cir.1986), and also raised federal constitutional claims \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with that previous judgment. <em>See Doe &amp; Assocs. v. Napolita-no, </em>252 F.3d 1026, 1029 (9th Cir.2001). The district court did not abuse its discretion by awarding Rule 11 sanctions, <em>see Blue v. County of Los Angeles, </em>120 F.3d 982, 985 (9th Cir.1997); although defendants Bischoff and Braley simultaneously served and filed their amended motion for sanctions, they properly served their original motion for sanctions at least 21 days prior to filing. <em>See Barber v. Miller, </em>146 F.3d 707, 710 (9th Cir.1998). In addition, defendant Cruz\u2019s identical motion for Rule 11 sanctions was filed in compliance with the rule, providing Habib with an opportunity to withdraw his amended complaint and to take advantage of Fed.R.Civ.P. ll\u2019s \u201csafe harbor\u201d provision in order to escape sanctions. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b695-15\">Bischoff and Braley\u2019s motion for sanctions pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 38 is denied without prejudice to renewal.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b695-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
