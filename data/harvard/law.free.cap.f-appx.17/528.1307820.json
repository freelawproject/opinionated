We review motions to suppress evidence de novo. <em>See United States v. Wright, </em>215 F.3d 1020, 1025 (9th Cir.2000). We review Camou\u2019s sentence for plain error because he did not object at sentencing. <em>See United States v. Johansson, </em>249 F.3d 848, 861 (9th Cir.2001). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C \u00a7 3742, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-23\">Camou contends that: (1) the district court erred by failing to suppress evidence of marijuana in his boat as the product of a search in violation of the Fourth Amendment; (2) his term of supervised release exceeds the statutory maximum in violation of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000); and (3) under <em>Apprendi, </em>the district court could not base an increase in the statutory minimum sentence on a fact not proved beyond a reasonable doubt. We reject his contentions as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">(1) Camou told Coast Guard personnel he was en route from Mexico to the United States, and therefore, the border search exception to the Fourth Amendment applies in this case. <em>See United States v. Dobson, </em>781 F.2d 1374, 1376 (9th Cir.1986). The parties agree reasonable suspicion existed. Reasonable suspicion permits a non-routine border search. <em>See United States v. Montoya de Hernandez, </em>473 U.S. 531, 541, 105 S.Ct. 3304, 87 L.Ed.2d 381 (1985). And, in this case, the search was \u201creasonably related in scope to the circumstances that justified it initially.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 542, 105 S.Ct. 3304. The district court did not err in denying Camou\u2019s motion to suppress evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">(2) The district court sentenced Camou to one additional year of supervised release in violation of <em>Apprendi. See United States v. Velasco-Heredia, </em>249 F.3d 963, 969 (9th Cir.2001). The error, however, did not affect Camou\u2019s substantial rights because it is clear that he did in fact possess the quantity of marijuana found by the district court and because he does not contest the quantity on appeal. <em>See United States v. Saya, </em>247 F.3d 929, 942 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">(3) Finally, <em>Apprendi </em>does not govern any increase in Camou\u2019s statutory minimum sentence. <em>See United States v. Garciar-Sanchez, </em>238 F.3d 1200, 1201 (9th Cir. 2001) <em>(\u201cApprendi </em>dealt with the consideration of facts in sentencing enhancement beyond the statutory <em>maximum.\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b557-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
