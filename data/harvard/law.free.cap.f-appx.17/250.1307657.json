Corporation (\u201cBeretta\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s award of summary judgment to The Federal Insurance Company (\u201cFederal\u201d) and Great Northern Insurance Company (\u201cGreat Northern\u201d) in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>a dispute over insurance coverage. Beretta, a Maryland corporation, brought this diversity action in the District of Maryland seeking a declaration that its insurers, Federal and Great Northern, owed it a duty, under general liability and umbrella policies, to defend and indemnify it against pending lawsuits. Federal and Great Northern sought dismissal or, in the alternative, summary judgment, and Beretta also sought summary judgment. The district court, which possessed jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a), ruled in favor of Federal and Great Northern. Beretta appeals the adverse ruling, and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. As explained below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">The facts relevant to our inquiry are fully described in the ruling of the district court, embodied in its Memorandum of September 29, 2000, No. CCB-99-2798 (the \u201cD. Ct. Memo.\u201d). Both Federal and Great Northern issued annual commercial insurance policies (the \u201cPrimary Policies\u201d) to Beretta, effective for the aggregate period from July 31, 1990, through December 31, 1999. The Primary Policies each provided, inter aha, that Federal and Great Northern would pay \u201cdamages the insured [Beretta] becomes legally obligated to pay by reason of liability imposed by law or assumed under an insured contract for: bodily injury or property damage ... caused by an occurrence; ... or personal injury ... or advertising injury.\u201d J. A. 94, 220. Central to the controversy in this litigation is the \u201cProducts Completed Operations Hazard\u201d exclusion (the \u201cExclusion\u201d), found in each policy, which is defined to include, inter alia, \u201call bodily injury and property damage occurring away from premises you own or rent and arising out of your product ... except: products that are still in your physical possession.\u201d J.A. 111, 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">In addition to the Primary Policies, Federal and Great Northern also issued annual umbrella and excess policies to Beretta for the aggregate period from July 31, 1992, through December 31, 1999 (the \u201cUmbrella Policies\u201d). The Declaration page of each Umbrella Policy also contained, <em>in hasc verba, </em>the Exclusion, specifically stating that the Umbrella Policies did not provide coverage to Beretta for any liability arising out of the Exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">Prior to initiating this litigation, Beretta notified both Federal and Great Northern that thirteen lawsuits had been filed against it \u2014 twelve being brought by municipal governments in various parts of the United States, and the thirteenth being a class action (the \u201cUnderlying Actions\u201d). The Underlying Actions each allege, inter alia, that Beretta engaged in the \u201cnegligent marketing and distribution of guns and public nuisance, and seek to recover expenses allegedly incurred in treating and caring for people who have suffered gunshot injuries.\u201d J.A. 9. Both Federal and Great Northern denied coverage to Beretta under the Primary Policies and the Umbrella Policies (the \u201cPolicies\u201d). Beretta maintained that the denials of coverage were improper, and it sought a declaratory judgment awarding insurance coverage for the claims, except the product liability claims, made in the Underlying Actions (the \u201cClaims\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Upon consideration of the written submissions and oral argument, the district court awarded summary judgment to Federal and Great Northern. The court determined that the Claims involved bodily injury or property damage that occurred away from Beretta\u2019s premises and that \u201carose out of\u2019 Beretta\u2019s product. Accordingly, it concluded that coverage of the Claims was precluded by the terms of the Exclusion, and that, under Maryland law, neither Federal nor Great Northern had any duty to defend or indemnify Beretta.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">The parties agree that the first prong of the Exclusion is satisfied; that is, the damages sought in the Claims occurred away from Beretta\u2019s premises. Thus, as the district court recognized, the central question for our consideration and determination is the meaning, under Maryland law, of the phrase \u201carising out of,\u201d as contained in the Exclusion. Beretta contends that this phrase limits the scope of the Exclusion to allegations involving the dangerous and defective nature of Beretta\u2019s products and its failure to warn of those dangers. Federal and Great Northern, in contrast, maintain that the Exclusion is not limited to the product liability claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">We must decide whether the district court erred in concluding that the Claims fell under the provisions of the Exclusion, and in granting summary judgment to Federal and Great Northern. Our standard for review is plenary; we review an award of summary judgment <em>de novo. Dalton v. Capital Assocs. Indus., Inc., </em>257 F.3d 409, 411 (4th Cir.2001); <em>Detrick v. Panalpina, Inc., </em>108 F.3d 529, 538 (4th Cir.1997); <em>Becerra v. Dalton, </em>94 F.3d 145, 148 (4th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">After deciding that Maryland law is controlling, <em>see Assicurazioni Generali v. Neil, </em>160 F.3d 997, 1000 (4th Cir.1998), the district court concluded that Maryland courts have interpreted broadly the policy phrase \u201carising out of.\u201d \u201cThe words \u2018arising out of must be afforded their common understanding, namely, to mean originating from, growing out of, flowing from, or the like.\u201d <em>N. Assurance Co. of Am. v. EDP Floors, Inc., </em>311 Md. 217, 533 A.2d 682, 688 (Md.1987). In other words, the phrase \u201carising out of\u2019 implies only \u201cbut for\u201d causation. Mass <em>Transit Admin, v. CSX Transp., Inc., </em>349 Md. 299, 708 A.2d 298, 307 (Md.1998). Accordingly, the district court reasoned that the Exclusion applied to the Claims and that Beretta was not entitled to indemnification or defense under the Policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-12\">In reaching its conclusion, the district court found instructive the <em>EDP Floors </em>decision of Maryland\u2019s highest court. In <em>EDP Floors, </em>the Court of Appeals of Maryland interpreted a policy provision that excluded coverage for \u201cbodily injury ... arising out of ... loading or unloading of [a truck].\u201d <em>EDP Floors, </em>533 A.2d at 686. The court ruled that the insurer had properly denied coverage to its insured for a claim of negligent hiring, supervision, and retention of an employee who was intoxicated on the job and who injured the plaintiff by his actions during the unloading of a truck. <em>Id. </em>at 686-89. The court explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-13\">if [the plaintiffs] bodily injury arose out of EDP\u2019s employee\u2019s unloading of the truck, then that injury is excluded from coverage. This is so regardless of whether the injury may also be said to have arisen out of other causes further back in the sequence of events, such as the employee\u2019s consumption of alcohol, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>or the employer\u2019s negligent failure to supervise the employee. <em>The exclusion also applies irrespective of the theory of liability by which [the plaintiff] seeks redress for his injury.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 688-89 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Applying the reasoning of <em>EDP Floors, </em>the district court concluded that the Exclusion applies to the Claims because, regardless of whether the injuries involved could also be said to arise from Beret-ta\u2019s negligent marketing and distribution of its products, the \u201cbut for\u201d cause of the injuries in the Claims arose out of Beretta\u2019s product. On appeal, Beretta asserts that the district court\u2019s analysis is incorrect. It contends that Maryland law does not permit a court to look beyond the allegations in the Claims. As we have noted, the <em>EDP Floors </em>decision renders this position untenable, because \u201cthe theory of liability by which [the plaintiff] seeks redress\u201d is irrelevant. <em>Id. </em>at 689.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">Next, Beretta maintains that the district court erred when it rejected Beretta\u2019s contention concerning the Exclusion\u2019s plain meaning. It asserts that, under Maryland law, the Exclusion, by its plain meaning, applies only to injuries caused by defective products, in that a reasonably prudent layperson would believe an injury arises out of a product only if a product defect causes the injury.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-8\">In analyzing that contention, it is first necessary to examine the language of the policy itself. As noted, the[Exclusion] excludes coverage for all bodily injury ... occurring away from premises you own or rent and arising out of your product.... Nothing in that language supports the proposition that the exclusion applies only to defective products.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-12\">D. Ct. Memo., at 13 (internal citations omitted). Moreover, the district court found additional support in <em>Brazas Sporting Arms, Inc. v. American Empire Surplus Lines Insurance Co., </em>220 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.2000), a First Circuit decision addressing a similar appeal by a firearms distributor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Brazas, </em>220 F;3d at 1-4. The court, under Massachusetts law, \u201capplied principles of insurance contract construction virtually identical to the principles applied under Maryland law,\u201d and ruled that \u201cthe plain language of the exclusion was not limited to defective products claims.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> D. Ct. Memo., at 13 (citing <em>Brazas, </em>220 F.3d at 4-5). The district court agreed with the analysis made by the First Circuit; we agree as well. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b282-13\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-14\">Finally, Beretta contends that the district court erred by not considering extrinsic evidence of the Exclusion\u2019s meaning. The district court found no merit in this position because, under Maryland law, \u201c[o]nly if a policy is ambiguous should the court consider extrinsic and parol evidence to determine the intention of the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9 (citing <em>Sullins v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>340 Md. 503, 667 A.2d 617, 619 (Md.1995)). Under Maryland law, \u201c[w]hether ambiguity exists depends on whether \u2018the language in an insurance policy suggests more than one meaning to a reasonably prudent lay person\u2019 \u201d. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Sullins, </em>667 A.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>619.) The district court concluded that the Exclusion was not ambiguous because, as Maryland\u2019s courts have repeatedly held, the text of an insurance contract will be accorded its usual, ordinary, and accepted meaning, unless the evidence demonstrates that the parties intended otherwise. <em>Neil, </em>160 F.3d at 1001 (citing <em>Cheney v. Bell Nat\u2019l Life Ins. Co., </em>315 Md. 761, 556 A.2d 1135, 1138 (Md.1989)) (internal quotations omitted).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Beretta has failed to demonstrate that the parties to the Policies intended the phrase \u201carising out of,\u201d or the other provisions of the Exclusion, as having anything other than their usual, ordinary, and accepted meanings. Although Beretta asserts several separate bases in its effort to convince us otherwise, each misses the mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">First, Beretta suggests the Exclusion is ambiguous because it has historically been interpreted by other courts, and understood in the insurance industry, to apply only to defective product and failure-to-warn claims, rather than negligent sale claims. While Beretta asserts that a number of decisions from other jurisdictions support its position,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cthat fact cannot alter the application of clearly established Maryland law, which this court is bound to follow.\u201d D. Ct. Memo., at 13. It is manifest that, under Maryland law, the phrase \u201carising out of\u2019 is to be interpreted broadly. <em>EDP Floors, </em>533 A.2d at 688.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Second, Beretta contends that the Exclusion\u2019s title (Products Completed Operations Hazard) in and of itself creates ambiguity. However, to the extent the title of the Exclusion might be considered ambiguous, such a construction would be insufficient to render the Exclusion ambiguous. <em>Bernhardt v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., </em>102 Md.App. 45, 648 A.2d 1047, 1051 (Md.App.1994) (finding the title endorsement \u2014 \u201cpollution exclusion\u201d \u2014 not to be ambiguous because the provisions of the insurance contract were quite specific).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">Third, Beretta maintains that the conflicting decisions from other jurisdictions concerning the scope of the Exclusion also constitute evidence of ambiguity. <em>See supra </em>note 5. In Maryland, however, a mere conflict in judicial interpretation is not dispositive on the issue of ambiguity, but is only a factor to be considered. <em>Sullins, </em>667 A.2d at 624. In any event, \u201cconflicting interpretations from other jurisdictions do not create ambiguity where Maryland courts have adopted a definitive interpretation under Maryland law.\u201d D. Ct. Memo., at 14 (citing <em>Willis v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>88 Md.App. 21, 591 A.2d 896, 900-02 (Md.App.1991); <em>MeCloskey v. Republic Ins. Co., </em>80 Md.App. 19, 559 A.2d 385, 387 (Md.App.1989)). Maryland courts have adopted a definitive interpretation of the phrase \u201carising out of.\u201d In this circumstance, Beretta cannot rely on contrary decisions of other jurisdictions to create an ambiguity in the language of the Exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>Finally, Beretta invokes the principle embodied in <em>Stanley v. American Motorist Insurance Co., </em>195 Md. 180, 73 A.2d 1 (Md.App.1950), that \u201cparties who adopt an insurance policy, which apparently has had nationwide use and has been judicially construed in five or six states, adopt with it the uniform judicial construction that it has received in other states.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4. This point is of no assistance to Beretta, however, because the provisions of the Exclusion have not been uniformly construed. <em>See, e.g., Cobbins v. Gen. Accident Fire &amp; Life Assurance Corp., Ltd., </em>53 Ill.2d 285, 290 N.E.2d 873, 877 (Ill.1972) (\u201cThe definition of the \u2018products\u2019 hazard does not permit the interpretation that it applies only to the typical product-liability or defective-product case. It is not so limited.\u201d); <em>see also Parma Seed, Inc. v. Gen. Ins. Co., </em>94 Idaho 658, 496 P.2d 281, 286 (Idaho 1972); <em>Tiano v. Aetna Cas. and Sur. Co., </em>102 Mich.App. 177, 301 N.W.2d 476, 480 (Mich. Ct.App.1980); <em>Pennsylvania Gen. Ins. Co. v. Melon, </em>492 N.Y.S.2d 502, 503 04 (NY.App.Div.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Pursuant to the foregoing, we find no error in the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of Maryland law. We accordingly adopt its well-reasoned decision, and we affirm. <em>Beretta U.S.A. Corp. v. Federal Ins. Co., </em>117 F.Supp.2d 489 (D.Md. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b280-8\">. The Underlying Actions also assert product liability claims for Beretta's failure to make its firearms safe and to prevent foreseeable misuse because Beretta failed to use modern technology to incorporate safety devices that would prevent its firearms from being used by children and unauthorized persons. At oral argument, Beretta conceded that the product liability claims fall within the terms of the Exclusion, and thus are not covered by the Policies. There is accordingly no issue on appeal concerning coverage for product liability claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b282-9\">. The theories of liability asserted against the firearms distributor in <em>Brazas </em>were for negligent and willful misconduct in the distribution, marketing, and advertising of excessive numbers of firearms, which allegedly resulted in bodily injuries to the plaintiffs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b282-15\">. In Massachusetts, the phrase \"arising out of\" denotes an intermediate standard of causation between proximate and \"but for\u201d causation. <em>Brazas, </em>220 F.3d at 4. Therefore, in <em>Brazas </em>a more demanding standard was applied by the First Circuit than the \"but for\u201d standard mandated by Maryland law</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b283-8\">. In <em>Brazas, </em>the First Circuit concluded that \u2018\u2018[w]here, as here, the language of the exclusion provision is unambiguous, the text should be given its plain meaning. In this case, the plain meaning of the exclusion is that it applies to all product-related injuries.\u201d <em>Brazas, 220 </em>F.3d at 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b283-9\">. <em>See, e.g., Scarborough v. N. Assurance Co. of Am., 718 </em>F.2d <em>130, 136 (5th Cir.1983) </em>(applying Louisiana law); <em>Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. of Arkansas, Inc. v. Lyon, </em>258 Ark. 802, 528 S.W.2d 932, 934 (Ark. 1975); <em>Lessak v. Metro. Cas. Ins. Co., </em>168 Ohio St. 153, 151 N.E.2d 730, 735 (Ohio 1958); <em>Colony Ins. Co. v. H.R.K., Inc., </em>728 S.W.2d 848-851 (Tex.Ct. App.1987). Several of the decisions on which Beretta relies are distinguishable because either the policy language at issue was different from that involved in this case, or the decisions did not involve interpreting of the phrase \u201carising out of.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b284-7\">WILKINSON, Chief Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"aj-dedup-0\">concurring in the judgment:</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">I concur in the judgment here, but I write separately because I think the case is closer than the majority acknowledges.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">In the abstract, it is reasonable to contend, as appellant does, that the language \u201carising out of your product\u201d in the exclusion applies only to traditional products liability actions. If an injury is inflicted by a person with a non-defective gun or knife, one would not normally think of the gun or knife as having inflicted the injury. Rather, one would typically view the person who misused the weapon as having inflicted the injury. That is, the injury would be said to have \u201carisen out of\u2019 the wrongful act of the person, not the weapon itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-11\">In many jurisdictions, this would be a prevailing argument, and coverage for the insured manufacturer would lie. The question here is whether Maryland courts have interpreted the words \u201carising out of\u2019 in such a manner as to sweep this argument away. Analytically, they have. It is only because Maryland assigns to the words \u201carising out of\u2019 an extraordinary breadth that the exclusion can be interpreted as the district court did. The Maryland courts have interpreted \u201carising out of\u2019 to express the expansive concept of but \u2014 for causation, and they have done this repeatedly and in a variety of different settings and contexts. <em>See, e.g., Mass Transit Admin, v. CSX Transp., Inc., </em>349 Md. 299, 708 A.2d 298, 307 (Md.1998); <em>N. Assurance Co. of Am. v. EDP Floors, Inc., </em>311 Md. 217, 533 A.2d 682, 688-89 (Md. 1987); <em>Nat\u2019l Indem. Co. v. Ewing, </em>235 Md. 145, 200 A.2d 680, 682 (Md.1964). Under Maryland law, one cannot escape the fact that, \u201cbut for\u201d appellant\u2019s product, the harms alleged in the underlying complaints would not have occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-12\">Secondly, if the adjective \u201cdefective\u201d had been used to modify the noun \u201cproduct,\u201d the exclusion could likewise be interpreted in the manner that appellant suggests. The exclusion would then plainly be limited to traditional products liability suits. I do not believe, however, that courts possess the authority to add that word to the contract of insurance negotiated by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-13\">In sum, had another state\u2019s law been controlling or had the exclusion contained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>a single additional word, the result might well have been different. On the basis of Maryland law and under this contract, however, I think an affirmance is the proper course.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
