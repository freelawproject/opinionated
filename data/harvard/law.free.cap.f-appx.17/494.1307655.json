Adkins on two counts of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 113(a)(3) for assaulting his Indian girlfriend with a dangerous weapon on the Omaha Indian Reservation. Each count described the same substantive offense, but asserted alternative bases for jurisdiction. Count I invoked jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1152 based on Adkins\u2019s status as a non-Indian person. Count II invoked jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153 based on Adkins\u2019s status as an Indian. Adkins filed a motion to dismiss, arguing the indictment was improperly based on falsehoods because his \u201cbirth certificate and own statement indicate that he is not an Indian.\u201d He then pleaded guilty to Count I. Adkins now appeals, arguing the district court<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> lacked jurisdiction over the offense charged in Count I because he is an Indian. Having reviewed the record de novo, we affirm. <em>See United States v. Lawrence, </em>51 F.3d 150, 151 (8th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-15\">Because Adkins did not show he has Indian blood and is recognized as an Indian by a tribe or the federal government, we conclude Adkins is not an Indian for purposes of federal criminal jurisdiction. <em>See id. </em>at 152. Both of Adkins\u2019s parents of record were Caucasian, and are now deceased. Adkins\u2019s only claim to Native American heritage is based on information he received that his biological father might not be the father listed on his birth certificate. Although he knows the name and town of residence of his putative Native American father, Adkins has not confirmed his parentage. In addition, Adkins has offered no evidence of his \u201crecognition\u201d as an Indian, such as enrollment in a tribe, receipt of tribal benefits or other benefits available only to Indians, or social recognition as an Indian. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b523-16\">Adkins argues the Government conceded his Indian heritage by recounting his story of uncertain parentage in the presentence investigation report and by charging him as an Indian in Count II of the indictment. We disagree. Both the current and previous presentence investigation reports conclude Adkins is Caucasian. Similarly, the alternative counts do not concede heritage but rather provide comprehensive jurisdiction regardless of heritage. <em>See United States v. Driver, </em>945 F.2d 1410, 1414-15 (8th Cir.1991) (upholding jury verdicts as not inconsistent where defendant was found guilty of assault with a deadly weapon under \u00a7 1152 as a non-Indian and under \u00a7 1153 as an Indian because defendant refused to stipulate to his heritage). In fact, the relevant eonces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>sion is Adkins\u2019s pretrial statement that he is not an Indian. Because Adkins is not an Indian, jurisdiction under \u00a7 1152 was proper. <em>See United States v. Ashley, </em>255 F.3d 907, 911 n. 3 (8th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Finding no reversible error, we thus affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b523-13\">The Honorable Joseph F. Bataillon, United States District Judge for the District of Nebraska.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
