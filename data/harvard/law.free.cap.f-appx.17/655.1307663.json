We review de novo the denial of a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>United States v. Seesing, </em>234 F.3d 456, 459 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-17\">Nguyen contends that the district court\u2019s failure to define what \u201ccarry\u201d meant for purposes of his guilty plea to a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1) violated Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1), and rendered his plea unknowing and involuntary. This contention lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-18\">The adequacy of a Rule 11 plea hearing is reviewed de novo, as is whether the plea colloquy satisfied Rule ll\u2019s requirements. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b684-19\">During the plea colloquy, Nguyen admitted that he and his co-defendants had weapons, which were to be used to commit the robbery, and thus he was guilty of carrying firearms during and in relation to a crime of violence. <em>See Seesing, </em>234 F.3d at 461-62 (stating that in order to convict a defendant under section 924(c) for \u201ccarrying\u201d a firearm the defendant must have transported the firearm on or about his person). Accordingly, no Rule 11(c)(1) violation occurred and Nguyen\u2019s guilty plea was knowing and voluntary. <em>Id. </em>(concluding that where nature and elements of the crime are explained to the pleading defendant, the requirements of Rule 11(c)(1) are satisfied).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b684-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
