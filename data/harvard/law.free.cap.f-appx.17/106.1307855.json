In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, the relevant question is not whether the court is convinced of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but rather whether the evidence, when viewed in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>light most favorable to the Government, was sufficient for a rational trier of fact to have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862-63 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc). At the bench trial, Detective Hartig testified that Williams admitted that marijuana packaged for sale and found in Williams\u2019 bag at Williams\u2019 workplace was his and that he sold it. Williams also admitted that he was aware of the presence of another quantity of marijuana located in a trashcan near his workstation. While Williams denied making these statements, the trial court clearly chose to believe Detective Hartig, and we will not review the trial court\u2019s credibility determinations. <em>Mazzell v. Evatt, </em>88 F.3d 263, 270-71 (4th Cir.1996). Thus, we affirm Williams\u2019 conviction. We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
