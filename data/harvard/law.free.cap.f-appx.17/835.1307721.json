Mr. Scott was convicted of two counts of aggravated battery, one count of aggravated assault, and one count of aggravated kidnapping in Kansas state court. <em>State v. Scott, </em>250 Kan. 350, 827 P.2d 733, 736 (Kan.1992). He was sentenced to five to twenty years imprisonment for the battery convictions, three to ten years imprisonment for the assault conviction, and life imprisonment for the kidnapping conviction, all sentences to run concurrently. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291, 2253(c), and deny Mr. Scott a COA and dismiss his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">The Kansas Supreme Court affirmed Mr. Scott\u2019s convictions on February 28, 1992. <em>Scott, </em>250 Kan. 350, 827 P.2d 733. Approximately five years later, on June 30, 1997, Mr. Scott filed a motion for post-conviction relief in state district court. R. doc. 8, at 1; Pet. Br. at 4. The state district court denied the motion, the court of appeals affirmed, and the supreme court denied review. R. doc. 8, at 1-2. Mr. Scott then filed the instant habeas petition in federal district court. R. doc. 1. The district court dismissed the petition, R. doc. 8, and denied a COA R. doc. 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">A COA should issue only if Mr. Scott \u201chas made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). The district court dismissed Mr. Scott\u2019s petition as barred by the statute of limitations. R. doc. 8, at 4. Habeas petitions brought under \u00a7 2254 are subject to a one-year statute of limitations. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). Because Mr. Scott\u2019s conviction was made final before the effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, the limitations period did not begin to run until April 24, 1996. <em>Hoggro v. Boone, </em>150 F.3d 1223, 1225-26 (10th Cir.1998). Thus, Mr. Scott had until April 23, 1997 to file his federal habeas petition unless the limitations period was tolled. \u00a7 2244(d)(2) tolls the statute of limitations during the time \u201ca properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review\u201d is pending. The district court concluded that the limitations period was not tolled in Mr. Scott\u2019s case because he did not file his motion for state-post conviction relief until after June 23, 1997,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and there was no basis for equitable tolling (because Mr. Scott did not seek post-conviction relief until five years after his conviction). R. doc. 8, at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-11\">We have reviewed the district court\u2019s order, the record, and Mr. Scott\u2019s brief and COA application filed on appeal. Having done so, we hold that Mr. Scott has not demonstrated that \u201creasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). Mr. Scott\u2019s argument that the court should have \u201cexercize[d] its Authority under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 ... and con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>duct[ed] an Evidentiary hearing\u201d is without merit. COA App. at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">Therefore, we DENY Mr. Scott a COA and DISMISS his petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b864-9\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. This court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b864-12\">. The district court rejected Mr. Scott\u2019s contention that he submitted his motion to dismiss to prison staff in April 1997 for mailing, finding that the state court record did not support this contention. R. doc. 8, at 3. Mr. Scott does not contest this finding on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
