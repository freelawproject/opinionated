Plunkett, an inmate appearing pro se, seeks a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>allowing him to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying relief on his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Because Mr. Plunkett has failed to make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2), we deny his request and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">In 1995, Mr. Plunkett was convicted of three counts of aggravated criminal sodomy and two counts of rape. Doc. 8, at 3. The state court sentenced Mr. Plunkett to an overall term of imprisonment of thirty years to life. <em>Id. </em>The Kansas Supreme Court affirmed Mr. Plunkett\u2019s convictions on direct appeal. <em>State v. Plunkett, </em>261 Kan. 1024, 934 P.2d 113 (Kan.1997). In 1998, Mr. Plunkett filled the instant habeas petition in federal district court alleging a single ground for relief: that the trial court had erroneously terminated his right to represent himself in violation of the Sixth Amendment. Doc. 1, at 4. The district court denied Mr. Plunkett\u2019s petition on the merits, Doc. 14, at 7, and denied Mr. Plunkett\u2019s application for a COA. Doc. 17, at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">On appeal, Mr. Plunkett reasserts his alleged Sixth Amendment violation. In his brief, he also raises claims of prosecutorial misconduct, trial court bias, ineffective assistance of counsel, and that the trial court erred in ruling on his petition without a complete set of trial transcripts. <em>See </em>Aplt. Br. Attach. Because Mr. Plunkett did not raise his claims of prosecutorial misconduct, trial court bias, and ineffective assistance of counsel in his habeas petition for consideration by the district court, we decline to consider those claims here. <em>See In re Walker, </em>959 F.2d 894, 896 (10th Cir.1992). As for Mr. Plunkett\u2019s contention that the district court committed error by denying Mr. Plunkett\u2019s petition without reviewing the entire set of trial transcripts, <em>see </em>Doc. 14, at 1 n. 1, we disagree. The district court relied on the transcript of Mr. Plunkett\u2019s pretrial hearing during which the relevant events occurred (i.e., the state trial court found Mr. Plunkett incapable of representing himself). <em>Id. </em>at 2-5. Mr. Plunkett does not contest the facts leading to this appeal, and he also has not shown how the lost trial transcripts have prejudiced this appeal. <em>See Capps v. Cowley, </em>63 F.3d 982, 984 (10th Cir.1995). Therefore, we hold that the district court did not err in denying Mr. Plunkett\u2019s habeas petition without reviewing an entire set of trial transcripts.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">Addressing the one issue that Mr. Plunkett did raise in his habeas petition, that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated by the state trial court\u2019s refusal to let him represent himself, we agree with the district court that Petitioner has failed to show that the state court\u2019s decision \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 412-413, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000), or \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding,\u201d \u00a7 2254(d)(2). On appeal, Mr. Plunkett has failed to show that \u201creasonable jurists could debate whether ... the petition should have been resolved in a different manner.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). Therefore, we DENY Mr. Plunkett\u2019s request for a COA and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b865-29\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. This court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
