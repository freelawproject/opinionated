Khatib appeals, challenging the sufficiency of the evidence and the district court\u2019s application of \u00a7 4246(d). Having reviewed the record, we conclude the district court\u2019s findings are not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. S.A., </em>129 F.3d 995, 1000 (8th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-23\">Khatib concedes he has schizoaffective disorder (a mental disease that includes disturbances of both thought and mood) and does not dispute either his dangerousness or the lack of available state placement; thus his challenge is limited to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>whether he presents a risk of dangerous behavior because of his mental disease. <em>See id. </em>Despite Khatib\u2019s numerous criticisms, we cannot conclude the district court erroneously credited the testimony of Khatib\u2019s treating psychiatrist that Khatib\u2019s risk of dangerous behavior was the result of the combination of schizoaffective disorder and antisocial personality disorder (a character disorder marked by pervasive disregard for and violation of the rights of others). Although the opposing expert disagreed, the expert\u2019s opinion was based solely on a review of Khatib\u2019s records rather than an evaluation of Khatib himself because Khatib refused to cooperate. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Ecker, </em>30 F.3d 966, 970 (8th Cir.1994) (finding evidence sufficient to commit prisoner despite differences in expert opinions).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">We reject Khatib\u2019s assertion that differences in two risk assessment reports completed at the Federal Medical Center in Springfield, Missouri, are inherently contradictory. Although the initial report concluded there was insufficient evidence of overt violence to find Khatib dangerous, the second report reflected additional information gained through frustrated discharge planning efforts; thus the second report was not inconsistent in concluding Khatib posed a risk of dangerous behavior because of his grandiose, unrealistic thinking. Besides, overt acts of violence are not required to prove dangerousness. <em>Id. </em>In addition, the second report clearly explains that Khatib\u2019s distorted thinking provides the link between his mental illness and his risk of dangerous behavior, thus Khatib\u2019s contention there was no evidence of this connection is without merit. Finally, we conclude the expert testimony that Khatib\u2019s risk of dangerous behavior is the result of both schizoaffective disorder and antisocial personality disorder satisfies the plain language of \u00a7 4246(d). <em>See </em>S.A, 129 F.3d at 1001; <em>United States v. Evanoff, </em>10 F.3d 559, 562 (8th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Finding no error, we thus affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b514-15\"> The Honorable Gary A.
