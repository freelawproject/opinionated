R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-12\">Ronald E. Hall, a state prisoner appearing pro se, appeals the dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-13\">Hall filed his complaint on February 27, 2001, alleging violations of his Fifth Amendment due process rights, his Fourteenth Amendment equal protection rights, and his Eighth Amendment cruel and unusual punishment rights. The district court dismissed the complaint, finding (1) \u201cno cause of action exists under \u00a7 1983 for the recovery of damages arising from an allegedly unconstitutional conviction where the challenged conviction has not been set aside\u201d; (2) \u201cboth the county attorney and the state court judge are entitled to immunity\u201d; (3) \u201cplaintiffs allegations state no claim for relief against his appointed defense attorneys because these individuals are not considered state actors\u201d; and (4) \u201cplaintiffs claim for relief against the Board of County Commissioners is based solely on his conclusory assertion that the Board is responsible for the actions of the county employee.\u201d Order at 1-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-16\">We agree with the district court\u2019s analysis of the issues and AFFIRM for substantially the same reasons as stated in the district court\u2019s order entered April 30, 2001. Hall is reminded of his obligation to continue making the payments toward his appellate filing fee until the entire fee has been paid.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b962-14\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
