He was sentenced to 41 months\u2019 imprisonment on the bank robbery count and a consecutive term of 25 years\u2019 imprisonment on the firearm count, the mandatory minimum under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C)\u00ae for a defendant with a prior \u00a7 924(c)(1) conviction. Luney maintains on appeal that the district court erred in sentencing him to the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>minimum under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C)\u00a9 and in refusing to depart below that minimum. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Luney and two codefendants, Miguel Rodriguez and Shirlene Wayne, robbed a bank in Tell City, Indiana, in July 1999. Luney robbed another bank in Kentucky in December 1999 and was apprehended while attempting to flee the bank. Luney was charged first with the Kentucky robbery in the Eastern District of Kentucky and in February 2000 pleaded guilty to armed bank robbery and using a semiautomatic assault weapon during and in relation to that robbery. . He was sentenced in May 2000 to 33 months\u2019 imprisonment on the armed robbery count and a consecutive term of 10 years\u2019 imprisonment on the \u00a7 924(c)(1) count.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Before sentencing in the Kentucky case, Luney was charged in the Southern District of Indiana in March 2000 with armed bank robbery and using, carrying, and brandishing a firearm during and in relation to that robbery. Luney pleaded guilty to both counts in February 2001. Over Luney\u2019s objection the district court imposed a 25-year prison term on the \u00a7 924(c)(1) count because of Luney\u2019s prior \u00a7 924(c)(1) conviction in Kentucky. The court imposed the term to run consecutively to the prison terms imposed in the Kentucky case.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Luney first argues on appeal that the district court erred in sentencing him to the 25-year mandatory minimum under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C)\u00ae. This argument is frivolous. Under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C)\u00ae, a mandatory minimum 25-year prison term \u201cshall be imposed\u201d in \u201cthe case of a second or subsequent conviction\u201d under \u00a7 924(c)(1). In <em>Deal v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 129, 135, 113 S.Ct. 1993, 124 L.Ed.2d 44 (1993), the Supreme Court read this \u201csecond or subsequent conviction\u201d language literally and held that all that is required is \u201ca <em>conviction </em>after the first conviction.\u201d <em>See also United States v. Bennett, </em>908 F.2d 189, 194 (7th Cir.1990). And here Luney\u2019s current \u00a7 924(c)(1) conviction was \u201csecond or subsequent\u201d to his Kentucky \u00a7 924(c)(1) conviction, even though the Indiana robbery was committed first in time.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">Luney next argues that the district court should have departed downward from the mandatory minimum. This argument is flawed in that it is predicated on the erroneous assumption that the district court had the authority to depart from the statutory minimum-it did not. Unless the government moves for a departure based on substantial assistance under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e), a sentencing court is prohibited from imposing a sentence below the mandatory minimum. <em>United States v. McMutuary, </em>217 F.3d 477, 486 (7th Cir.2000). Because the government did not file a substantial assistance motion here, the district court properly refused to depart.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
