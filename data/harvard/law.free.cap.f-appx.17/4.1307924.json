We add only that with regard to the property tax portion of the claim, the mortgage clearly allows the mortgagee to pay taxes \u201c[i]f ... there is a legal proceeding that may significantly affect Lender\u2019s rights in the Property.\u201d Bankruptcy Appellate Panel Record Appendix, p. 154. This provision is in accord with that set out in the Restatement (Third) of Property \u00a7 2.2 (1997) (\u201c[A] mortgagee may expend funds reasonably necessary for the protection of the security, and may add the sums so expended to the principal amount secured by the mortgage. Such expenditures may be made ... (2) to protect against the assertion of liens having priority over the mortgage.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-24\">So far as we can determine from the record, at the time the mortgagee began paying property taxes on the mortgagor\u2019s behalf, the Town of Lexington had notified the mortgagee that taxes were overdue and that a tax sale of the property was scheduled. The contract allowed the mortgagee to pay all taxes due and to add that amount to the loan balance where \u201ca legal proceeding that may significantly affect Lender\u2019s rights in the Property\u201d is instigated. The Town may have been wrong, or the information may have been out-of-date at the time the mortgagee received it, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>but clearly the mortgagee was entitled under the contract to pay the disputed taxes. Long makes no claim that the Town\u2019s actions did not constitute a \u201clegal proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\"><em>Affirmed. </em>1st Cir. Loc. R. 27(c).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
