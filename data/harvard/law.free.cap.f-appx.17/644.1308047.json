We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Alfaro-Rojas first contends that he should have received a three-level reduction in his sentence for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to USSG \u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b), based upon his initial confession and limited defense at trial. We review this contention for clear error, giving deference to the sentencing judge\u2019s finding. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>897 F.2d 1018, 1019 (9th Cir.1990). This contention fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">The district court properly found that Alfaro-Rojas did not demonstrate acceptance of responsibility. He pleaded not guilty, attacked the validity of his confession, refused to discuss his case with the probation officer, and made no statement of contrition at sentencing. <em>See United States v. Innie, </em>7 F.3d 840, 848 (9th Cir. 1993). Because Alfaro-Rojas did not qualify for the two-level adjustment under USSG \u00a7 3El.l(a), he was ineligible for the third point. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 3El.l(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">Relying on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Alfaro-Rojas next contends that because his prior convictions were not alleged in the indictment or proved to the jury, they cannot be used to increase his sentence beyond the two year maximum specified in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). This argument is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Pacheco-Zepeda, </em>234 F.3d 411-15 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 121 S.Ct. 1503, 149 L.Ed.2d 388 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b672-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
