We have previously granted the motion filed by the Debtors, Charles and Lila Eron, to submit this case on the briefs and we now vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-12\">In March 1997, Charles Eron and John Eron signed an agreement to lease a 1997 Nissan truck from GE Capital. The lease agreement was \u201cClosed End with Guaranteed Fixed Price Purchase Option\u201d and provided that the Erons would pay GE Capital twenty-four equal installments of $179.99, beginning in March 1997. At the end of the twenty-four months, the lessees, if not in default and upon notice, could purchase the vehicle for the stated residual value of $11,268.53. The title to the vehicle listed the owner as \u201cGECAL INC % Eron Charles C.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-13\">Charles and Lila Eron filed a petition under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code in November 1997. The plan proposed by the Debtors and confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court provided for \u201c[pjayments of $282 or more per month to GE Capital until the net balance of claim plus 8.25% interest has been paid in full.\u201d No execu-tory contracts or unexpired leases were listed in the plan. In fact, the plan stated that \u201can executory contract or lease not specifically mentioned [ ] is treated as rejected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-14\">GE Capital did not object to the plan. GE Capital\u2019s original and amended proofs of claim listed a secured claim of approximately $3100 \u2014 the sum of the prepetition arrearages and the remaining sixteen payments due under the lease agreement. Pursuant to the plan and GE Capital\u2019s proof of claim, approximately $3100 was paid to GE Capital, paying the claim in full as filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-15\">In March 1999, the lease term expired. GE Capital subsequently sought \u2014 and the Erons refused \u2014 return of the vehicle. In October 1999, GE Capital moved for relief from the stay pursuant to \u00a7 362. The Erons objected to the motion, asserting that their plan had provided for payment of the full purchase price by proposing payment of $13,302 plus 8.25% interest over the fifty-seven month term of the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-16\">The bankruptcy court denied the motion for relief from stay, reasoning that the plan \u201cprovided for\u201d GE Capital\u2019s claim by making provision for its treatment and that the confirmed plan is entitled to res judicata effect. The court suggested that GE Capital could submit an additional proof of claim for the purchase option amount and recover the full value of the vehicle. Following the district court\u2019s af-firmance of the bankruptcy court\u2019s denial of the motion for relief from stay, GE Capital noted its appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>In general, liens pass through bankruptcy unaffected. <em>Dewsnup v. Timm, </em>502 U.S. 410, 418, 112 S.Ct. 773, 116 L.Ed.2d 903 (1992); <em>Cen-Pen Corp. v. Hanson, </em>58 F.3d 89, 92 (4th Cir.1995). Some affirmative act is required by the debtor in order to extinguish or modify \u201ca lien or other interest in property.\u201d Fed. R. Bankr.P. 7001(2) (requiring the filing of an adversary \u201cproceeding to determine validity, priority, or extent of a lien or other interest in property\u201d); <em>In re Deutchman, </em>192 F.3d 457, 460 (4th Cir.1999). Here, all the Erons did was list GE Capital as a secured creditor and state that the claim would be paid in full with payments of $282 per month plus interest. There was no affirmative action taken to determine the extent of the Erons\u2019 interest in the truck. <em>See Cen-Pen, </em>58 F.3d at 92 (requiring some affirmative step to alter extent of lien or other interest in property). The Erons did not file a preconfirmation adversary proceeding hearing, did not object to GE Capital\u2019s proof of claim, which listed the amount of the claim as $3100, did not seek to value the claim, and did not undertake any affirmative step to modify the parties\u2019 interests under the agreement. <em>See Deutchman, </em>192 F.3d at 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Although the bankruptcy court found \u2014 and the Erons now argue \u2014 that the confirmed plan is res judicata as to the treatment of GE Capital\u2019s claim, we disagree. Upon confirmation of a plan, property of the estate vests in the debtor \u201cfree and clear of any claim or interest of any creditor provided for by the plan.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1327(b), (c) (1994). Thus, where the debtor has not taken affirmative action to avoid a creditor\u2019s lien or to change an interest in property, such interests pass through bankruptcy unaffected unless the plan \u201cprovides for\u201d the interest. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1327(c). \u201cAs a general matter, a plan \u2018provides for\u2019 a claim or interest when it acknowledges the claim or interest and makes explicit provision for its treatment.\u201d <em>Cen-Pen, 58 </em>F.3d at 94 (citing <em>In re Work, </em>58 B.R. 868, 871 (Bankr.D.Or.1986)). \u201cIn order to \u2018provide for\u2019 a creditor for purposes of \u00a7 1327(c), the plan must, at a minimum, clearly and accurately characterize the creditor\u2019s claim throughout the plan.\u201d <em>Deutchman, </em>192 F.3d at 461 (Chapter 13 plan does not \u201cprovide for\u201d a lien and thus eliminate the lien \u201csimply by failing or refusing to acknowledge it or by calling the creditor unsecured.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">In this case, the Erons contend that they provided for GE Capital\u2019s claim by listing GE Capital in the plan and agreeing to pay $282 per month plus interest until GE Capital\u2019s claim was paid in full. However, the Erons did not characterize GE Capital\u2019s interest in the truck as a lease, did not provide notice to GE Capital that they intended to exercise their option to purchase the truck, and did not state in the plan the value of GE Capital\u2019s claim. We conclude that the bankruptcy court erred in determining that the Erons\u2019 plan provided for GE Capital\u2019s claim. Contrary to the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings, the plan did not state the total amount that was to be paid to GE Capital under the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">In <em>Cenr-Pen, </em>the plan did not mention or otherwise acknowledge Cen-Pen\u2019s liens, and thus did not \u201cprovide for\u201d treatment of the liens or full payment of the underlying claim. <em>Cenr-Pen, </em>58 F.3d at 94. Similarly, the Erons\u2019 plan- \u2014 -by not characterizing the interest of GE Capital, not stating the amount of the claim, and not otherwise notifying GE Capital of their intent to convert the lease-purchase agreement to a financing agreement \u2014 did not provide for GE Capital\u2019s claim. Therefore, contrary to the bankruptcy court\u2019s conclusion, upon confirmation of the plan and completion of the relevant terms of the plan, the truck <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>did not vest in the Erons free and clear of GE Capital\u2019s claim or interest. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1327(b), (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Having reviewed the briefs, the joint appendix, and the opinions below, we deny GE Capital\u2019s motion for reconsideration of the order granting the motion to submit on briefs, and we vacate the decision of the district court and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
