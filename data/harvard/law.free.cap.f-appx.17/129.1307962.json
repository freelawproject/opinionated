Salazar sued in state court for assault and battery, among other things. Ballesteros removed the case to the Eastern District of Virginia based on diversity of citizenship. Upon consideration of Ballesteros\u2019s motion to dismiss, the district court held that Salazar\u2019s action was barred by the Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act, and dismissed the case. <em>See </em>981 F.Supp. 960 (1997). We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">This case involves the intersection of three statutes, which we briefly summarize.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-10\">1. The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(b), 1402(b), 2401(b), 2671-2680, allows the United States to be sued for certain torts committed by its employees. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1346(b)(1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-16\">2. The Federal Employees\u2019 Liability Reform and Tort Compensation Act of 1988 (the \u2018Westfall Act\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679, which amended the FTCA, immunizes federal employees who are sued for actions \u201cwithin the scope of [their] office or employment\u201d and substitutes the United States in their place. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2679(d)(1). However, in order for substitution to occur, certain procedures must be followed: The defendant must notify the Attorney General of the suit, have the Attorney General certify his actions as \u201cwithin the scope of employment,\u201d and petition the court for such certification if the Attorney General refuses to do so. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2679(c), (d). Once the United States is substituted as the defendant, the suit only can proceed under the FTCA. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 2679(b)(1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-17\">3. The Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act (FECA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8101-8193, is in essence a federal worker\u2019s compensation statute. <em>See United States v. Lorenzetti, </em>467 U.S. 167, 168, 104 S.Ct. 2284, 81 L.Ed.2d 134 (1984); <em>Lockheed Aircraft Corp. v. United States, </em>460 U.S. 190, 193-94, 103 S.Ct. 1033, 74 L.Ed.2d 911 (1983). Under FECA, a federal employee may not sue \u201cthe United States or an instrumentality thereof\u2019 for work-related injuries, but may receive FECA benefits. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8116(c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-18\">A number of circuit courts of appeals have held that FECA bars a federal employee\u2019s suit against the United States or its instrumentalities but does <em>not </em>bar a federal employee\u2019s suit against individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>co-employees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Allman v. Hanley, </em>302 F.2d 559, 563 (5th Cir.1962) (holding that FECA does not bar suits against fellow employees); <em>see also Heathcoat v. Potts, </em>790 F.2d 1540, 1543-44 (11th Cir. 1986) (noting that FECA \u201cis silent on the matter of co-employee suits,\u201d and following <em>Allman); Bates v. Harp, </em>573 F.2d 930, 935 (6th Cir.1978) (holding that \u201ceven though we are not persuaded that co-employee suits are advisable as a matter of policy, in light of the overwhelming authority in support of such suits, absent an explicit statutory bar to the contrary, we feel constrained to follow the holding of <em>Allman\u201d)-, Davis v. Harrod, </em>407 F.2d 1280, 1282 n.2 (D.C.Cir.1969) (noting that \u201c[u]nder the FECA it appears that appellant[ ] could sue [her co-employee], but not the District\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The Fourth Circuit recognized the <em>All-man </em>line of cases in <em>Carr v. United States, </em>422 F.2d 1007 (4th Cir.1970). <em>Carr </em>examined the predecessor to the Westfall Act, the Federal Drivers\u2019 Act, which immunized federal drivers from suit for their negligence. The federal employee raised the Drivers\u2019 Act as a defense to the plaintiffs suit, and the United States was substituted as'the defendant. The court first noted that, \u201c[p]rior to the [Drivers\u2019] Act, a government employee who sustained injuries as a result of the negligence of a fellow-employee acting within the scope of his employment ... could ... have brought a common law action against his co-worker for negligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1010 (citing <em>All-man). </em>The court then found that \u201cthe Drivers Act abrogates a federal employee\u2019s common law right of action against a government driver who is acting within the scope of his employment,\u201d <em>id., </em>and concluded that the plaintiffs only remedy was against the United States (the substituted defendant), under the FTCA. It affirmed the dismissal of the action because the FTCA statute of limitations had run. (The court declined to address whether FECA also barred the plaintiff\u2019s claim, because it resolved the matter on statute of limitations grounds.)</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">Normally, the same principle would apply here: The Westfall Act would abrogate Salazar\u2019s right to sue Ballesteros, the United States would be substituted as the defendant, and Salazar\u2019s only remedy would be against the United States under the FTCA. FECA then might bar her FTCA suit and allow only worker\u2019s compensation as a remedy. The problem in this case, however, is that the Westfall Act never was activated, because Ballesteros apparently failed to follow the elaborate statutory procedures for (1) notifying the Attorney General of the suit, (2) having the Attorney General certify his actions as \u201cwithin the scope of employment,\u201d and (3) petitioning the court for such certification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>in the event that the Attorney General refused to do so. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2679(c), (d). Notably, the Seventh Circuit considered this very problem, though not in the FECA context, in <em>Sullivan v. Freeman, </em>944 F.2d 334 (7th Cir.1991). The <em>Sullivan </em>court found that the defendant-employees were not yet immunized by the Westfall Act because they failed to follow these procedures, and concluded that \u201cdoubtless on remand ... the district court will be asked whether the defendants can still invoke the Act\u2019s protection or have waived it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Because of this procedural problem, Salazar\u2019s suit remains against her co-employee and not against the United States. Under these circumstances, we follow the <em>Allman </em>line of cases, and hold that FECA does not prohibit the plaintiff from suing a co-employee. Therefore, the district court\u2019s judgment is reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">\n<em>REVERSED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b159-6\">. Under the Westfall Act, the United States may be substituted as the defendant if the tortfeasor was a co-employee acting within the scope of his employment. If such a substitution takes place, then FECA may bar the plaintiff\u2019s claim as the suit no longer would be against the co-employee but rather against the United States. <em>See, e.g., Borneman v. United States, </em>213 F.3d 819, 829 n. 3 (4th Cir.2000) (noting, also on review of postal employee's suit against co-employee for assault and battery, that \"once the United States is substituted as defendant [via the Westfall Act], the FTCA may not apply at all ... [because] FECA provides the exclusive remedy for a federal employee against the United States\u201d); <em>Green v. Hill, </em>954 F.2d 694 (on which the district court relied) (noting that the Attorney General invoked the Westfall Act, that the United States was substituted as the defendant, and that the plaintiff\u2019s suit would have to be dismissed under FECA if the assault and battery was work-related), <em>withdrawn in part and amended on petition for reh'g, </em>968 F.2d 1098 (11th Cir. 1992). As discussed below, this is not the case here, because no such substitution took place.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b160-7\">. We note that there are a number of issues that are not sufficiently presented in the record before us, and which we accordingly do not herein undertake to resolve, such as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-8\">(1) whether Salazar's action, having been filed on the basis of diversity of citizenship, <em>see Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, 326 </em>U.S. 99, 65 S.Ct. 1464, 89 L.Ed. 2079 (1945), is barred by the applicable statutes of limitations, <em>see, e.g., </em>Va.Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-243, 8.01-247.1;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-9\">(2) whether Ballesteros waived a statute of limitations or other affirmative defense, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(c);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AhV\">\u00eds) whether Salazar\u2019s claims were timely presented to the appropriate federal agency under the FTCA, <em>see 28 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2401(b), 2675(a), or are otherwise timely under the Westfall Act, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 2679(d)(5), in the event the district court certifies that Bal-lesteros acted within the scope of his employment and substitutes the United States as a defendant; <em>see, e.g., Mittleman v. United States, </em>104 F.3d 410 (D.C.Cir.1997) (discussing timeliness issues under the FTCA and Westfall Act); and (4) whether Ballesteros can invoke the protection of the Westfall Act, or waived it.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
