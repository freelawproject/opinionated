We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm in part and vacate in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-18\">Cortez contends that the district court erred by denying his motion to suppress because the government failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>demonstrate \u201cnecessity\u201d for the wiretap. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(l)(c), (3)(c); <em>United States v. Khan, </em>993 F.2d 1368, 1375 (9th Cir.1993). In an earlier appeal brought by one of his co-defendants, this court upheld the wiretap\u2019s validity and the denial of the motion to suppress in <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>No. 98-50176, 1999 WL 274665 (9th Cir. Apr.23, 1999); the motion had been made in the district court by Cortez and joined by his co-defendant. The doctrine of law of the case therefore establishes that the district court did not err. <em>See United States v. Schaff, </em>948 F.2d 501, 506 (9th Cir.1991) (concluding law of the case doctrine applies when one co-defendant\u2019s appeal is decided before another co-defendant\u2019s appeal, if both were convicted at the same trial); <em>United States v. Tier-ney, </em>448 F.2d 37, 39 (9th Cir.1971).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Cortez contends that the district court committed plain error under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), by imposing a sentence based on an unproven quantity of cocaine and an unproven prior felony drug conviction. We are unpersuaded. The statutory maximum for an unspecified amount of cocaine is twenty years. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C); <em>United States v. Garcia-Guizar, </em>234 F.3d 483, 488 (9th Cir.2000) (outlining procedure for determining whether <em>Apprendi </em>invalidates a sentence), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 121 S.Ct. 1629, 149 L.Ed.2d 490 (2001). Because Cortez\u2019s 121-month sentence was substantially less than the statutory maximum, he fails to show that his rights under <em>Apprendi </em>were violated. <em>See United States v. Nordby, </em>225 F.3d 1053, 1059-60 (9th Cir.2000) (concluding defendant prejudiced because sentence imposed was longer than the maximum had he been sentenced in accordance with the facts as found by the jury); <em>United States v. Hernandez-Guardado, </em>228 F.3d 1017, 1026-27 (9th Cir.2000) (concluding that <em>Apprendi </em>is not implicated if sentence is below the statutory maximum).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">Cortez\u2019s additional contention that <em>Apprendi </em>was violated because an unproven prior drug conviction was used to increase his statutory minimum sentence similarly fails. <em>Apprendi </em>exempted prior convictions from its rule concerning facts that must be pleaded and proven to a jury, and Cortez\u2019s prior conviction did not increase the penalty here beyond the prescribed statutory maximum. <em>See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90. Instead, the prior conviction established only the ten-year minimum mandatory sentence for Cortez\u2019s current conviction. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(b)(1)(B). We conclude that <em>Apprendi </em>has no application here because it dealt with the consideration of facts in sentencing enhancement beyond the statutory <em>maximum, </em>not beyond the statutory <em>minimum. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490; <em>United States v. Garcia-Sanchez, </em>238 F.3d 1200, 1201 (9th Cir.2001) (indicating <em>Apprendi </em>is not implicated when the sentence exceeds the statutory minimum).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-11\">Finally, Cortez contends that the district court erred by failing to comply with the requirements of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(b) at sentencing because the district court: (1) did not ask Cortez whether he affirmed or denied the prior conviction; and (2) did not inform him that any challenge to the prior conviction must be made before sentence was imposed and could not be raised thereafter to attack his sentence. We agree. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(b); <em>United States v. Hamilton, </em>208 F.3d 1165, 1168 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>(9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 867, 121 S.Ct. 164, 148 L.Ed.2d 111 (2000) (stating the district court must strictly comply with section 851(b)). Because the district court failed to comply with section 851(b), the sentence is illegal. <em>See United States v. Garrett, </em>565 F.2d 1065, 1071-72 (9th Cir. 1977).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we vacate and remand for resentencing in full compliance with section 851(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">AFFIRMED in part, and VACATED and REMANDED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b550-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b551-8\">. We note, however, based on our review of the wiretap application and the affidavit, that the district court did not err by denying the suppression motion because necessity was shown. <em>See United States v. Bennett, </em>219 F.3d 1117, 1121-23 (9th Cir.2000), <em>cert, denied, </em>531 U.S. 1153, 121 S.Ct. 1099, 148 L.Ed.2d 971 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b552-17\">. We reject the government\u2019s argument that any error was harmless under <em>United States v. Housley, </em>907 F.2d 920, 921-22 (9th Cir.1990). In contrast to <em>Housley, </em>the district court in the instant case failed to comply with both prongs of section 851(b), and section 851(e) would not have barred Cortez from challenging the prior conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
