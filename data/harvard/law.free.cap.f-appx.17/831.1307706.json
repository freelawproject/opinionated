The cause is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b859-21\">ORDER AND JUDGMENT <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<author id=\"b859-22\">PAUL KELLY, JR., Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b859-23\">Mr. Moneada, a state inmate appearing pro se, applies for a certificate of appeala-bility (\u201cCOA\u201d) to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his habeas corpus petition, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Mr. Moneada was convicted of assault and battery with a deadly weapon and second-degree burglary in Oklahoma state court. II R. at 134. He received concurrent sentences of 999 and 979 years for the respective crimes. <em>Id. </em>at 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-24\">In his petition for habeas relief filed in federal district court, Mr. Moneada asserted four grounds for relief, including a claim that his conviction violated his double jeopardy rights. I R. doc. 1, at 5-9. The matter was referred to a magistrate judge, who recommended that the petition be denied. I R. doc. 22, at 16-17. The magistrate judge advised Mr. Moneada that \u201cfailure to make timely objection to th[e] Report and Recommendation waives his right to appellate review of both factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>and legal questions contained herein.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 17 (citing <em>Moore v. United States, </em>950 F.2d 656 (10th Cir.1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">Mr. Moneada objected only to the magistrate judge\u2019s resolution of his double jeopardy claim. I R. doc. 23, at 2-3. The district court affirmed and adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, I R. doc. 24, at 1-2, and subsequently denied Mr. Moncada\u2019s request for a COA. I R. doc. 32, at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">Mr. Moneada now applies to this court for a COA, asserting that he is actually innocent and that his conviction violated double jeopardy. We consider only the latter argument because Mr. Moneada did not object to the magistrate judge\u2019s finding that there was sufficient evidence to support his conviction. <em>Moore, </em>950 F.2d at 659. The essence of Mr. Moncada\u2019s double jeopardy claim is that he was punished twice for the same crime insofar as his \u201cconviction of burglary is premised upon his intent to commit an assault....\u201d Pet. Amend. Br. at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">To obtain a COA, Mr. Moneada must make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). We have reviewed the record, including Mr. Moncada\u2019s habeas petition, the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, the district court\u2019s order, and Mr. Moncada\u2019s COA application, amended application, and opening brief. Having done so, we hold that a COA should not issue for substantially the same reasons given by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment does not prohibit the imposition of cumulative punishments for separate crimes that arise from the same sequence of events, so long as such punishments are not greater than the legislature intended. <em>Missouri v. Hunter, </em>459 U.S. 359, 366, 103 S.Ct. 673, 74 L.Ed.2d 535 (1983). \u201cIn assessing whether a state legislature intended to prescribe cumulative punishments for a single criminal incident, we are bound by a state court\u2019s determination of the legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>Birr v. Shillinger, </em>894 F.2d 1160, 1161 (10th Cir. 1990) (citation omitted). The OCCA has held that the Oklahoma legislature did not intend for \u201c[bjurglary and other offenses committed within the structure burgled\u201d to merge. <em>Taylor v. State, </em>889 P.2d 319, 339 (Okla.Crim.App.1995). \u201cThe burglary ... perpetrated [is] complete when [the perpetrator] enter[s] the victims\u2019 residence with the intent to commit a crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, Mr. Moneada has not \u201cdemonstrate[d] that reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">We therefore DENY Mr. Moncada\u2019s COA application and DISMISS his petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b859-25\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. This court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
