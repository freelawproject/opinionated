He appeals the district court\u2019s decision not to instruct on entrapment and several aspects of his sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b305-11\">Partridge bought and sold cocaine with Betty Peterson and, after her death, with her daughter, Barbara Rice. Partridge and Rice dated between 1992 and 1994, when they both resided in West Virginia. After they split up, Rice moved to Newport, Tennessee and lived with Peterson, while Partridge remained in West Virginia. Rice continued to see Partridge, however, because he traveled to Newport to buy and sell cocaine with Peterson. Rice witnessed many drug transactions between Partridge and Peterson. When Partridge and Peterson met, Partridge would cut a whole kilogram (\u201ckilo\u201d) of cocaine in half. He would then sell a half kilo to Peterson and keep the other half kilo for himself. From February 1997 through September 1997, Partridge sold a half kilo of cocaine to a whole kilo of cocaine per month to Peterson. Peterson died in September 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-15\">Approximately two months after her mother\u2019s death, Rice began distributing cocaine on her own. She continued her mother\u2019s practice of purchasing half kilos from Partridge. Rice estimated that she bought between 2.5 and 3 kilos of cocaine from Partridge from the time that she took over her mother\u2019s business until she was arrested in June 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-16\">In March 1997, Jim Williams, a special agent with the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (\u201cTBI\u201d), began an undercover investigation of Peterson and her \u201corganization.\u201d After Peterson died, he focused his investigation on Rice. In 1998, he made undercover cocaine purchases from her. In March 1998, Williams attempted to purchase a half kilo of cocaine from Partridge through Rice. Because Rice was having problems getting cocaine from Partridge at that time, Williams arranged a \u201creverse sting operation,\u201d whereby he posed as a cocaine distributor and offered to supply Rice and Partridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-17\">Rice first approached Partridge about Williams\u2019s proposed cocaine deal between the end of May and the beginning of June 1998. She spoke with Partridge by telephone and discussed specifics such as price. In their conversations, Rice and Partridge referred to \u201ccocaine\u201d as \u201ccar.\u201d On June 5, 1998, Rice spoke with Williams on the telephone and told him about the sales price that she had quoted to Partridge, who had decided to purchase a kilo of cocaine through Williams\u2019s operation. During these events, Rice did not know that Williams was an undercover agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>On June 8, 1998, the date of the reverse sting, Rice accompanied Williams to a motel, where they were to meet with cocaine suppliers. At the motel, Rice was confronted by other TBI agents, learned Williams\u2019s true identity for the first time, and agreed to cooperate with law enforcement by contacting Partridge. After she agreed to cooperate, the TBI installed a tape recorder on her telephone. Agents recorded and monitored three subsequent telephone conversations, during which Partridge and Rice discussed the cocaine deal. Rice told Partridge to \u201ccome and pick up his stuff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">In 1999, Partridge and four other defendants were indicted on drug charges. Pursuant to count 1, all five co-defendants were charged with conspiracy to distribute cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. Additionally, counts 21, 22, and 23 charged Partridge with the use of a communication facility \u2014 a telephone \u2014 to facilitate a conspiracy to distribute cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b). While his four co-defendants pleaded guilty to count 1, Partridge went to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Partridge was convicted on counts 1, 21, 22, and 23. The court sentenced him to 151 months imprisonment. To date, Partridge continues to deny any involvement with cocaine and contends that the tape recorded conversations concerned a car sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Partridge appeals three aspects of his trial/sentence. He contends that the district court erred by a) not instructing the jury on entrapment; b) estimating drug quantity for sentencing purposes; and c) incorrectly adjusting his base offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">a. Entrapment Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">We review a district court\u2019s choice of jury instructions under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>See United States v. Prince, </em>214 F.3d 740, 761 (6th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">A valid entrapment defense has two elements: 1) government inducement of the crime and 2) a lack of predisposition on the part of the defendant to engage in the criminal conduct. <em>See Mathews v. United States, </em>485 U.S. 58, 63, 108 S.Ct. 883, 99 L.Ed.2d 54 (1988); <em>United States v. Nelson, </em>922 F.2d 311, 317 (6th Cir.1990). Once a defendant shows that the government induced him to commit an offense, the burden then shifts to the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was predisposed to commit that offense. <em>See Nelson, </em>922 F.2d at 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-11\">A defendant \u201cis entitled to an entrapment instruction whenever there is sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that the government entrapped the defendant.\u201d <em>See United States v. Graham, </em>856 F.2d 756, 762 (6th Cir.1988). To be entitled to an entrapment instruction, however, a defendant must come forward with evidence \u201cthat government agents implanted criminal design in his mind and induced him to commit the offense.\u201d <em>Nelson, </em>922 F.2d at 317. \u201c[E]vidence that Government agents merely afforded an opportunity or facilities for the commission of the crime would be insufficient to warrant such an instruction.\u201d <em>Mathews, </em>485 U.S. at 66. Where a telephone call is initiated by an individual other than a defendant, including law enforcement, that defendant can still be convicted for the unlawful use of a telephone pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b). <em>See United States v. McLernon, </em>746 F.2d 1098, 1107 (6th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-12\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Partridge\u2019s request for a jury instruction on entrapment. He provided no evidence that government agents induced him to commit his crime(s) beyond affording him the opportunity to participate, through drug associate Rice, in another cocaine deal. Partridge\u2019s strongest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>argument is that government agents asked Rice to telephone him, but government initiation of a telephone call does not itself constitute entrapment. Without knowing that Williams was a TBI agent, Rice presented Williams\u2019s proposed cocaine deal to Partridge, whose participation in that deal was well under way before Rice called him at the TBI\u2019s direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">b. Drug Quantity</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Partridge also contends that, pursuant to either i) <em>Apprendi v. New </em>Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) or ii) clear error review, the district court erred in calculating drug quantity for sentencing. \u201cWhether the district court violated the constitutional rule expressed in <em>Apprendi </em>is a question of law we review de novo.\u201d <em>United States v. Arellano-Rivera, </em>244 F.3d 1119, 1126-27 (9th Cir.2001). But, where <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply, a district court\u2019s determination of the quantity of drugs used to compute a defendant\u2019s sentence is a finding of fact that should not be rejected unless clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Lloyd, </em>10 F.3d 1197, 1219 (6th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">i. <em>Apprendi</em></p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">This case is distinguishable from seemingly similar cases where we have found <em>Apprendi </em>violations. In <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>242 F.3d 348 (6th Cir. 2001) (applying <em>Apprendi), </em>where a defendant was sentenced pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), this court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-9\">From a practical perspective ... when a defendant is found guilty of violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), he must be sentenced under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) unless the jury has found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant possessed the minimum amounts required by \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) and \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). Because in this case the government did not charge or attempt to prove to the jury a quantity of drugs that would permit a mandatory sentence, we remand this case to the District Court with instructions to sentence the defendant under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) and in accordance with the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 352. As in <em>Ramirez, </em>Partridge\u2019s indictment \u201ccharged him in general language\u201d and did not specify the quantity of drugs for which he (and his co-conspirators) was indicted. <em>Ramirez, </em>242 F.3d at 350. And the jury did not consider drug quantity when it convicted him.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-12\">But this case is distinguishable from <em>Ramirez </em>and others in the most significant way. In those cases, either an indictment or a district court specified that a defendant was being sentenced pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) or 841(b)(1)(B). Partridge\u2019s indictment, however, did not specify which prong of \u00a7 841(b)(1) that he was to be sentenced under. And, the district court simply stated that he was sentenced under \u00a7 846. Section 846 cocaine violations can be sentenced under three different provisions: \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), 841(b)(1)(B), or 841(b)(1)(C). Since the district court did not specify the prong of \u00a7 841(b)(1) that it used to sentence Partridge, we will treat Partridge\u2019s sentence as a \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-14\">Section 841(b)(1)(C) does not require that a jury make any finding about drug quantity. Instead, it permits the court to sentence a defendant to a term or imprisonment not to exceed 20 years. Partridge was sentenced to less than 20 years. Because we analyze Partridge\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), there is no <em>Ap-prendi </em>violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-15\">ii. Clear Error</p>\n<p id=\"b307-16\">Partridge further contends that, if <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply, the district court clearly erred in estimating drug quantity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>for sentencing. The district court\u2019s conservative estimate of drug quantity was \u201cbased on the evidence introduced at trial and statements made by [Partridge\u2019s] co-defendants.\u201d In concluding that Partridge trafficked in 6 to 7 kilos of cocaine, the district court made the following findings: 1) that from February 1, 1997 until September 30, 1997, Partridge and Peterson would split a kilo of cocaine at least once a month for a total of at least 8 kilos of cocaine but, to \u201cerr on the side of caution,\u201d it would not include this cocaine in its final calculation; 2) Rice testified that she received from 2.5 to 3 kilos from Partridge, meaning that, based upon their established practice of splitting a whole kilo of cocaine, a total of 5 to 6 kilos of cocaine were distributed between Rice and Partridge; and 3) Rice purchased 6 more ounces of cocaine from Partridge at a later sale, where she observed him in possession of the rest of the kilo. In estimating total drug quantity, the court did not include the kilo of cocaine that Partridge was attempting to buy at the time of his arrest in June 1998. The district court did not err by sentencing Partridge pursuant to USSG 2Dl.l(a)(3)(4), which is the applicable sentencing provision where at least 5 but less than 15 kilos of cocaine are involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">c. Base Offense Level Adjustments</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Finally, Partridge argues that the district court erred in the adjustments to his base offense level. He argues that he i) should not have received an upward adjustment for obstruction of justice; ii) should have received a reduction for acceptance of responsibility; and iii) was eligible for the \u201csafety valve\u201d provision. Each of these arguments is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">i. Obstruction of Justice</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">In reviewing a district court\u2019s application of USSG \u00a7 3C1.1, this court applies a three-step approach. <em>See United States v. McDonald, </em>165 F.3d 1032, 1034 (6th Cir.1999). First, findings of fact are reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard. <em>See id. </em>Second, the determination of whether the facts constitute an obstruction of justice, a mixed question of law and fact, is reviewed de novo. <em>See id. </em>And third:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-9\">once there has been a finding of obstruction of justice, the court must apply the enhancement. The guideline states that if \u201cthe defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice during the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense ... increase the offense by 2 levels.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3C1.1. Because the enhancement language of the guideline is mandatory rather than discretionary, such enhancement is reviewed under the de novo standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b308-11\">Pursuant to USSG \u00a7 3C1.1, the district court assessed Partridge with a two-level adjustment for obstruction of justice because he committed perjury. Partridge contends that this enhancement constituted error because the \u201cjury made no finding of fact that [he] committed perjury.\u201d But a jury is not required to make such a finding for \u00a7 3C1.1 to attach. Instead, a district judge is required to make a specific finding that defendant gave false testimony under oath. <em>See United States v. Burnette, </em>981 F.2d 874, 878 (6th Cir. 1992). The district judge made that specific finding with regard to Partridge. Therefore, the district court did not err by assessing a two-level adjustment for obstruction of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-12\">ii. Acceptance of Responsibility</p>\n<p id=\"b308-13\">A district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a defendant\u2019s offense level for acceptance of responsibility is a factual determination that is subject to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>clearly erroneous standard of review. <em>See United States v. Carroll, </em>893 F.2d 1502, 1511-12 (6th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The district court did not grant Partridge a two-level reduction under \u00a7 3E1.1. Partridge argues that he was entitled to an acceptance of responsibility adjustment on the grounds that he should not be penalized for maintaining his innocence, and that he admitted associating with an individual who dealt drugs but was not a co-defendant. His argument is without merit. At trial, Partridge not only pleaded not guilty, but he denied any involvement in drug trafficking. And, after his conviction, he continued (and continues) to deny that he ever distributed cocaine with Rice. Thus, the district court adopted the U.S. Probation Office\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[sjince the defendant proceeded to jury trial and still maintains his innocence, he does not qualify for an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.\u201d That conclusion did not constitute clear error.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">iii. Safety Valve</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">This court treats a district court\u2019s refusal to apply USSG \u00a7 5C1.2 as a factual finding that is subject to clear error review. <em>See United States v. Adu, </em>82 F.3d 119, 124 (6th Cir.1996). In relevant part, USSG \u00a7 5C1.2 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-8\">In the case of an offense under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 ... \u00a7 846 ..., the court shall impose a sentence in accordance with the applicable guidelines without regard to any statutory minimum sentence, if the court finds that the defendant meets the criteria in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(l)-(5) set forth verbatim below:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-9\">(5) not later than the time of the sentencing hearing, the defendant has truthfully provided to the Government all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">A defendant has the burden of proving \u201csafety valve\u201d eligibility by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See Adu, </em>82 F.3d at 123-24. And, \u201c[ejvery court which has considered the issue has held that [\u00a7 5C1.2(5)] requires a defendant to provide complete information regarding the immediate chain of distribution.\u201d <em>United States v. Maduka, </em>104 F.3d 891, 894 (6th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-12\">Partridge contends that the district court erred by finding that he was not eligible under \u00a7 5C1.2. His argument is again based on the fact that he admitted associating with an individual who dealt drugs but was not a co-defendant. In rejecting his argument, the district court cited ample evidence that Partridge has never admitted participating in a cocaine conspiracy. Thus, Partridge has provided the government with no information about or evidence relevant to his drug conspiracy. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s refusal to apply \u00a7 5C1.2 did not constitute clear error.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
