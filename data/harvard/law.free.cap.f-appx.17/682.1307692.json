Burgess, an inmate of the Snake River Correctional Facility, brought a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action alleging that prison officials violated his constitutional rights. Burgess appeals pro se the district court\u2019s grant of judgment on the pleadings as to claims 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8 of his complaint, and the grant of summary judgment as to his remaining First Amendment claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">Burgess\u2019s rights were not violated when the district court ordered that the filing fee be deducted from \u201cplaintiffs trust account.\u201d No misidentification occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">We affirm the dismissal of claims related to the presence of allegedly incorrect information in Burgess\u2019s prison file and sealed PSI report. The allegedly incorrect information was not relied upon by prison officials to any constitutionally significant degree: A prisoner has no constitutional right to a particular custody classification, or to participate or refrain from participation in rehabilitative programs. <em>See, e.g., Moody v. Daggett, </em>429 U.S. 78, 88 n. 9, 97 S.Ct. 274, 50 L.Ed.2d 236 (1976) (rejecting claim that \u201cprisoner classification and eligibility for rehabilitative programs\u201d invoked due process protections).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-14\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b711-15\">We affirm the grant of summary judgment as to Burgess\u2019s First Amendment claims. Even if actionable, Burgess\u2019s claim that the correctional institution is \u201cmaking it appear these religious services are institutionally controlled\u201d is belied by Burgess\u2019s own complaint which acknowledges that the religious services are \u201cprovided by civilian volunteers,\u201d are \u201cnot Federally funded,\u201d and are \u201cvoluntarily\u201d attended.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-16\">We further affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment as to Burgess\u2019s claim that he was punished for failing to attend a religious service because Burgess was never punished for failing to attend worship services. Uncontested facts<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> demonstrate that Burgess was disciplined only for violating a prison rule governing the reporting of inmates to previously designated activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-17\">Finally, Burgess\u2019s claim that he was not permitted to rest on Saturday, his alleged Sabbath, fails because Burgess designated his Sabbath as Sunday and never changed that designation.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-18\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b711-19\">In sum, defendants did not violate Burgess\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>531 U.S. 991, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 2155-56, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b711-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b711-13\">. We reject Burgess\u2019s contention that the district court abused its discretion when it relied upon the \"hearsay testimony\u201d of Acting Administrator of Religious Services Thomas Armstrong. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 803(6) (testimony of custodian of records); <em>see also </em>Fed. R.Evid. 602 (testimony based on personal knowledge).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
