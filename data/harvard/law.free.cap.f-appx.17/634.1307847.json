In view of the time that the case has been pending in this court, the government agreed at argument that it would join in a motion to be filed by appellant Huskey to expedite the appellate proceedings in the Federal Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">The appeal is hereby transferred to the Federal Circuit pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b662-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
