Pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), Pacheco-Canto\u2019s counsel has filed a brief stating that there are no arguable issues for review, and a motion to withdraw as counsel of record. Pacheco-Canto has not filed a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">Counsel has identified and correctly rejected as potential issues for appeal the following: (1) whether the district court failed to comply with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 requirements; (2) whether counsel was ineffective for advising Pacheco-Canto to plead guilty; (3) whether Pacheco-Canto\u2019s sentence violated <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), because it was enhanced by his prior aggravated felony conviction; and (4) whether the district court\u2019s failure to depart for alleged sentencing disparities in \u00a7 1326 cases violated due process. The record indicates these claims are meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">Having conducted an independent review of the record pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 83-84, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we conclude that there are no additional issues for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-11\">Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b670-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
