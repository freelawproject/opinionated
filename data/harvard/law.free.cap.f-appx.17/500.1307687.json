(Accu-Path) and Becton, Dickinson and Company (Becton) entered into a contract obligating Accu-Path to lease medical equipment and purchase medical supplies from Becton over a sixty-month period. Twenty-one months into the contract, Accu-Path terminated the agreement and Becton brought this diversity breach-of-contract action. Accu-Path raised the defense of mistake, arguing that it mistakenly believed the contract included a cancellation clause. Accu-Path also counterclaimed for damages on the basis of misrepresentation, namely, that Becton should have disclosed its intent to sell similar medical equipment to Accu-Path\u2019s customer because the subsequent sale eliminated Accu-Path\u2019s need for the equipment. The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> granted summary judgment to Becton, and Accu-Path appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">Upon careful de novo review of the record, <em>see Roeder v. Metropolitan Ins. &amp; Annuity Co., </em>236 F.3d 433, 436 (8th Cir.2001), we agree with the district court that Accu-Path\u2019s defense and counterclaim fail. Its summary judgment submissions do not show that Becton committed any fraud in inducing Accu-Path to enter into a contract without a cancellation clause, <em>see Union Nat\u2019l Bank v. Farmers Bank, </em>786 F.2d 881, 887 (8th Cir.1986), and Arkansas law requires fraud before rescinding or reforming a contract because of a unilateral mistake, <em>see Westlund v. Melson, </em>7 Ark.App. 268, 647 S.W.2d 488, 489 (Ark.Ct.App.1983). Likewise, the record does not support Accu-Path\u2019s misrepresentation claim, given the lack of evidence of any special relationship of trust or confidence in this arm\u2019s-length transaction. <em>See Union Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>786 F.2d at 887 (under Arkansas law, party has no obligation to inform unless it holds position of influence over the other).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-11\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b529-8\">.
