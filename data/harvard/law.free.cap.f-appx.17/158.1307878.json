He appeals his sentence, alleging that the district court erred in counting his juvenile adjudications in his criminal history score under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4A1.2(d)(2) (2000). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-22\">Hamilton did not contest his criminal history calculation in the district court. On appeal, he argues for the first time that the Sentencing Commission exceeded its mandate and acted irrationally when it created USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(d)(2), which he contends violates the Equal Protection Clause. Because Hamilton failed to raise the issue he presents here in the district court, we review only for plain error. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (to afford relief for unpreserved error, reviewing court must find an error, which is plain, which affects substantial rights, and which seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Guideline section 4A1.2(d)(2) provides that, for offenses committed before age eighteen, one criminal history point is added \u201cunder \u00a7 4Al.l(c) for each adult or juvenile sentence imposed within five years of the defendant\u2019s commencement of the instant offense not covered in (A).\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Hamilton argues that \u00a7 4A1.2(d)(2) is unconstitutional because it automatically treats juvenile adjudications like adult sentences for criminal history purposes, although the juvenile justice system is based on principles and goals that are different from the adult justice system. He further contends that \u00a7 4A1.2(d)(2) violates equal protection in that juvenile adjudications are treated differently from military, foreign, or tribal sentences and civil adjudications. He also notes that incarcerations for treatment, such as insanity or mental disability, are not automatically counted for criminal history purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Hamilton has not demonstrated that the district court plainly erred in accepting the criminal history calculation recommended in the presentence report. The sentencing guidelines as a whole have been held to be constitutional, <em>Mistretta v. United States, </em>488 U.S. 361, 412, 109 S.Ct. 647, 102 L.Ed.2d 714 (1989), and no court has held \u00a7 4A1.2(d)(2) to be invalid. That being so, any alleged error was not plain when Hamilton was sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">We therefore affirm the sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b187-8\">Subsection (A) provides that two criminal history points are added under \u00a7 4Al.l(b) for similar sentences of at least 60 days if the defendant was released from confinement within five years of his commencement of the instant offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
