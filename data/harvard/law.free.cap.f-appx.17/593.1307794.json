Because we hold that the district court erred when it concluded that initiation of termination of the Club Agreement required notice under Sections 26 and 31, we reverse and vacate both summary judgments and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">In 1990, the American Automobile Association (\u201cAAA\u201d) concluded a contract (the \u201cNational Agreement\u201d) with Mellon allowing Mellon to issue credit cards bearing the emblems of some of AAA\u2019s local clubs. The National Agreement required that Mellon also execute separate agreements with the local AAA clubs interested in the credit card program. Accordingly, Mellon on August 1, 1992, entered into the Club Agreement with ACSC, a local AAA member, which allowed Mellon to issue credit cards displaying ACSC\u2019s trademark and tradename. The Club Agreement provides that interpretation of its provisions shall be governed by Delaware and applicable federal laws. The Club Agreement had an initial term of five years and automatically renewed for one year terms thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Section 26(a) of the Club Agreement provides that either party \u201cmay terminate\u201d the Club Agreement after its initial five year term elapses by giving the other party written notice at least 180 days before the expiration of the term. Section 26(a) provides that if the Club Agreement is terminated at Mellon\u2019s initiation, Mellon must pay to ACSC 20% of the \u201cnet positive premium amount\u201d for the sale of ACSC\u2019s accounts. If Mellon and ACSC terminate the Club Agreement by mutual assent, then Mellon, under Section 26(a), must pay ACSC 10% of the \u201cnet positive premium amount.\u201d If ACSC initiates termination of the agreement, however, Mellon is not obligated to pay ACSC anything.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">Section 31 elaborates Section 26(a)\u2019s notice requirement for termination. Section 31 provides that any notice required or permitted under the Club Agreement must be in writing and hand-delivered or mailed by certified or registered mail. Section 31 also stipulates that any notice under the Agreement from ACSC to Mellon must, in order to be effective, be sent to a particular Wilmington, Delaware address and be copied to a particular Pittsburgh address.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-11\">In February 1995, AAA sought to form a financial services company (\u201cFISCO\u201d) to channel financial services through some of its local clubs. AAA solicited Mellon\u2019s interest in FISCO through a Request for Proposal letter dated February 8, 1995, in which AAA asked Mellon if AAA\u2019s local clubs that had credit card agreements with Mellon could terminate their card agreements early in order that they might ink new agreements with FISCO. Responding to this letter, Mellon offered ACSC a proposed early termination agreement. ACSC did not sign it.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-12\">In January 1996, AAA decided to collaborate with PNC Bank (\u201cPNC\u201d) in developing FISCO. Local AAA clubs wishing to participate in FISCO would, to gain their wish, have to conclude separate agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>ments with PNC and terminate their existing agreements with Mellon. On January 31, 1996, Mellon wrote to ACSC concerning AAA\u2019s selection of PNC. In its January 31 letter, Mellon noted that AAA\u2019s selection of PNC \u201craises numerous questions concerning the future of\u2019 the Club Agreement, but confirmed Mellon\u2019s continuing adherence to the Club Agreement. On February 7,1996, ACSC wrote Mellon that \u201cbased upon AAA\u2019s FISCO decision, [ACSC] does not intend to expend funds during 1996 for the acquisition of new ... accountholders____[W]e do not feel it is a prudent use of joint marketing funds to acquire accounts at this time.\u201d Section 16(e) of the Club Agreement required ACSC to contribute $400,000 in 1996 for the solicitation and acquisition of new accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Shortly thereafter, AAA contacted ACSC to see if ACSC would participate in FISCO. ACSC advised AAA in a February 23, 1996, letter copied to Mellon that \u201cThe [ACSC] desires to take advantage of the American Automobile Association National Financial Services RFP Special Condition, which offers clubs an \u2018early out\u2019 from their agreements with Mellon Bank. The Auto Club intends to transfer its credit card program from Mellon Bank to FIS-CO. We look forward to proceeding with the steps necessary for this transfer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">A few months later, Mellon advised ACSC that Mellon interpreted certain of ACSC\u2019s oral requests for termination and the February 23, 1996, letter as effective notice of termination of the Club Agreement and asked that ACSC formalize the termination by signing an enclosed termination agreement. ACSC did not sign the agreement, but suggested revisions that might induce ACSC\u2019s assent. Mellon revised the termination agreement as ACSC suggested and forwarded ACSC the revised version. ACSC, however, did not sign it.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">Mellon continued to fulfill its Club Agreement obligations until October 1996, when Mellon agreed with PNC that PNC would purchase Mellon\u2019s portfolio of AAA-related accounts, including ACSC\u2019s account. Although Mellon and ACSC had commenced negotiations addressing their disagreements concerning the Club Agreement, Mellon sold ACSC\u2019s account to PNC before those disagreements were resolved. Mellon sold its portfolio of AAA-related accounts to PNC for $771 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">Following the sale, ACSC sued Mellon to recover, per Section 26(a) of the Club Agreement, 20% of the \u201cnet positive premium amount\u201d Mellon earned when it sold ACSC\u2019s accounts to PNC. ACSC argued that Mellon initiated termination \u2014 indeed, terminated \u2014 the Club Agreement through the sale of its AAA-related accounts. The District Court agreed and granted ACSC summary judgment. The District Court held that the Club Agreement was not terminated at ACSC\u2019s initiation because ACSC\u2019s various communications to Mellon concerning the Club Agreement were not notice sufficient to trigger termination under Sections 26 and 31. ACSC submitted a motion for summary judgment seeking an award of damages for Mellon\u2019s termination of the Club agreement. The District Court granted this motion, as well, and awarded ACSC $8,502,488.91 in damages. Mellon appeals those summary judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b623-12\">We review the district court\u2019s holding <em>de novo. Meade v. Cedampids, Inc., </em>164 F.3d 1218, 1221 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-13\">The Club Agreement provides that \u201ceither party may terminate this agreement at the expiration of the current term for any reason, with or without cause, by giving the other party written notice at least one hundred and eighty days before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>expiration of the term.\u201d The District Court held that this provision allows the parties to terminate the Club Agreement <em>only </em>by giving notice in the manner the agreement describes in Section 31. <em>See Automobile Club of Southern California v. Mellon Bank (DE) National Association, </em>No. CV 97-6785 (C.D.Cal. Sept. 25, 1998) (order granting summary judgment) (\u201cReading the Club Agreement as a whole, initiation of termination occurs when notice of termination is provided by a party\u201d). The District Court implied, however, that means other than Section 31 notice-giving suffice to terminate the Club Agreement. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cAlthough neither party provided effective notice of termination, Mellon actually effected termination of the Club Agreement when it sold the Club\u2019s accounts to PNC\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">With this implication we concur. The Club Agreement states that either party \u201cmay terminate\u201d the agreement by giving notice of termination in the manner required by Section 31. \u201cMay\u201d here expresses permission or possibility. <em>See Al-lis-Chalmers Corp. v. Lueck, </em>471 U.S. 202, 204 n. 1, 105 S.Ct. 1904, 85 L.Ed.2d 206 (1985); Bryan A. Garner, the Elements op Legal Style 105 (1991). The Club Agreement permits and makes possible termination through Section 31 notice-giving. We do not construe the Club Agreement to make impossible termination by all other means. Indeed, the Club Agreement by its terms explicitly acknowledges at least one other possible means of termination\u2014 the parties\u2019 mutual assent. The Club Agreement, therefore, allows for initiation of termination by means other than notice of termination per Section 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">In fact, it may have been terminated at ACSC\u2019s initiation. ACSC and AAA impelled the series of events that culminated in Mellon\u2019s sale of ACSC\u2019s accounts to PNC. AAA\u2019s selection of PNC as its partner in developing FISCO was the first event in this series. AAA\u2019s selection of PNC, Mellon correctly noted in its January 31, 1996, letter to ACSC, \u201craise[d] numerous questions concerning the future of\u2019 the Club Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">ACSC\u2019s communications to Mellon in the month following AAA\u2019s selection of PNC answered those questions in the negative. On February 7, 1996, ACSC advised Mellon that ACSC planned to violate Section 16(e) of the Club Agreement by expending no funds during 1996 for the solicitation and acquisition of new cardholders. On February 23, 1996, ACSC copied Mellon on a letter from ACSC to AAA declaring that ACSC would pursue an \u201cearly out\u201d from the Club Agreement, that ACSC \u201cintend[ed] to transfer its credit card program from Mellon Bank to FISCO,\u201d and that ACSC in the future would \u201cproceed with the steps necessary for this transfer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-11\">ACSC, then, aware that AAA\u2019s selection of PNC as its FISCO partner worried Mellon with \u201cnumerous questions concerning the future of\u2019 the Club Agreement, informed Mellon in clear terms of ACSC\u2019s intention to withdraw from the Club Agreement and, true to its word, \u201cpro-eeed[ed] with the steps necessary\u201d for withdrawal. That Mellon, with the sale of ACSC\u2019s accounts to PNC, concluded the process of withdrawal from the Club Agreement that ACSC began does not mean that the Club Agreement was terminated at Mellon\u2019s initiation. Rather, because ACSC\u2019s course of conduct in February 1996 made Mellon\u2019s sale of ACSC\u2019s accounts to PNC a near-fait accompli,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>may be that the Club Agreement was terminated at the initiation of ACSC.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The Club has filed a motion for sanctions and the Club and Mellon each filed motions for attorney\u2019s fees in connection with the motion for sanctions. All motions are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">We reverse and vacate the District Court\u2019s orders of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">ALL MOTIONS DENIED, JUDGMENT REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b622-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b624-6\">. ACSC, in other words, repudiated its Club Agreement obligations. <em>See, for example, Shee-han v. Hepburn, </em>138 A.2d 810, 812 (Del.Ch. 1958) (\"An outright refusal of one party to a contract to perform the contract or its essentials constitutes such a repudiation as to entitle the other contracting party to treat the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>contract as rescinded\u201d); Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 253(2) (\"Where performances are to be exchanged under an exchange of promises, one party\u2019s repudiation of a duty to render performance discharges the other party\u2019s remaining duties to render performance\u201d). \"Initiation of termination\u201d conceptually resembles repudiation. Accordingly, our construction of the Club Agreement\u2019s provisions regarding \"initiation of termination\u201d reflects policies that inform Delaware law regarding repudiation. <em>See </em>13 Samuel Williston &amp; Richard A. Lord, A Treatise on the Iaw of Contracts \u00a7 39:38 (4th ed. 1993) (\"Anticipatory repudiation, in addition to being an excuse for nonperformance of contractual obligations and conditions, is a breach of contract, which, like other breaches of contract, entitles the nondefaulting party to walk away from the contract without liability... \u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
