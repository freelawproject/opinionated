Her guideline sentencing range was thirty to thirty-seven months. The District Court departed downward to a sentence of probation, and the government appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-27\">In deciding to depart downward, the District Court relied on a combination of two factors, which the government chai-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>lenges in this appeal, arguing that the court abused its discretion in relying on these two factors and imposing a sentence of probation. The two challenged factors are: (1) Patterson was the mother of an infant, who was some four months old at the time of sentencing, and (2) Patterson had a recently diagnosed congestive-heart condition that required medication and a strict dietary regime.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 5H1.6 (1998), \u201c[f]amily ties and responsibilities ... are not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a sentence should be outside the applicable guideline range.\u201d Family-related considerations are thus \u201cdiscouraged\u201d factors under the analytical framework set out in <em>Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 95, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996). A discouraged factor warrants a departure \u201conly if the factor is present to an exceptional degree or in some other way makes the case different from the ordinary case where the factor is present.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 96. Having searched the record of this case, we find nothing to make Patterson a viable candidate for a downward departure on this ground. There simply are no extraordinary circumstances to \u201ctake[] the case outside the heartland of the applicable Guideline.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 109; see <em>United States v. Kapitzke, </em>130 F.3d 820, 822 (8th Cir. 1997) (holding that district court abused its discretion in granting downward departure to father who was providing financial support to wife and two children); <em>United States v. Bieri, </em>21 F.3d 811, 818 (8th Cir.) (holding that district court did not err in concluding that incarceration of both parents of two young children was not sufficiently extraordinary to support downward departure), <em>cert. denied, </em>513 U.S. 878, 115 S.Ct. 208, 130 L.Ed.2d 138 (1994); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>908 F.2d 396, 398-99 (8th Cir.1990) (holding that district court\u2019s refusal to depart downward was not reviewable where defendant\u2019s status as a single mother of infant was argued to justify a downward departure); <em>see also United States v. Sweeting, </em>213 F.3d 95, 103-04 (3d Cir.) (holding that district court abused its discretion in concluding that family ties and responsibilities of a single mother supporting five children, one of whom suffered from Tourette\u2019s syndrome, were sufficiently extraordinary to justify departure under \u00a7 5H1.6), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 906, 121 S.Ct. 249, 148 L.Ed.2d 180 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">A defendant\u2019s physical condition is also, like family ties and responsibilities, a discouraged basis for departure. Under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 5H1.4 (1998), \u201c[pjhysical condition ... is not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a sentence should be outside the applicable guideline range.\u201d Nevertheless, \u201can extraordinary physical impairment may be a reason to impose a sentence below the applicable guideline range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Patterson\u2019s request for a departure on this ground rested entirely on statements her counsel made at sentencing regarding her congestive-heart condition. Those statements, which everyone present at the sentencing appeared to accept as accurate, fall far short of showing that her heart condition amounted to an \u201cextraordinary physical impairment.\u201d Even assuming that her condition, if untreated, is or would become life-threatening, Patterson has made no showing that the condition cannot properly or adequately be treated by prison medical facilities. The phrase \u201cextraordinary physical impairment\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-10\">should be interpreted according to its manifest purpose. Is the particular de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>fendant\u2019s physical condition such that he or she would find imprisonment more than the normal hardship? Would imprisonment subject him or her to more than the normal inconvenience or danger? Does the physical condition have any substantial present effect on the defendant\u2019s ability to function? These questions must be answered for each individual defendant who claims the benefit of \u00a7 5H1.4.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-4\"><em>United States v. Rabins, </em>63 F.3d 721, 729 (8th Cir.1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>516 U.S. 1153, 116 S.Ct. 1031, 134 L.Ed.2d 109 (1996). \u00c1 departure is properly denied when, as in the present case, there is \u201cno evidence that imprisonment would worsen [Patterson\u2019s] condition or that [she] required special care\u201d that the prison could not provide. <em>Id. </em>at 728. The District Court did not answer, and on the sparse record made at sentencing concerning Patterson\u2019s medical condition could not have answered, the questions that must be answered favorably to the defendant\u2019s position if a downward departure based on the defendant\u2019s physical condition is to be properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">In these circumstances, we must conclude that the District Court\u2019s grant of a downward departure on the basis of the two discouraged factors discussed above was an abuse of discretion. The sentence of probation is vacated and the case is remanded for resentencing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b525-6\">. The District Court also referred favorably to Patterson\u2019s efforts at rehabilitation, a matter not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b526-9\">. Our disposition of the case makes it unnecessary for us to address the government\u2019s claim that the District Court erred as a matter of law in ordering a downward departure without providing meaningful prior notice to the government of the court\u2019s intended reason for departure.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
