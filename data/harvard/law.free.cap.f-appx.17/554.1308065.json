On July 19, 2000, after a two-day trial, the jury returned a guilty verdict. The trial court imposed a sentence of 57 months in custody, enhancing the maximum two-year sentence otherwise allowable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 in light of Salas-Rivera\u2019s prior conviction for Unlawful Sexual Intercourse with a Minor under Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 261.5. On November 13, 2000, Salas-Rivera filed a timely Notice of Appeal. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 1294(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-12\">Salas-Rivera contends that his indictment was invalid because it failed to charge a voluntary entry.. However, we have held that indictments under \u00a7 1326 need not specifically charge a voluntary entry. <em>United States v. Parga-Rosas, </em>238 F.3d 1209, 1213 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201c[W]e have never suggested that the crime of \u2018entry\u2019 must be charged in order to charge the crime of being \u2018found in.\u2019 \u201d). Salas-Rivera acknowledges that <em>Parga-Rosas </em>decided an \u201cidentical claim\u201d to his own, and calls upon this court to rehear this issue en banc. However, this panel is bound by <em>Pargctr-Rosas, </em>and we decline to urge the court to revisit this case en banc. Accordingly, we hold that the indictment was not invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-13\">The trial court refused to give defendant\u2019s proposed jury instructions concerning certain elements of the charged crime. Defendant\u2019s Proposed Instruction 15(a) recited that the government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Salas-Rivera knew that he was an alien, knew that he had been previously deported, and knew that he reentered the United States lacking permission to do so. Defendant\u2019s Proposed Instruction No. 16 recited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>that the United Stated had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had the specific intent to enter the United States. We hold that the trial court properly refused to give these instructions. Being \u201cfound in\u201d the United States in violation of \u00a7 1326 is not a specific intent crime. <em>Penar-Cabanillas v. United States, </em>394 F.2d 785, 788-90 (9th Cir. 1968). Nor must the government prove that Salas-Rivera had knowledge that he was an illegal alien, that he had been previously deported, and that he lacked permission to reenter the United States. <em>See id. </em>at 790. Although general intent to enter the United States is certainly an element of the crime of being \u201cfound in\u201d the United States, the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury as to this element of the crime constituted, at most, harmless error, as Salas-Rivera made no allegation, and nor did the government\u2019s evidence reveal, that his return was involuntary. <em>See United States v. Quintana-Torres, </em>235 F.3d 1197, 1200 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Salas-Rivera argues that under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), he has a Sixth Amendment right to a jury determination of the fact of his prior conviction. We disagree. Under the express limitation of <em>Apprendi, </em>the fact of a prior conviction need not be determined by a jury. <em>Id. </em>at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348. Moreover, under <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 226, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the aggravated felony provision of \u00a7 1326(b)(2) is not a separate criminal offense but, instead, is only a sentencing enhancement for a violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and therefore need not be separately charged. Salas-Rivera\u2019s constitutional challenges to \u00a7 1326 also fail, as we held in <em>United States v. Fresnares-Torres, </em>235 F.3d 481, 482 (9th Cir.2000), that sentencing under \u00a7 1326 comports with <em>Apprendi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Finally, Salas-Rivera contends that the trial court erred in enhancing his sentence under \u00a7 1326(b)(2) in light of his prior conviction under Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 261.5 for Unlawful Sexual Intercourse with a Minor. Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2), a sentence enhancement is only proper when the defendant was previously convicted of an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d To determine whether Salas-Rivera\u2019s prior conviction constitutes an aggravated felony, courts initially must apply a \u201ccategorical\u201d approach, and \u201clook only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Rivera-Sanchez, </em>247 F.3d 905, 907 (9th Cir. 2001) (en banc) (citing <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990)). Importantly, guilt under CaLPenal Code \u00a7 261.5(c) does not necessarily entail a felony conviction. Rather, a person convicted under this statute may be found guilty of either a misdemeanor or a felony. By its very wording then, a person found guilty under \u00a7 261.5 has not necessarily and categorically been convicted of any felony, much less an aggravated felony. Thus, under the categorical approach, it cannot be said that Salas Rivera\u2019s prior conviction constitutes an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\"><em>Taylor </em>also permits courts \u201cto go beyond the mere fact of conviction in a narrow range of cases.\u201d <em>Rivera-Sanchez, </em>247 F.3d at 907 (citing <em>Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143). When a statute \u201creaches both conduct that would constitute [an aggravated felony] and conduct that would not,\u201d <em>id. </em>(citing <em>Ye v. INS, </em>214 F.3d 1128, 1133 (9th Cir.2000), we have interpreted <em>Taylor\u2019s </em>edict to include examination of \u201cdocumentation or judicially noticeable facts that clearly establish that the conviction is a predicate conviction for enhancement purposes[,] such as the indictment, the judgment of conviction, jury instructions, a signed guilty plea, or the tran<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>script from the plea proceedings),\u201d <em>id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Casarez-Bravo, </em>181 F.3d 1074, 1077 (9th Cir.1999)). If such judicially noticeable facts establish that Salas-Rivera\u2019s prior conviction for Unlawful Sexual Intercourse with a Minor necessarily constitutes an aggravated felony, then Salas-Rivera\u2019s sentence enhancement may be reinstated. Sex with a minor under 14 years of age would constitute \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d regardless of any consent. <em>United States v. Baron-Medina, </em>187 F.3d 1144, 1146 (9th Cir.1999). Although at argument the government relied on the probation officer\u2019s report to establish that the minor girl here was only 13, this report sources a police report, which does not fit within the category of documents recited in <em>Rivera-Sanchez. </em>Accordingly, we vacate the sentence imposed on Salas-Rivera and remand for the district court to conduct a second-stage <em>Taylor </em>analysis of the judicially noticeable facts in the existing record and any state court documents that may be obtained and to resentence Salas-Rivera. His conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">AFFIRMED-in-part, VACATED-in-part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b584-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
