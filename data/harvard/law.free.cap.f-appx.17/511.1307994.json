Bennett, </em>531 U.S. 4, 121 S.Ct. 361, 148 L.Ed.2d 213 (2000). Ruben Garcia Guerrero appeals from the district court\u2019s dismissal of his habeas petition, brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, on statute of limitations grounds. After review of the record and the original and supplemental briefs, we conclude that Mr. Guerrero\u2019s petition was timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) imposes a one-year period of limitation on federal habeas petitions. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d). Here, the limitation period began to run on April 24, 1996, the effective date of the AEDPA. <em>Nino v. Galaza, </em>183 F.3d 1003, 1006 (9th Cir.1999). Mr. Guerrero claims that the AEDPA limitations period was tolled from the time he delivered the first state petition on April 14, 1997 until he received the California Supreme Court\u2019s decision denying his last state habeas petition on May 26,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Mr. Guerrero\u2019s first state petition in superior court was delivered after 355 days of the period had run. Under <em>Nino, </em>the statute of limitations is \u201ctolled during the period in which [the petitioner] was properly pursuing his state post-conviction remedies .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1006. After the California Supreme Court denied Mr. Guerrero\u2019s final petition on May 20, 1998, ten days remained in which he could timely file his federal petition. Mr. Guerrero\u2019s petition was delivered to the clerk and stamped \u201clodged\u201d on May 27, 1998, although it was not filed by the clerk until June 4, 1998. The limitations period expired on May 30, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">For purposes of a statute of limitations, papers and pleadings are considered filed when they are placed in the possession of the court, not when they are filed by the clerk. <em>See Cintron v. Union Pacific R. Co., </em>813 F.2d 917, 920 (9th Cir.1987); Fed.R.Civ .P. 5(e). Mr. Guerrero\u2019s petition was delivered three days before the limitations period expired. Accordingly, it was timely filed. Therefore, we reverse and remand to the district court to consider the merits of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b540-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
