Grant also alleged that HRA had unlawfully terminated his benefits once before. Grant sought to enjoin HRA to resume his benefits, retroactive to August 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">State defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, under <em>Will v. Michigan Department of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989), which holds that state agencies are immune from suit under the Eleventh amendment for \u00a7 1983 claims. The district court concluded that <em>Will </em>controlled, and dismissed Grant\u2019s complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Grant sued governmental entities only, which are considered arms of the State for Eleventh Amendment purposes. <em>See Will, </em>491 U.S. at 70, 109 S.Ct. 2304. Therefore, the district court properly determined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review Grant\u2019s claim that termination of his food stamp benefits violated his constitutional rights under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Grant was not afforded an opportunity to amend his complaint to name individual state officials. Accordingly, the case is remanded to the district court to allow such an amendment if Grant be so advised. <em>See Platsky v. CIA, </em>953 F.2d 26, 28-29 (2d Cir.1991) (per curiam) (pro se plaintiff should be granted leave to amend pleadings when \u201c[i]t is not beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts supporting his claim[ ]\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
