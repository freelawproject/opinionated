We review that decision de novo. <em>Botosan v. Paul McNally Realty, </em>216 F.3d 827, 830 (9th Cir.2000). The Privacy Act provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-25\">No agency shall disclose any record which is contained in a system of records by any means of communication to any person, or to another agency, except pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior written consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-26\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(b). Thus, a threshold requirement of a Privacy Act claim is that the agency maintain a system of records that contains the record at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-27\">We agree with the district court that Appellant failed to present sufficient evidence to support the existence of a record. Even assuming that he had, however, Appellant presented no evidence to show that whatever record may have existed was contained in a \u201csystem of records.\u201d A system of records is a \u201cgroup of any records ... from which information is re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>trieved by the name of the individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(a)(5); <em>see also Baker v. Dep\u2019t of Navy, </em>814 F.2d 1381, 1384-85 (9th Cir. 1987) (noting that this definition \u201cmakes coverage under the Act dependent upon the method of retrieval of a record rather than its substantive content\u201d). Here, there is no evidence that such a system existed for the type of record at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">Finally, there is absolutely no authority to support Appellant\u2019s assertion that Ap-pellees had a duty to make a record of Appellant\u2019s participation in the witness protection program and the reasons thereof. Therefore, summary judgment on this ground was appropriate as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b759-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Cir.
