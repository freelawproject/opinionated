R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-18\">Jean Hinderman appeals from the district court\u2019s order dismissing her Title VII complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1). We have jurisdiction over this appeal by virtue of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the court\u2019s dismissal de novo. <em>See U S West, Inc. v. Tristani, </em>182 F.3d 1202, 1206 (10th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-23\">Ms. Hinderman was originally employed by defendant as a civilian clerk at Tinker Air Force Base, but was laid off in 1997 during a reduction in force. She filed suit under Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(3), alleging racial discrimination. That suit was terminated following a written settlement agreement pursuant to which defendant reinstated appellant to a specified position. Ms. Hinderman\u2019s employ was again terminated some nine months later. As provided for in the settlement agreement, she notified the Director of the Air Force Civilian Appellate Review Organization, alleging that defendant had violated the terms of the settlement agreement. The Director issued a written final agency decision denying Ms. Hinderman\u2019s claim that the settlement agreement had been breached. In that decision, the Director notified her that her latest termination was a \u201cnew issue,\u201d and that she should file a new complaint with defendant\u2019s Chief EEO Counselor. Aplt.App. at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-24\">Ms. Hinderman did not contact the EEO counselor, but instead filed suit in federal court, ultimately asserting two claims: that defendant had breached the settlement agreement and that it had terminated her employment \u201cin a racially discriminatory manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20. Defendant moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because Ms. Hinderman had failed to bring her complaints to an agency EEO counselor and file a formal discrimination complaint with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>the agency, as required by Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) regulations. <em>See id. </em>at 27. The district court agreed with defendant that Ms. Hin-derman had not exhausted her administrative remedies and that such exhaustion is a \u201cjurisdictional prerequisite to a lawsuit alleging employment discrimination under Title VII.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 47. The court also noted that Ms. Hinderman\u2019s letter to the Director of the Air Force Civilian Appellate Review Organization could not satisfy her duty to exhaust administrative remedies because it did not allege racial discrimination, but claimed only that defendant had violated the terms of the parties\u2019 settlement agreement. The district court dismissed Ms. Hinderman\u2019s complaint and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">This circuit has held that Title VII\u2019s exhaustion requirements do not apply to \u201cpurely contractual\u201d claims seeking to enforce Title VII settlement agreements. <em>See Cisneros v. ABC Rail Corp., </em>217 F.3d 1299, 1305 (10th Cir.2000).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because <em>Cisneros </em>may operate in this case to excuse Ms. Hinderman from exhaustion, we reverse the district court\u2019s dismissal of her complaint for failure to exhaust her administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">On remand, the district court should first determine the nature of Ms. Hinder-man\u2019s claims. In <em>Cisneros, </em>we distinguished situations where a plaintiff sought to bring new claims of discrimination in connection with an alleged breach of a settlement agreement. <em>See id. </em>(distinguishing <em>Blank v. Donovan, </em>780 F.2d 808, 809-10 (9th Cir.1986)). Here, although Ms. Hinderman\u2019s complaint facially includes allegations of both a breach of the settlement agreement and discriminatory termination under Title VII, her letter to the Director of the Air Force Civilian Appellate Review Organization alleged only breach of the settlement agreement. At this stage of the proceedings, it is unclear whether she is alleging new claims of discrimination to which, arguably, the Title VII exhaustion requirements apply, or whether she is simply attempting to reinstate her previous discrimination claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">Further, should the district court determine that Ms. Hinderman\u2019s claims are not solely contractual in nature and therefore not excused from the Title VII exhaustion requirements by the application of <em>Cisne-ros, </em>the court should address her argument that she is entitled to bring suit pursuant to Title VII because defendant issued a final agency action letter on her claim that the settlement agreement was violated. Finally, if <em>Cisneros </em>applies to excuse Ms. Hinderman from exhausting her Title VII administrative remedies, the district court should consider whether federal jurisdiction exists. This court has not decided whether Title VII provides a jurisdictional basis in cases alleging only breach of a Title VII settlement agreement. <em>See Cisneros, </em>217 F.3d at 1302; <em>cf. Morris v. City of Hobart, </em>39 F.3d 1105, 1110-12 (10th Cir.1994) (rejecting notion that Title VII provides independent jurisdictional ground for breach of contract claims arising from <em>private </em>settlement agreements); <em>Snider v. Circle K Corp., </em>923 F.2d 1404, 1407 (10th Cir.1991) (holding federal common law applies to Title VII settlement agreements, and noting that such agreements are \u201cinextricably linked to Title VII\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-9\">We REVERSE the judgment of the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma and REMAND <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>this case for further proceedings consistent with this order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b881-19\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b882-6\">. Although <em>Cisneros </em>was decided five months before the district court\u2019s ruling, neither the parties nor the court apparently contemplated its applicability to this case. We asked the parties to file simultaneous supplemental appellate briefs on this point.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
