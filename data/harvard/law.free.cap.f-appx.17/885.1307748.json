RApp. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-24\">Proceeding <em>pro se </em>and <em>informa pauper-is, </em>Francisco Sosa appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of the civil rights complaint he brought alleging causes of action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985(3). Sosa contended that the defendant, his court-appointed attorney, forced him to enter a plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>to the criminal charges against him, thereby depriving him of his constitutional rights. Sosa also alleged that the defendant conspired to deprive him of his civil rights in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(3). The district court concluded that Sosa had failed to state claims upon which relief may be granted and dismissed his complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>A district court may dismiss <em>sua sponte </em>a <em>pro se </em>complaint for failure to state a claim when it is \u201cpatently obvious that the plaintiff could not prevail on the facts alleged, and allowing him an opportunity to amend his complaint would be futile.\u201d <em>See McKinney v. Okla. Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., </em>925 F.2d 363, 365 (10th Cir.1991) (quotation and citations omitted). It is well-settled that \u201c[a] public defender does not act under color of state law when performing a lawyer\u2019s traditional functions as counsel to a defendant in a criminal proceeding.\u201d <em>Polk County v. Dodson, </em>454 U.S. 312, 325, 102 S.Ct. 445, 70 L.Ed.2d 509 (1981); <em>see also Harris v. Champion, </em>51 F.3d 901, 910 (10th Cir.1995). In addition, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(3) applies only to conspiracies motivated by \u201csome racial, or perhaps otherwise class-based, invidiously discriminatory animus.\u201d <em>Griffin v. Breckenridge, </em>403 U.S. 88, 102, 91 S.Ct. 1790, 29 L.Ed.2d 338 (1971). The district court based it\u2019s dismissal of Sosa\u2019s complaint on this controlling Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">In his notice of appeal, Sosa contends that he should have been given the opportunity to amend his complaint to correct any deficiencies. Sosa then purports to amend his complaint by deleting the allegation that the defendant was acting under of color of state law. Sosa also alleges several additional constitutional violations. Even if Sosa is permitted to amend his complaint as proposed, he cannot state a valid \u00a7 1983 claim against defendant. <em>See Am. Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sullivan, </em>526 U.S. 40, 49-50, 119 S.Ct. 977, 143 L.Ed.2d 130 (1999) (\u201cTo state a claim for relief in an action brought under \u00a7 1983, [plaintiffs] must establish that they were deprived of a right secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States, and that the alleged deprivation was committed under color of state law.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">The district court\u2019s order contains an extremely clear and concise explanation of controlling law. In light of that order, this court concludes that Sosa\u2019s appeal is frivolous and malicious. Accordingly, this court dismisses Sosa\u2019s appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Sosa\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). Our dismissal of Sosa\u2019s appeal also counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). Thus, Sosa has now accumulated two strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Jennings v. Natro-na County Det. Ctr. Med. Facility, </em>175 F.3d 775, 780 (1999). Sosa is hereby warned that if he accrues one more strike, he will be precluded from proceeding <em>in forma pauperis </em>in any further civil proceedings unless he is under \u201cimminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). Sosa is further notified that despite this court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal, he remains obligated to continue making partial payments until his appellate filing fee is paid in full. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1915(b). Sosa\u2019s Motion to Appear in <em>Propria Persona </em>is construed as a request for oral argument and is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b913-17\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
