We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-16\">Because Zamudio-Orozco did not challenge the prior aggravated felony convictions used to enhance his sentence nor object to the indictment, we review his claims for plain error. <em>United States v. Pacheco-Zepeda, </em>234 F.3d 411, 413 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-17\">At sentencing, the district court increased Zamudio-Orozco\u2019s offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A), which authorizes a 16-level increase where \u201cthe defendant previously was deported after a criminal conviction [and] the conviction was for an aggravated felony.\u201d Information in Zamudio-Orozco\u2019s presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) stated that he had two prior aggravated felony convictions, one in 1988 and one in 1993, both for delivery of a controlled substance. Relying on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Zamudio-Orozco maintains that the district court erred by imposing a sentence in excess of the two-year maximum set forth in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) on the basis that neither of the prior convictions were charged in the indictment, submitted to the jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The Supreme Court in <em>Apprendi </em>stated, \u201cOther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63. Zamudio-Orozco contends that <em>Apprendi </em>renders inapplicable <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 226, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), which held that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) \u2014 the subsection which increases the penalty for previous deportation following conviction of an aggravated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>felony \u2014 is a penalty provision for recidivist behavior and does not define a separate offense. Therefore, a prior conviction is the only factor that increases a penalty beyond the statutory maximum that need not be submitted to a jury. <em>See Jones v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 227, 248, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999). Zamudio-Orozco\u2019s argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>Pacheco-Zepeda, </em>which held that <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Al-mendarez-Torres, </em>and found that the government is not required to included prior aggravated felony convictions in the indictment, submit them to a jury, or prove them beyond a reasonable doubt when used as the basis for a sentencing enhancement under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). 234 F.3d at 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">In addition, Zamudio-Orozco\u2019s argument that the PSR, uncontroverted by any other evidence, is insufficient to prove a prior conviction, has been addressed and rejected by this court in <em>United States v. Romero-Rendon, </em>220 F.3d 1159, 1163 (9th Cir.2000) (holding that the PSR alone provides clear and convincing evidence of the previous conviction for aggravated felony where the defendant has been convicted under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 with a sentencing enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b538-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
