The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-18\">Milton Hansen, a federal prisoner proceeding pro se, requests a certificate of appealability to appeal the denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 habeas petition. We deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-19\">Hansen pled guilty to one count of attempted manufacture of methamphetamine pursuant to a plea agreement and, on August 26, 1998, was sentenced to seventy months in prison. He did not file a direct appeal. He filed his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 petition on November 21, 2000, asserting he was sentenced contrary to the strictures of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). The magistrate judge recommended that the petition be dismissed as untimely. The district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation and dismissed the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-20\">As an initial matter, we address the question of jurisdiction. This court has adopted a \u201cfirm waiver\u201d rule when a party fails to object to the findings and recommendations of the magistrate judge. <em>Moore v. United States, </em>950 F.2d 656, 659 (10th Cir.1991). \u201cOur waiver rule provides that the failure to make timely objection to the magistrate\u2019s findings or recommendations waives appellate review of both factual and legal questions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, Hansen mailed his objections on the tenth day after the report and recommendation was filed and the district court referenced his objections in its opinion. Therefore, we have jurisdiction to consider the case on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>Generally, \u00a7 2255 prohibits a prisoner from filing a petition more than a year after the final judgment of conviction. Hansen filed his petition more than two years after the final judgment. However, he argues his petition is within the following exception to the one-year standard rule: \u201cThe limitation period shall run from ... the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if that right has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">We need not reach the retroactivity issue. <em>Apprendi </em>is only relevant where a defendant has been sentenced beyond the statutory maximum. <em>See United States v. Keeling, </em>235 F.3d 533, 538 (10th Cir.2000). Hansen pled guilty to attempted manufacture of methamphetamine pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846. The maximum sentence for this crime is twenty years. <em>See </em>\u00a7 841(b)(1). Because Hansen was sentenced to less than the statutory maximum, <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply. <em>See United States v. Thompson, </em>237 F.3d 1258 (10th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">Hansen has not \u201cmade a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). We DENY a certificate of appealability and DISMISS the appeal. The motion to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal is DENIED. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b963-16\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir.R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
