We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-26\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b843-27\">Mr. \"Whitaker, along with co-defendant Tracy Tooker, was charged with bank extortion and aiding and abetting after attempting to extort money from two banks in Ogden, Utah. I R. doc. 13. Mr. Tooker was arrested shortly after the second attempted extortion, TV\" R. at 18, 48-49, and confessed his involvement. I R. doc. 93, ex. 2, at 8. Mr. Whitaker was then arrested. IV R. at 19, 49. Pursuant to a warrant issued by a state magistrate judge, FBI agents searched Mr. Whitaker\u2019s apartment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>The warrant affidavit included a statement by Mr. Tooker after his arrest. Mr. Tooker\u2019s initial statement corroborated much of what FBI agents had observed immediately after the attempted extor-tions. I R. doc. 93, ex. 2. In addition, Mr. Tooker stated that Mr. Whitaker had recruited him to assist in the extortions. <em>Id. </em>at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">Mr. Whitaker filed a motion to suppress, which was referred to a magistrate judge. Mr. Wfiiitaker argued that the search warrant was deficient because the warrant affidavit \u201cneglected to reference ... 1. Tooker\u2019s limited mental capabilities; 2. The stressful nature of Tooker\u2019s interrogation; 3. The inconsistencies of Tooker\u2019s confession; and 4. Tooker\u2019s recantation of his confession.\u201d I R. doc. 99, at 3; <em>see also id. </em>doc. 88, at 4. Specifically, Mr. Whitaker alleged that Mr. Tooker was illiterate and had only a seventh-grade education, <em>id. </em>doc. 88, at 1, and was distraught (and even cried) during the interrogation. <em>Id. </em>at 2. He also alleged that Mr. Tooker made several inconsistent statements regarding the second extortion attempt. <em>Id. </em>Mr. Tooker said that his accomplice was named \u201cBeckstead,\u201d that he was to pick up a brown bag (as opposed to a envelope), and that he was to pick up the money from between barricades (as opposed to the fourth break in a retaining wall). <em>Id. </em>Finally, after confessing and speaking with his girlfriend by telephone, Mr. Tooker recanted, claiming that he had told the agents what they wanted to hear so that he could make the telephone call. <em>Id. </em>Mr. Wfiiitaker requested a hearing under <em>Franks v. Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978). <em>Id. </em>doc. 87.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">The federal magistrate judge denied Mr. WTiitaker\u2019s request for a <em>Franks </em>hearing, II R. at 18, and recommended that his motion to suppress be denied. I R. doc. 99, at 11. Exercising de novo review, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1), the district court affirmed the magistrate judge\u2019s denial of the motion, concluding that \u201ceven if the omitted information had been included, the search warrant would still have established probable cause to search defendant Whitaker\u2019s house and truck.\u201d Aplt. Br. att. B, at 2. Mr. Whitaker was convicted of two counts of bank extortion and aiding and abetting, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2, 2113(a). I R. doc. 147, at 1. On appeal, Mr. Whitaker argues that the district court erred in refusing to conduct an evi-dentiary hearing. Aplt. Br. at 6. <em>Discussion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">If the defendant \u201cmakes a substantial preliminary showing\u201d that a warrant affidavit contains an intentional or reckless false statement, the Fourth Amendment requires a hearing if the \u201callegedly false statement is necessary to the finding of probable cause.... \u201d <em>Franks, </em>438 U.S. at 155-56, 98 S.Ct. 2674; <em>see also United States v. Kennedy, </em>131 F.3d 1371, 1376 (10th Cir.1997). Where material information has been omitted from the affidavit, a hearing is required if a reasonable magistrate judge would not have issued the warrant had the affidavit included the omitted information. <em>Kennedy, </em>131 F.3d at 1375.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">\u201cWe review de novo a district court\u2019s determination of reasonableness [of a warrant] under the Fourth Amendment,\u201d and ask \u201cwhether the issuing magistrate ... had a substantial basis for finding probable cause....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1376 (citation and internal quotations omitted). We give \u201cgreat deference\u201d to that decision. <em>Id. </em>Probable cause exists if, \u201cgiven all the facts and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>circumstances set forth in the affidavit before [the state magistrate judge], including the veracity and basis of knowledge of persons supplying hearsay information, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1378 (quoting <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 238, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983)) (internal quotations omitted); <em>see also United States v. Cook, </em>949 F.2d 289, 292 (10th Cir.1991). The state magistrate judge need only have a \u201csubstantial basis for ... concluding] that a search would uncover evidence of wrongdoing.\u201d <em>Kennedy, </em>131 F.3d at 1378 (quoting <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 236, 103 S.Ct. 2317) (internal quotations omitted) (alterations in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">In addition to Mr. Tooker\u2019s statement, the warrant affidavit recited the following. On January 7, a Bank of Utah branch received a call from a pay phone just north of the bank. I R. doc. 93, ex. 2, at 3. The caller was male. The caller told the bank that there was a note taped to a dumpster located behind the bank. The note was typed on tractor-feed computer paper (with perforated edges) and attached to the dumpster with duct tape. <em>Id. </em>at 4. The branch manager was instructed to take $4,750 by bus to a particular location, where the manager would be given further instructions. <em>Id. </em>at 3. The note stated if the demand was not met, an eight-year-old girl would be kidnaped and killed. <em>Id. </em>at 3-4. Approximately fifteen minutes after the call, officers observed Mr. Tooker in a parking lot west of the bank. <em>Id. </em>at 4 \u2014 5. Mr. Tooker was watching the bank and then drove his truck south in the parking lot to a grocery store. <em>Id. </em>at 4. Fifteen minutes later, Mr. \"Whitaker was observed in the same parking lot in his truck. <em>Id. </em>at 5. He was also watching the bank. Mr. Tooker made a gesture to Mr. Whitaker. Mr. Whitaker remained for approximately a half horn', and then returned to his apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">The next day, an Ogden police officer visited Mr. Whitaker\u2019s apartment to follow up on previous noise complaints. Mr. Whitaker wrote his telephone number on a piece of tractor-feed computer paper with perforated edges and gave it to the officer. The officer observed a computer and printer in Mr. Whitaker\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">On January 14, a note was discovered on the front door of a First Security Bank branch. The note was attached with duct tape and \u201cinstructed the manager to deliver $10,000 to a location just north of the bank.\u201d Approximately twenty-five minutes after the note was discovered, Mr. Whitaker was observed in his truck in a parking lot west of the bank. <em>Id. </em>at 7. Mr. Whitaker then proceeded north approximately 100 yards, stopped, and opened the hood of his truck. Five minutes later, Mr. Whitaker drove to the parking lot where the manager was instructed to leave the money. Mr. Whitaker then returned to his apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">The bank manager and an FBI agent then left a package in the parking lot where the manager had been instructed to leave the money. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Tooker drove to the parking lot and was arrested. <em>Id. </em>at 7-8. Mr. Whitaker was then arrested. <em>Id. </em>at 9. The arresting agents did a protective sweep of Mr. Whitaker\u2019s apartment and observed a computer and two printers.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">It is readily apparent that there was enough evidence, independent of Mr. Tooker\u2019s statement, to support a finding of probable cause. Even if the affidavit had disclosed the omitted information, a reasonable state magistrate judge would have still issued the warrant. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s decision not to hold a <em>Franks </em>hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-10\">In so holding, we reject Mr. Whitaker\u2019s argument that the district court relied upon the magistrate judge\u2019s incorrect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>statement of the applicable law. Aplt. Br. at 8; Aplt. Reply Br. at 2. At the suppression hearing, counsel for Mr. Whitaker stated that the FBI \u201cmust tell the judge all of the salient information so the judge can make an impartial decision.\u201d II R. at 9-10. The magistrate judge responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao_\">Where is the law that says that they need to do that? The law says that they need to establish probable cause, provide sufficient facts to have probable cause for the issuance of a warrant. That\u2019s what the law requires. That\u2019s what the Fourth Amendment requires. WTiere does it say they have to tell the judge everything?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b846-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 10. It should first be noted that the district court reviewed the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation de novo, and, further, that the recommendation did not include a statement to this effect. In any event, even if the district court\u2019s order can be read to have adopted the above statement, the district court did not commit reversible error. While this statement is inconsistent with <em>Kennedy </em>(insofar as it can be read to mean that police officers may withhold material information from the court in applying for a warrant), see <em>Kennedy, </em>131 F.3d at 1375, the magistrate judge proceeded to correctly analyze Mr. Whitaker\u2019s <em>Franks </em>hearing request, both at the hearing and in his report and recommendation. At the hearing, the magistrate judge repeatedly asked counsel for Mr. Whitaker whether the warrant affidavit, independent of Mr. Tooker\u2019s statement, supported a finding of probable cause. II R. at 10, 13, 15-16. The judge posited the same question in the report and recommendation. <em>See also </em>I R. doc. 99, at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b843-17\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.

R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b843-18\">. Following a partial remand by this court, the district court granted Mr. Whitaker\u2019s motion for extension of time in which to file a notice of appeal. I Supp. R. doc. 164. We reserved judgment on the timeliness of this appeal. <em>United States v. Whitaker, </em>Order, No. 00-4158 (10th Cir. filed Jan. 25, 2001). We now hold that Mr. Whitaker\u2019s notice of appeal was timely, <em>see Hinton v. City of Elwood, </em>997 F.2d 774, 778 (10th Cir. 1993), and proceed to the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b843-29\">. In the apartment, agents found computer equipment, IV R. at 54, and an extortion note addressed to a Nevada casino next to a com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>puter in the living room. <em>Id. </em>at 59. Agents also found, among other things, tractor-feed computer paper with perforated edges, <em>id. </em>at 66, and duct tape. <em>Id. </em>at 67. The agents seized \"a computer with a hard drive and data storage disks,\u201d which were the object of Mr. Whitaker\u2019s motion to suppress.
