Robinson, an Arizona state prisoner, appeals the federal district court\u2019s dismissal of his petition for writ of habeas corpus. The facts and prior proceedings are known to the parties; they are not cited herein, except as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, a petition for writ of habeas corpus may be granted if the state court\u2019s adjudication of the claim: \u201c(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or (2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Robinson bases his habeas petition on ineffective assistance of counsel. Under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>the controlling federal law in this case, Robinson must establish that (1) counsel was deficient at the pre-sentence hearing, which (2) prejudiced Robinson\u2019s defense so severely that it produced an unreliable result at trial. 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Robinson has failed to demonstrate prejudice, for he has not shown a reasonable probability that his sentence would have been different but for counsel\u2019s allegedly deficient performance. <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Though he criticizes counsel for asserting an actual innocence argument that was contrary to Robinson\u2019s plea, the record demonstrates that the state court would have imposed the same sentence absent counsel\u2019s alleged errors. Considering the aggravating factors, Robinson\u2019s prison term is within the statutory range assigned to his crime. Therefore, he was not denied effective assistance of counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (\u201cIf it is easier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice ... that course should be followed.\u201d). Accordingly, the state court\u2019s decision was not \u201ccontrary to, or ... an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-10\">Therefore, the district court\u2019s denial of Robinson\u2019s petition for writ of habeas corpus is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b602-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
