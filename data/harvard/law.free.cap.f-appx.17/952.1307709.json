R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">Plaintiff-appellant Vent Jeffries appeals from a jury verdict rendered in favor of defendant Board of County Commissioners of Tulsa County (Board) on his suit alleging racial discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e to 17, and violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101 12213. Mr. Jeffries challenges the district court\u2019s refusal to allow him to amend his complaint at trial, asserts unfair prejudice by improper remarks made during the Board\u2019s closing argument, and alleges reversible error in the court\u2019s response to a question submitted by the jury. Our jurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">Mr. Jeffries was employed as a Tulsa county deputy from 1988 until his termination in November 1997. Mr. Jeffries alleged that he suffered racial discrimination during his tenure as a deputy and that the sheriff\u2019s department also failed to accommodate his disability resulting from emphysema. The Board denied that county employees discriminated against Mr. Jeffries and alleged that he was terminated because he did not report to work. The case went to trial. After presentation of the case-in-chief, counsel for Mr. Jeffries stated that testimony elicited from a county employee about the timing of the sheriff\u2019s receipt of Mr. Jeffries\u2019 EEOC complaint suggested that Mr. Jeffries had also been terminated in reprisal for having filed his EEOC complaint. Counsel requested that the pleadings be amended to conform to that proof pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(b), which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-7\">When issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings. Such amendment of the pleadings as may be necessary to cause them to conform to the evidence and to raise these issues may be made upon motion of any party at any time, even after judgment; but failure so to amend does not affect the result of the trial of these issues. If evidence is objected to at the trial on the ground that it is not within the issues made by the pleadings, the court may allow the pleadings to be amended and shall do so freely when the presentation of the merits of the action will be subserved thereby and the objecting party fails to satisfy the court that the admission of such evidence would prejudice the party in maintaining the party\u2019s action or defense upon the merits. The court may grant a continuance to enable the objecting party to meet such evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b981-9\">The Board objected, arguing that (1) the reprisal claim was barred by the statute of limitations; (2) the claim was barred for failure to exhaust administrative remedies; (3) Mr. Jeffries had been aware from the inception of suit of the proximity in time between his filing of the EEOC claim and his termination; and (4) because there was insufficient time to prepare a defense, the Board would be unfairly prejudiced by having to address such a claim at trial. Appellant\u2019s App. at 348-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-10\">The district court denied the motion to amend, finding that Mr. Jeffries had been given ample opportunity to discover and bring the retaliation claim both before entry of the pretrial order and before trial, and that the claim was likely barred by the statute of limitations. <em>Id. </em>at 349-50. On appeal, the Board additionally argues that Mr. Jeffries failed to introduce issues or evidence not already relevant to his discrimination and ADA claims, and therefore, its failure to object to the testimony regarding the timing of the receipt of the EEOC complaint should not be deemed as consent to try the issue of retaliation. Ap-pellee\u2019s Br. at 3-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>We review the denial of the motion to amend for an abuse of discretion. <em>Koch v. Koch Indus., Inc., </em>203 F.3d 1202, 1216 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 926, 121 S.Ct. 302, 148 L.Ed.2d 242 and \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 121 S.Ct. 302, 148 L.Ed.2d 242 (2000). In <em>Koch, </em>we noted that Rule 15(b) does not apply when evidence raised at trial is relevant to other issues already being tried. <em>Id. </em>at 1217. Therefore, our first inquiry is whether evidence of the receipt of the EEOC complaint was relevant to the issues of discrimination and/or ADA claims. We conclude that it was. Mr. Jeffries was on sick leave for almost three months in 1997. Although there was evidence that the sheriffs department had previously placed him in several appropriate light-duty positions after learning of his disability in 1995, Mr. Jeffries claimed that he was not properly accommodated in August 1997 when he returned to work after the sheriff received the EEOC complaint. He claimed that, before the sheriff received the complaint, he was scheduled to report to a light-duty clerical job at the city jail. Instead, on the night he returned to work, he was assigned to the county jail, where he was exposed to, and injured by, residual pepper spray. Other testimony indicated that Mr. Jeffries was temporarily assigned to a light-duty job at the county jail in response to an emergency need for personnel. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s. App. at 127-28. If the jury had believed Mr. Jeffries\u2019 version of the events, it could have inferred that the sheriff intentionally failed to place Mr. Jeffries in an appropriate working environment, thereby refusing to reasonably accommodate his disability. Receipt of the complaint was therefore relevant to Mr. Jeffries\u2019 ADA claim, and pursuant to <em>Koch, </em>Rule 15(b) is not applicable as a basis for amendment of the pretrial order. See 203 F.3d at 1217.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">We must next determine whether there is any other basis for holding that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to allow amendment of the pretrial order. \u201cThe order following a final pretrial conference shall be modified only to prevent manifest injustice.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 16(e). It is a general rule that issues not raised in the pretrial order should not be allowed to be raised at trial \u201c \u2018if the evidence or issue was within the knowledge of the party seeking modification [of the pretrial order] at the time of the [pretrial conference].\u2019 \u201d <em>Koch, </em>203 F.3d at 1217 (quoting 6A Charles A. Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice <em>&amp; </em>Procedure \u00a7 1527, at 278-89 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-6\">We- conclude that the underlying facts \u2022 and issue of retaliatory discharge were within Mr. Jeffries\u2019 knowledge at the time of the pretrial conference and that he cannot establish manifest injustice. The district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow Mr. Jeffries to amend the pretrial order at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-7\">We next address Mr. Jeffries\u2019 claim that the Board\u2019s closing argument unfairly prejudiced the jury. We note, however, that Mr. Jeffries did not contemporaneously object to the comments or request a corrective instruction. By failing to object, Mr. Jeffries waived any argument he may have had concerning the statements made by the Board\u2019s counsel. <em>See Glenn v. Cessna Aircraft Co., </em>32 F.3d 1462, 1465 (10th Cir.1994) (\u201cA party who waits until the jury returns an unfavorable verdict to complain about improper comments during ... closing argument is bound by that risky decision and should not be granted relief.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-8\">We also reject Mr. Jeffries\u2019 confusing contention that the district court improperly responded to a jury question. During deliberations, the jury apparently<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>the court whether it had an option to recommend reinstatement of Mr. Jeffries\u2019 job with the sheriffs office. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s App. at 394-95. After conducting research indicating that reinstatement is a matter left to the court\u2019s discretion and is not a jury question, <em>see, e.g., Bingman v. Natkin &amp; Co., </em>937 F.2d 553, 558 (10th Cir.1991) (stating that an \u201caward of equitable relief by way of reinstatement rests in the discretion of the trial court\u201d), the district court instructed the jury that it was not an option. Mr. Jeffries claims, without explanation or citation to legal authority on point, that if the court had responded that reinstatement was one of the jury\u2019s options, \u201cthe results could have been different.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 15. We disagree. The jury specifically found that Mr. Jeffries had not proved either race discrimination or violation of the ADA. Mr. Jeffries was therefore not entitled to any type of remedy, including the equitable remedy of reinstatement. The result could not have been different even if the jury had been told it could recommend reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">The judgment of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b980-16\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.
