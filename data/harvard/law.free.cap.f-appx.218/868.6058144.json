Though Redeker-Barry\u2019s notice of appeal states she is appealing the magistrate judge\u2019s May 24, June 5, and December 1, 2005, orders denying her motions to quash and for reconsideration, this Court only possesses jurisdiction to review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>the district court\u2019s orders denying her \u201cmotion to request a <em>de novo </em>determination\u201d and final motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">First, AmSouth\u2019s compliance with the IRS summons did not render this case moot because the district court could have provided a partial remedy by ordering the IRS to destroy or return all copies of the documents produced by AmSouth. <em>See Church of Scientology v. United States, </em>506 U.S. 9, 113 S.Ct. 447, 450, 121 L.Ed.2d 313 (1992). Accordingly, the district court erred in denying Redeker-Barry\u2019s \u201cmotion for a <em>de novo </em>determination\u201d as moot. Second, we have held that, where the legality of an IRS summons is at issue, a taxpayer has a minimal right to discovery which can be fulfilled through an evidentiary hearing at the district court. <em>United States v. Harris, </em>628 F.2d 875, 881 (5th Cir.1980).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court erred in denying Redeker-Barry the opportunity to conduct discovery before denying her \u201cmotion to request a <em>de novo </em>determination.\u201d We vacate the denial of Redeker-Barry\u2019s motion, and remand to the district court for discovery and consideration of whether the IRS summons of Redeker-Barry\u2019s records from AmSouth should be quashed.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b897-8\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), this Court adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to close of business on September 30, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
