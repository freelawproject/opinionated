California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Calderon has filed a response. Our independent review of the record, counsel\u2019s brief, and Calderon\u2019s response shows that there are no nonfrivolous issues for appeal. Although Calderon argues in his response that his counsel was ineffective for various reasons, the record is insufficiently developed to allow consideration of these claims on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Higdon, </em>832 F.2d 312, 313-14 (5th Cir. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-24\">Accordingly, the motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The Government\u2019s motion to dismiss is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b334-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
