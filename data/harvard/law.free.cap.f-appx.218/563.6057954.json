R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b592-7\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">Major Singh Mann, a native and citizen of India, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) decision, which summarily affirmed the Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) order denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">When, as here, the BIA affirms without an opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s decision directly. <em>See Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 849 (9th Cir.2003). We review for substantial evidence, <em>Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962 (9th Cir.2004), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-10\">The IJ found that Mann\u2019s demeanor was not convincing, noting that Mann often mumbled his answers, which the IJ found to indicate hesitation and reluctance. We conclude that there is no reason to discount the IJ\u2019s reliance on Mann\u2019s demean- or. <em>See Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1151 (9th Cir.1999) (noting that \u201cspecial deference\u201d is given to a credibility determination based on demeanor); <em>cf. Arulampalam v. Ashcroft, </em>353 F.3d 679, 685-86 (9th Cir.2003) (distinguishing findings regarding non-verbal communication and \u201cfactors concerning the nature of petitioner\u2019s testimony,\u201d that are ascertainable from the record).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-13\">In addition, the IJ found that Mann was not credible based upon discrepancies between Mann\u2019s credible fear interview and his testimony at the hearing regarding the number and circumstances of his arrests, and the length of his detentions. We conclude that because Mann\u2019s credible fear interview was conducted under oath, with the benefit of an interpreter, and recorded in question and answer format, the credible fear interview statement was a reliable impeachment source. <em>See Li, </em>378 F.3d at 962-63 (upholding adverse credibility determination based on discrepancies between petitioner\u2019s statements in airport interview and subsequent testimony). Because the inconsistencies identified by the IJ go to the heart of Mann's claim, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. <em>See Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1043 (9th Cir.2001) (inconsistencies regarding \u201cevents leading up to [petitioner\u2019s] departure and the number of times he was arrested\u201d were sufficient to uphold adverse credibility determination).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-14\">In the absence of credible testimony, Mann failed to establish eligibility for either asylum or withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>Because Mann\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same testimony that was found not credible, and he points to no other evidence to support this claim, his CAT claim also fails. <em>See id. </em>at 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b592-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
