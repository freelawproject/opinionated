We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination based on Myenchikov\u2019s submission of fraudulent documents, which were used to establish his Jewish identity, an element of his persecution. <em>See Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741, 745 (9th Cir.2004); see <em>also Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">Because Myenchikov failed to qualify for asylum, he also failed to meet the stricter standard under withholding of removal. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">Myenchikov\u2019s claim under the CAT is based on the same facts that the BIA found to be not credible, and Myenchikov points to no other evidence that the BIA should have considered, therefore he has also failed to establish eligibility for relief under the CAT. <em>See id. </em>at 1156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b668-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
