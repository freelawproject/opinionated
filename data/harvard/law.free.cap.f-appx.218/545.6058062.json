Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-24\">We agree with the district court that the <em>Bivens </em>claims were not administratively exhausted. The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) has a multi-step process for inmates to use in bringing complaints about any aspect of their confinement: an informal resolution, an administrative remedy (with the warden), an appeal to the BOP\u2019s regional director, and finally an appeal to the BOP\u2019s central office. There are deadlines for each step. <em>See </em>28 C.F.R. \u00a7 542.10 to .18. Marlin did not rebut the BOP attorney\u2019s declaration that an inmate must proceed through all the steps and be denied at each before he is deemed to have exhausted. Because he filed the instant complaint on June 27, 2005 \u2014 -just thirteen days after he was assigned to the job giving rise to the instant lawsuit \u2014 it would have been impossible for him to have completed all four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>steps of the administrative-remedy process before filing the instant complaint. Dismissal of the <em>Bivens </em>claims was thus mandatory. <em>See Johnson v. Jones, </em>340 F.3d 624, 627 (8th Cir.2003). We also find no basis for overturning the district court\u2019s dismissal on the merits of the ADA claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B. We also deny Marlin\u2019s pending motions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b573-16\">.
