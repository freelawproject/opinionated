GIBSON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">Bartosz Sieprawski, a native and citizen of Poland, petitions for review of an order of the Bureau of Immigration Appeals denying two motions Sieprawski had filed. The first motion asked the Board to reissue the Board\u2019s order of May 2, 2005, which Sieprawski alleges he never received until after the time for petitioning for review of that order had expired. The second motion sought to reopen Sieprawski\u2019s removal proceedings to adduce evidence that the criminal conviction on which the removal order was based was not in fact final. We will deny review.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">Sieprawski was charged with removability on the grounds that he had been convicted of an aggravated felony, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), due to a New Jersey criminal conviction. He moved to terminate the removal proceedings, contending he was not removable because he was an American citizen, by virtue of the naturalization of his father during Siep-rawski\u2019s childhood. The Immigration Judge hearing his case ruled that Siepraw-ski did not become a citizen through his father because his parents were divorced and his mother had legal custody of Siep-rawski; the IJ ordered Sieprawski removed. Sieprawski appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals, which upheld the Id\u2019s decision by order of May 2, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-15\">Sieprawski contends that he was not notified of the BIA\u2019s decision, but only learned of it on July 18, 2005, after the time for appeal had expired, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1) (petition for review must be filed no later than 30 days after final order of removal). Sieprawski promptly filed a \u201cMotion to Reissue the BIA\u2019s Decision,\u201d informing the BIA of the fact that he had not received notice of its decision during the time for petitioning for review and asking the agency to reissue the order so that he could make a timely petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-16\">A few days after filing the motion to reissue, Sieprawski also filed a separate motion to reopen, arguing that his state conviction was not final because he had an appeal pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-17\">The BIA denied both motions on August 16, 2005. The BIA rejected the motion to reopen because the record showed that Sieprawski\u2019s appeal of his state criminal conviction was untimely and had not therefore prevented his conviction from becoming final. The BIA rejected the motion to reissue on three grounds. First, the BIA stated that it had mailed the May 2, 2005 order to Sieprawski. Second, it said Siep-rawski had not come forward with arguments or evidence that would convince the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>BIA that service was defective. Third, the BIA held that \u201ceven if a mailing error were established,\u201d Sieprawski had not suffered prejudice from not receiving the order because he had two remedies: (1) Sieprawski was able to file the motion to reissue, and (2) he could ask the Third Circuit to accept a late-filed petition to review the May 2, 2005, order.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">We first must consider whether we have jurisdiction over this petition to review the August 16, 2005, denial of Sieprawski\u2019s motions. Sieprawski petitioned for review on September 13, 2005, which the government concedes was timely. However, the government contends that we lack jurisdiction because the August 16, 2005, order was not a final order of removal that we have jurisdiction to review under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(5). We treat the motion to reissue as a motion to reopen. <em>See Tobeth-Tangang v. Gonzales, </em>440 F.3d 537, 539 n. 2 (1st Cir.2006); <em>Radkov v. Ashcroft, </em>375 F.3d 96, 98 (1st Cir.2004) (reviewing denial of motion to reissue under standard for motion to reopen). Denial of a motion to reopen a final order of removal is itself a final order of removal. <em>See Cruz v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>452 F.3d 240, 246 (3d Cir.2006). We therefore have jurisdiction to review the denial <em>of </em>the motions to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen on the ground of failure to make a prima facie case for relief for abuse of discretion, with the underlying findings of fact reviewed for substantial evidence. <em>Sevoian v. Ashcroft, </em>290 F.3d 166, 170 (3d Cir.2002). The BIA abuses its discretion when its decision is arbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law. <em>Id. </em>at 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">The BIA\u2019s finding that it mailed the order to Sieprawski was supported by substantial evidence. Sieprawski came forward with his attorney\u2019s \u201ccertification\u201d that she did not receive the order and his own letter stating he had not received it.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The BIA introduced no direct evidence of mailing, but it did produce a cover letter dated May 2, 2005, that was addressed to Sieprawski\u2019s counsel\u2019s correct address. In the recent case of <em>Singh v. Gonzales, </em>469 F.3d 863, 866-69 (9th Cir.2006), the BIA introduced a correctly addressed cover letter, while the alien produced evidence that neither he nor his attorney received a copy of the order. The Ninth Circuit held that this was substantial evidence to support the BIA\u2019s finding of service and denial of a motion to reissue. <em>Accord Radkov, </em>375 F.3d at 98-99 (BIA did not abuse discretion in denying reissuance where record included envelope in which the order was mailed to attorney\u2019s address of record and returned to the BIA as undeliverable). The record in <em>Singh </em>was substantially identical to that in this case, and it follows that the BIA\u2019s denial of the motion to reissue in this case was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-13\">The BIA\u2019s treatment of Sieprawski\u2019s motion was indeed irrational in one respect: the BIA stated that, assuming there was a defect in mailing, Sieprawski was not harmed because he was able to bring the motion to reissue; but the BIA denied that motion on the ground that there was no defect in the mailing. The remedy was thus illusory. However, the BIA\u2019s decision was adequately supported by its finding that it had served the order and its conclusion that Sieprawski\u2019s evidence was not sufficient to make a prima facie case for reopening. Accordingly, we need not rely on the BIA\u2019s lack-of-prejudice analysis in order to uphold its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>The BIA suggested that Sieprawski could ask this Court for leave to file a late petition for review, which he has done. The 30-day time limit imposed by section 1252(b)(1) for filing a petition for review is jurisdictional. <em>Malvoisin v. INS, </em>268 F.3d 74, 75-76 (2d Cir.2001). The government now contends that we cannot grant such leave. However, we have in unpublished decisions approved the Ninth Circuit\u2019s analysis in <em>Singh v. INS, </em>315 F.3d 1186, 1188 (9th Cir.2003), that the 30 days do not begin to run until the BIA has complied with its obligation to mail the order in compliance with applicable regulations. <em>Gaur v. Ashcroft, </em>65 Fed.Appx. 773, 774 (3d Cir.2003); <em>Hamilton v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>183 Fed.Appx. 196, 198 (3d Cir.2006); <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(f) (service requirement). Thus, Sieprawski\u2019s petition would be timely if he could show the BIA failed to serve the May 2 order in accordance with the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">The BIA itself has held that there was no such failure. Although we review de novo questions concerning our own jurisdiction, <em>Alaka v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>456 F.3d 88, 94 n. 8 (3d Cir.2006), we see no reason to arrive at a different conclusion regarding the record than that arrived at by the BIA. Accordingly, we must hold that the petition to review the May 2, 2005, order was untimely and must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">We next must determine whether the BIA abused its discretion in rejecting Sieprawski\u2019s argument that his conviction was not final because he still had an appeal pending. We note that the BIA did not rely on the fact that the state court appeal urged in Sieprawski\u2019s motion was not newly available evidence, since the state court appeal was filed March 16, 2004, and was therefore available before the BIA issued its original May 2, 2005, decision. Since the BIA did not rely on that ground, we may not rely on it, either. \u201cIt is a bedrock principle of administrative law that judicial review of an agency\u2019s decision is limited to the rationale that the agency provides.\u201d <em>Konan v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>432 F.3d 497, 501 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">Sieprawski contended that his conviction for the aggravated felony was not final because there was still a direct appeal pending. The BIA responded that the record showed that Sieprawski\u2019s appeal had been filed out of time. Under <em>Matter of Polanco, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 894, 897-98 (BIA 1994), where the alien has failed to file his appeal in time, the BIA will consider the conviction final, notwithstanding the possibility of discretionary relief by the state court, unless the alien can show that he has been granted leave to take a late appeal. Sieprawski did not show that he has been granted such leave; accordingly, the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen on this ground was not contrary to law, or otherwise an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">We will deny review of the BIA\u2019s denial of the motions to reopen.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b231-8\">. He later also adduced evidence that his attorney did not receive papers the BIA was supposed to have mailed in another matter at about the same time and that it entered a calendar date incorrectly in another matter. However, this evidence was not introduced until after the BIA ruled on his motion to reissue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
