His first sentence was vacated by this Court pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). At resentencing, the District Court imposed a term of 144 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-14\">On appeal, defendant raises three arguments: 1) the District Court erred in enhancing defendant\u2019s sentence for possession of a firearm under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l); 2) the District Court erred in enhancing the sentence based on defendant\u2019s characterization as a leader or organizer under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a); and 3) the sentence was not \u201creasonable\u201d in light of <em>United States v. Booker </em>because the District Court faded to consider the statutory sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) other than the Sentencing Guidelines themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-15\">For the reasons discussed below, we AFFIRM the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-16\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b521-17\">A federal grand jury returned an indictment on July 16, 2001. A superseding indictment was filed on October 15, 2001, charging defendant with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and distribution of fifty grams or more of a mixture and substance containing cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (conspiracy) and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (possession with intent to distribute and distribution).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-18\">On October 3, 2001, pursuant to a plea agreement, the defendant entered a guilty plea. On September 24, 2002, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>sentenced the defendant to a term of 264 months. After entry of judgment, the defendant filed a timely notice of appeal. On June 24, 2004, pursuant to the government\u2019s motion for a reduction in the defendant\u2019s sentence for substantial assistance, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b), the District Court reduced the defendant\u2019s sentence to 188 months. On appeal, this Court vacated the District Court\u2019s judgment in accordance with <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and remanded for resentencing. On July 8, 2005, the District Court sentenced defendant to a term of 144 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">At the new sentencing hearing, after granting the government\u2019s motions under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 and Rule 35(b) for a reduction in the defendant\u2019s sentence, the District Court concluded as follows: An \u201c[offense level of] 31 and a criminal history of II gives me a sentencing range of 121 to 151 months. And it seems to me that that\u2019s a reasonable range for me to sentence you in.\u201d (J.A. at 111.)</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">The court noted that the defendant \u201cmade some good decisions in recent years, and that was to admit [his] guilt and try to help [him]self by providing assistance against others. And in doing so, [he] dramatically reduced the sentence that [he] would otherwise get.\u201d (J.A. at 112.) The District Court described the drug quantity attributed to the defendant as \u201cconservative,\u201d referring to the large discrepancy between the amount of drugs attributed to the defendant and the total amount involved in the conspiracy. (J.A. at 112.)</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">The District Court noted that the defendant was at the \u201cbottom\u201d of the \u201ccriminal history [category] of II.\u201d (J.A. at 112.) The court ordered the defendant to participate in a \u201cprogram of testing and treatment for drug abuse.\u201d (J.A. at 113.) The District Court acknowledged that the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory. Specifically, the District Judge indicated that: 1) he was considering \u201can advisory range of 121 to 151 months\u201d (J.A. at 112); and 2) he was \u201crelieved that [he] did not have to sentence [the defendant] to 360 months as formerly required under the [Guidelines before [the defendant\u2019s cooperation].\u201d (J.A. at 114.)</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">The District Court found that, based on the proffer of a co-conspirator, the defendant possessed a weapon during the conspiracy and, accordingly, the District Court applied a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). Additionally, the District Court applied a four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) for the defendant\u2019s role as a leader in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">On appeal, defendant raises three claims: 1) the District Court erred in enhancing defendant\u2019s sentence for possession of a firearm under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l); 2) the District Court erred in enhancing the sentence based on defendant\u2019s characterization as a leader or organizer under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a); and 3) the sentence was not \u201creasonable\u201d in light of <em>United States v. Booker </em>because the District Court failed to consider the statutory sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) other than the Sentencing Guidelines themselves. None of the arguments raised by the defendant warrants reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-11\">A. Sentencing Enhancement Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l)</p>\n<p id=\"b522-12\">The District Court\u2019s conclusion under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) that the defendant possessed a firearm is a factual finding that this Court reviews for clear error. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Ables, </em>167 F.3d 1021, 1035 (6th Cir.1999). A finding is clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>erroneous when, although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. <em>United States v. U.S. Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948). We review the District Court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo. <em>United States v. Gardner, </em>417 F.3d 541, 543 (6th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">The Sentencing Guidelines instruct the court to increase a defendant\u2019s base offense level by two levels \u201c[i]f a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed.\u201d \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). The government must show by a preponderance of the evidence, <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>344 F.3d 562, 565 (6th Cir.2003), that the dangerous weapon was possessed during \u201crelevant conduct,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Faison, </em>339 F.3d 518, 520 (6th Cir.2003). Relevant conduct under the Sentencing Guidelines includes \u201call acts and omissions ... that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 520 (citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">The District Court found that the defendant possessed a weapon based on a statement, as reported in the presentence report, by James Milan, one of the defendant\u2019s co-conspirators, in the presentence report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-7\">Defendant Milan reported that he had previously observed a large-frame revolver at the home of Sharn Raynard Milan and Stephen Dorrell Milan, and that he had observed Sharn Raynard Milan shoot this weapon in the Spring of 2001.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">(J.A. at 129.)</p>\n<p id=\"b523-12\">The defendant argues that James Milan\u2019s statement cannot support the District Court\u2019s application of \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) because this account fails to establish any connection between the firing of the weapon and the offenses for which the defendant was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-13\">This argument fails. Application Note 3 of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 provides that the enhancement for possession of a weapon should be applied if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense. The defendant did not dispute the claim that he possessed a firearm at his home in 2001 \u2014 during the period of the conspiracy. A District Court may accept as true all factual allegations in a presentence report to which the defendant does not object. <em>United States v. Levy, </em>250 F.3d 1015, 1018 (6th Cir.2001) (citing <em>United States v. Ward, </em>190 F.3d 483, 492 (6th Cir.1999)). Because the defendant does not contest that he possessed a firearm during the period of the conspiracy, the District Court may infer that this possession was connected to the offense. <em>See United States v. Bolka, </em>355 F.3d 909, 912 (6th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-14\">The defendant may rebut this presumption by demonstrating that it is clearly improbable that the firearm was connected to the offense. <em>Bolka, </em>355 F.3d at 912 (citing <em>United States v. Moses, </em>289 F.3d 847, 850 (6th Cir.2002)). The court may consider several factors in making this determination: the proximity of the firearm to the drugs, the type of firearm involved, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>whether the firearm was loaded, and any alternative purpose offered to explain the presence of the firearm. <em>Moses, </em>289 F.3d at 850 (citation omitted). Milan offers no alternative explanation for the presence of the weapon, and he does not dispute that drugs were stored and drug transactions took place in his home \u2014 where he, according to James Milan\u2019s statement, possessed the revolver. Because the defendant cannot rebut the presumption that his possession of the revolver was connected to the drug conspiracy, enhancement under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) is appropriate. <em>See United States v. Miggins, </em>302 F.3d 384, 390-91 (6th Cir.2002) (citing <em>United States v. McGhee, </em>882 F.2d 1095, 1097-98 (6th Cir. 1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">B. Sentencing Enhancement Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Milan argues that the District Court\u2019s factual findings under \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) are not specific enough to allow review by this Court. As we have explained previously, it is unclear what standard of review this Court should apply in evaluating the District Court\u2019s application of \u00a7 3Bl.l(a). <em>See, e.g., United States v. McDaniel, </em>398 F.3d 540, 551 (6th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Henley, </em>360 F.3d 509, 516-18 (6th Cir. 2004). Before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Buford v. United States, </em>532 U.S. 59, 121 S.Ct. 1276, 149 L.Ed.2d 197 (2001), it was clear that we reviewed a District Court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and legal conclusions de novo. <em>Henley, </em>360 F.3d at 516 (citation omitted). The Supreme Court in <em>Buford, </em>however, held that an appellate court should review deferentially, rather than de novo, a District Court\u2019s application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2 because of the fact-bound nature of the legal decision. 532 U.S. at 66, 121 S.Ct. 1276. We reserve judgment as to whether the District Court\u2019s application of \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) to the facts of this case should be reviewed deferentially or de novo, because we would affirm using either standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">The Sentencing Guidelines instruct the court to increase a defendant\u2019s base offense level by four levels \u201c[i]f the defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d \u00a7 3Bl.l(a). To qualify for an adjustment, the defendant must have been the organizer or leader of one or more other participants. \u00a7 3B1.1, Application Note 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">In applying the \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) enhancement, the District Court stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-9\">It\u2019s apparent to me, Mr. Milan, that you were actively involved as a ringleader in this very large drug conspiracy with eight defendants, seven besides you, and that you clearly were a leader and organizer in that enterprise. So that four-level enhancement is also appropriate. All those other defendants pled guilty, you pled guilty, and it seems to me that\u2019s a sufficient basis, given your role in the offense, to add that four-level enhancement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">(J.A. at 110-11.)</p>\n<p id=\"b524-11\">While it would have been preferable for the District Court to have identified a specific individual over whom Milan exercised control, the District Court is not required to state on the record the specific facts it relied on in applying \u00a7 3Bl.l(a). <em>See United States v. Caseslorente, </em>220 F.3d 727, 736 (6th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-12\">The government cites numerous items in the presentence report, none contested by the defendant, that support the court\u2019s application of \u00a7 3B1.1(a). <em>(See </em>Appellee\u2019s brief at 11-14). These include allegations that the defendant was the \u201c \u2018kingpin\u2019 \u201d of the drug conspiracy and that specific co-conspirators purchased crack cocaine from or delivered crack cocaine for the defendant. <em>Id. </em>A District Court may accept as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>true all factual allegations in the presentence report to which the defendant does not object. <em>United States v. Levy, 250 </em>F.3d 1015, 1018 (6th Cir.2001) (citing <em>United States v. Ward, </em>190 F.3d 483, 492 (6th Cir.1999)). Based on the facts in the report, the District Court properly concluded that the defendant was an organizer or leader under \u00a7 3Bl.l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">C. The Reasonableness of Milan\u2019s Sentence Under <em>Booker</em></p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">We review Milan\u2019s sentence for substantive and procedural reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Blackwell, </em>459 F.3d 739, 773 (6th Cir.2006) (citing <em>United States v. Webb, </em>403 F.3d 373, 383 (6th Cir.2005)) (holding that in determining whether a sentence is reasonable, the reviewing court must consider the length of the sentence, the factors the District Court evaluated, and the procedures the District Court employed at sentencing).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">A sentence may be substantively unreasonable if the District Court selects the sentence arbitrarily, bases the sentence on impermissible factors, fails to consider pertinent 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, or gives an unreasonable amount of weight to any pertinent factor. <em>United States v. Colling-ton, </em>461 F.3d 805, 808 (6th Cir.2006) (citing <em>Webb, </em>403 F.3d at 385). A sentence may be procedurally unreasonable if the District Judge imposes a sentence that he or she deems appropriate without considering the applicable Guideline range or the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Collington, </em>461 F.3d at 808 (citing <em>Webb, </em>403 F.3d at 383).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">Because defendant failed to object to his sentence at the sentencing hearing, we review his claim to vacate his sentence for plain error. <em>See United States v. Caswell, </em>456 F.3d 652, 655 (6th Cir.2006) (citing <em>United States v. Oliver, </em>397 F.3d 369, 377-78 (6th Cir.2005)). On plain error review, we may only correct such a mistake if there is: 1) an error; 2) that is plain; 3) that affects substantial rights; and 4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 466, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">To determine if an error was committed, this Court must first determine whether the sentence is unreasonable. <em>Webb, </em>403 F.3d at 383 (citation omitted). Only after this analysis is complete can this Court determine whether any error that occurred was plain or whether it affected the substantial rights of the parties. <em>Caswell, </em>456 F.3d at 656.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">1. Substantive Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b525-12\">The defendant has failed to rebut the presumption that his sentence, because it is properly calculated under the Guidelines, is substantively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>436 F.3d 706, 708 (6th Cir.2006). The defendant has not identified any relevant factor the District Court should have considered that would have benefitted the defendant at sentencing. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>467 F.3d 559, 571 (6th Cir.2006) (citation omitted). Nor has the defendant pointed to any factor that the District Court improperly considered. <em>See Collington, </em>461 F.3d at 808. Therefore, Milan\u2019s sentence is substantively reasonable and not arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-13\">2. Procedural Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b525-14\">The defendant argues the District Court relied exclusively on the Sentencing Guideline range in sentencing the defendant. Because the District Court did not state that it considered \u00a7 3553(a), this Court must analyze the record to infer whether the District Court engaged at all in the required meaningful examination of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>\u00a7 3553(a) factors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., United States v. Johnson, </em>467 F.3d 559 (6th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>436 F.3d 706, 708 (6th Cir.2006). The more the District Court obscures its reasoning or requires us to ponder and speculate, the more likely we are to find procedural unreasonableness in the court\u2019s decision. <em>United States v. McBride, </em>434 F.3d 470, 476 n. 3 (6th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">On review of the record, we conclude that Milan\u2019s sentence is procedurally reasonable. While the District Court did not explicitly state that it engaged generally in the necessary consideration of relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the record reflects that the District Court did, in fact, consider these factors in sentencing the defendant. A District Court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors at sentencing and articulate its reasoning to allow for reasonable appellate review, but it need not recite these factors. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Kirby, </em>418 F.3d 621, 626 (6th Cir.2005) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The District Court considered \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed ... to provide the defendant with needed ... medical care,\u201d \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(D), by ordering the defendant to participate in a drug treatment and testing program. Additionally, the court evaluated \u201cthe seriousness of the offense\u201d under \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) by discussing the discrepancy between the relatively small amount of drugs attributed to the defendant under the Sentencing Guidelines and the large amount involved in the conspiracy, in which the defendant played an organizing role. Moreover, the court considered the need \u201cto afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct\u201d under \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B) by noting that the defendant will likely have \u201clearn[ed his] lesson\u201d by the time he completes his sentence. While further elucidation by the District Court of its reasoning would have been helpful to the defendant and to this Court, this shortcoming does not render Milan\u2019s sentence procedurally unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">We conclude that the defendant\u2019s sentence is substantively and procedurally reasonable. The defendant cannot demonstrate any error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b523-8\">. As we explained in <em>Faison, </em>effective November 1, 1991, the Guidelines no longer require that the defendant possess the weapon during the commission of the offense. The government must now prove only that the dangerous weapon was possessed during \"relevant conduct.\u201d District Courts must no longer limit their review to the evidence related to the proximity between the firearm and the drugs at the specific time of the offense. <em>Faison, </em>339 F.3d at 520, 520 n. 1 (citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b526-6\">. The District Court must consider, in addition to the Sentencing Guidelines, the nature and circumstances of the offense; the history and characteristics of the defendant; the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, to provide just punishment, to provide adequate deterrence, to protect the public, and to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(l)-(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
