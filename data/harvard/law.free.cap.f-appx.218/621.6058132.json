Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970), for illegal reentry following deportation, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-29\">Anguiano-Vera contends that the district court erred in declining to award an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a), based on the exercise of his right to a jury trial and his subsequent silence as to the issue of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>alienage when entering an <em>Alford </em>plea. However, the adjustment is \u201cnot intended to apply to a defendant who puts the government to its burden of proof at trial by denying the essential factual elements of guilt.\u201d <em>United States v. Lopez-Patino, </em>391 F.3d 1034, 1038 (9th Cir.2004); <em>cf. United States v. Ochoa-Gaytan, </em>265 F.3d 837, 842 n. 5 (9th Cir.2001) (noting that \u201cthe difference between requiring the government to satisfy its burden and falsely denying criminal conduct is crucial,\u201d but remanding only where the defendant \u201cmade no affirmative defense, called no witnesses, and presented no evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">In light of the \u201cgreat deference on review\u201d accorded the sentencing judge, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. n. 5, we conclude that the district court did not err in declining to award an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b649-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
