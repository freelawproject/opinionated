We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-25\">The government\u2019s contention that we lack jurisdiction to review a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Plouffe, </em>445 F.3d 1126, 1131 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>-U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2314, 164 L.Ed.2d 832 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-28\">Templeton contends that his sentence must be reversed because the district court misapplied 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6) by failing to consider the disparity between his sentence and sentences imposed on his co-conspirators and defendants in related cases. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>The record shows that the district court considered Templeton\u2019s particular history and characteristics, the nature and circumstances of the offense, and the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, and to provide just punishment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2). The district court \u201cgave thoughtful attention to factors recognized in \u00a7 3553(a) and exercised sound discretion to ensure that the punishment fit the crime and the circumstances of the appellant[ ].\u201d <em>United States v. Marcial-Santiago, </em>447 F.3d 715, 719 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Acosta-Franco v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 309, 166 L.Ed.2d 232 (2006). We therefore conclude that Templeton\u2019s sentence was not unreasonable. <em>See Plouffe, </em>445 F.3d at 1131.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b614-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
