We have reviewed the administrative record and the Board\u2019s decision and find that substantial evidence supports the ruling that Sim failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution, as necessary to establish eligibility for asylum. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2006) (stating that the burden of proof is on the alien to establish eligibility for asylum); <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (same). Moreover, as Sim cannot sustain his burden on the asylum claim, he cannot establish his entitlement to withholding of removal. <em>See Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004) (\u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum \u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-24\">Although Sim did not present an argument concerning the denial of protection under the Convention Against Torture to the Board, the Board found that the record provided no basis for finding that Sim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>demonstrated eligibility for protection under the Convention. Even assuming we have jurisdiction to consider this claim, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (2000); <em>Gandziami-Mickhou v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 351, 359 n. 2 (4th Cir.2006) (citing <em>Asika v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 264, 267 n. 3 (4th Cir.2004)), we agree with the Board as to its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">We deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
