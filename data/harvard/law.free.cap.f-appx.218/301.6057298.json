Lampton argues that he is actually innocent of engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise under this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Bass, </em>310 F.3d 321 (5th Cir.2002). He maintains that he may bring his claim in a \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 because <em>Bass </em>resolved a question of first impression in this court, demonstrating that his claim was foreclosed prior to <em>Bass.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-22\">We review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo. <em>See Christopher v. Miles, </em>342 F.3d 378, 381 (5th Cir.2003). Lamp-ton\u2019s claim relies upon our decision in <em>Bass, </em>and Lampton does not cite to any new Supreme Court cases in support of his claim. As he has not shown that his claim is based upon a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision that decriminalized the conduct for which he was convicted, Lampton has not made the required showing to challenge his conviction in a \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See id. </em>at 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b329-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
