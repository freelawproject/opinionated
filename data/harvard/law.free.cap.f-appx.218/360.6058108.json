Park contends that (1) the IJ plainly erred in finding that he was ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief because the IJ conflated statutory eligibility with discretion, (2) he was denied due process because the IJ applied the incorrect legal standard, and (3) the IJ abused his discretion in failing to consider favorable evidence and in denying relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-22\">Because Park\u2019s third argument attacks the IJ\u2019s weighing of the favorable and adverse factors for \u00a7 212(c) relief and does not present a constitutional or legal question, this court lacks jurisdiction as to that claim. <em>See Delgado-Reynua v. Gonzales, </em>450 F.3d 596, 600 (5th Cir.2006). Additionally, this court is without jurisdiction to review Park\u2019s remaining claims because he failed to present them in his appeal to the BIA and therefore failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. <em>See Wang v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number><em>Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Accordingly, Park\u2019s petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b388-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
