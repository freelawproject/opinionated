Arnold (on the brief) and Mark R. Rehe (argued), Office of the U.S. Attorney, San Diego, CA, for Plaintiff-Appellee. Michael Petrik, Jr., Esq., FDSD \u2014 Federal Defenders of San Diego, Inc., San Diego, CA, for Defendant-Appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b661-18\">Before: REINHARDT, KOZINSKI and IKUTA, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b661-19\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-20\">1. The district court instructed the jury on all the elements of Busane\u2019s defense that she lacked the requisite knowledge. Because Valtierra\u2019s motivation was not an element of the defense, the district judge did not err in failing to instruct the jury thereon. <em>United States v. Romero-Avila, </em>210 F.3d 1017, 1023 (9th Cir.2000) (de novo review). Nor did the district judge abuse his discretion in refusing to use the exact language suggested by Busane. <em>United States v. Shipsey, </em>363 F.3d 962, 966 n. 3 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-21\">2. The district court found that Busane didn\u2019t meet the fifth prong of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 because she didn\u2019t provide information about the crime; Busane does not dispute this finding. The district court thus didn\u2019t err in refusing to grant a safety valve reduction. <em>See United States v. Diaz-Cardenas, </em>351 F.3d 404, 407 (9th Cir.2003) (application of guidelines to facts is reviewed <em>de </em>novo).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-22\">3. Even if the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument constituted misconduct, which is doubtful, such misconduct didn\u2019t deprive Busane of a fair trial and any error was harmless. <em>See United States v. Weatherspoon, </em>410 F.3d 1142, 1150-51 (9th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>2005) (quoting <em>United States v. Hinton, </em>31 F.3d 817, 824 (9th Cir.1994)); <em>United States v. Yarbrough, </em>852 F.2d 1522, 1539 (9th Cir.1988) (mistrial only warranted where \u201cthe misconduct deprives the defendant of a fair trial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b661-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
