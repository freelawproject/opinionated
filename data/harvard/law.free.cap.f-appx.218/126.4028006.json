Though Montanye\u2019s Amended Complaint included several counts, only two are the subject of this appeal: Count 1, in which Montanye alleges violations of her right to expressive conduct under the First Amendment; and Count 2, wherein Mon-tanye alleges violations of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. We will affirm the District Court\u2019s ruling on both counts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">I. Factual and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">In her Amended Complaint, Montanye sets forth details of her interactions with K.T. (\u201cK\u201d), a 14-year old student assigned to Montanye\u2019s 9th grade classroom at Wis-sahickon High School in September 2001. K had been on homebound instruction for her 8th grade year due to psychological problems, and had been hospitalized for a suicide attempt two months before commencing 9th grade. Throughout the fall of 2001, Montanye and K\u2019s mother discussed K\u2019s ongoing problems at home and at school. In January 2002, one of Monta-nye\u2019s classroom aides found a note, written by K, expressing suicidal thoughts. Mon-tanye showed the note to Wissahickon High School Principal Robert Anderson, who passed it along to the school\u2019s \u201cWIN Team,\u201d an administrative unit charged with assisting at-risk students. However, Montanye avers that the WIN Team never contacted K, her mother, or Montanye about the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">When Montanye learned about the note and approached K\u2019s mother about it, she indicated to Montanye that she could not control K and that K was staying at friends\u2019 houses and not coming home at night. K\u2019s mother was clearly upset about the situation. Montanye suggested to K that she ask her mother if she could see a therapist and gave her the name of one approved by the school district. When it became clear that K would only attend therapy sessions if Montanye accompanied her, K\u2019s mother agreed. In February 2002, Montanye made arrangements for K to attend a session, transported K to that session, and, with K and her mother\u2019s permission, attended the session. Thereafter, K\u2019s behavior and emotional condition continued to deteriorate. In one incident, K became hysterical at school, which led to K being admitted to a psychiatric facility for observation. Following her release, Mon-tanye again attended a therapy session with K.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-11\">In March 2002, Principal Anderson directed Montanye not to attend any future therapy sessions with K. Later that month, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>the WIN Team wrote a letter to Anderson expressing concern about the propriety of Montanye\u2019s interaction with K and other students identified as \u201chigh risk\u201d through the Wissahickon School District\u2019s Student Assistance Program (\u201cSAP\u201d) process.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">In May 2002, School District Superintendent Stanley Durtan sent Montanye a letter informing her of allegations that she had engaged in \u201cwillful neglect of duty, insubordination, incompetency, persistent negligence in the performance of duties, willful violation of school laws, and improper conduct growing out of\u2019 her involvement in various situations pertaining to K. Durtan\u2019s letter informed Montanye that a <em>\u201cLoudermill </em>hearing\u201d would take place, giving her an opportunity to respond to the charges.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Montanye avers that this hearing was held to \u201cmake her resign as part of the District\u2019s unlawful campaign against special education.\u201d During the hearing, at which Montanye was represented by counsel, Principal Anderson testified that he had been aware of Monta-nye\u2019s efforts with regard to K. Montanye claims that following, and because of, this testimony, the School District told Principal Anderson to find other employment, which he eventually did.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Following the hearing, in June 2002, Superintendent Durtan sent Montanye a letter \u2014 which she characterizes as a \u201cconstructive discharge letter\u201d \u2014 setting forth various policies, relating to her interaction with at-risk students, to which Montanye would be required to adhere over the course of her future employment with the School District.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The three specific directives contained in the letter were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-9\">(1) that Montanye not engage in any activity or conduct not expressly required or reasonably implied by her job or contractual duties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-10\">(2) that Montanye comply with legal processes and school district policies regarding evaluations and referrals of students, including the SAP; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-11\">(3) that if Montanye engages in any conduct outside the school or outside her status of a teacher with any student or parent, she is to notify the school and advise the parent that she is doing so strictly in her personal capacity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-12\">Montanye\u2019s complaint characterizes these rules as \u201cimpossible new rules for her behavior.\u201d She avers that the letter was designed to chill her \u201cprotected speech and punish her for helping special education students, in accordance with [Wissahickon School District\u2019s] official unwritten policy, sanctioned by the School Board, of discouraging at risk students from finding help and advancing in public school, and therefore in life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-13\">In Count 1 of her Amended Complaint, Montanye avers that her speech and conduct, \u201cin helping K. to get a therapist, helping K. and Mrs. T. work toward a healthy family life and giving educational and emotional support to K an at risk student, was Constitutionally protected speech concerning matters of great public importance\u201d and that this speech was infringed upon by the <em>Loudermill </em>hearing and the June 2002 letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-14\">In Count 2, Montanye avers that under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 794, defendants are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>prohibited from retaliating \u201cagainst any individual who provides special assistance, advocacy and support for children at risk within a program receiving federal funds.\u201d Montanye contends that she was punished for providing such assistance to K and therefore is entitled to damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">We will address each of these claims in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">II. Count 1 \u2014 First Amendment Claim<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">As the District Court found, the Supreme Court has determined that, while expressive conduct is protected under the First Amendment, \u201cwe cannot accept the view that an apparent limitless variety of conduct can be labeled \u2018speech\u2019 whenever the person engaging in the conduct intends thereby to express an idea.\u201d <em>United States v. O\u2019Brien, </em>391 U.S. 367, 376, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968). Rather, to determine whether a particular action or pattern of conduct constitutes speech protected under the First Amendment, we must ask whether \u201can attempt to convey a particularized message was present, and whether the likelihood was great that the message would be understood by those who viewed it.\u201d <em>Texas v. Johnson, </em>491 U.S. 397, 404, 109 S.Ct. 2533, 105 L.Ed.2d 342 (1989) (quoting <em>Spence v. </em>State <em>of Wash., </em>418 U.S. 405, 410-11, 94 S.Ct. 2727, 41 L.Ed.2d 842 (1974)).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">The District Court opined that, here, \u201c[Montanye\u2019js conduct in assisting an at-risk student cope with her emotional and psychological problems does not possess sufficient communicative elements to fall within the protection of the First Amendment.\u201d Therefore, the District Court concluded, and we agree, that while Montanye\u2019s conduct in scheduling K\u2019s therapy sessions, transporting her to those sessions and attending those sessions may have involved some \u201ckernel of expression,\u201d there was no intent to convey any message, let alone a particularized message, supporting special education, and no likelihood that her interactions with K could be \u201cunderstood\u201d as conveying such a message.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-11\">Accordingly, we will not disturb the District Court\u2019s finding that Montanye failed to allege that she engaged in conduct protected by the First Amendment and its resulting dismissal of Count I.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-12\">III. Count 2 \u2014 Rehabilitation Act Claim<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-14\">In her Amended Complaint, Montanye alleges that Appellees violated \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act in conducting the <em>Loudermill </em>hearing and issuing the subsequent June 2002 letter. Section 504 provides that no \u201cotherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States ... shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance----\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a). This section, as the District Court properly noted, also dictates that the \u201cstandards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>used to determine whether this section has been violated in a complaint alleging employment discrimination under this section shall be the standards applied under ... the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(d). The ADA states, in relevant part, that no \u201cperson shall discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this [Act] or because such individual made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this [Act].\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12203(a). Finally, we have previously held that we will \u201canalyze ADA retaliation claims under the same framework we employ for retaliation claims arising under Title VII.\u201d <em>Krouse v. Am. Sterilizer Co., </em>126 F.3d 494, 500 (3d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Given this framework, the District Court properly determined that, to state a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act, \u201c \u2018a plaintiff must show: (1) protected employee activity; (2) adverse action by the employer either after or contemporaneous with the employee\u2019s protected activity; and (3) a causal connection between the employee\u2019s protected activity and the employer\u2019s action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fogleman v. Mercy Hosp., </em>283 F.3d 561, 567-68 (3d Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Krouse, </em>126 F.3d at 500).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The District Court concluded that Mon-tanye failed to allege that she engaged in protected employee activity under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act. We agree with the District Court that Montanye has not alleged that she \u201copposed any act or practice made unlawful by\u201d the ADA or Rehabilitation Act, nor has she asserted that she \u201cmade a charge, testified, assisted or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing\u201d under the ADA or Rehabilitation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">Though Montanye argues that the Rehabilitation Act prohibits retaliation against individuals who \u201cprovide special assistance, advocacy and support,\u201d the District Court correctly concluded that this is not the type of employee activity protected by the relevant statutes. It is clear from the case law that protected activity does not include mere assistance of special education students, but, rather, requires afiirmative action in advocating for, or protesting discrimination related to, unlawful conduct by others. <em>See, e.g., Sumner v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>899 F.2d 203, 209 (2d Cir.1990) (finding that \u201cprotected conduct\u201d contemplates such activity as \u201cmaking complaints to management,\u201d \u201cwriting critical letters,\u201d \u201cprotesting against discrimination,\u201d and \u201cexpressing support of co-workers\u201d). Indeed, the concept of \u201cprotected activity\u201d at issue here is necessarily limited to, if not speech in the strict sense, at least the sort of expressive conduct which conveys a message. Therefore, Montanye\u2019s Rehabilitation Act claims fail for the same reasons that her First Amendment claims fail: Montanye has not sufficiently alleged that her actions in helping K were expressive or communicative.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">Accordingly, we will not disturb the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Montanye failed to set forth a claim under the ADA and/or Rehabilitation Act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">In light of the foregoing, we will AFFIRM the Order of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b156-8\">. The District Court had jurisdiction over these claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1343(a)(3). We have appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. As Montanye challenges the District Court's grant of Appel-lees' motion for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), our review tests the District Court's view of the sufficiency of the complaint. \u201cOur review of a district court's decision to grant a motion to dismiss ... is plenary.\u201d <em>Gallo v. City of Philadelphia, </em>161 F.3d 217, 221 (3d Cir.1998). The underlying standard governing a motion to dismiss is whether \"it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations.\u201d <em>Hishon v. King &amp; Spalding, </em>467 U.S. 69, 73, 104 S.Ct. 2229, 81 L.Ed.2d 59 (1984). Though the District Court later granted summary judgment in favor of Appellees with respect to Montanye's equal protection claims, that order is not the subject of this appeal. <em>See Montanye v. Wissahickon Sch. Dist., </em>399 F.Supp.2d 615 (E.D.Pa.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b157-7\">. The term <em>\u201cLoudermill </em>hearing\u201d refers to the process a government entity must afford to a civil servant prior to terminating his or her employment. <em>See Cleveland Bd. of Ed. v. Loudermill, </em>470 U.S. 532, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 84 L.Ed.2d 494 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b157-15\">. Despite Montanye\u2019s assertions about the purpose of Superintendent Durtan\u2019s letter, she concedes that it did not have the effect of formally discharging her.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b158-8\">. Though Count 1 of Montanye\u2019s Amended Complaint alleged constitutional violations under the Fourteenth Amendment, which the District Court dismissed, she has elected only to pursue her First Amendment claim on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b158-9\">. In her brief on appeal, Montanye refers to a claim against the School District for \"interference with ... students\u2019 protected rights\u201d under the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act (''ADA\u201d). However, this claim was neither raised in Montanye's Amended Complaint nor in her brief below in opposition to Appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss. Accordingly, Montanye\u2019s claim is not properly before us now.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b159-7\">. Appellees argue that Montanye\u2019s claims under Count I and Count II are procedurally barred and not properly before us. With respect to Count I, Appellees argue that Monta-nye\u2019s Notice of Appeal refers only to Count II and, therefore, that we should not consider her appeal as to Count I. With respect to Count II, Appellees argue that Montanye has waived her Rehabilitation Act claim because she failed to defend that claim in her brief below in opposition to Appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss. At oral argument, counsel for Appel-lees urged that we rule in their favor on these bases. Rather than rely on these arguably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>technical \u201cprocedural\u201d grounds, however, we prefer to base our ruling on the merits of the District Court\u2019s order of dismissal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
