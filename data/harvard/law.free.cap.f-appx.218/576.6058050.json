We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-20\">Otto contends that the district court erred by denying his motion for a downward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.13 and that his sentence is unreasonable because <em>the </em>district court failed to adequately consider his severe mental illness. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-21\">A review of the record demonstrates that the district court properly calculated and considered the Guidelines, properly considered the sentencing factors pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and analyzed the policy considerations of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.13 in denying a downward departure. Thus, Otto\u2019s sentence was reasonable. <em>See United States v. Mohamed) </em>459 F.3d 979, 985-87 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-22\">Contrary to Otto\u2019s contentions, the district court properly considered his mental health problems. While addressing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court considered Otto\u2019s history of drag abuse, mental health and his use of a serious threat of violence in sentencing him to the low end of the Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b605-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
