We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing for substantial evidence, <em>see Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1244 (9th Cir.2000), we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-15\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that Islam failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution. Islam\u2019s testimony that he returned to Bangladesh without incident in 1996 and that he did not encounter any problems after relocating to his in-laws\u2019 home in 1990 undercuts his claimed fear. <em>See Belayneh v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 488, 491 (9th Cir.2000); <em>Lata, </em>204 F.3d at 1245. Further, Islam\u2019s claimed fear is undermined by the agency\u2019s individualized analysis of his circumstances in light of current country conditions. <em>See Gonzalez-Hernandez v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 995, 998-1000 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-16\">Because Islam failed to prove eligibility for asylum, he necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Alvarez-Santos v. INS, </em>332 F.3d 1245, 1255 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-17\">Islam also failed to establish a CAT claim because he did not show that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured if he returned to Bangladesh. <em>See Kamalthas v. INS, </em>251 F.3d 1279, 1283-84 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-18\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b684-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
