After examining the briefs and the record, we have concluded that oral argument is unnecessary. See Fed. R.App. P. 34(a); Cir. R. 34(f).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b551-9\">Order</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">We affirmed Tedder\u2019s conviction but remanded for resentencing after concluding that conspiracy to commit money laundering should be treated the same as a substantive money-laundering conviction under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Tedder, </em>403 F.3d 836 (7th Cir. 2005). Our decision had the effect of establishing the Guidelines range at 37 to 46 months\u2019 imprisonment. Under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the range is advisory, so we remarked: \u201cWhether this conclusion will benefit Tedder in the end is a question for the district judge. <em>Booker </em>provides district judges with additional discretion, so on remand the judge might reimpose the 60-month sentence if she thinks it the most appropriate response to Tedder\u2019s crimes and risks of recidivism; appellate review after <em>Booker </em>is for reasonableness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-11\">After concluding that Tedder\u2019s risk of recidivism is exceptionally high, the district judge resentenced him to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment. Tedder again appeals, and his lead argument is that the district judge did not warn him that he could be resentenced above the top of the Guidelines\u2019 range. That line of argument is incompatible with the law of this circuit. See <em>United States v. Walker, </em>447 F.3d 999, 1006-07 (7th Cir.2006) (notice is unnecessary because <em>Booker </em>jettisoned the concept of \u201cupward departure\u201d from the Guidelines). Tedder could not benefit even if we were prepared to change circuit law: he knew from the district court\u2019s original sentence and from our opinion that a sentence exceeding 46 months\u2019 imprisonment was a distinct possibility. That was all the notice required under any circuit\u2019s standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-13\">This sentence was reasonable, for the reasons the district judge gave. Tedder asks us to disagree with the district judge\u2019s conclusions, but that\u2019s functionally a request for a <em>de novo </em>decision on appeal. The question is not what sentence we would have imposed, but whether the district judge abused her discretion. The 60-month sentence is not beyond the wide latitude set by a \u201creasonableness\u201d standard. No more need be said.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
