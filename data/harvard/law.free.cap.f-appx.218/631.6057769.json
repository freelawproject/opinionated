We reverse because the district court overlooked CLTF\u2019s request pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(f) for a continuance to conduct discovery. <em>Cf. United States v. Larry Flynt, </em>756 F.2d 1352, 1362 (9th Cir.1985). Discovery had previously been stayed pending resolution of a dispute about subject matter jurisdiction. The court determined that it had jurisdiction, but then treated the parties\u2019 submissions on Martinez\u2019s motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment without ruling on the Rule 56(f) request. As a result, CLTF was denied any discovery at all, without consideration of whether the discovery sought was appropriate or could have raised a triable issue of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-14\">We cannot say that this does not matter. The order granting summary judgment turned on CLTF\u2019s failure to controvert evidence submitted by Martinez showing that Laborers\u2019 Schedule A is not the \u201cappropriate\u201d one to define Martinez\u2019s contractual obligation to make trust fund contributions. This was based on Martinez\u2019s representation that it assigned work to the Southern California Pipe Trades District Council, and on evidence that Martinez made benefits payments to the Pipe Fitters\u2019 trust fund pursuant to the Pipe Fitters\u2019 collective bargaining agreement. The difficulty is that Martinez performed work covered by the Los Angeles Unified School District Project Stabilization Agreement as of January 2000, but did not become a signatory to the Pipe Fitters\u2019 collective bargaining agreement until October 9, 2002. CLTF acknowledges that it does not claim contributions after October 9, 2002. But CLTF argues that the only way it could adduce evidence to refute Martinez\u2019s representation that work was assigned to the Pipe Fitters for the period between January 2000 and October 9, 2002 is by discovery. The reason, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>it submits, is that CLTF does not otherwise know to whom Martinez may have assigned work, which in turn, is the only way CLTF can show that the Laborers\u2019 Master Labor Agreement (MLA) was the \u201cappropriate\u201d Schedule A Agreement. This is because the Laborers\u2019 MLA is the relevant agreement under the PSA only if Martinez\u2019s employees were assigned work falling under Laborers\u2019 classifications. Thus, CLTF has shown prejudice. We express no opinion one way or the other on the proper scope of discovery, or the significance of what discovery might reveal, but summary judgment should not have been granted without addressing the Rule 56(f) request.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b660-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
