R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b844-23\">ORDER AND JUDGMENT <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<author id=\"b844-24\">TIMOTHY M. TYMKOVICH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b844-25\">Michael Patrick Brunton agreed to plead guilty to one count of mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341 and to forego his right to appellate review as part of a plea agreement. The district court subsequently sentenced him to 16 months in prison and ordered him to pay restitution to his victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-26\">Despite having waived his appellate rights in this case, Brunton claims the district court erred in calculating the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>amount of losses to his victims. In doing so, he contends the court wrongfully bumped him into a higher sentencing range than he deserved.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">Because we agree with the government that Brunton waived his right to appeal, we enforce the waiver and dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">Brunton was indicted on 12 counts of mail and wire fraud after being caught running an on-line auction scheme whereby he would offer up certain items for sale (e.g., football tickets, Rolex watches), accept payment from the winning bidder, but not remit any item in return. Brunton\u2019s criminal conduct first came to light in late 2002, when two users of the Internet auction eBay complained that they had ordered and paid for a Rolex watch that they never received. As authorities began investigating the matter, a host of similar unconsummated deals were uncovered. United States postal authorities, together with eBay and PayPal staff, ultimately identified Brunton as the source of the fraudulent offers.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">Investigators identified 40 victims who never obtained their winning bids. Pursuant to Brunton\u2019s guilty plea, the government dropped all but one count against him. In return, Brunton promised not to appeal his sentence or how it was determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">At sentencing, the government attributed the actual losses to Brunton\u2019s victims as $72,758.91, while intended loss (that which would have resulted but for can-celled checks, etc.) was $102,126.30. [Gov. Brief at 5.] Brunton specifically objected to the loss calculations stemming from two victims totaling $8,765. The district court held a hearing on the amount of loss attributed to the two victims, and then overruled Brunton\u2019s objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-12\">Finding the actual losses from Brunton\u2019s crime to exceed $70,000, the district court determined that Brunton\u2019s sentencing range was 12-18 months. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines (U.S.S.G.) \u00a7 2B1.1. Had Brunton caused losses under $70,000, he would have been eligible for a lower guideline range than he received (8-14 months rather than 12-18 months). Nevertheless, causing losses above $70,000 (but below $120,000) merited a 2-point enhancement under the Guidelines with a concomitant increase in the applicable sentencing range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(E). The court went on to sentence Brunton to 16 months in prison and ordered restitution in the amount of $72,758.91.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-13\">On appeal, Brunton revives his objections to losses attributed to two victims in the amount of $8,765 to advance his claim that the actual losses were below the $70,000 threshold. \u201cThe Defendant vehemently denie[s] causing loss above $70,000 to warrant an enhancement [in offense level score] of eight instead of the appropriate enhancement of six. Consequently the trial judge was guided by the wrong guideline range and imposed an excessive sentence.\u201d Aplt. Brief at 5. The government counters that we are precluded from reaching the merits of Brunton\u2019s claim because of the explicit appellate waiver contained in his plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">We have held that if we find a waiver to be valid and enforceable, we will enforce its terms and dismiss an appeal. <em>United States v. Hahn, </em>359 F.3d 1315, 1329 (10th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">\n<em>A. Enforcing Appellate Waivers</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">An appellate waiver will be enforced if (1) the disputed appeal falls within the scope of the waiver; (2) the waiver was made knowingly and voluntarily; and (3) enforcing the waiver will not result in a miscarriage of justice. <em>Hahn, </em>359 F.3d at 1325.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">We interpret the terms of a plea agreement \u201caccording to contract principles and what the defendant reasonably understood when he entered his plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Arevalo-Jimenez, </em>372 F.3d 1204, 1206 (10th Cir.2004). Moreover, while we construe \u201cany ambiguities in these agreements [ ] against the Government,\u201d <em>United States v. Porter, </em>405 F.3d 1136, 1142 (10th Cir.2005) (internal quotation omitted), we start by \u201cexaminfing] the plain language of the plea agreement.\u201d <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>413 F.3d 1146, 1151 (10th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">\n<em>B. Brunton\u2019s Appellate Waiver</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">\n<em>1. Scope of the Waiver</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b846-10\">For economic crimes, the applicable sentencing range is a function of the pecuniary loss flowing from the defendant\u2019s conduct. To determine the sentence here, the district court was required by the Guidelines to calculate the \u201cactual loss\u201d attributable to the crime, i.e., the \u201creasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm that resulted from the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G., \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. 3(A)(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-11\">Brunton agreed in his appeal waiver not to challenge his sentence or the manner in which it was determined. Specifically, Brunton agreed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-15\">[Defendant in exchange for the promises and concessions made by the United States in this plea agreement, knowingly and voluntarily waives his right to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-16\"><em>v </em># &amp;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-17\">(b) <em>Appeal, collaterally challenge, or move to modify </em>... <em>his sentence </em>as <em>imposed by the Court and the manner in which the sentence is determined, </em>provided the sentence is within or below the advisory guideline range determined by the Court to apply to this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b846-18\">Aplt. App. at 18 (emphasis added). The question for us, then, is whether the instant appeal falls within the scope of this explicit appellate waiver. We conclude that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-19\">Firstly, Brunton\u2019s appeal falls squarely within the plain meaning of the waiver. His appeal is a direct challenge to the manner in which his sentence was determined. The district court conducted a straightforward application of the Guidelines in determining the appropriate guideline range, and then, after determining the amount of loss, exercised its discretion to impose a sentence within the range.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-20\">Secondly, Brunton\u2019s claim that his sentence exceeded the guideline range is without merit. The district court concluded that Brunton\u2019s total offense level (13) and criminal history category (I) yielded a sentencing range of 12-18 months imprisonment. Ultimately receiving a prison term of 16 months, Brunton plainly received a sentence \u201cwithin or below the advisory guideline range determined by the Court to apply to this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b846-21\">Thus, the sentence imposed was within the scope of the appellate waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>\n<em>2. Waiver ivas Knowing &amp; Voluntary</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">\u201cWhen determining whether a waiver of appellate rights is knowing and voluntary, we especially look to two factors. First, we examine whether the language of the plea agreement states that the defendant entered the agreement knowingly and voluntarily. Second, we look for an adequate Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 colloquy.\u201d <em>Hahn, </em>359 F.3d at 1325 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">The first component of a knowing, voluntary waiver was clearly satisfied by the express language in Brunton\u2019s plea agreement providing that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-7\">[Djefendant ... <em>knowingly and voluntarily </em>waives his right to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-8\">a. Appeal or collaterally challenge his guilty plea and any other aspect of his conviction, including but not limited to any rulings on pretrial suppression motions or any other pretrial disposition of motions and issues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-9\">b. Appeal, collaterally challenge, or move to modify under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) or some other ground, his sentence as imposed by the Court and the manner in which the sentence is determined, provided the sentence is within or below the applicable guideline range determined by the Court to apply to this case. Defendant acknowledges that this waiver remains in full effect and is enforceable, even if the Court rejects one or more of the positions of the United States or defendant set forth in paragraph 7 concerning the application of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-10\">c. It is provided that (i) defendant specifically does not waive the right to appeal an upward departure from the sentencing guideline range determined by the Court to apply to this case, and (ii) his waiver of rights to appeal and to bring collateral challenges based on changes in the law reflected in Tenth Circuit or Supreme Court eases decided after the date of this agreement that are held by the Tenth Circuit or Supreme Court to have retroactive effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b847-12\">Aplt. App. at 18 (emphasis added). Brun-ton was represented by counsel and he supplies no reason to believe he did not know what rights he was waiving.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-13\">The transcript of the Rule 11 colloquy reinforces our conclusion that Brunton\u2019s appellate waiver was knowing and voluntary. At the hearing on March 8, 2005, the district court specifically addressed the waiver of appeal referenced in the plea agreement and asked Brunton if he understood it.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-14\">THE COURT: In your plea agreement, you may recall that you have waived your right to appeal or collaterally challenge any sentence imposed by the Court, except under limited and specified circumstances. Do you understand that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-15\">BRUNTON: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-16\">THE COURT: \u2014 as part of your plea agreement? Do you have any questions about anything that has taken place in these proceedings?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-17\">BRUNTON: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b847-18\">Plea Tr. at 9. We are satisfied that Brun-ton knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to bring this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-19\">\n<em>3. Enforcing the Waiver will not Result in a Miscarriage of Justice</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b847-20\">Finally, we consider whether an appellate waiver will result in a miscarriage of justice. Under <em>Hahn, </em>a defendant must show (1) the district court relied on an impermissible factor such as race in computing the sentence, (2) ineffective assistance of counsel rendered the waiver invalid, (3) the sentence exceeded the statutory maximum, or (4) the waiver was otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>unlawful. <em>Hahn, </em>359 F.3d at 1327 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">Factors one and two are not at issue in this case: Brunton neither argues the district court relied on an impermissible factor in sentencing, nor does he raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. This limits our miscarriage of justice analysis to whether the sentence exceeds the statutory maximum or whether the waiver is otherwise unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">Brunton\u2019s prison term of 16 months was far below the statutory maximum for his offense, which is 20 years. <em>Hahn </em>\u201crefers to the upper limit of punishment that Congress has legislatively specified for the violation of a given statute.\u201d <em>United States v. Green, </em>405 F.3d 1180, 1194 (10th Cir.2005). The statute under which Brun-ton pleaded guilty, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341, authorizes a maximum term of imprisonment of \u201cnot more than 20 years\u201d and fines up to $250,000 (pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3571). Brunton\u2019s 16-month prison term obviously falls well below the statutory maximum for his offense and thus his appellate waiver cannot be challenged on this basis. And, although the plea agreement does not contain an expected amount of restitution, Brunton\u2019s challenge is not to the order of restitution itself, but to the loss calculation under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 and its affect on the length of his prison sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">As to our catch all \u201cotherwise unlawful\u201d element, under <em>Hahn </em>\u201cthe error [must] seriously affect[ ] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d 359 F.3d at 1327 (internal quotation marks omitted). Brunton claims the district court committed such error in establishing the loss calculation and associated sentencing guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">Brunton misinterprets the miscarriage of justice exception, which looks to whether \u201cthe waiver is otherwise unlawful,\u201d <em>Hahn, </em>359 F.3d at 1327, not whether some other aspect of the proceeding may have involved legal error. His claim that the appellate waiver should be excused due to alleged errors in establishing his guideline range entails what <em>Hahn </em>called \u201cthe logical failing[ ] of focusing on the result of the proceeding, rather than on the right relinquished, in analyzing whether an appeal waiver is [valid].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1326 n. 12. To allow alleged errors in computing a defendant\u2019s sentence to render a waiver unlawful would nullify the waiver based on the very sort of claim it was intended to waive. This circular argument has been rejected in many cases. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Morgan, </em>386 F.3d 376, 381-82 (2d Cir. 2004); <em>United States v. Andis, </em>333 F.3d 886, 892 (8th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Brown, </em>232 F.3d 399, 403-04 (4th Cir. 2000); <em>United States v. Kratz, </em>179 F.3d 1039, 1041 (7th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-10\">Brunton does not allege that the waiver itself is unenforceable, but attacks the loss calculations under \u00a7 2B1.1. This is precisely the type of attack we sought to foreclose in Hahn and, therefore, we decline to find Brunton has satisfied the miscarriage of justice exception.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">Because we are satisfied that the appeal is within the scope of Brunton\u2019s appellate waiver and that the district court did not clearly err in calculating the actual losses, we DISMISS this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b844-17\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b845-10\">. Brunton\u2019s brief refers several times to the district court\u2019s loss calculation as an error in calculating \"restitution.\u201d It is clear from the briefs, however, that Brunton is challenging on appeal the court's calculation of the length of his sentence based on the amount of victim loss under the United States Sentencing Guidelines, \u00a7 2B1.1. To the extent he challenges restitution, his only concern is with the accuracy of the district court\u2019s calculation of amount.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b846-12\">. The restitution award in this case happens to be identical to the loss calculation used to determine Brunton\u2019s sentencing range under the Guidelines.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b848-7\">. We also reject Brunton's claim that constitutional <em>Booker </em>error plagues his sentence because but for the district court\u2019s error \"the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Huerta, </em>403 F.3d 727, 733 (10th Cir.2005). Brunton argues that \u201cwith an offense category of 11 [rather than 13] ... the Court may have been persuaded to grant [him] probation.\u201d Aplt. Brief at 7. However, the district court dispelled such wishful thinking at sentencing when it said: \"Mr. Brunton, I'm going to send you to prison, and I\u2019m going to do that because punishment is a legitimate goal of sentencing and you deserve it. And you\u2019ll do this time, and when you come back you can\u2014 you can work hard to make restitution to your victims.\u201d Aplt. App. at 50-51.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
