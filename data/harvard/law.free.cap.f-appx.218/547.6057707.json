Following the completion of his duties of representation, plaintiff filed a CJA voucher claiming payment for the services rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Plaintiff states that the amount claimed was \u201csummarily, arbitrarily, and unilaterally cut without notice, hearing, justification or explanation\u201d by the Chief Judge of the Circuit, the Honorable James B. Lo-ken. Plaintiff has filed what he has styled \u201cMotion for Hearing on CJA Fees,\u201d asking that the court schedule a hearing on the motion, to be followed by a review process along with an independent decision by an unbiased arbitrator, following which plaintiff is to be restored to the legal fees to which he is entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">We conclude that, for the reasons set forth in <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>391 F.3d 946 (8th Cir.2004), we are without jurisdiction to consider plaintiffs motion. The chief judge\u2019s role under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A(d)(3) is to rule upon requests for waiver of the maximum amounts of compensation set forth in \u00a7 3006A(d)(2). As we held in <em>Johnson, </em>\u201cThe role of the chief judge therefore relates to the management of funds, and the decision to approve a recommendation for excess funds is entirely his responsibility, not that of an appellate panel.\u201d 391 F.3d at 948. We conclude that the holding in <em>Johnson </em>applies with equal force to plaintiffs motion. <em>See also United States v. Obasi, </em>435 F.3d 847 (8th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">The motion is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
