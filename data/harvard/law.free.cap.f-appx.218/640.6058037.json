R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b669-8\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">Tatiana Khubeeva, and her husband, Stepan Kunetsky, natives and citizens of Russia, petition for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) denial of her application for asylum, withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We grant the petition and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-10\">Because the BIA considered Khubeeva\u2019s claims de novo, our review is limited to the BIA\u2019s decision. See <em>Shah v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1062, 1067 (9th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Cordon-Garcia v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 985, 990 (9th Cir.2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-11\">The BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination is based solely on the forensic expert\u2019s testimony and report, which purported to offer evidence regarding the authenticity of Khubeeva\u2019s birth certificate. The record shows, however, that Khubeeva\u2019s marriage certificate had been mislabeled as Khubeeva\u2019s birth certificate in the forensic report. Furthermore, the expert incorrectly testified that he had examined and found Khubeeva\u2019s birth certificate to be fraudulent. In fact, the record shows that the expert had only examined the marriage certificate and Khubeeva\u2019s husband\u2019s birth certificate. Thus, any information that the expert mistakenly offered, as to the authenticity of Khubeeva\u2019s birth certificate, was not reliable. Because the BIA relied on this evidence to find Khubeeva incredible as to her identity and nationality, the BIA\u2019s credibility determination is not supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Shah, </em>220 F.3d at 1067 (9th Cir.2000) (citing <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-14\">Accordingly, we grant the petition and remand for further proceedings consistent with this disposition. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-17, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-15\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b669-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
