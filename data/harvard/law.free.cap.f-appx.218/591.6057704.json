We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen. <em>See Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 899-900 (9th Cir.2003). To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is conferred by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-25\">The agency acted within its discretion in denying as untimely Manalili\u2019s motion to reopen filed more than eight years after the agency\u2019s final decision. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) (a motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days of the BIA\u2019s final decision). Moreover, the agency properly determined that Manalili failed to demonstrate she suffered prejudice as a result of alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See Iturribarria, </em>321 F.3d at 889-900 (to establish a valid due process claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must show that she was prejudiced by the attorney\u2019s deficient performance).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>We do not consider Manalili\u2019s contention that the agency should have reopened her case on the basis of hardship, because we lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s decision not to invoke its <em>sua sponte </em>authority to reopen proceedings. <em>See Ekimi-an v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153, 1159 (9th Cir. 2002). Furthermore, we do not consider Manalili\u2019s contention relating to <em>Ekimian v. INS </em>raised for the first time in her reply brief. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996) (holding issues which are not specifically raised and argued in a party\u2019s opening brief are waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b619-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
