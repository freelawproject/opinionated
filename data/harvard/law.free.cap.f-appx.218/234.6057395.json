Blackwell\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but suggesting that the district court erred in denying Blackwell\u2019s motion for a variance base on her limited intellect.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-22\">We find that the district court properly applied the Sentencing Guidelines and considered the relevant sentencing factors before imposing the fifteen month sentence. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2006); <em>see United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir. 2005). Additionally, we find that the district court\u2019s decision to deny Blackwell\u2019s request for a variance from the guideline range was reasonable, and its determination of the sentence within the range was reasonable. <em>See United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number><em>Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.2006). (\u201c[A] sentence imposed within the properly calculated [guidelines range [\u00b6]... ] is presumptively reasonable.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Accordingly, we affirm Blackwell\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Blackwell\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform her client, in writing, of her right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
