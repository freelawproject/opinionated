Hayward contends that the district court\u2019s decision to upwardly depart from the applicable guidelines range of 8 to 14 months and the extent of the departure were unreasonable. Hayward also contends that the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>trict court provided inadequate justification for imposing a sentence outside the recommended guidelines range and that his sentence was therefore unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">The sentence imposed in Hayward\u2019s case, while in excess of the range indicated by the policy statement, was within the statutory maximum term of imprisonment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(8). Hayward has not shown that his 24-month sentence was either unreasonable or plainly unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Hinson, </em>429 F.3d 114, 119-20 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1804, 164 L.Ed.2d 540 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Further, the record demonstrates that the district court considered the relevant 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. The district court reviewed the allegations against Hayward, heard the factual basis for Hayward\u2019s violations of supervised release, and was aware that Hayward had continued to commit credit card fraud while on supervised release. The nature and circumstances of Hayward\u2019s offenses; his criminal history and characteristics; and the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offenses, to promote respect for the law, and to protect the public from further crimes by Hayward are all factors a court must consider under \u00a7 3553(a). The record thus demonstrates that the district court considered the relevant sentencing factors and articulated sufficient reasons to support the sentence. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 518-19 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b379-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
