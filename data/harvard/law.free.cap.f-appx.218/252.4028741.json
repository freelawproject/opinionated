Mack was sentenced by the district court to a total of 137 months\u2019 imprisonment. We affirm the convictions and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-15\">On appeal, counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting there were <em>no </em>meritorious grounds for appeal, but raising the issue of whether the Government\u2019s failure to request a downward departure under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5K1.1 (2005) was improper. Mack was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but did not do so, and the Government elected not to file a responsive brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-16\">The decision to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion is solely within the Government\u2019s discretion. <em>United States v. Butler, </em>272 F.3d 683, 686 (4th Cir.2001). Therefore, unless the Government has obligated itself in a plea agreement to file a substantial assistance motion, its refusal to do so is not reviewable unless it was based on an unconstitutional motive or not rationally related to a legitimate Government end. <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185-87, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-17\">Mack\u2019s plea agreement provided that if the Government, \u201cin its sole discretion,\u201d determined that Mack had rendered substantial assistance, it \u201cmay make a motion pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 for imposition of a sentence below the applicable Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d Thus, because the Government retained its discretion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, and Mack has failed to establish that the Government\u2019s refusal to file was either based on an unconstitutional motive or not rationally related to a legitimate Government end, the issue is not reviewable on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Mack\u2019s convictions and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
