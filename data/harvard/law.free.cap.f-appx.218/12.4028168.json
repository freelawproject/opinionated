We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the relevant facts and procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-18\">A district court may order pretrial detention where it finds by clear and convincing evidence that \u201cno condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure ... the safety of any other person and the community....\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(e); <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3142(f). We review a district court\u2019s bail determination for clear error. <em>United States v. Ferranti, </em>66 F.3d 540, 542 (2d Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-19\">Upon review of the facts and circumstances of this case, we cannot say that the district court\u2019s decision to grant the government\u2019s motion to revoke bail is clearly erroneous. Nevertheless, in light of the length of time the defendant has been in federal custody, the likely period of incarceration he faces if convicted, and the repeated exclusions of time under the Speedy Trial Act that have occurred as a result of the magistrate judge\u2019s delay in deciding a motion to exclude evidence, we construe Mikula\u2019s appeal, in the alternative, as a petition for mandamus. <em>See Hong Mai Sa v. Doe, </em>406 F.3d 155, 158 (2d Cir.2005). Having done so, we deny the petition because we conclude that petitioner\u2019s right to relief is not at this time \u201cclear and indisputable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We do so, however, with the proviso that if (1) the motion to suppress which we are told is now pending before the magistrate judge is not decided by him within 30 days hereafter, or (2) there is substantial other delay in resolv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>ing this prosecution, the petition may be reinstituted in this Court. In the event it is so reinstituted, it shall be referred to this panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED, and defendant\u2019s petition for mandamus is hereby DENIED without prejudice under the terms set forth above.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
