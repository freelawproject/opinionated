July 5, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, proceedings below, and specification of issues. We hold as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-16\">While Johnson\u2019s petition was pending, this court clarified in <em>Wilson v. Gonzales, </em>471 F.3d 111 (2d Cir.2006), that applicants who claim that they \u201cdelayed filing an affirmative \u00a7 212(c) application to build a stronger case warranting the granting of that relief, believing such reliance will continue to be available, ... must make an individualized showing of reliance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 122. Johnson did not have the benefit of this decision when she filed her motion to reopen. We therefore grant Johnson\u2019s petition and remand her case to the BIA to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>determine whether she can make the requisite showing of individualized reliance.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
