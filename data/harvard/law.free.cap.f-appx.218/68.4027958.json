Feb. 14, 2005), <em>aff'g </em>No. A77 957 270 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City May 28, 2003). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-11\">When the BIA adopts and affirms, then supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yu Yin Yang v. Gonzales, </em>431 F.3d 84, 85 (2d Cir.2005). We review questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact <em>de novo. Secaida-Ro-sales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir. 2003). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-12\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of Dong\u2019s CAT claim, to the extent he claimed he would be tortured in prison. In <em>Mu Xiang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>432 F.3d 156, 159-60 (2d Cir. 2005), this Court held that without any particularized evidence, an applicant cannot demonstrate that he or she is more likely than not to be tortured \u201cbased solely on the fact that [he or she] is part of the large class of persons who have left China illegally\u201d and on generalized evidence indicating that torture occurs in Chinese prisons. Here, the background evidence indicated that most returnees were subjected to a brief detention, at most, and this Court has found that a brief detention, on its own, does not constitute torture. <em>See Mu-Xing Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 130, 144 (2d Cir.2003). Moreover, Dong provided the IJ with no basis to conclude that he, or someone in his \u201cparticular alleged circumstances,\u201d faced an elevated risk of excessive punishment. <em>Id. </em>at 143-44. Although he provided letters from his father and neighbor, each alleging that he was imprisoned upon his forced return to China, Dong\u2019s father admitted that he was not beaten, and his neighbor, who claimed he was beaten, did not point to any particular similarities between his circumstances and Dong\u2019s. See Mu <em>Xiang Lin, </em>432 F.3d at 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-13\">To the extent Dong claimed he would be subject to torture by the smugglers or loan sharks who financed his travel to the United States in 2001, the BIA\u2019s conclusion was likewise reasonable. The background evidence he submitted focused entirely on torture by the police and government officials in China, and contained no specific information on torture by loan sharks or other private individuals. Absent any evidence of torture by private individuals, much less the Chinese government\u2019s knowledge or tolerance of such actions, Dong could not establish that such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>torture was more likely than not to occur. <em>Cf. Khouzam v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 161, 170-71 (2d Cir.2004). Accordingly, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s conclusion that Dong failed to meet the high burden of proof for his CAT claim. <em>See Mu-Xing Wang, </em>320 F.3d at 143-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
