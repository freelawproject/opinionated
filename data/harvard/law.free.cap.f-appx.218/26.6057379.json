Defendant-appellant the City of Mount Vernon also appeals; because only individuals can assert qualified immunity, the City\u2019s appeal is dismissed, <em>see Munafo v. Metropolitan Transp. Auth, </em>285 F.3d 201, 215 (2d Cir.2002). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">We have interlocutory jurisdiction to review a district court\u2019s denial of summary judgment on qualified immunity only if the appeal is based \u201con undisputed facts or plaintiffs version of the facts.\u201d <em>See Coons v. Casabella, </em>284 F.3d 437, 440 (2d Cir. 2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). For substantially the reasons stated by the District Court, we conclude that disputed issues of material fact exist with respect to the entitlement of McCue and Manganiello to qualified immunity on both the false arrest and excessive force claims. Moreover, we note that their appeal is based on interpretations of the circumstances surrounding plaintiffs arrest that plaintiffs version of the facts do not compel. We therefore lack jurisdiction to review the District Court\u2019s order, and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
