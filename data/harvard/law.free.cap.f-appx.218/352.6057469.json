Aurelio RODRIGUEZ-MONGE, Defendant-Appellant.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b380-14\">No. 06-50447</docketnumber>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"Asg\">Summary Calendar.</p>\n<court data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b380-15\">United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b380-17\">Feb. 15, 2007.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b380-18\">Joseph H. Gay, Jr., Assistant U.S. Attorney, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, for Plaintiff-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b380-20\">Before SMITH, WIENER, and OWEN, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b380-21\">PER CURIAM: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b380-22\">Aurelio Rodriguez-Monge pleaded guilty, without a plea agreement, of conspiracy and possession with intent to distribute more than 50 grams of methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846. He appeals his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-23\">Rodriguez-Monge argues that the district court misapplied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(4) or, alternatively, clearly erred in finding that he could have foreseen that the methamphetamine was imported from Mexico. He argues that \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(4) applies only if the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>knew that his offense involved the importation of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Although the guidelines are advisory, the district court must still consider and take them into account. <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 360 (5th Cir.2005). We continue to review the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 &amp; n. 9 (5th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 268, 163 L.Ed.2d 241 (2005); <em>Villegas, </em>404 F.3d at 359.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">Assuming, without deciding, that proof of knowledge is required, the record evidence was sufficient for the district court to find by a preponderance of the evidence that Rodriguez-Monge had knowledge of the workings of the conspiracy, including the fact that the conspiracy\u2019s source of methamphetamine was in Mexico. The judgment of sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b380-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
