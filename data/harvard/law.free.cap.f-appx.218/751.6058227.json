Sims, a federal inmate appearing pro se, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to vacate, set aside or correct his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. On January 24, we granted Mr. Sims a Certificate of Appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) with respect to his contention that his attorney rendered ineffective assistance by failing to object to the district court\u2019s erroneous Sentencing Guideline calculation. Thereafter, the government confessed error and moved for remand. Our jurisdiction arises pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253, and we remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-12\">\n<em>Background,</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b780-13\">On July 19, 2004, Mr. Sims pled guilty to one count of possession of a firearm by a previously convicted felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). According to the Pre-sentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d), Mr. Sims\u2019s crime warranted a base offense level of 24 because he committed the offense subsequent to at least two violent felony convictions. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2) (2003). Pursuant to the plea agreement, Mr. Sims made \u2014 and the government did not oppose \u2014 a motion for a two-level reduction for his acceptance of responsibility with an additional one-level reduction for timely notifying the government of his intent to plead guilty. R. Doc. 44 at 3. The court granted these motions and determined that, with a total offense level of 21 and a criminal history category of VI, the applicable guideline range was 77 to 96 months. R. Doc. 50 at 5-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-14\">Mr. Sims, his attorney, and the Assistant United States Attorney each informed the court that there were no objections to these findings. <em>Id. </em>at 6. Mr. Sims\u2019s attorney then asked the court to sentence his client \u201cat the low end of the applicable guideline range,\u201d and the Assistant United States Attorney recommended \u201ca sentence of 77 months, based upon the plea agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7. The court accepted these recommendations and sentenced Mr. Sims to 77 months in prison and restitution in the amount of $228. R. Doc. 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-15\">On May 9, 2005, Mr. Sims filed his \u00a7 2255 motion. R. Doc. 51. The district court rejected his claims, determining that he failed to establish any defects in his counsel\u2019s performance or any prejudice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>caused by his counsel\u2019s decisions. R. Doc. 57 at 6-7. We then granted a COA on one claim contained in the motion: whether Mr. Sims\u2019s counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the district court\u2019s finding that he had two qualifying prior convictions for crimes of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">In reviewing the denial of a \u00a7 2255 petition, we examine the district court\u2019s legal rulings de novo. <em>United States v. Horey, </em>333 F.3d 1185, 1187 (10th Cir.2003). A defendant claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must typically show both that his counsel\u2019s performance \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness\u201d and that the deficient performance prejudiced him. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 692, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). However, the failure to object to the legally erroneous imposition of an enhancement under the Sentencing Guidelines constitutes ineffective assistance. <em>See Jansen v. United States, </em>369 F.3d 237, 244 (3d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">The base offense level for a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) is 24 if the defendant has two or more prior convictions for crimes of violence or controlled substances offenses and 22 if the defendant has only one such prior conviction. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a). A crime of violence is defined as a felony that \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or ... otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4B1.2(a). However, convictions for crimes of violence do not impact the base offense level under \u00a7 2K2.1(a) if the \u201csentence [was] imposed more than fifteen years prior to the defendant\u2019s commencement of the instant offense ... unless the defendant\u2019s incarceration extended into this fifteen-year period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4A1.1 cmt. n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-10\">Mr. Sims does not dispute that his 1983 manslaughter conviction, for which he was imprisoned until 1990, was properly considered a prior conviction for a crime of violence under \u00a7\u00a7 2K2.1(a) and 4B1.2(a). However, he argues that he has no other qualifying conviction; his other convictions are either too old or do not fit the definition of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d or \u201ccontrolled substances offense.\u201d The government agrees, admitting that the PSR mistakenly counted a 1980 armed robbery conviction as the second prior violent felony. <em>See </em>Aplee. Br. at 3. Mr. Sims was released from prison for this offense in 1981, making it far too stale to fit into \u00a7 4Al.l\u2019s fifteen-year window. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1 cmt. n. 1. Thus, Mr. Sims had only one qualifying prior violent felony conviction, and his base offense level should have been 22 rather than 24.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-11\">The district court used an incorrect base offense level in sentencing Mr. Sims, and there is a possibility that his sentence would have been lower if he had been sentenced using the correct base offense level and the lower attendant Guideline range. Accordingly, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s denial of Mr. Sims\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion on this point and REMAND for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b780-11\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to grant the parties' request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b781-8\">. A base offense level of 22 would have resulted in a total offense level of 19, leading to a sentencing range of 63 to 78 months.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
