For the reasons that follow, we will deny Gweh\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-15\">As we write only for the parties, who are familiar with the factual context and the procedural history of the case, we will set forth only those facts necessary to our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-16\">Gweh is a native and citizen of Liberia, and was admitted to the United States in September 1993 as a refugee. Gweh applied to adjust his status to legal permanent resident as required under \u00a7 209 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1159. His application was granted in February 1995. In June 2003, Gweh was convicted of robbery, criminal conspiracy, and possessing instruments of a crime under 18 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 \u00a7 3701(a)(l)(i), 903, 907, and he was sentenced to three and a half to seven years in prison. Gweh concedes that the robbery conviction constituted an aggravated felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-17\">In December 2003, Gweh was served a Notice to Appear, which charged him with removability under \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony. He was placed in removal proceedings, and admitted to removability as charged. Gweh sought to file a waiver under \u00a7 209(c) of the INA as a refugee in removal proceedings, and sought asylum, withholding of removal and protection under the CAT. The IJ refused to accept Gweh\u2019s application as a refugee, and a removal hearing was held on June 28, 2005.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The IJ found that Gweh\u2019s aggra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>vated felony conviction was a particularly serious crime, and pretermitted Gweh\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal <em>applications. </em>Additionally, the IJ determined that Gweh did not qualify for protection under the CAT because he failed to meet his burden of proof. He determined that although there was historical evidence of torture, there was no current evidence. The State Department Country Report for 2004 indicated that, although there were reports of torture when Charles Taylor was in power, there have been no such reports since the National Transitional Government of Liberia (\u201cNTGL\u201d) has taken power. The IJ ordered Gweh removed to Liberia.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Gweh appealed the IJ\u2019s decision to the BIA. The BIA dismissed the appeal. It held that when a refugee gains lawful permanent resident status, he or she may be placed in removal proceedings based on conduct which constitutes grounds for removal under \u00a7 237(a) of the INA. The BIA also affirmed the IJ\u2019s determinations that Gweh was convicted of a particularly serious crime and was therefore barred from receiving withholding of removal, and that Gweh failed to meet his burden for protection under the CAT. Gweh filed a petition for review of the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">We have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a). <em>See Romanishyn v. Attorney General, </em>455 F.3d 175, 180 (3d Cir.2006).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because the BIA adopted the findings of the IJ and discussed some of the bases for the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the decisions of the IJ and the BIA. <em>Chen v. Ashcroft, </em>376 F.3d 215, 222 (3d Cir.2004). Our review of the decisions is for substantial evidence, considering whether the decision is \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Balasubramamim v. INS, </em>143 F.3d 157, 161 (3d Cir.1998). Factual findings by the BIA or the IJ will be overturned only if a reasonable fact-finder would be compelled to conclude otherwise. <em>Abdille v. Ashcroft, </em>242 F.3d 477, 483 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">Gweh\u2019s first claim is that because his refugee status was not terminated, even though he became a legal permanent resident, he may not be placed in removal proceedings under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). We addressed this question in <em>Romanishyn v. Attorney General, </em>455 F.3d at 185. In <em>Romanishyn, </em>we held that an alien who enters the United States as a refugee, adjusts his status to become a legal permanent resident, and then commits an aggravated felony may be placed into removal proceedings under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), even though his refugee status was never formally terminated. <em>Id. </em>Gweh\u2019s case is indistinguishable from <em>Romanishyn, </em>and therefore we will deny this part of the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-12\">Gweh next argues that the IJ\u2019s determination, affirmed by the BIA, that his conviction for robbery was a particularly serious crime, which bars him from seeking withholding of removal, was improper.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A particularly serious crime, in the withholding of removal context, is an aggravat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>ed felony for which the alien was sentenced to five years imprisonment or an aggravated felony that the Attorney General deems a particularly serious crime. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(B); <em>Alaka v. Attorney General, </em>456 F.3d 88, 105 (3d Cir.2006). Because Gweh\u2019s sentence was for three and a half to seven years, the IJ considered whether the aggravated felony (robbery) should be deemed a particularly serious crime. Gweh claims that the IJ did not consider important factors in making its determination. We have approved of the BIA\u2019s requirement that an individualized assessment of the facts and circumstances must be made for a particularly serious crime determination. <em>Chong v. INS, </em>264 F.3d 378, 388 (3d Cir.2001). The BIA explained that \u201cconviction records and sentencing information\u201d are to be considered. <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Two other factors are the circumstances surrounding the conviction and whether the crime and circumstances suggest that the alien would be a danger to the community. <em>Yousefi v. INS, </em>260 F.3d 318, 329-30 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Here, the IJ considered the underlying facts of the crime. First, the IJ noted that Gweh was convicted of robbery.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As the IJ explained, he held a person up with a gun, although Gweh claimed it was a toy gun. The IJ considered the intent to frighten the victim, and the use of violence. This review of relevant factors is all that is required. <em>Chong, </em>264 F.3d at 388. Therefore, Gweh was not eligible for withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231 because he committed a particularly serious crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Gweh\u2019s final claim is that the IJ\u2019s determination that Gweh did not prove that he was entitled to protection under the CAT was not supported by the record. In a CAT claim, the burden is on the alien to prove that it is \u201cmore likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2); <em>Gabu-niya v. Attorney General, </em>463 F.3d 316, 320-21 (3d Cir.2006). Gweh relies on historical evidence of torture, which may be considered. However, the record clearly demonstrates that there have been no reports of torture since the NTGL took power. The reports of torture ceased when the regime of Charles Taylor was overthrown. Gweh has not rebutted this evidence nor provided additional evidence to meet his burden. Therefore, there is substantial evidence to support the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">Therefore, we will deny Gweh\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b224-13\">. There are two different spellings of Gweh\u2019s first name in the record. It appears that this is the correct spelling, as it is the spelling used on his application for refugee status.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b224-18\">. The hearing was conducted via teleconference from the State Correctional Institute Chester, where Gweh was held. Gweh raised a due process claim before the BIA because there was a bad connection. However, he has not raised this issue in his petition to this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b225-8\">. We have jurisdiction to review whether the law was properly applied in a particularly serious crime determination. <em>Alaka </em>v. <em>Attorney General, </em>456 F.3d 88, 103-04 (3d Cir. 2006). Additionally, we have jurisdiction to review the CAT claim regarding issues of application of law to fact. <em>Singh v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 533, 537-38 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b225-13\">. Gweh is also barred from asylum because the robbery was a particularly serious crime as defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(2)(A)(ii), (B)(i). Gweh does not dispute that his conviction is within the definition of particularly serious crime for asylum purposes, as all that is required is conviction of an aggravated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>felony regardless of the sentence imposed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b226-20\">. Although the IJ did not specifically state Gweh's sentence in the decision, the term of the sentence was included in the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
