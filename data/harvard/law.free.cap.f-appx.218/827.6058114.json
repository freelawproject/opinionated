The immigration judge (\u201cU\u201d) denied the application, and the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) affirmed. The petitioners, through counsel, seek review.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-24\">Petitioners make two arguments on appeal. First, they argue that the IJ erred by denying their application on the basis of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>an adverse credibility finding. Second, they argue that substantial evidence does not support the IJ\u2019s determination to deny them application. They claim that they have a well-founded fear of future persecution by guerillas who have imputed a political opinion to them and wish to harm them or recruit their elder son.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">When the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, as in this case, we review both the BIA and the IJ decisions. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir. 2001). We review legal determinations <em>de novo. Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247-48 (11th Cir.2001). We review factual determinations under the substantial evidence test, and \u201cmust affirm the [IJ\u2019s] decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1283-84 (internal quotations omitted). We may reverse a denial of asylum under the substantial evidence test \u201conly if the evidence presented by the applicant is so powerful that a reasonable factfinder would have to conclude that the requisite fear of persecution exists.\u201d <em>Ma-zariegos v. Office of the U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2001) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">To establish eligibility for asylum, an alien must show with specific, credible, and direct evidence either (1) past persecution because of a statutorily-listed factor, or (2) a well-founded fear of future persecution based on a statutorily-listed factor. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b). An adverse credibility determination alone may be fatal to an asylum application where the applicant presents only his own testimonial evidence. <em>Forgue v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005). But unless the IJ makes a \u201cclean determination[ ] of credibility,\u201d we assume that a credibility determination was not dispositive, and that the IJ also relied on the insufficiency of the evidence. <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005) (internal citations and quotations omitted). For example, in <em>Yang, </em>even though the IJ described an applicant\u2019s claims as \u201cridiculous fabrication\u201d and \u201cextremely inconsistent,\u201d the IJ did not expressly state whether she found Yang\u2019s testimony to be credible. We therefore assumed that the credibility determinations were not dispositive in the IJ\u2019s denial of the application, and went on to review whether there was substantial evidence to support the IJ\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">Here, the IJ said only that \u201ccertain inconsistencies do somewhat reduce credibility,\u201d and that such inconsistencies \u201cmust be considered by the [c]ourt as somewhat of an issue as to credibility.\u201d This did not constitute a \u201cclean determination\u201d of credibility. We therefore assume that the IJ relied also on the insufficiency of the petitioners\u2019 evidence, and not simply on a failure to believe the petitioners. <em>See Yang, </em>418 F.3d at 1201.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">Accordingly, we turn to the question of whether the IJ\u2019s decision to deny the application for asylum was supported by substantial evidence. The Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum if an alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AslU\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b857-11\">INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). To establish asylum eligibility, the alien must, with specific and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>credible evidence, establish either (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of future persecution based on a statutorily listed factor. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. An alien who shows past persecution raises a rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1). An alien who has not shown past persecution may still be entitled to asylum if he can demonstrate a well-founded fear of a future threat to his life or freedom on the basis of a protected ground. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2). To establish a \u201cwell-founded fear,\u201d an applicant must show that he has a fear of persecution in his home country and that \u201cthere is a reasonable possibility of suffering such persecution if he or she were to return to that country.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)\u00ae. An asylum applicant claiming persecution on the basis of political opinion must show (1) that he has a political opinion, and (2) that he was either persecuted for that opinion, or has a well-founded fear of being persecuted because of that opinion. <em>INS v. Elias-Zaca-rias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 816, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">Petitioners argue that substantial evidence did not support the IJ\u2019s denial of their application for asylum. They first claim that they were persecuted by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). The petitioners testified that a cousin tried to recruit the elder son, Elias, into the FARC. When Elias refused to join, Elias\u2019s father Roberto confronted the cousin. As a consequence, the cousin and others threatened the petitioners on several occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">Substantial evidence supported the IJ\u2019s determination that this did not suffice to show past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor. The petitioners failed to show that the alleged persecution was on account of a statutorily listed factor. They did not present any evidence that the threats or harassment were based on race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. Rather, the evidence tended to show that petitioners were harassed because FARC wanted Elias to join. The Supreme Court has recognized that guerilla recruitment efforts alone are not sufficient to show past persecution, because \u201ca person ... might resist recruitment for a variety of reasons-fear of combat, a desire to remain with one\u2019s family and friends, a desire to earn a better living in civilian life, to mention only a few.\u201d <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 482, 112 S.Ct. at 815. Thus, in addition to guerilla recruitment or harassment, a petitioner must show \u201cthat the guerillas will persecute him because\u2022 of [a] political opinion, rather than because of his refusal to fight with them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 483, 112 S.Ct. at 816 (emphasis in original). Petitioners\u2019 evidence related only to the fact of attempted guerilla recruitment and the corresponding threats. Thus, on the whole record, the IJ\u2019s conclusion that they did not suffer past persecution on the basis of a statutorily listed factor was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">Having failed to show past persecution, petitioners next argue that they have a well-founded fear of future persecution. This claim fails for the same reason: even if they could show a fear of future persecution, they have not presented evidence showing that their fear is linked to race, political opinion, membership in a particular social group, religion, or nationality. \u201c[Ejvidence that either is consistent with acts of private violence or the petitioner\u2019s failure to cooperate with guerillas ... does not constitute evidence of persecution based on a statutorily protected ground.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1258 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>Petitioners attempt to satisfy the statutory definition by claiming that Elias belongs to a \u201cparticular social group\u201d: \u201cyoung men recruited by unlawful guerilla factions.\u201d But the BIA has rejected the assertion that young men in certain countries who are targeted by guerilla recruiters constitute a particular social group. <em>See Matter of Vigil, </em>19 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 572, 574 (BIA 1988). Moreover, we have previously upheld the BIA\u2019s interpretation of \u201cparticular social group\u201d as requiring \u201ca common immutable characteristic that is fundamental to its members\u2019 individual identities or consciences.\u201d <em>Castillo-Arias v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1190, 1196-7 (11th Cir.2006). A group composed of all young men in Colombia recruited by guer-illa factions is far too broad and ill-defined to meet that definition. Because petitioners failed to provide a link to one of the grounds enumerated in the statute, the IJ did not err in dismissing their asylum application.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">Petitioners finally claim that they supplied the requisite nexus to the statutory categories by way of a theory of imputed political opinion. We have held that \u201c[a]n imputed political opinion, whether correctly or incorrectly attributed, may constitute a ground for a well-founded fear of political persecution within the meaning of the INA.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289 (internal quotations omitted). \u201cAn asylum applicant may prevail on a theory of imputed political opinion if he shows that the persecutor falsely attributed an opinion to him, and then persecuted him because of that mistaken belief about his views.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alterations and internal quotations omitted). But in the context of forcible recruitment, \u201cthe mere existence of a generalized \u2018political\u2019 motive underlying the guerrillas\u2019 forced recruitment is inadequate to establish (and, indeed, goes far to refute) the proposition that [the petitioner] fears persecution <em>on account </em>of political opinion, as [INA] \u00a7 101(a)(42) requires.\u201d <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 482, 112 S.Ct. at 816 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">Petitioners claim that the guerillas will impute a political opinion to them on the basis of their resistance to the efforts to recruit Elias. But they have not specified the content of this imputed political opinion, and thus cannot show why the guerillas might want to persecute them for it. Rather, their evidence only tends to show that the guerillas harassed them, and might continue to harass them, because they refused to let Elias join the FARC: not because FARC thought they disagreed with its political views. To the extent that petitioners fear the guerillas still wish to recruit Elias, this tends to refute the notion that they wish to persecute him for having political beliefs different from theirs. <em>See Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 482, 112 S.Ct. at 816 (noting that guerillas\u2019 forced recruitment \u201cgoes far to refute\u201d a claim of persecution on the basis of political opinion). Alluding to the political motives that the guerilla movement may possess is not enough to carry petitioners\u2019 burden. <em>See id. </em>at 482, 112 S.Ct. at 816 (\u201cThe ordinary meaning of the phrase \u2018persecution on account of ... political opinion\u2019 in \u00a7 101(a)(42) is persecution on account of the victim\u2019s political opinion, not the persecutor\u2019s\u201d). Petitioners must show that the guerillas would persecute them on the basis of their political beliefs, and they have presented no evidence to show that they have a well-founded fear of such persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">Petitioners also failed to show that their fear of future persecution is well-founded. We have previously found it significant that a petitioner\u2019s \u201cson and his parents have remained unharmed in the region of Colombia where [petitioner] allegedly was threatened.\u201d <em>Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1259. Elias\u2019s father Roberto, who eonfi\u2019onted the cousin and received many of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>the threatening phone calls, remains in Colombia and has not been harmed. Substantial evidence therefore supported the IJ\u2019s determination, both because petitioners failed to show that their fear was well-founded and because their fear was not linked to a statutorily listed ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">Finally, even if petitioners could have established a well-founded fear of persecution, their claim would still fail because they produced no evidence showing they could not avoid persecution by moving elsewhere in Colombia. \u201cAfter establishing a \u2018well-founded fear\u2019 of persecution, the alien must establish the persecution cannot be avoided by relocating within the subject country.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231. Petitioners would have to show not only that guerilla activity is widespread in Colombia: they would have to show that guerillas who would specifically target them exist wherever they might move in Colombia. <em>Id. </em>at 1232 n. 7. We previously upheld the denial of an application where a petitioner claiming persecution by guerillas \u201cwas a fairly low-level soldier who does not appear to have played an especially notorious role in the war\u201d because \u201c[w]e cannot say on this record that he is a high-profile target, or that guerillas outside the vicinity of his home are likely to identify and pursue him.\u201d <em>Mazariegos, </em>241 F.3d at 1327. Similarly, as the IJ found, the petitioners did not attempt to relocate before departing Colombia, and in fact, Elias\u2019s father Roberto still lives there. Petitioners thus presented no evidence to show that they would be persecuted if they relocated within Colombia, and for this reason too the IJ did not err in dismissing their application for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">Petitioners also claim that they are entitled to withholding of removal and relief under the CAT. Withholding of removal, unlike asylum, is mandatory. To qualify for withholding of removal under the INA, an alien must show that if returned to his country, the alien\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. INA \u00a7 241(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). Generally, where an alien fails to meet the \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d standard for establishing asylum eligibility, the alien cannot establish the higher burden for withholding of removal. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93. Similarly, the burden on the alien seeking CAT relief is higher than the burden imposed on the asylum seeker. <em>Id. </em>at 1303. To show an entitlement to CAT relief, the petitioner must show \u201cthat it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because substantial evidence supported the IJ\u2019s determination that petitioners were not eligible for asylum, substantial evidence also supported the IJ\u2019s determination that petitioners are not entitled to withholding of removal or relief under the CAT. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
