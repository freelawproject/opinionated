After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b861-17\">I. BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b861-18\">Williams was indicted on drug distribution charges in two counts, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (Counts I &amp; II), with being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g) and 924(a)(2) (Count IV), and with knowingly and willfully possessing counterfeit federal reserve notes with intent to defraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 472 (Count V). Count III, the only conviction at issue in this appeal, charged Williams with \u201cusing and carrying\u201d firearms, and aiding and abetting his co-defendant in the \u201cusing and carrying\u201d of firearms, during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(c) and 2. Williams entered a conditional guilty plea to all five counts, reserving for appeal only the issue of the denial of his motion to suppress evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-19\">\u00a3)uring the plea colloquy, the government made a proffer of the facts supporting the guilty plea. In relevant part to Count III, the government stated that the Suwanee County Sheriffs Department pulled over a Ford Bronco owned by Williams for failing to display a license plate. Williams\u2019s co-defendant, Lee Oliver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>Edmond, was driving, and Williams was riding in the passenger seat. After officers learned that Williams was a convicted felon, Williams told them that they could not search his car because it contained a firearm. The officers arrested Williams for being a felon in possession of a firearm. A subsequent search of the Bronco found 200 grams of cocaine base, four grams of cocaine powder, a set of scales, razor blades, two firearms and a box of ammunition. One firearm, a loaded Browning model Hi-Power .9 mm pistol, was found in the center console between the driver and passenger seats. The other firearm found in the Bronco was an AA Arms model AP-9 .9 mm pistol.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">After hearing the government\u2019s proffer, Williams agreed that the facts were true. Williams also admitted that he had \u201ccarried\u201d a firearm while committing the drug trafficking crime charged in Count I, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-5\">THE COURT: On or about August 22, 1991, in Suwanee County, in the Middle District of Florida, did you commit the drug trafficking crime, that is, count one having to do with the crack cocaine, when you were possessing that cocaine with intent to distribute it, cocaine base, did you at that time knowingly use or carry a firearm described in the indictment, that is a Browning model Hi-Power .9 millimeter pistol and a AA Arms model AP-9 .9 millimeter pistol?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-6\">DEFENDANT WILLIAMS: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-7\">THE COURT: And do you admit that you carried that pistol while you were also guilty of and in the process of committing the crime in count one?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-8\">DEFENDANT WILLIAMS: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-10\">On February 14, 1992, the district court sentenced Williams to a 200-month sentence on Counts I and II, a 120-month sentence on Count IV, 180-month sentence on Count V, all to run concurrently. The district court sentenced Williams to a consecutive 5-year sentence on Count III.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-11\">Williams appealed, challenging the district court\u2019s ruling on his motion to suppress. This Court affirmed Williams\u2019s conviction. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>No. 92-2191, 1992 WL 315493 (11th Cir. Oct. 21, 1992). The Supreme Court denied certiorari on February 22, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-12\">On April 29, 1993, Williams filed a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate his sentence, which the district court denied on August 6, 1993. Williams filed an appeal of that denial, which appeal this Court dismissed on April 29, 1998. <em>Williams v. United States, </em>No. 93-3191 (11th Cir. Apr. 29, 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-13\">On December 6, 1995, the Supreme Court decided <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995). In <em>Bailey, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that a conviction under \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s \u201cuse\u201d prong, as distinct from the \u201ccarry\u201d prong, requires \u201cactive employment,\u201d such as \u201cbrandishing, displaying, bartering, striking with, and, most obviously, firing or attempting to fire a firearm,\u201d as opposed to mere possession. <em>Bailey, </em>516 U.S. at 148, 116 S.Ct. at 508; <em>see also Castillo v. United States, </em>200 F.3d 735, 736-37 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-14\">On March 18, 2004, Williams filed the instant \u00a7 2241 petition, raising a claim based on Bailey.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation (\u201cR &amp; R\u201d) recommended that Williams\u2019s petition be dismissed as a successive \u00a7 2255 motion and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>concluded that \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause did not apply. Over Williams\u2019s objections, the district court dismissed Williams\u2019s petition \u25a0without prejudice based on the reasons in the R &amp; R. We granted Williams a certificate of appealability on the issue of \u201c[wjhether the district court erred by concluding that appellant could not challenge his conviction and sentence through the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, in light of the standard set forth in <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1238 (11th Cir.1999).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">On appeal, Williams does not dispute that he filed a prior \u00a7 2255 motion in 1993. Instead, Williams argues that \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause applies to his \u00a7 2241 petition. Specifically, Williams contends that he was convicted of using a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), in violation of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Bailey.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">To fall within the savings clause, a prisoner must show that an otherwise available remedy under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The restrictions on successive \u00a7 2255 motions, standing alone, do not render that section \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d within the meaning of the savings clause. <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1245 (11th Cir.1999). Rather, under <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>the savings clause applies to a claim when: (1) the claim is based upon a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) the holding of that Supreme Court decision establishes the prisoner was convicted for a non-existent defense; and (3) circuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised in the prisoner\u2019s trial, appeal or first \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Id. </em>at 1244. A petitioner may not argue the merits of his claim until he has \u201copen[ed] the portal\u201d to a \u00a7 2241 proceeding by demonstrating that the savings clause applies to his claim. <em>Id. </em>at 1244 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-12\">The parties do not dispute that Williams\u2019s <em>Bailey </em>claim satisfies the first and third prongs of the <em>Wofford </em>test. <em>Bailey </em>was decided after Williams\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion was denied and is retroactively applied to cases on collateral review. <em>See Bousley v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 614, 621, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 1610, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998). Furthermore, prior to <em>Bailey, </em>our Circuit interpreted \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s \u201cuse\u201d prong to include possession that did not include active employment of the firearm. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Poole, </em>878 F.2d 1389, 1393 (11th Cir.1989). Thus, the issue on appeal in this case is whether Williams established the second prong, that is, that he was convicted of an offense made nonexistent by <em>Bailey. </em>We conclude that he did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-13\">Bailey applies only to defendants who are convicted of using a firearm and not to defendants who are convicted of carrying a firearm. <em>See Castillo, </em>200 F.3d at 737; <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998). In order to satisfy his burden under the Wofford test, Williams was required to show that he was convicted of using a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-14\">However, Williams\u2019s indictment and the transcript of his plea colloquy make clear that Williams pled guilty to \u201ccarrying\u201d a firearm during the commission of a drug trafficking offense. Specifically, Williams\u2019s indictment charged that Williams \u201cknowingly did use and carry ... firearms\u201d and he admitted during his plea <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>colloquy to carrying one of the pistols charged in the indictment. Furthermore, the facts proffered by the government and admitted by Williams during his plea show that Williams knowingly transported the firearms in his car, which was being used as a drug distribution center. These facts are sufficient to support a conviction for carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime. <em>See Tannen-baum, </em>148 F.3d at 1263 (\u201cIn order to convict a defendant for \u2018carrying\u2019 a firearm, it is necessary only to show that the defendant knowingly carried a gun in a car that was being used as a drug-distribution center.\u201d); <em>Castillo, </em>200 F.3d at 737 (explaining that, since <em>Bailey, </em>\u201cso long as the defendant was charged under both the \u2018use\u2019 and \u2018carry\u2019 prongs of the statute, the conviction may be sustained if the evidence proves carrying but not use\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Williams\u2019s offense of conviction fell under the \u201ccarry\u201d prong of \u00a7 924(c), not under the \u201cuse\u201d prong. Thus, Williams has failed to show under the second prong of <em>Wofford </em>that he was convicted of a non-existent offense. As a result, he has also failed to \u201copen the portal\u201d to \u00a7 2241. <em>See Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244 n. 3. Therefore, the district court did not err by dismissing Williams\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b861-13\">. Williams filed his \u00a7 2241 petition after the effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996). Therefore, the provisions of the AEDPA govern this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b861-20\">.
