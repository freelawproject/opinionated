California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Davis has filed a response to counsel\u2019s motion. Our independent re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>view of the record, counsel\u2019s brief, and Davis\u2019s response shows that there are no nonfrivolous issues for appeal. The record is insufficiently developed to allow consideration of Davis\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel in this direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Higdon, </em>832 F.2d 312, 313-14 (5th Cir.1987). Accordingly, the motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and this APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b345-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
