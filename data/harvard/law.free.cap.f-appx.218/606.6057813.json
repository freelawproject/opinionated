We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-25\">Reviewing for abuse of discretion, <em>Cano-Merida v. INS, </em>311 F.3d 960, 964 (9th Cir.2002), we conclude that the IJ acted within her discretion in denying Hossain\u2019s motion to reopen. Hossain\u2019s contention that he did not understand Hindi is unsupported by the record, which demonstrates that he was provided proper notice of the date and time of his exclusion hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>Accordingly, we also conclude that Hos-sain has not established a due process violation. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201cTo prevail on a due process challenge ... [a petitioner] must show error and substantial prejudice.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b634-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
