To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 968, 972 (9th Cir.2004), review de novo constitutional challenges, <em>id., </em>and review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual determinations, <em>Ordonez v. INS, </em>345 F.3d 777, 782 (9th Cir.2003). We deny in part, and dismiss in part, the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reopen on the ground that Shepherd failed to establish a prima facie claim of citizenship because the record is insufficient to establish that \u201cpaternity [was] established during minority, by legitimation, or adjudication of a competent court\u201d as was required by former section 205 of the Nationality Act of 1940, found at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 605 (1945). <em>See id. </em>at 785 (explaining that to reopen, alien must establish a \u201creasonable likelihood that the statutory requirements for relief have been satisfied\u201d); <em>Ablang v. Reno, </em>52 F.3d 801, 803 (9th Cir.1995) (explaining that the applicable law for transmitting citizenship to a child born abroad out of 'wedlock \u201cis the statute that was in effect at the time of the child\u2019s birth\u201d); <em>cf. </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1409(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-11\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Shepherd has not established eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, or protection under the CAT. The record does not contain evidence that Shepherd has a well-founded fear of, or is likely to be subject to, persecution in the United Kingdom. <em>See Singh v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 1100, 1111-13 (9th Cir.2006). Nor does it contain evidence that it is more likely than not that he would face torture. <em>See id. </em>at 1113.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-12\">To the extent Shepherd contends he is eligible for adjustment of status, suspension of deportation, cancellation of removal, or a section 212 waiver, we lack jurisdiction to review these contentions because Shepherd did not exhaust them before the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-13\">Shepherd\u2019s contention that the requirements of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1409 violate equal protection lacks merit. <em>See Nguyen v. INS, </em>533 U.S. 53, 61, 121 S.Ct. 2053, 150 L.Ed.2d 115 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b686-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
