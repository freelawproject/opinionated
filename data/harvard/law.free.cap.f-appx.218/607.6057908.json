We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">Where, as here, the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s decision and also adds its own reasons, we review both decisions. <em>See Zhou v. Gonzales, </em>437 F.3d 860, 864 (9th Cir.2006). We review for substantial evidence, <em>Chen v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 611, 616 (9th Cir. 2004), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Thind\u2019s inability to conclusively demonstrate his true identity goes to the heart of his asylum claim, and therefore substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir. 2003); <em>see also Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962 (9th Cir.2004) (explaining that adverse credibility ruling will be upheld so long as identified inconsistencies go to heart of asylum claim). Because Thind failed to satisfy the lower standard of proof for asylum, he necessarily failed to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Alvarez-Santos v. INS, </em>332 F.3d 1245, 1255 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Substantial evidence likewise supports the denial of Thind\u2019s CAT claim because he did not establish that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured if he returned to India. <em>See Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b635-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
