By plea agreement, he waived his right to \u201c[ajppeal or collaterally challenge his guilty plea and any other aspect of his conviction.\u201d Plea Agreement at 7. In addition, he waived his right to \u201c[ajppeal, collaterally challenge, or move to modify ..., his sentence imposed by the Court and the manner in which the sentence is determined, provided the sentence is within or below the advisory guideline range determined by the Court to apply to this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He, however, did \u201cnot waive the right to appeal a sentence above the advisory guideline sentencing range determined by the Court to apply to this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>After determining that the applicable guideline range was 188 to 235 months of imprisonment, the district court imposed a sentence of 200 months of imprisonment followed by five years of supervised re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>lease. Notwithstanding the plea waiver, Mr. Long filed a pro se notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">The government has moved to enforce Mr. Long\u2019s plea waiver under <em>United States v. Hahn, </em>359 F.3d 1315 (10th Cir. 2004) (en banc) (per curiam). Mr. Long\u2019s attorney filed a response stating that Mr. Long would \u201cfile his Petition in Error within the prescribed time frame,\u201d that the \u201cPetition in Error will allege, among other things, that the sentence of time to serve of 200 months is outside the advisory guideline,\u201d and that until Mr. Long \u201cfiles his Petition in Error and Brief in support [a] ruling granting appellee\u2019s Motion for Enforcement may be premature.\u201d Resp. to Mot. for Enforcement of the Plea Agreement at 2. For these reasons, counsel requested that this court deny the motion to enforce the plea agreement. This court gave Mr. Long an opportunity to file a pro se response to the motion to enforce. To date, he has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">We have reviewed the petition to enter a guilty plea, the plea agreement, the plea hearing transcript, the sentencing hearing transcript, the government\u2019s motion to enforce the plea agreement, and Mr. Long\u2019s counsel\u2019s response to the motion to enforce. We conclude that the following three factors have been satisfied: (1) \u201cthe disputed appeal falls within the scope of the waiver of appellate rights\u201d; (2) Mr. Long \u201cknowingly and voluntarily waived his appellate rights\u201d; and (3) \u201cenforcing the waiver would [not] result in a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Hahn, </em>359 F.3d at 1325. Accordingly, we conclude that Mr. Long\u2019s waiver of his right to appeal is enforceable. Further, we note, contrary to his counsel\u2019s argument, Mr. Long received a sentence that fell within the advisory guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">We therefore GRANT the government\u2019s motion to enforce the plea agreement and DISMISS the appeal. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b836-15\"> This panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
