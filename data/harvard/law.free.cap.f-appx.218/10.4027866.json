Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), retroactive to cases on collateral review constitutes a denial of his First Amendment right to petition the government to redress his grievances and establishes a suspension of the Writ of Habeas Corpus. The district court (Kahn,./.) dismissed the petition and this appeal followed. We assume familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-16\">Because White has challenged the constitutionality of his sentence, based upon <em>Booker </em>and <em>Apprendi, </em>and not the execution of his sentence, it should be construed as a motion for relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See Poindexter v. Nash, </em>333 F.3d 372, 377 (2d Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 1210, 124 S.Ct. 1486, 158 L.Ed.2d 135 (2004). While the correct forum for a \u00a7 2241 petition is the district where the petitioner is confined, <em>see Starnes v. McGuire, </em>512 F.2d 918, 932 (C.A.D.C. 1974), a \u00a7 2255 petition must be filed in \u201cthe court which imposed the sentence,\u201d <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 \u00b6 1; <em>Poodry v. Tonawanda Band of Seneca Indians, </em>85 F.3d 874, 890 n. 17 (2d Cir.1996). In very limited circumstances, claims that fall within the substantive scope of \u00a7 2255 may properly be made in a petition filed under \u00a7 2241.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Poindexter, </em>333 F.3d at 378 (cit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>ing <em>Jiminian v. Nash, </em>245 F.3d 144, 147-48 (2d Cir.2001); <em>Triestman v. United States, </em>124 F.3d 361, 373-74, 377-78 (2d Cir.1997)). In order to fit within this exception authorizing a petition under \u00a7 2241 for a claim that is within the substantive scope of \u00a7 2255, it is insufficient simply to claim that relief under \u00a7 2255 is unavailable because a prior petition under \u00a7 2255 has been denied, <em>see, e.g., Roccisano v. Menifee, </em>293 F.3d 51, 57 (2d Cir.2002); <em>Jiminian, </em>245 F.3d at 147-48, or because \u00a7 2255 relief is unavailable because the Supreme Court has not made a new rule of constitutional law retroactive to cases on collateral review, <em>see Guzman v. United States, </em>404 F.3d 139, 141 (2d Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 731, 163 L.Ed.2d 577 (2005); <em>Love v. Menifee, </em>333 F.3d 69, 73-74 (2d Cir.2003) (no serious constitutional question raised by unavailability of retroactive \u00a7 2255 relief on an <em>Apprendi </em>claim). Because White\u2019s claims fall within the substantive scope of \u00a7 2255 and do not fit within the \u201csavings clause\u201d authorizing a petition under \u00a7 2241, the district court properly dismissed White\u2019s petition. For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b39-12\">.
