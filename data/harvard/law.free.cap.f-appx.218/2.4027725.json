Jimenez, timely appeal from the dismissal of their discrimination complaint against the company and individuals who manage the Proyecto Residencial Las Flores housing project in Aibonito, Puerto Rico, where they have lived for over twenty years. We affirm the entry of summary judgment for appellees essentially for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s decisions dated October 13, 2005 and March 30, 2006, adding only the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-28\">Appellants claim that they each suffer from mental disabilities and that they requested a transfer to a different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>apartment at Las Flores as a reasonable accommodation of those disabilities. Appellants further claim that appellees\u2019 denial of their transfer request constituted impermissible discrimination against them on the basis of their disabilities in violation of the Fair Housing Act (\u201cFHA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3613, and section 504 of the 1974 Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In order to make out a prima facie case for failure to accommodate under the FHA, appellants bear the burden of establishing three things: that the requested accommodation is (1) <em>reasonable </em>and (2) <em>necessary </em>to (3) afford the handicapped person <em>equal oppoHunity </em>to use and enjoy the housing. <em>Bryant Woods Inn v. Howard County, </em>124 F.3d 597, 603 (4th Cir.1997); <em>Schroeder v. Bertolo, </em>942 F.Supp. 72, 75 (D.P.R.1996). But before a district court can assess whether a plaintiff has met his or her burden of establishing each of the elements of a prima facie case, the plaintiff must show that a special accommodation of a disability was, in fact, requested. A routine or \u201cmundane\u201d request, <em>Reed v. Le-Page Bakeries, Inc., </em>244 F.3d 254, 260 (1st Cir.2001), such as a request to transfer to a different apartment, does not rise to the level of a request for a reasonable accommodation unless the plaintiff specifically explains \u201chow the accommodation requested is linked to some disability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">Even after indulging all inferences in appellants\u2019 favor, our <em>de novo </em>review of the record shows that at the time appellants requested a transfer to apartment # G-5, and for several months after that request was denied, appellants repeatedly informed appellees that they needed the transfer in order to get away from conflicts with noisy neighbors, which they had been unable to resolve. Appellants claim that throughout this time, appellees were \u201cwell aware\u201d of their disabilities and need for an accommodation. To be sure, there is evidence in the record that indicates that appellees made changes to appellants\u2019 apartment to make it physically more accessible for Lydia E. Jimenez, who was then 71 years old, and that Orlando Colon-Jimenez received Social Security disability insurance benefits. But such general \u201cawareness\u201d does not transform appellants\u2019 request to move to a different apartment into a request for a reasonable accommodation. It is appellants\u2019 responsibility to put appellees \u201con notice by making \u2018a sufficiently direct and specific request for special accommodations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gill v. Franklin Pierce Law Center, </em>899 F.Supp. 850, 855 (D.N.H.1995) (quoting <em>Nathanson v. Med. Coll. of Pa., </em>926 F.2d 1368, 1381 (3d Cir.1991)). Indeed, beyond asserting that appellants needed a quiet apartment in order to protect their mental health, it was never made clear precisely how the transfer request was linked to or made necessary by appellants\u2019 disabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">In view of the lack of evidence on this crucial point, the district court was correct in concluding that appellants\u2019 transfer request represents not \u201ceven-handed treatment,\u201d as required by the FHA, but an action that would give appellants \u201cgreater opportunity than nonhandicapped persons,\u201d <em>Bryant Woods Inn, </em>124 F.3d at 604 (citing <em>Southeastern Cmty. Coll. v. Davis, </em>442 U.S. 397, 410-11, 99 S.Ct. 2361, 60 L.Ed.2d 980 (1979)), as transfers solely because of noise are not permitted as of right at Las Flores and, as the district court explained, virtually any tenant would prefer a quiet apartment over a noisy one. Because appellants have failed to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>appellees\u2019 actions were discriminatory, their pretext claim also fails. <em>Lewis v. Gillette Co., </em>22 F.3d 22, 25 (1st Cir.1994) (per curiam). And, finally, we find no evidence of retaliation against appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">The district court also correctly dismissed appellants\u2019 due process claims. Appellants assert that appellees violated their procedural due process rights by failing to restore Orlando Colon-Jimenez to his mother\u2019s lease, yet nowhere in the record does it appear that Colon-Jimenez ever applied for admission to the Las Flores project after he voluntarily terminated his lease, nor does the record contain any facts indicating that appellees\u2019 admissions process was unavailable or inadequate. <em>El Dia, Inc. v. Rossello, </em>20 F.Supp.2d 296, 306 (D.P.R.1998), <em>aff'd, </em>165 F.3d 106 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">To the extent that appellants also claim violations of their substantive due process rights, we observe that, \u201c[wjhere, as here, a plaintiffs substantive due process claim challenges specific acts of a state officer, the plaintiff must show <em>both </em>that the acts were so egregious as to shock the conscience <em>and </em>that they deprived him of a protected interest in life, liberty, or property.\u201d <em>Pagan v. Calderon, </em>448 F.3d 16, 32 (1st Cir.2006) (citing <em>Rivera v. Rhode Island, </em>402 F.3d 27, 34 (1st Cir.2005)). There is no \u201cconscience-shocking\u201d conduct in this record, and appellants have not been deprived of housing \u2014 they still reside in the apartment that was modified to accommodate Lydia E. Jimenez\u2019s physical disabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">The district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b31-6\">. Appellants have not appealed the dismissal without prejudice of their supplemental claims based on Articles 1802 and 1803 of the Civil Code of Puerto Rico, 31 L.P.R.A. \u00a7\u00a7 5141-42.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
