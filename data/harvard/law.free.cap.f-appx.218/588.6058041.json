We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Gonzalez-Cervantes contends that the district court erred by failing to exercise its independent discretion to grant a downward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K3.1 when the government\u2019s refusal to move for a departure was based on an unconstitutional motive. Specifically, Gonzalez-Cervantes contends that the government\u2019s failure to move for such a departure based on his refusal to stipulate to removal was unconstitutional because it discriminated against him based on race and nationality or alienage.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">Even assuming the district court had independent discretion to grant such a departure, <em>see Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992), Gonzalez-Cervantes failed to demonstrate that the government had an unconstitutional or improper motive for refusing to move for a fast-track departure. <em>See id. </em>at 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840; <em>United States v. Espinoza-Cano, </em>456 F.3d 1126, 1138 (9th Cir.2006) (noting that a defendant must present objective evidence of an improper motive on the part of the government).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b617-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
