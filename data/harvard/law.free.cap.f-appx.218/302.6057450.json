The dismissal of a complaint under \u00a7 1915A is reviewed de novo. <em>Velasquez v. Woods, </em>329 F.3d 420, 421 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-17\">Melntire does not dispute that this lawsuit raises substantially the same claims that he raised in <em>McIntire v. Grand Prairie Police Dep\u2019t, </em>No. 4:04-CV-951-A (N.D.Tex.2005), but he argues that the dismissal of this complaint was error because No. 4:04-CV-951-A was dismissed without prejudice and his claims are still timely under Texas law.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-18\">Our records do not support Mclntire\u2019s contention that No. 4:04-CV-951-A was dismissed without prejudice. The district court dismissed No. 4:04-CV-951-A pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e). Although the order of dismissal did not specifically state that the complaint was dismissed with prejudice, a dismissal pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e) is deemed to be with prejudice unless the district court specifies otherwise. <em>Marts v. Hines, </em>117 F.3d 1504, 1506 (5th Cir.1997) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-19\">We therefore conclude that this appeal is without arguable merit and that it should be dismissed as frivolous. 5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>The dismissal of No. 4:04-CV-951-A, the dismissal of the current complaint by the district court, and the dismissal of this appeal all count as strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). As Mcln-tire now has accumulated at least three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he is barred from proceeding in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b330-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
