Muhammad El Ali sought an order enjoining the state court action. Muhammad El Ali also filed a mandamus petition and request for a restraining order accompanied by a \u201cnotice of removal for writ of habeas corpus,\u201d seeking to remove the state court foreclosure action and to restrain the state court \u201cfrom any further interference\u201d with the foreclosure action.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-23\">By order entered September 14, 2005, the District Court dismissed the habeas petition with prejudice. The District Court determined that Muhammad El Ali, also known as Donald Smith, had violated the pre-filing injunction order issued on February 4, 2005, in the case of <em>Smith v. Litton Loan Servicing, LP, et al., </em>Civ. No. 04-02846, 2005 WL 289927, by submitting the habeas petition without proper leave of the Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court also held that the habeas petition had no basis in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>law or fact because Muhammad El Ah was not in custody and the matters alleged did not come under the purview of any habeas corpus statute. The District Court noted that the habeas petition sought to avoid a sheriffs sale of the Tasker Street property and that the matter had been previously litigated in <em>Donald Smith ex rel. Donald Muhammed El Ali v. Altegra Credit Co., </em>Civ. A. No. 02-08221, 2004 WL 2399773 (E.D.Pa. Sept. 22, 2004). Muhammad El Ali timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. This Court is required to dismiss an in <em>forma pauperis </em>appeal if it is \u201cfrivolous.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae. An appeal is frivolous where none of the legal points is arguable on its merits. <em>See Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). Muhammad El Ai is not in custody and his request for relief is not cognizable under \u00a7 2241. His appeal is frivolous, therefore, and will be dismissed as such pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae. Appellant\u2019s motion for stay pending appeal is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b190-18\">. The pre-filing injunction is set forth in full in the District Court's memorandum opinion. The pre-filing injunction applied to Donald Smith, Donald A. Smith, Donald Muhammad El Ali or Lisa Smith.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
