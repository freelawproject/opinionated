The board issued a brief letter denying the couple\u2019s petition. It stated: \u2018While the submitted materials reflect that the officials may be more strictly enforcing the population control policies to individuals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>residing in the respondent\u2019s home province, the respondents! ] provided no evidence regarding the persecution of citizens returning to China with foreign-born children.\u201d It then referenced the State Department\u2019s latest China Profile \u201cindicating that returning Chinese nationals with foreign-born children are not subject to special treatment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">The BIA\u2019s analysis is facially incoherent. If officials in Wang and Huang\u2019s home province are \u201cmore strictly enforcing population control policies,\u201d and returning Chinese nationals \u201care not subject to special treatment,\u201d then Wang and Huang have every reason to believe they will be subject to these new and stricter population control policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">The BIA also referenced <em>Matter of C-C- </em>28 I &amp; N Dec. 899 (BIA 2006), in which the board discredited an affidavit by Dr. John Aird. <em>Id. </em>at 900-01. Wang and Huang relied in part on an affidavit by Dr. Aird. We note that two circuits have already criticized the BIA for rejecting without sufficient reasons the evidence presented in Dr. Aird\u2019s affidavits. <em>See Guo v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 556, 565-66 (3d Cir. 2004); <em>Zheng v. Gonzales, </em>415 F.3d 955, 961-63 (8th Cir.2005). Even if the board\u2019s subsequent and more thorough analysis of Dr. Aird\u2019s affidavit in <em>Matter of C-C- </em>redresses the concerns raised by our sister circuits, the BIA has not addressed any of the other evidence presented by the petitioners. We therefore grant Wang\u2019s petition for review, vacate the BIA\u2019s denial of Wang and Huang\u2019s motion to reopen their claims for asylum, and remand this case for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">PETITION GRANTED. ORDER DENYING MOTION TO REOPEN VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
