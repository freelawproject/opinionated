Two years later, judgment was entered in the case based on an accepted Offer of Judgment. The defendants agreed to pay plaintiffs\u2019 attorney\u2019s fees and costs, and Taylor wanted his share. However, he did not file a claim within the allotted 14 day period following entry of judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Taylor thus filed a motion to allow an untimely claim on the ground that he had not known judgment entered until after the applicable deadline.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-20\">Courts should allow late filings caused by \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Pioneer Investment Services Co. v. Brunswick Associates Limited Partnership</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>instructs that \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d is \u201ca somewhat elastic concept\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and \u201cis at bottom an equitable [determination], taking account of all the relevant circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As we explained in <em>Pincay v. Andrews,</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we therefore \u201cexamine all of the circumstances involved rather than holding that any single circumstance in isolation compels a particular result regardless of the other factors.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The <em>Pioneer </em>analysis is \u201cbroader and more flexible\u201d than the one we previously employed and \u201ccaution[s] against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>erecting a rigid barrier against late filings....\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">Judged by the liberal <em>Pioneer </em>standard, Taylor\u2019s untimeliness is excusable. He did not know in time to meet the deadline that judgment had entered. He was mailed a copy of the notice of entry of judgment, but apparently did not receive it due to chronic problems with delivery of his mail. The other attorneys involved spoke to Taylor about the \u201csettlement\u201d and the \u201coffer of judgment,\u201d and faxed him a request to submit a fee claim to defense counsel, but they did not tell him that judgment had entered. These exchanges understandably did not give Taylor knowledge that judgment had entered. A settlement, even following offer of judgment, is typically documented by a release of claims and stipulation for dismissal of the case from the plaintiff in exchange for a check from the defendant. A stipulation for entry of judgment is less common. Taylor was not required to monitor the docket sheet to discover if judgment would ever enter.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Indeed, it is unlikely that Taylor could have found a deputy clerk so accommodating to pull the docket sheet for him every morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">When Taylor finally learned that an order had been filed based on the offer of judgment, he immediately sent someone to the clerk\u2019s office to check the status of the case, thereby discovering the Notice of Entry of Judgment that had been lost in the mail. That same day, Taylor sent his documented fee request to defendants\u2019 counsel. Shortly thereafter, he asked defendants\u2019 counsel for an extension of time to file a claim. When defendants\u2019 counsel denied his request, Taylor made his untimely fee motion. All this occurred within nine days. There is no indication that Taylor acted with anything other than good faith. He did not do anything sneaky or try to keep anyone in the dark.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-13\">At the time Taylor requested an extension from defense counsel, and when he actually filed his motion, the parties themselves had not yet settled attorney\u2019s fees and costs. In fact, defendants\u2019 counsel had even granted plaintiffs\u2019 new counsel a time extension. Moreover, Taylor\u2019s \u201clate\u201d request for his fees and costs was no surprise. Before the parties settled, Taylor had filed a lien notifying the parties that he wanted his share of the fees and costs. The post-settlement conduct of plaintiffs\u2019 new attorney and defense counsel indicates that they both well understood Taylor\u2019s position. In short, Taylor\u2019s delay did not significantly impact the proceedings. No prejudice to anyone else has been suggested. The only prejudice that might result from this case is prejudice to Taylor, who could lose his fees and costs because he did not know when judgment was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-14\">Basically, Taylor did not know when judgment was entered for two reasons. First, he was no longer plaintiffs\u2019 attorney. Second, the communications to him initially spoke of settlement, not entry of judgment, and settlement does not typically involve entry of judgment. He acted in good faith and with reasonable diligence once he knew judgment had been entered. The prejudice to him is great if leave to file an untimely application is denied. There is no apparent prejudice to other parties if it is granted. For these reasons, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>especially prejudice, <em>Pioneer </em>and <em>Pincay </em>require that discretion be exercised in Taylor\u2019s favor on the extension of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b719-12\"> xhiS disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
