The PSI also correctly noted that the maximum term of supervised release for the \u00a7 924(c) count was three to five years under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(b)(1) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.2(a)(l). It does not appear that Ellis made any objections to the PSI. The court sentenced Ellis to 51 months imprisonment on the \u00a7 922(g) and \u00a7 1951 charges, to run concurrently, and a consecutive 84-month term of imprisonment on the \u00a7 924(c) charge, for a total of 135 months imprisonment. The court imposed three years of supervised release on the \u00a7 922(g) and \u00a7 1951 counts, with a concurrent five-year term of supervised release on the \u00a7 924(c) count. Ellis now appeals, asserting a violation of Fed.R.Crim.P. (\u201cRule\u201d) 11 because the court improperly advised him of the term of supervised release on the \u00a7 924(c) count.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-11\">When a defendant fails to assert a Rule 11 violation in the district court, we review for plain <em>error. United States v. Quinones, </em>97 F.3d 473, 475 (11th Cir.1996). To establish plain error, Ellis must show \u201cthat there was error, that the error was plain, and that it affected his substantial rights, i.e., the error affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u201d Once the appellant proves these three elements, this court may correct the error only if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In evaluating whether there was any effect on the defendant\u2019s substantial rights, we may consider the record as a whole. <em>United States v. Monroe, </em>353 F.3d 1346, 1350 (11th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>United States v. Vonn, </em>535 U.S. 55, 59, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 1046, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-12\">Under Rule 11, the district court must address three core principles before accepting a guilty plea: \u201c(1) the guilty plea must be free from coercion; (2) the defendant must understand the nature of the charges; and (3) the defendant must know and understand the consequences of his guilty plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>143 F.3d 1417, 1418-1419 (11th Cir.1998). Rule 11 also requires the court to inform the defendant of \u201cany maximum possible penalty, including imprisonment, fine, and term of supervised release.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(1)(H).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-13\">As the government concedes, the court improperly advised Ellis of the term of supervised release for the \u00a7 924(c) count. Thus, there was an error that was plain. <em>United States v. Carey, </em>884 F.2d 547, 549 (11th Cir.1989). Nevertheless, Ellis is not entitled to relief because the error did not affect his substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-14\">At the plea colloquy, Ellis was informed of an incorrect term of supervised release. However, the PSI correctly indicated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>term of supervised release, and Ellis did not object to the PSI\u2019s supervised release calculation. Moreover, after the court imposed sentence, including the five years of supervised release, Ellis did not object to the term. Thus, the error did not affect Ellis\u2019s substantial rights. <em>United States v. Bejarano, </em>249 F.3d 1304, 1307 (11th Cir. 2001) (rejecting the defendant\u2019s argument that the district court committed plain error by failing to inform him of the term of supervised release because the defendant\u2019s \u201cconduct indicates that his substantial rights were not affected by the district court\u2019s failure to inform him at his plea colloquy of the specific term of supervised release required by statute.\u201d); <em>Carey, </em>884 F.2d at 549 (holding that although the district court erred by failing to inform the defendant at his plea hearing of the term of supervised release, the defendant failed to object to the court\u2019s imposition, pursuant to the PSI, of a term of supervised release, and, therefore, the defendant\u2019s substantial rights were not violated). Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
