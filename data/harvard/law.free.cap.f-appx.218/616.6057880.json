To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is conferred by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo claims of due process violations in immigration proceedings. <em>See Sanchez-Cruz v. INS, </em>255 F.3d 775, 779 (9th Cir.2001). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-20\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary determination that Romero Bonifacio failed to show exceptional and extremely unusual hardship. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-21\">Romero Bonifacio\u2019s contention that the agency deprived him of due process by misapplying the law to the facts of his ease, mischaracterizing testimony, and failing to properly assess the hardship his children would experience does not state a colorable due process claim. <em>See id. </em>(\u201ctraditional abuse of discretion challenges recast as alleged due process violations do not constitute colorable constitutional claims that would invoke our jurisdiction\u201d); <em>see also Sanchez-Cruz, </em>255 F.3d at 779 (holding that the \u201cmisapplication of ease law\u201d may not be reviewed).</p>\n<p id=\"Alr\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>Contrary to Romero Bonifacio\u2019s contention that the IJ failed to fully develop the record and was biased, the record shows that the proceedings were not \u201cso fundamentally unfair that he was prevented from reasonably presenting his case.\u201d <em>Colmenar v.
