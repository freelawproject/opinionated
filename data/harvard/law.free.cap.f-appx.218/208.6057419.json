Although trial counsel for Anderson never objected to these legally correct charges, Anderson asks this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Court to reverse and remand the judgment below as an exercise of our discretion to correct plain errors that are prejudicial. We find that no error at all occurred in this case, and, for the reasons that follow, will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">As we write only for the parties, we forgo a lengthy recitation of the facts. Anderson worked as a sales representative for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco (RJR) from November 4, 1998 to May 8, 2000. During that time, Anderson carried out a scheme to defraud his employer centering on promotional and marketing discounts given by RJR to high-volume retailers in the form of payback checks and vouchers. As a sales rep, Anderson was responsible for determining who would qualify for the promotional checks and vouchers. In return for a kickback of about half the face value of the checks, Anderson would have checks and vouchers sent through the mail to low-volume retailers who in fact did not qualify. The checks ranged in value from $600 to $8,000 and Anderson gained a total of about $160,000 from the scheme. Anderson did not report this illicit income on his tax returns for the years 1999 or 2000, and consequently deprived the United States of about $40,000 in revenue. On September 18, 2003, Anderson was indicted and charged with sixteen counts of mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341 and two counts of tax evasion in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">At the charging conference, jury instructions on the elements of a \u201cscheme to defraud\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341 were discussed. Specifically, the conversation focused on two paragraphs\u2014one that stated \u201cit is not necessary for the Government to prove that the defendant was actually successful\u201d and one that referred to \u201can unsuccessful scheme.\u201d The attending Government attorney observed \u201cI think these two paragraphs just aren\u2019t relevant.\u201d Defense counsel responded \u201cI have no objection to deleting the last paragraph, beginning with \u2018an unsuccessful scheme.\u2019 \u201d The trial judge agreed, stating \u201cI think it\u2019s a good idea and my view is, the shorter the charge, the better a jury grasps the issues.\u201d With all in agreement, the paragraphs were deleted.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">During its deliberations, the jury sent a note to the trial judge asking the following question: \u201cTo be mail fraud, does the defendant have to receive money or property, or does the act of trying to obtain money or property constitute mail fraud?\u201d Obviously, the deleted paragraphs addressed that question directly insofar as they made clear that an unsuccessful attempt was still mail fraud under the statute. Consequently, the Government offered its original, annotated copy of the jury instructions, suggesting that the omitted paragraphs be read to the jury. Counsel for Anderson did not object to the supplemented jury instructions and instead affirmatively agreed to the reading of those paragraphs. With all in agreement again, the trial judge re-read the legally correct jury instructions supplemented by the omitted paragraphs, which are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-10\">It is not necessary for the Government to prove that the defendant was actually successful in defrauding anyone or successful in obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises. It is not necessary for the Government to prove that anyone lost any money or property as a result of the scheme or plan to defraud. An unsuccessful scheme to defraud is as illegal as a scheme or plan that is actually successful.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>The jury then returned a verdict finding Anderson guilty on thirteen counts of mail fraud and two counts of tax evasion. Anderson filed a timely appeal, alleging for the first time that the reading of the jury instructions as supplemented was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">The District Court had jurisdiction over these criminal proceedings pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. Anderson filed a timely appeal, and we have jurisdiction over the final judgment of the District Court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Because trial counsel for Anderson failed to object to the jury instruction at trial, we review the proceedings for plain error, that is, one that is \u201cclear\u201d and \u201caffects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Nappi, </em>243 F.3d 758, 762 (3d Cir.2001). Reversal is permissive, not mandatory, under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b) and in this case we \u201cexercise our discretion to order such a correction only if the error \u2018seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Stevens, </em>223 F.3d 239, 242 (3d Cir.2000) (quoting <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)) (internal citations omitted). The burden is on Anderson to demonstrate that plain error occurred. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">It is undisputed that the challenged jury instruction in its entirety was a correct statement of the law. In addition, throughout the proceedings the Government asserted that Anderson had committed mail fraud under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341, the same crime for which he was indicted and eventually convicted. In alleging that the supplemented jury instructions \u201cchanged the government\u2019s theory of the case,\u201d it is unclear whether Anderson believes the jury instructions created a \u201cvariance\u201d or rather a \u201cconstructive amendment\u201d of the indictment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, we need not resolve this ambiguity as it is clear that neither occurred. As we explained in <em>United States v. Somers, </em>496 F.2d 723 (3d Cir.1974), there are two types of variations between the indictment and evidence that may form the basis for reversal of a conviction: (1) amendments, which occur \u201cwhen the charging terms of the indictment are altered, either literally or [constructively], by prosecutor or court after the grand jury has last passed upon them,\u201d and (2) variances, \u201cwhere the charging terms are unchanged, but the evidence at trial proves facts materially different from those alleged in the indictment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 743 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-12\">In this case, the grand jury\u2019s indictment specifically charged Anderson with mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>tax evasion in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201. The Government\u2019s \u201ctheory of the case\u201d throughout the proceedings was that Anderson violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341 through a scheme to defraud involving the U.S. Postal Service, and then failed to report the illegal proceeds of that fraudulent activity as taxable income. A constructive amendment occurs only when jury instructions broaden the scope of the indictment by permitting conviction for an uncharged offense. <em>See, e.g., Government of the V.I. v. Joseph, </em>765 F.2d 394, 397-99 (3d Cir.1985) (finding constructive amendment occurred where indictment charged first-degree rape and court\u2019s instruction to jury allowed conviction of entirely separate charge of third-degree rape). Here the jury convicted Anderson of the precise crimes with which he was charged in the indictment, a scheme to defraud under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341 and tax evasion under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201. The jury instruction charge, which simply states the correct legal standard for finding an individual hable under \u00a7 1341, therefore did not constructively amend Anderson\u2019s indictment. Rather, it merely identified the alternative grounds for finding him hable for the same charge. <em>See United States v. Navarro, </em>145 F.3d 580, 584 (3d Cir.1998) (finding no constructive amendment where jury instructions included three possible mental states although prosecution focused on only one state).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Furthermore, there was no variance between the facts alleged and the evidence proved at trial. Anderson argues that the Government conceded during the charging hearing that there was no evidentiary support for the jury instruction that Anderson could be liable under \u00a7 1341 for an unsuccessful attempt to defraud. This argument is unpersuasive. It is illogical in that the Government clearly believed and asserted throughout the trial that there was a sufficient foundation in the evidence to support a charge of successful mail fraud. Implicit in the assertion that there is sufficient evidentiary support for a successful effort to defraud is the proposition that there is sufficient evidence for an unsuccessful effort to defraud. Furthermore, we do not believe Anderson is correct in his assertion that the Government \u201cacknowledged\u201d and \u201cfrankly admitted\u201d that there was no support for the jury instruction charge on an unsuccessful attempt. The Government stated that it believed the additional paragraphs on an unsuccessful scheme \u201cjust aren\u2019t relevant.\u201d It is not the Government\u2019s position that evidence did not support such a charge. Rather, it maintains that the paragraphs were \u201csuperfluous\u201d and that it believed originally that they would needlessly complicate and confuse the issues. <em>See </em>Appellee\u2019s Br. 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">Finally, the jury found Anderson guilty of tax evasion for failing to report the proceeds of his fraudulent mail scheme. Clearly, both the grand jury and trial jury concluded Anderson\u2019s mail fraud was \u201csuccessful,\u201d otherwise there would have been no illegal income to fail to report. Anderson argues it is impermissible to consider the tax evasion charges as proof that the jury found his mail fraud scheme successful. To do so, he asserts, would require us to rely on a \u201cpattern of convictions,\u201d a rationale which Anderson argues we disavowed in <em>United States v. Syme, </em>276 F.3d 131, 155 (3d Cir.2002) (\u201cWe do not believe that the \u2018pattern of convictions\u2019 is sufficient to support the conclusion that the government urges us to draw about the jury\u2019s motivations, <em>ie., </em>that it relied on the chart and ignored the Court\u2019s instructions.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>This is not a case, however, where we are speculating as to a jury\u2019s motivations, as in <em>Syme. </em>Rather, we are drawing a necessary inference from the jury\u2019s conclusion that Anderson was guilty of tax evasion for failing to report the proceeds of his fraudulent scheme. We know that the jury concluded that Anderson was successful in his fraudulent scheme because, as a matter of simple logic, such a conclusion was a necessary precondition to a finding that Anderson was guilty of tax evasion. Had Anderson not been successful at his fraudulent scheme, there would have been no fraudulent proceeds to fail to report in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Anderson was charged with and convicted of the offenses of mail fraud and tax evasion. The challenged jury instructions were legally correct and in no way amended or varied from the charges against him. Therefore, no error at all occurred in this case, let alone plain error, and we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b238-7\">. Anderson's opening brief does not explicitly mention \"variance\u201d or \"constructive amendment\u201d or cite any cases specifically addressing these claims, but his reply brief does argue a constructive amendment occurred. Were it not so clear that this argument has no merit, we might otherwise conclude that Anderson waived it by failing to meet the specificity requirements of Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28. <em>See Fed. R.App. P. </em>28(a)(9)(A)(\"[A]rgument ... must contain ... appellant\u2019s contentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies....\u201d); <em>Laborers\u2019 Int\u2019l Union v.
