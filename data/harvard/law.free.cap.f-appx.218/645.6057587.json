We review for an abuse of discretion, <em>see Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 968, 972 (9th Cir.2004), <em>amended by </em>404 F.3d 1105 (9th Cir.2005), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-25\">Dilbar concedes that his attorney received notice of his hearing. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229(a)(2)(A); <em>Garcia v. INS, </em>222 F.3d 1208, 1209 (9th Cir.2000) (per curiam) (holding that it is a longstanding principle that a party is considered to have notice of all facts of which his attorney has notice) (citations omitted). Furthermore, Dilbar made no showing that he failed to appear at his hearing due to circumstances that are exceptional within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(1). <em>See, e.g., Valencia-Fragoso v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 1204, 1206 (9th Cir.2003) (holding that a petitioner\u2019s failure to appear because she forgot the correct time of the hearing is not, in and of itself, an exceptional circumstance). Accordingly, the IJ did not abuse his discretion in denying Dilbar\u2019s motion to reopen. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-26\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b673-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
