Escobar-Rico argues that the district court erred by imposing a 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) based upon his Texas conviction for burglary of a habitation. His argument is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Valdez-Maltos, </em>443 F.3d 910, 911 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 265, 166 L.Ed.2d 205 (2006); <em>United States v. Garcia-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d 454, 456-57 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1398, 164 L.Ed.2d 100 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-27\">Escobar-Rico also challenges, in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. His constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although he contends that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Escobar-Rico properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"AE9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b328-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
