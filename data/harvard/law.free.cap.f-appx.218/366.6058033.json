Burton, formerly federal prisoner # 03618-180, seeks a certificate of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>appealability to challenge the district court\u2019s denial of her 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. She also seeks leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">In her \u00a7 2255 motion Burton challenged the one-year prison term that the district court imposed after revoking the supervised release that she was serving for her conviction of theft of government property, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">To obtain a COA, Burton must make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(2); <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). During the pendency of this appeal, Burton was released from prison. Burton\u2019s claims have been rendered moot by her release. <em>See Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 7, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998); <em>Bailey v. Southerland, 821 </em>F.2d 277, 278-79 (5th Cir.1987). Therefore, this appeal is DISMISSED AS MOOT. COA and IFP are DENIED AS MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b394-36\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
