Boyd pleaded guilty to one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), and was sentenced to 75 months\u2019 imprisonment and three years\u2019 supervised release. Boyd filed a notice of appeal, but his appointed counsel now seeks to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), because she is unable to discern a nonfrivolous issue to pursue. Counsel\u2019s supporting brief is facially adequate, and Boyd has not responded to our invitation under Circuit Rule 51(b) to comment on counsel\u2019s submission. We therefore limit our review to the potential issues identified in counsel\u2019s brief. <em>See United States v. Schuh, </em>289 F.3d 968, 974 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-14\">In September 2005 Boyd got into an argument with another individual on a street in Superior, Wisconsin, pulled out a gun, and fired a shot into the air. Soon thereafter the police arrived. They arrested Boyd after they found ammunition on him and a gun in nearby bushes, resulting in this criminal case for unlawful firearms and ammunition possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-15\">Boyd had previously been convicted under Wisconsin law of battery/habitual criminality. When preparing Boyd\u2019s PSR, the probation officer determined that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>prior conviction met the definition of a felony conviction for a crime of violence, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2K2.1 cmt. n. 1, 4B1.2 cmt. n. 1. The probation officer therefore calculated a base offense level of 20 because the instant offense came after that felony conviction for a crime of violence, <em>see </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A). Boyd\u2019s PSR included an additional four levels for possessing a firearm in connection with another felony offense, <em>see </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5). The other felony offense was reckless endangerment, which the probation officer determined that Boyd committed by firing a shot into the air in a residential neighborhood. Boyd received a three point reduction for acceptance of responsibility, resulting in a total offense level of 21. Boyd was placed in criminal history category V, with an applicable guidelines range of 70 to 87 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Boyd objected to the PSR prior to his sentencing hearing. He argued that his prior battery conviction should not be classified as a felony because it would have been a misdemeanor but for the habitual criminality enhancement. Boyd also objected to the inclusion in his criminal history of a judgment entered against him for operating a vehicle while intoxicated because it was a default judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court overruled Boyd\u2019s objections and then addressed the sentencing factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a)(1). With respect to Boyd\u2019s history and characteristics, <em>see </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), the district court acknowledged that Boyd had a difficult childhood, growing up without a father and losing his mother to cancer at the age of 16. But, the district court continued, Boyd responded by turning to drug use and criminal activity, and opined that his \u201cvery serious criminal history record\u201d indicates an \u201cinability to control [his] anger, [his] willingness to use physical force\u201d and draw a gun on someone. The court also observed that Boyd\u2019s criminal activity spanned ten years with no indication that he took his responsibilities seriously since Boyd had accumulated \u201chuge child support arrears payments\u201d and rarely showed up for any gainful work. Based on these considerations plus the seriousness of his offense, <em>see </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), and the need to protect the public from Boyd\u2019s \u201cincreasingly more dangerous criminal conduct,\u201d <em>see </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C), the court imposed a sentence toward the middle of the advisory guidelines range. The court also stated that this sentence would afford Boyd \u201cadequate opportunity to participate in much needed rehabilitative programming,\u201d including vocational training and drug and mental health treatment, <em>see </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">First, counsel has considered whether Boyd could argue that his guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary and therefore should be set aside. But, as counsel notes, Boyd does not wish to have his plea vacated, and thus we need not consider this potential argument. <em>See United States v. Knox, </em>287 F.3d 667, 671 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">Counsel next considers whether Boyd could argue that his prior battery/habitual criminality conviction should not have been used to increase his base offense level. Boyd\u2019s battery conviction was classified as a misdemeanor by the Wisconsin county court, <em>see </em>Wis. Stat. \u00a7 940.19(1), but he was also charged with and convicted of being a habitual offender under Wisconsin law. The applicable statute states that \u201c[i]f the actor is a repeater ... the maximum term of imprisonment ... may be increased to not more than 2 years.\u201d Wis. Stat. \u00a7 939.62(1). A felony conviction, for purposes of the sentencing guidelines, is \u201ca prior adult federal or state conviction for an offense punishable by death or imprisonment for a term exceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>ing one year, regardless of whether such offense is specifically designated as a felony and regardless of the actual sentence imposed.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 cmt. n. 1. Therefore, although Boyd\u2019s battery conviction was designated a misdemeanor, it is considered a felony for sentencing purposes. <em>See United States v. Peters, </em>462 F.3d 716, 720 (7th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Bissonette, </em>281 F.3d 645, 646 (7th Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">Next, counsel considers whether Boyd could challenge the inclusion of his default conviction for operating while intoxicated in his criminal history calculation. According to Boyd\u2019s PSR, a plea of no contest was entered after he failed to appear for his court date. The sentencing guidelines provide that a plea of <em>nolo contendere, </em>or no contest, is considered an adjudication of guilt and that a sentence imposed pursuant to such a plea is properly considered a \u201cprior sentence.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 4A1.2(a)(l). <em>See also United States v. Jiles, </em>102 F.3d 278, 280-81 (7th Cir.1996). Accordingly, any challenge to the inclusion of this prior conviction would be frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Finally, counsel considers whether Boyd could argue that his sentence was unreasonable. Because the term falls within the properly calculated guidelines range, it is presumed reasonable, and counsel says he cannot find any basis to rebut this presumption. <em>See United States v. Mykytiuk, </em>415 F.3d 606, 608 (7th Cir. 2005). Although the Supreme Court recently granted a writ of certiorari to consider whether it is consistent with <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), to afford a presumption of reasonableness to a sentence within the guidelines range, <em>see United States v. Rita, </em>177 Fed.Appx. 357 (4th Cir.2006), <em>cert. granted, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 551, 166 L.Ed.2d 406 (2006), even without the presumption any challenge to the 75-month term imposed in this case would be frivolous. The district court considered the relevant factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), including his family history, lack of meaningful work history and individual responsibility, and the seriousness of his offense, <em>see United States v. Dean, </em>414 F.3d 725, 729 (7th Cir.2005). We thus agree with counsel that it would be frivolous for Boyd to argue that his sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
