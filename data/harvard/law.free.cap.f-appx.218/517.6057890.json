Ortuno pleaded guilty to distributing more than five grams of methamphetamine. <em>See 21 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(B)(viii). The district court sentenced him within the guidelines range to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment and four years\u2019 supervised release. As part of his written plea agreement, Ortuno expressly waived his right to appeal the conviction and sentence \u201cfor any reason,\u201d if the sentence imposed was within the guidelines range. Despite the waiver, however Ortuno filed a <em>pro se </em>notice of appeal. His appointed counsel now moves to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), because he is unable to discern a nonfrivolous basis for the appeal. Counsel\u2019s supporting brief is facially adequate, and Ortuno has not responded to counsel\u2019s motion, <em>see </em>Cir. R. 51(b), so we limit our review of the record to the potential issues counsel has identified. <em>See United States v. Schuh, </em>289 F.3d 968, 973-74 (7th Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-13\">Counsel questions whether Ortuno might attack the validity of the appeal waiver. We have repeatedly held that waivers of appeal are valid and binding, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Mason, </em>343 F.3d 893, 893-94 (7th Cir.2003), and that a waiver of appeal stands or falls with the rest of the plea bargain, <em>see United States v. Whitlow, </em>287 F.3d 638, 640 (7th Cir.2002). Counsel gives no indication that Ortuno wants to have his guilty plea set aside and risk losing the benefits conferred by his plea agreement, and thus we agree with counsel that any challenge to the validity of the appeal waiver would be frivolous. We also agree with counsel that, given the valid appeal waiver, all other arguments would be frivolous as well. <em>See United States v. Lockwood, </em>416 F.3d 604, 607-08 (7th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-14\">Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
