Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1190, 1194 (9th Cir.2004). We review for substantial evidence, <em>Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2006), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">Because Fernandez-Leon did not raise his CAT claim before the BIA, that claim is unexhausted, and this court does not have jurisdiction to consider it. <em>See Morales-Alegria v. Gonzales, </em>449 F.3d 1051, 1059 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">Similarly, this court does not have jurisdiction to consider Fernandez-Leon\u2019s voluntary departure claim. <em>See Oropeza-Wong v. Gonzales, </em>406 F.3d 1135, 1141 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">The IJ\u2019s denial of withholding of removal is supported by substantial evidence because Fernandez-Leon\u2019s claim was based on the mere possibility that he would be the victim of crime upon returning to Mexico, or targeted by the corrupt Mexican government, both of which eventualities are highly speculative. <em>See Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1018 (9th Cir.2003) (declining to credit a speculative future persecution claim). Furthermore, Fernandez-Leon did not demonstrate that he would be targeted on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b628-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
