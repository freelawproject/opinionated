We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>id., </em>and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that petitioner did not establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground. <em>See Sangha v. INS, </em>103 F.3d 1482, 1486 (9th Cir.1997). Petitioner did not testify that he suffered past persecution. Rather, he claimed that he has a fear of future persecution both on account of his Amhara ethnicity and his political opinion opposing the current Ethiopian government.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">The record does not compel the conclusion that petitioner has a well-founded fear of future persecution on either protected ground. <em>See Mgoian v. INS, </em>184 F.3d 1029, 1035 n. 4 (9th Cir.1999) (internal quotation marks omitted) (an applicant may establish a well-founded fear of persecution where he is a member of a \u201cdisfavored group\u201d coupled with a showing that he, in particular, is likely to be targeted as a member of that group); <em>see Suntharal-inkam v. Gonzales, </em>458 F.3d 1034, 1049 (9th Cir.2006) (upholding the IJ\u2019s finding that there was no pattern or practice of persecution); <em>see also Sanchez-Trujillo v. INS, </em>801 F.2d 1571, 1580 (9th Cir.1986) (holding no basis for fear of future persecution where there was no evidence that the government of El Salvador had ever been made aware of petitioner\u2019s political activities in the United States).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Because petitioner did not establish eligibility for asylum, it follows that he did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Alvarez-Santos v. INS, </em>332 F.3d 1245, 1255 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of his claim for protection under CAT because petitioner did not establish that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if returned to Ethiopia. <em>See Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-11\">Petitioner\u2019s remaining due process claims fail because he cannot show prejudice. <em>See Campos-Sanchez v. INS, </em>164 F.3d 448, 450 (9th Cir.1999); <em>see also Hassan v. INS, </em>927 F.2d 465, 469 (9th Cir. 1991) (holding that the factual record alone supported the denial of petitioner\u2019s application, and the IJ\u2019s bias had no bearing on the outcome).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b676-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
