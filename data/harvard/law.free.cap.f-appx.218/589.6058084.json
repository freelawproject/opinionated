We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>Rios contends that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court failed to appropriately consider his history and characteristics under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), and the need to avoid unwarranted disparity in sentencing under \u00a7 3553(a)(6). Upon review, we conclude that the district court properly considered the advisory Guidelines and the \u00a7 3553 factors in imposing the sentence. The record reflects that the district court considered Rios\u2019s history and characteristics, the nature and circumstances of the offense, and Rios\u2019s ties to the United States, and imposed a sentence that was sufficient but no greater than necessary to comply with \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Plouffe, </em>445 F.3d 1126, 1131-32 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2314, 164 L.Ed.2d 832 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">We reject Rios\u2019s contention that disparity between his sentence and fast-track sentences imposed on other defendants in the Southern District of California rendered his sentence unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Marcial-Santiago, </em>447 F.3d 715, 718-19 (9th Cir.2006) (concluding that the disparity between fast-track sentences and non-fast-track sentences is not unwarranted).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b617-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
