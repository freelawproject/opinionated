Jan. 10, 2006). We assume <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen or reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam); <em>Jin Ming Liu v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 109, 111 (2d Cir.2006). An abuse of discretion may be found where the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cprovides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Zhu\u2019s motion. As a preliminary matter, the BIA reasonably construed the motion as one to reconsider and reopen, given that Zhu submitted documentary evidence in addition to raising new arguments in the motion. <em>See Jie Chen, </em>436 F.3d 76, 78-79 &amp; n. 5 (2d cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">Moreover, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in declining to \u201creconsider\u201d the argument \u2014 which, we note, Zhu did not raise in his appeal \u2014 that the IJ improperly excluded evidence and pretermitted his asylum claim. As the BIA noted, the IJ has the authority to set filing deadlines and to reject materials submitted after the deadline. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.31(c). Here, the IJ alerted Zhu early in the proceedings that his asylum claim might be pretermitted if he failed to illustrate a nexus to a protected ground, and granted him a 30-day continuance in which to submit a brief addressing the nexus requirement. When Zhu had neither submitted a brief, nor requested an extension of the deadline, after nearly 60 days, the IJ acted within his discretion in pretermitting the asylum claim. <em>See id.; Sanusi v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 193, 199-200 (2d Cir.2006). Moreover, as the record does not suggest that the IJ denied Zhu a full and fair opportunity to submit the brief or other background evidence, we find no violation of due process. <em>See Morgan v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 549, 552 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">Finally, to the extent Zhu sought to reopen his ease for consideration of the background materials he submitted with his motion \u2014 which, we note, did not include the brief addressing the asylum nexus \u2014 the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying reopening. As the BIA noted, each of the articles submitted with the motion related to torture in China and illegal emigrants, and predated his hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The BIA had already considered and rejected Zhu\u2019s challenges to the IJ\u2019s denial of CAT relief in his appeal, and therefore reasonably found that the evidence was neither material nor previously unavailable. <em>Cf. </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). Zhu has thus failed to demonstrate that the BIA acted arbitrarily or exceeded its authority in denying his motion to reconsider and reopen. <em>See Ke Zhen Zhao, </em>265 F.3d at 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Zhu\u2019s pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b51-8\">. While Zhu claimed in his motion that the IJ prevented him from filing either a brief or the background evidence, the record does not indicate that Zhu attempted to file the articles relevant to his CAT claim before the IJ. Moreover, while he made repeated references to these articles in his brief to the BIA, he did not attach them to the brief, nor explain in his motion why they could not have been submitted with the appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
