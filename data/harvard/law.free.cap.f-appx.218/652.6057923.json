We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion, <em>see Bolshakov v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1279, 1282 (9th Cir.1998), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Singh\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely, where the general country condition articles submitted with the motion pre-dated his initial asylum hearing and failed to demonstrate \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d in India. <em>See Konstantinova v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 528, 530 (9th Cir.1999) (upholding the denial of a motion to reopen where petitioner introduced evidence that was too general in nature to demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1003.2(c)(2)-(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s March 2, 2004 dismissal of Singh\u2019s direct appeal from the immigration judge\u2019s decision because he failed to timely file a petition for review of that order. <em>See Stone v.
