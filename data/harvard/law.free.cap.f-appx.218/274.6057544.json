He pled guilty to malicious wounding by stabbing and by throwing a caustic substance. We previously granted a certificate of appealability on the issue of whether Price\u2019s plea was knowing and voluntary and appointed counsel to represent Price. After formal briefing by the parties, we affirm the district court\u2019s order as to that issue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-17\">Price argues that because his guilty plea hearing was \u201cfraught with confusion\u201d concerning whether he intended to enter an Alford<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> plea or traditional guilty plea, his guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary. Price has no constitutional right to plead guilty, or to require the court to accept an <em>Alford </em>plea. <em>Santobello v. New York, </em>404 U.S. 257, 262, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971); <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. at 38, 91 S.Ct. 160 n. 11. We find any error in accepting Price\u2019s plea as a traditional guilty plea versus an <em>Alford </em>plea was harmless error. Even if Price\u2019s guilty plea were involuntary because he intended to enter an <em>Alford </em>plea, the error would not affect his substantial rights. <em>See Perry v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 410, 533 S.E.2d 651, 652-53 (2000) (holding that <em>Alford </em>pleas are treated the same as a guilty plea and thus \u201cby freely and intelligently entering an <em>Alford </em>plea,\u201d Perry \u201cwaived his right to appeal the issue of whether the evidence was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was guilty of that charge.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>Price, as the Commonwealth contends, has not argued that he intended to plead not guilty, rather that he intended to enter an <em>Alford </em>plea instead of a traditional guilty plea. Price argues on appeal that there was insufficient evidence to sustain his conviction. Under <em>Perry, </em>regardless of whether Price entered an <em>Alford </em>plea or traditional guilty plea, he waived his right to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence. Therefore, even if Price\u2019s traditional guilty plea were involuntary because he intended to enter an <em>Alford </em>plea, the error would be harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s order denying relief on Price\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b303-12\">.
