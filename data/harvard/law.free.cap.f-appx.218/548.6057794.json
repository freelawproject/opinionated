He seeks leave to proceed in for-ma pauperis (IFP) on appeal. We grant Robertson leave to appeal IFP, and we affirm, but on different grounds than those relied on by the district court. <em>See United States v.

Dotson, </em>544 U.S. 74, 81, 125 S.Ct. 1242, 161 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005) (state prisoners may use only habeas remedies when they seek to invalidate duration of confinement, either directly through injunction compelling speedier release or indirectly through judicial determination that necessarily implies unlawfulness of State\u2019s custody); <em>Preiser v.
