He argues that the district court clearly erred in denying him a role adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-27\">We hold that the record does not establish that Illescas, whose role was, at a minimum, to transport 18.41 kilograms of cocaine from Mexico to Dallas, Texas, was \u201cplainly among the least culpable of those involved in the conduct of a group.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 3B1.2, comment, (n.4). He has therefore not shown that the district court clearly erred in denying him a minimal-role adjustment. <em>See United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 n. 9 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 268, 163 L.Ed.2d 241 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-30\">Similarly, Illeseas\u2019s self-proclaimed role as courier was not peripheral to the advancement of the offense. The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>court therefore did not clearly err in denying him an adjustment for a minor role in the offense. <em>See United States v. Miranda, </em>248 F.3d 434, 446-47 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b381-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
