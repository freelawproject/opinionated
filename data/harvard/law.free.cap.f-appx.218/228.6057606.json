Adopting the recommendations in the presentence report, the district court sentenced Davis to a life sentence for Count 1 and a 240-month concurrent sentence for Count 11. At the sentencing hearing, the district court stated that, even if the Federal Sentencing Guidelines were to be found \u201cnonbinding,\u201d it would give Davis an identical alternative sentence. (J.A. 59). The court referenced the 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2006) factors in its criminal judgment. On appeal, Davis alleges he was sentenced in violation of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-26\">Davis alleges that he was sentenced based on facts not found by the jury or admitted by him in violation of <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker. </em>Because Davis timely objected on this basis in the district court, we review his claim for harmless error.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number><em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>433 F.3d 411, 415-16 (4th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Mackins, </em>315 F.3d 399, 405 (4th Cir.2003). We find no harmless error, however, as the district court stated it would have given Davis an identical sentence even if the Sentencing Guidelines were found to be advisory. <em>United States v. Shatley, </em>448 F.3d 264, 267-68 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 310, 166 L.Ed.2d 155 (2006) (holding that in light of district court\u2019s finding that it would impose an identical alternative sentence, any Sixth Amendment <em>Booker </em>error was harmless).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Accordingly, we affirm Davis\u2019 sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b256-17\"> We offer no criticism of the district judge, who followed the law and procedure in effect at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>the time Davis was sentenced.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
