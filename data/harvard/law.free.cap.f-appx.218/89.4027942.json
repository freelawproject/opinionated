He petitions for review of a March 13, 2003 order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (the \u201cBoard\u201d) affirming the March 1, 1999 decision of Immigration Judge Gabriel C. Videla denying his application for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See In re Uwais, Rizvie, </em>Nos A 70 648 863 and A 73 625 916 (BIA Mar. 13, 2003), <em>aff'g </em>Nos A 70 648 863 and A 73 625 916 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Mar. 1, 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-22\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b118-23\">Uwais filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal in 1992, alleging that he had been persecuted on ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>count of his Tamil ethnicity and had a well-founded fear of future persecution for the same reason. He was placed in removal proceedings in 1998, and conceded remova-bility. The co-petitioner, Noor Fiyaza Riz-vie, is his wife. The couple did not know each other in Sri Lanka and their claims are based on different factual events. We address Rizvie\u2019s claim in a separate opinion. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">In 1999, the Immigration Judge found Uwais not credible and, in an oral opinion, denied his application. The primary reason the Immigration Judge gave for the adverse credibility determination related to Uwais\u2019 return to Sri Lanka in 1995 to visit his seriously ill mother. The Immigration Judge found that Uwais\u2019 failure to provide corroborating evidence of his persecution, such as statements, letters, or affidavits, also diminished his credibility. The Immigration Judge also questioned: (1) the decision of Uwais and his wife, Rizvie, to send their 8-month old son to Sri Lanka to meet the child\u2019s grandparents, accompanied only by a male family friend who was also Tamil; (2) the ability of Uwais\u2019 family to remain in Sri Lanka unharmed; and (3) Uwais\u2019 ability to obtain travel documents to enter the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Uwais filed an appeal with the Board.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In a written opinion issued in 2003, the Board affirmed the Immigration Judge\u2019s adverse credibility determination as to Uwais, but for different reasons. First, the Board expressly found that Uwais\u2019 travel to Sri Lanka to visit his sick mother was \u201cnot necessarily incredible.\u201d However, the Board found that Uwais\u2019 delay in traveling from Colombo to Kandy to see his mother once he arrived in Sri Lanka undermined his credibility. Second, the Board agreed with the Immigration Judge\u2019s concern that Uwais had not presented any corroborating evidence of his persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">The Board made no finding about, but simply noted that it was \u201cstruck by\u201d, Uwais\u2019 apparent ability to obtain travel documents through bribes. The Board also implicitly rejected the infant\u2019s travel or Uwais\u2019 family\u2019s relative safety in Sri Lanka as appropriate bases for the adverse credibility finding by rejecting those same reasons when it found Rizvie credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b119-11\">I. <em>Standards of review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b119-12\">\u201cWhen the [Board] issues an opinion, \u2018the opinion becomes the basis for judicial review of the decision of which the alien is complaining.\u2019 \u201d <em>Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Niam v. Ashcroft, </em>354 F.3d 652, 655 (7th Cir.2004)). When the Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>adopts an immigration judge\u2019s adverse credibility determination, but rejects some of the reasoning, we review the immigration judge\u2019s decision as modified by the Board. <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005). Here, the Board adopted the Immigration Judge\u2019s credibility finding, but its detailed opinion rejected most of his reasoning about both Uwais and Rizvie. In fact, the Board expressly adopted only one of the reasons given by the Immigration Judge for finding Uwais not credible: the lack of corroboration. Thus, the Board did more than \u201cmerely supplement\u201d the Immigration Judge\u2019s decision; the Board\u2019s modifications were substantial, requiring us to review the credibility finding of the Board. <em>Yan Chen, </em>417 F.3d at 271.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">On review of a credibility finding, this court generally will not disturb adverse determinations that are based on \u201cspecific examples in the record of inconsistent statements ... about matters material to [an applicant\u2019s] claim of persecution, or on contradictory evidence or inherently improbable testimony regarding such matters.\u201d <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 74 (2d Cir.2004). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 129 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">We review the Board\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see Zhou Yun Zhang, </em>386 F.3d at 73 &amp; n. 7. However, \u201cthe fact that an [Immigration Judge] considers a petitioner not to be credible constitutes the beginning not the end of our inquiry.\u201d <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Aguilera-Cota v. INS, </em>914 F.2d 1375, 1381 (9th Cir.1990)). \u201c[T]he fact that the [Board] has relied primarily on credibility grounds in dismissing an asylum application cannot insulate the decision from review.\u201d <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir.2004). The Board must give \u201cspecific, cogent\u201d reasons for rejecting the petitioner\u2019s testimony. <em>Id. </em>As a matter of law, those reasons must \u201cbear a legitimate nexus\u201d to the finding. \u201cWhen a credibility determination analyzing testimony is based on flawed reasoning, it will not satisfy the substantial evidence standard.\u201d <em>Secaida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">We examine legal questions, and the application of law to fact, <em>de novo. Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 287 (2d Cir.2000). When the agency has failed to apply the law correctly, \u201cwe retain substantial authority to vacate [Board] ... decisions and remand for reconsideration or rehearing.\u201d <em>Ivanishvili v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>433 F.3d 332, 337 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">Where an adverse credibility finding is based on flawed grounds, remand is not required where it could be \u201cconfidently predicted]\u201d that the agency would have reached the same conclusion absent the error-based grounds. <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>434 F.3d 144, 162 (2d Cir.2006). In this case, we cannot confidently predict that the Immigration Judge or the Board would, without the errors which we have identified, reach the same conclusion that we conclude devoid from legal error. Accordingly, we remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">II. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">Neither the Immigration Judge nor the Board identified any inconsistences or contradictory evidence. The Immigration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>Judge indicated that he doubted Uwais\u2019 credibility primarily because Uwais voluntarily returned to Sri Lanka in 1995 to visit his seriously ill mother. The Board rejected this reason. It found that it is not incredible that an asylum applicant would risk persecution to visit a seriously ill parent. We agree. Thus, we affirm the Board\u2019s finding that it was credible that Uwais would travel all the way to Sri Lanka to see his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">However, the Board\u2019s reasoning that it was not credible that he would wait three to four weeks to ensure that his travel to the interior region where he most feared persecution was as safe as possible is neither cogent nor based on substantial evidence. Uwais\u2019 explanation that he went to his mother\u2019s hometown slowly and carefully because that region was the likely site of persecution, has substantial support. In his 1998 supplement to his Asylum Application and in his oral testimony, Uwais presented consistent, repeated, and reasonable testimony about the reasons for his delay. He explained that the conditions were unstable, there were many checkpoints set up at the time, and he wanted to avoid traveling with his Tamil identity card. In fact, the reasons he gave for the delay would tend to support, rather than impugn, his claim of fear of persecution. He also testified about his detention at the train station on return to Colombo, which substantiates the fears he described. The record reveals no evidence to the contrary. Accordingly, there is no substantial record evidence supporting the Board\u2019s further finding that Uwais\u2019 delay in traveling to his mother\u2019s village makes his testimony less credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">The other reason for the adverse credibility finding adopted by the Board was the lack of corroboration. It relied on <em>Diallo </em>to hold that corroboration may be required where it could be reasonably expected. The Second Circuit has held that \u201cthe presence or absence of corroboration may properly be considered in determining credibility.\u201d <em>Diallo, </em>232 F.3d at 287. However, absence of \u201ccorroboration cannot be the only factor taken into account [in determining credibility] because this would effectively require corroboration in all cases, contrary to explicit provisions in the law that applicants may be able to rely exclusively on their testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 287-88; <em>see also Pavlova v. INS, </em>441 F.3d 82, 91 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">Accordingly, the petition for review is GRANTED, the Board\u2019s decision is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this order. Having completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b119-7\">. Uwais\u2019 appeals to the Board and to this Court were briefed together with Rizvie\u2019s appeals, and Uwais did not raise detailed arguments as to why his <em>individual </em>credibility finding should be reversed. However, he stated that the primary issue on appeal was whether he should be found credible. Br. of Petitioners at 4. The errors we identify are related to issues that were exhausted before the Immigration Judge and the Board, and were fully argued to us by the government. At oral argument, Uwais\u2019 counsel elaborated on the reasons why the adverse credibility finding should be reversed. Under all the circumstances of this case, including the lack of prejudice to the government, we have authority to consider them. <em>See Armstrong v. Brookdale Univ. Hosp. &amp; Med. Ctr., </em>425 F.3d 126, 136-37 (2d Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Babwah, </em>972 F.2d 30, 35 (2d Cir.1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
