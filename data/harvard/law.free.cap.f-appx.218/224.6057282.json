Smith was sentenced by the district court to forty-one months\u2019 imprisonment. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-21\">On appeal, Smith contends the district court improperly admitted the recording of a telephone conversation between Smith and another individual over defense objection. We review a district court\u2019s decision regarding the admission or exclusion of evidence for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Lancaster, </em>96 F.3d 734, 744 (4th Cir.1996). Such discretion is abused only when a district court has acted \u201carbitrarily or irrationally.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>27 F.3d 969, 974 (4th Cir.1994) (internal quotation marks omitted). However, evidentiary rulings based on erroneous legal conclusions are \u201cby definition an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Turner, </em>198 F.3d 425, 430 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-22\">Smith argues the Government violated Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(a)(1)(B) as well as an informal discovery agreement by not disclosing his recorded statement well in advance of trial. He asserts the Government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>was \u201ccharged with knowledge\u201d that Smith and James Edward Gainer, the Government\u2019s cooperating witness, conversed over the telephone about matters of interest subsequent to Gainer\u2019s arrest. Smith further asserts that his statement was within the Government\u2019s control \u201cbecause it was digitally recorded by a regional jail that has a long standing history of housing federal inmates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Rule 16(a)(1)(B) requires the Government, upon defendant\u2019s request, to disclose any relevant written or recorded statements made by the defendant that are within the Government\u2019s possession, custody, or control and which the Government knows, or through the exercise of due diligence could know, exist. Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(a)(l)(B)(i). Because the phone conversation between Smith and Gainer occurred while Gainer was in a state facility under state charges, we conclude the district court properly determined that the statements were not in the Government\u2019s \u201cpossession, custody, or control.\u201d Moreover, it is undisputed that once the Government obtained possession of the recorded statements, it provided Smith with a copy thereof in compliance with Rule 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Smith also contends the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). To determine if there was sufficient evidence to support a conviction, we consider whether, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, substantial evidence supports the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). We review both direct and circumstantial evidence, and permit the \u201cgovernment the benefit of all reasonable inferences from the facts proven to those sought to be established.\u201d <em>United States v. Tresvant, </em>677 F.2d 1018, 1021 (4th Cir.1982). Smith argues the evidence was insufficient because the Government\u2019s case rested on the \u201cunreliable\u201d testimony of its cooperating witness, Gainer. Witness credibility, however, is solely within the province of the jury and will not be reassessed on appeal. <em>See United States v. Saunders, </em>886 F.2d 56, 60 (4th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">Accordingly, we affirm Smith\u2019s conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
