He asserts that the district court erred in admitting certain testimony and documents into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>We review evidentiary rulings by the district court for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Ragsdale, </em>426 F.3d 765, 774 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1405, 164 L.Ed.2d 105 (2006), \u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1417, 164 L.Ed.2d 114 (2006). \u201cA trial court abuses its discretion when its ruling is based on an erroneous view of the law or a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). If we find an abuse of discretion, we review the ruling for harmless error and affirm the judgment unless the error affected the substantial rights of the complaining party. <em>Id. </em>at 774-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">Parsons asserts that the district court erred in admitting the testimony of an Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agent because the agent lacked personal knowledge of the facts. Parsons complains that, at the time the agent contacted the firearm manufacturer to determine the weapon\u2019s origin, the agent had no personal knowledge of the firearm\u2019s make, model, or serial number. Parsons argues that the agent merely relied upon another agent\u2019s report for the information.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He also argues that his Sixth Amendment right to <em>confront </em>the witnesses against him was violated because he did not have an opportunity to cross examine the other agent about the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">Rule 602 of the Federal Rules of Evidence prohibits a witness from testifying \u201cunless evidence is introduced sufficient to support a finding that the witness has personal knowledge of the matter.\u201d Fed. R.Evid. 602. Parsons has not shown that the agent lacked the proper knowledge to testify about the firearm. The agent\u2019s lack of personal knowledge of the weapon\u2019s manufacturer, model, and serial number during the pre-trial investigation was cured when the prosecutor handed him the firearm during his testimony, giving him the opportunity to confirm its manufacturer and serial number as he testified. <em>See United States v. Quezada, </em>754 F.2d 1190, 1195 (5th Cir.1985) (\u201c[E]ven if testimony is based in part on inadmissible hearsay, Rule 602 will be satisfied if evidence is introduced sufficient to support a finding that [the witness] has personal knowledge of the matter.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted). Because the agent\u2019s trial testimony was given with personal knowledge of the firearm\u2019s manufacturer, model, and serial number, Parsons\u2019s Confrontation Clause argument is also meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-12\">Parsons also renews his objection to the admission of the two documents that the prosecutor obtained from the Probation Office without leave from the district court. He asserts that the disclosure of the documents violated his right to privacy. Assuming arguendo that the district court abused its discretion in allowing the documents into evidence, the error was harmless. As counsel for Parsons conceded in the district court, the information in the documents is contained in the public record of Parsons\u2019s prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-13\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b376-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b377-10\">. Parsons does not argue that the manufacturer's statement about the firearm\u2019s Wyoming origin was inadmissible.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
