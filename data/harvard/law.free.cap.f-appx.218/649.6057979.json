Legal determinations regarding a petitioner\u2019s eligibility for cancellation of removal are reviewed de novo. <em>See Montero-Martinez v. Ashcroft, </em>277 F.3d 1137, 1145 (9th Cir.2002). We grant the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-14\">The IJ determined that Patel was statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal because Patel was convicted of a controlled substance offense before Patel acquired seven years of continuous physical presence. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a)(2). Patel argues that any lawful status accrued by his mother can be imputed to him, and this additional time would allow him to satisfy the seven-year continuous residence requirement. We agree and remand in order for him to present evidence on the issue. <em>See Cuevas-Gaspar v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 1013, 1029 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201cfor purposes of satisfying the seven-years of continuous residence \u2018after having been admitted in any status\u2019 required for cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a), a parent\u2019s admission for permanent resident status is imputed to the parent\u2019s unemancipated minor children residing with the parent\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-15\">Because this court issued its decision in <em>Cuevas-Gaspar </em>two months after the BIA issued its order in Patel\u2019s case, Patel was not required to raise this argument before the BIA. <em>See Alcaraz v. INS, </em>384 F.3d 1150, 1159 (9th Cir.2004) (holding that pe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>titioners\u2019 argument was not foreclosed for failing to exhaust their administrative remedies because the relevant regulations were issued after they were required to submit their brief to the BIA). Furthermore, the prudential exhaustion requirement does not apply to Patel\u2019s case because filing a motion to reconsider with BIA at this point would be untimely, and therefore, futile. <em>Id. </em>at 1160.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">The court need not address the additional arguments raised by Patel for the first time in his reply brief. <em>See Cuevas-Gas-par, </em>430 F.3d at 1021 n. 4 (issues not raised in the opening brief are deemed waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b678-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
