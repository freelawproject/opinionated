Gutierrez-Aspeitia also pleaded guilty to one count of using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime and possessing the firearm in furtherance of the drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(c) (West Supp.2006). In their plea agreements, the appellants stipulated that the amount of cocaine that was known to or reasonably foreseeable by them was in excess of five kilograms, and that a base offense level of thirty-two under the Sentencing Guidelines<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> applied to the conspiracy charge. After a reduction for acceptance of responsibility, appellants\u2019 total offense level on the conspiracy charge was twenty-nine. Lopez-Juarez\u2019s prior criminal activity placed him in criminal history category II, which resulted in a sentencing range of 120 to 121 months. Gutierrez-Aspeitia was in criminal history category I, with a sentencing range of 120 months on the drug conspiracy and a consecutive sixty months on the firearm charge.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Before sentencing, the Government moved for a departure from the statutory minimum sentence in Gutierrez-Aspeitia\u2019s case, which the district court granted. The court sentenced Lopez-Juarez to 120 months of imprisonment, and sentenced Gutierrez-Aspeitia to a total of 144 months after departing from the statutory minimum of 180 months. Appellants timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">On appeal, counsel filed an Anders<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> brief, in which they state there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but question whether the district court complied with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 in accepting the appellants\u2019 guilty pleas, and whether the sentences imposed were unreasonable or otherwise in violation of law. Appellants were advised of their right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but have not filed a brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">Appellants did not move in the district court to withdraw their guilty pleas, therefore this court reviews their challenge to the adequacy of the Rule 11 hearing for plain error. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.2002). Prior to accepting a guilty plea, the trial court must ensure the defendant understands the nature of the charges against him, the mandatory minimum and maximum sentences, and other various rights, so it is clear that the defendant is knowingly and voluntarily entering his plea. The court must also determine whether there is a factual basis for the plea. Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(b)(1), (3); <em>United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 116, 120 (4th Cir. 1991). Counsel do not specify any deficiencies in the magistrate judges\u2019 Rule 11 inquiries, and our review of the plea hearing transcripts reveals that the magistrate judges conducted a thorough Rule 11 colloquy that assured appellants\u2019 pleas were made both knowingly and voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-11\">We review a district court\u2019s sentence for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir. 2005). \u201cConsistent with the remedial scheme set forth in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a district court shall first calculate (after making the appropriate findings of fact) the range prescribed by the guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546. Counsel do not assert that the district court erred in determining the applicable Guideline range, and appellants\u2019 offense level was determined based on the stipulation in the plea agreement. Next, the district court must consider the Guideline range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the Guidelines and \u00a7 3553(a), and impose a sentence. \u201cA sentence within the proper advisory Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341-42 (4th Cir.2006). If a court imposes a sentence outside the Guideline range, the court must state its reasons for doing so. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. The sentence must be \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546-47 (citations omitted). In this case, appellants\u2019 sentences were governed by statutory minimums. Lopez-Juarez was sentenced to the statutory minimum term of imprisonment, and Gutierrez-Aspeitia received relief from the statutory minimums as a result of his substantial assistance to the government. We conclude that appellants\u2019 sentences are reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm appellants\u2019 convictions and sentences. This court requires that counsel inform appellants, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If either appellant requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b293-6\">. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(USSG) (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b293-7\">.
