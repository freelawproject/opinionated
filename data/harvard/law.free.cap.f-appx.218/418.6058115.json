The BIA affirmed the denial of relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">As with many individuals who come before us seeking permanent residency in the United States, we are sympathetic to the situation of the Krivonos family and their desire to make a new life in this country. Accordingly, we have reviewed the briefs of the parties and the administrative record below with great care. We conclude that petitioners have not made the requisite showing to justify relief on any of the theories that they have advanced. Because the reasons for our decision were adequately articulated by the immigration judge in his oral decision dated August 25, 2004, and by the BIA in its January 18, 2006 order adopting and affirming that decision, a detailed opinion by this court would serve no useful purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">The decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b447-8\">. On appeal, petitioners do not challenge the immigration judge\u2019s denial of their request for voluntary withholding of removal under \u00a7 241(b)(3) of the INA and for withholding under the U.N. Convention Against Torture (8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b447-26\">. The immigration judge focused exclusively upon the claims advanced by Mrs. Krivonos because she alone contends that she suffered persecution based upon political activity. Her husband and daughter\u2019s applications are derivative of her claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
