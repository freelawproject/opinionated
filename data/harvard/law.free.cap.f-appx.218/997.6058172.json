The district court dismissed without prejudice to Manning refiling complaints that clearly state the cognizable causes of action against each particular defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-31\">Manning filed various documents with the district court. On May 3, 2006, the district court entered an order stating that Manning had not revised his complaint and dismissed his case with prejudice.
