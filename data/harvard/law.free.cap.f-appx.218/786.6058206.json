Davis argues that his sentence was not reasoned or reasonable because it exceeded the recommended guideline range and the district court did not adequately explain its reasoning for the sentence. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-15\">A jury found Davis guilty of Conspiracy to Commit Credit Union Robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (\u201cCount I\u201d), Entering a Federally Insured Credit Union With Intent to Commit Armed Robbery and Aiding and Abetting in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) and (d) (\u201cCount II\u201d), and Use of a Firearm During Commission of a Crime of Violence in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1) (\u201cCount III\u201d). Davis was sentenced to 156 months\u2019 imprisonment to be followed by sixty months of supervised release. On September 26, 2005, a petition to revoke Davis\u2019 supervised release was filed alleging several rule violations including, failure to submit required urinalysis specimens (five times) and testing positive for illegal drugs (seven times), frequenting a place where controlled substances are sold, criminal association, and failure to maintain lawful employment. Each of these violations was a Grade C violation. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.1q(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-16\">At his sentencing hearing, Davis admitted to these violations and asked for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>twenty-four month sentence, arguing that his co-defendant in the matter had received a thirty-six month sentence for violations of supervised release, which had included the more serious violation of commission of a crime. The district court revoked Davis\u2019 supervised release and sentenced him to sixty months\u2019 imprisonment to be followed by thirty-six months of supervised release.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Noting that it had considered Chapter 7 of the United States Sentencing Guideline policy statements, the court stated that it imposed its sentence</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-4\">to protect the community, promote respect for the law, and provide just punishment for the violations. The sentence is based upon the serious nature of the violations, including the defendant\u2019s continued association with those engaged in criminal activity, his failure to maintain gainful employment, his use of illegal substances, and the Court also has taken into account [the fact that] the defendant absconded from the term of supervised release and did not report to the Probation Office for a period of seven months leading up to the arrest of April 20th of 2006. Record on Appeal (\u201cROA\u201d), Vol. Ill at 6-7.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">On appeal, Davis argues that his sentence is not reasoned or reasonable because it exceeded the recommended guideline range and the district court failed to articulate, other than referencing the sentencing guidelines, its reasoning for imposing such a severe sentence. \u201cUnder 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3), when a person violates a condition of his or her supervised release, the district court may revoke the term of supervised release and impose prison time.\u201d <em>United States v. Kelley, </em>359 F.3d 1302, 1304 (10th Cir.2004). \u201cBecause there is no applicable sentencing guideline for the sentence to be imposed after a violation of supervised release, our standard of review is \u2018plainly unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. A </em>sentence imposed in excess of that recommended by Chapter 7 of the United States Sentencing Guideline policy statements will be upheld \u201cif it can be determined from the record to have been reasoned and reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Quintanilla, </em>442 F.3d 1254, 1258 (10th Cir.2006). This analysis requires us to \u201creview the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its legal interpretations of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo.\u201d <em>Kelley, </em>359 F.3d at 1304.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">\u201cIn imposing a sentence following revocation of supervised release, a district court is required to consider both Chapter 7\u2019s policy statements, as well as a number <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>of other factors provided in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Cordova II, </em>461 F.3d 1184, 1188 (10th Cir.2006) (internal citations omitted); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3583(e) and 3584(b). \u201cThe sentencing court, however, \u2018is not required to consider individually each factor listed in \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019 nor is it required to \u2018recite any magic words to show us that it fulfilled its responsibility to be mindful of the factors that Congress has instructed it to consider\u2019 before issuing a sentence.\u201d <em>Cordova, </em>461 F.3d at 1189 (citations omitted). Finally, a sentencing court does not need to make specific findings for each factor, but must state the reasons for its actions. <em>United States v. Lee, </em>957 F.2d 770, 774-75 (10th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">The court expressly stated that it had considered the Chapter 7 policy statements in determining Davis\u2019 sentence, noted that these statements are merely advisory, and then explained its rationale for imposing a sentence outside the guideline range. In addition, the record reveals that the district court adequately considered the relevant \u00a7 3553 sentencing factors. The court considered the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant in noting \u201cthe serious nature of the violations, including the defendant\u2019s continued association with those engaged in criminal activity, his failure to maintain gainful employment, his use of illegal substances\u201d and his failure to report to the probation office for seven months. ROA, Vol. Ill at 6-7; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). The court also explained that it imposed its sentence \u201cto protect the community, promote respect for the law, and provide just punishment for the violations.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B) and (C) (requiring sentencing court to consider the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence and protect the public from further crimes of the defendant). Finally, the district court had discretion to impose consecutive sentences. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) (requiring sentencing court to consider the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, and provide just punishment for the offense). Because the record reveals the district court considered the appropriate factors in sentencing Davis and his sentence did not exceed the statutory maximum, we conclude that his sentence was reasoned and reasonable under the circumstances of his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>Based on the foregoing, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b815-11\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b816-6\">. The district court calculated this sentence by imposing twenty-four months for Count I, thirty-six months for Count II, and zero months for Count III. These sentences would run consecutively and were to be followed by thirty-six months of supervised release. Based on these Grade C violations and Davis\u2019 Criminal History Category of I, the sentencing guidelines recommended an advisory range of three to nine (3-9) months\u2019 imprisonment per count. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">The maximum sentence the district court could have imposed was eighty-four months (seven years). Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3), the maximum custody term that can be imposed upon revocation of supervised release resulting from a Class B conviction (Count II) is thirty-six months. The maximum custody term that can be imposed upon revocation of supervised release resulting from a class D conviction (Counts I and III) is twenty-four months. Multiple custody terms imposed after revocation of supervised release may run concurrently or consecutively. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a). If the district court had imposed the maximum term for each count and ordered those counts to run consecutively, this would have resulted in a maximum sentence of eighty-four months. The district court\u2019s sentence of sixty months is well below that maximum sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b817-6\">.
