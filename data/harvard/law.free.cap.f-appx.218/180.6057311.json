Because we conclude that Wise\u2019s appeal presents no substantial question, we will summarily affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-22\">Wise filed his complaint against the Defendants pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Wise\u2019s claims arose from a state court order issued by Judge Carrafiello which ordered Wise to vacate a parcel of real property. On appeal to the Pennsylvania Superior Court, Judges Del Sole, Gantman and Olszewski affirmed. Wise claimed that the Defendants deprived him of his constitutional rights through these orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-23\">After granting Wise\u2019s motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis, </em>the District Court dismissed the complaint based on a lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. Additionally, the District Court determined that the Defendants were immune from suit and dismissed the complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(n). Wise timely filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-24\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-25\">We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review of the District Court\u2019s dismissal under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine and dismissal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) is plenary. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number><em>Turner v. Crawford Square Apartments III, L.P., </em>449 F.3d 542, 547 (3d Cir.2006)(stating standard of review over District Court\u2019s application of the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine); <em>see also Tourscher v. McCullough, </em>184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir.1999)(stating standard of review over \u00a7 1915(e)(2) dismissal).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine deprives a District Court of jurisdiction in some circumstances to review a state court adjudication. <em>See Turner, </em>449 F.3d at 547. In <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Industries Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005), the United States Supreme Court emphasized the narrow scope of the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. It held that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine is confined to \u201ccases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court <em>judgments </em>rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those <em>judgments.\u201d See id. </em>at 284, 125 S.Ct. 1517 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">The majority of Wise\u2019s claims against the Defendants were purportedly caused when the state courts ordered Wise to vacate the parcel of real property. Wise\u2019s complaint sought review and rejection of the state court judgments. Therefore, these claims fall under the purview of the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine and are barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">Additionally, to the extent that Wise\u2019s complaint included claims that were not caused by the state court judgments, such claims are barred by judicial immunity. \u201cLike other forms of official immunity, judicial immunity is an immunity from suit, not just from ultimate assessment of damages.\u201d Mir<em>eles v. Waco, </em>502 U.S. 9, 11, 112 S.Ct. 286, 116 L.Ed.2d 9 (1991) (citation omitted). A judge is not immune from liability for non-judicial acts. <em>See id. </em>Additionally, \u201ca judge will not be deprived of immunity because the action he took was in error, was done maliciously, or was in excess of authority; rather, he will be subject to liability ... when he has acted in the clear absence of all jurisdiction.\u201d <em>See Stump v. Sparkman, </em>435 U.S. 349, 356-57, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978)(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Wise\u2019s complaint did not set forth any facts illustrating that the Defendants\u2019 actions were non-judicial or were made in the clear absence of their jurisdiction. Thus, judicial immunity bars suit on any of Wise\u2019s claims over which the District Court had jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-11\">In conclusion, the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine bars the majority of Wise\u2019s claims. Additionally, to the extent that Wise\u2019s claims were not caused by the state court judgments, these claims are barred by judicial immunity. Therefore, we will summarily affirm the District Court order. Wise\u2019s motion for summary action is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
