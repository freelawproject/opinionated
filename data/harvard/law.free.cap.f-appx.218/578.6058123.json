We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-21\">Storm contends that a statement he made implicating himself in his wife\u2019s murder was inadmissible because he invoked his right to counsel during a prior interrogation and the police therefore were barred from recontacting him later for questioning. We conclude that it was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States, for the California Supreme Court to determine that a break in custody exception to the no-recontact rule applied here. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>see also McNeil v. Wisconsin, </em>501 U.S. 171, 176-77, 111 S.Ct. 2204, 115 L.Ed.2d 158 (1991) (explaining that statements resulting from police-initiated contact following a suspect\u2019s invocation of the Fifth Amendment right to counsel are presumed involuntary \u201cassuming there has been no break in custody\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>Storm also contends that the statement at issue was inadmissible because it was the tainted product of the prior interrogation officers conducted in violation of his Fifth Amendment right to counsel. We conclude that the California Supreme Court\u2019s rejection of this contention was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>see also Oregon v.
