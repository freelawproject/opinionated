KATZMANN, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b103-20\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b103-21\">Defendants-Appellants Jin Kyoo Park and Myung Woo Jun appeal from a judgment of conviction entered in the District Court following a jury trial in which they were found guilty of alien smuggling in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii) and 1324(a)(2)(B)(iii). The District Court imposed, <em>inter alia, </em>sentences of sixteen months\u2019 imprisonment on defendant Park and ten months\u2019 imprisonment on defendant Jun. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and the procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-22\">On appeal, defendants argue that the District Court erred in (1) denying defendants\u2019 motion to exclude statements to Border Patrol agents based on the District Court\u2019s conclusion that defendants voluntarily waived their <em>Miranda </em>rights; and (2) denying defendants\u2019 motion for a judgment of acquittal under Fed.R.Crim.P. 29 based on the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the government need not prove the identities of the aliens smuggled by each defendant. In addition, defendant Jun argues that the District Court erred by considering conduct of which he was acquitted when imposing his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-23\">Each of defendants\u2019 claims is without merit. First, notwithstanding the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>that defendants did not sign the waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights presented to them during questioning, the District Court properly-found based on the facts presented that (1) defendants understood their rights when they were read aloud and translated into Korean; and (2) defendants\u2019 subsequent statements to Border Patrol agents were made voluntarily. <em>See North Carolina v. Butler, </em>441 U.S. 369, 373-76, 99 S.Ct. 1755, 60 L.Ed.2d 286 (1979) (holding that, in some cases, \u201cwaiver can be clearly inferred from the actions and words of the [defendant]\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Scarpa, </em>897 F.2d 63, 68 (2d Cir.1990) (even absent express statement of waiver, defendant\u2019s \u201crelaxed and friendly\u201d conversations contributed to a finding of waiver). Accordingly, the District Court\u2019s decision not to exclude defendants\u2019 statements was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">Second, the District Court did not err in rejecting defendants\u2019 argument that the government must prove which of the eight aliens were smuggled by defendant Park and which were smuggled by defendant Jun. In particular, no constructive amendment of the indictment exists when, as here, the government\u2019s failure to prove the identities of the aliens smuggled by each defendant did not alter \u201can essential element of the charge,\u201d <em>United States v. Milstein, </em>401 F.3d 53, 65 (2d Cir.2005), and where the District Court\u2019s jury instruction that no such proof was necessary constituted, at most, a harmless variance from the allegations set forth in the indictment, <em>see United States v. Ford, </em>435 F.3d 204, 216 (2d Cir.2006) (applying harmless error analysis to variances from the facts alleged in the indictment).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Finally, defendant Jun\u2019s argument that the District Court erred by considering conduct of which he was acquitted when imposing his sentence is without merit. We have held, after <em>Booker, </em>that district courts may consider acquitted conduct as a factor in sentencing, <em>see United States v. Vaughn, </em>430 F.3d 518, 526-27 (2d Cir.2005), and Jun presents no persuasive argument that the District Court erred in considering such conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Accordingly, we hereby AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
