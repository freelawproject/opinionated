Nelson denying Huang\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Huo Jian Huang, </em>No. A 97 660 605 (B.I.A. June 23, 2006), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 97 660 605 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Mar. 21, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">When the BIA agrees with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that a petitioner is not credible and, without rejecting any of the IJ\u2019s grounds for decision, emphasizes particular aspects of that decision, this Court reviews both the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s opinions-\u2014 or more precisely, the Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision including the portions not explicitly discussed by the BIA. <em>Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Substantial evidence supports material portions of the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determinations. The IJ accurately observed an inconsistency between Huang\u2019s testimony that his wife had two abortions and his wife\u2019s statement that she had three abortions. Likewise, the IJ accurately noted that Huang\u2019s testimony that his wife had an IUD inserted in 1991\u2014 after which she was not required to have further IUDs \u2014 -was inconsistent with her statement that she had an IUD inserted in 1994. Further, the IJ accurately observed that Huang omitted any mention of his wife\u2019s abortions from his airport statement. The IJ reasonably rejected Huang\u2019s explanations for these discrepancies: that the preparer of his wife\u2019s asylum application made a mistake; that his wife remembered incorrectly because she was not educated; and that he had been nervous during the airport interview. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005) (emphasizing that the agency need not credit an applicant\u2019s explanations for inconsistent testimony unless those explanations would compel a reasonable fact-finder to do so). Moreover, the IJ was entitled to rely on Huang\u2019s airport statement, which appears reliable under the standards set forth in <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 179-80 (2004) (providing factors that the Court generally considers to ensure that an airport interview represents a \u201csufficiently accurate record\u201d of the applicant\u2019s statements to merit consideration in determining whether the applicant is credible). Because the above discrepancies involved the crux of Huang\u2019s claim that he suffered past persecution under China\u2019s coercive family planning policy, they, along with other less central inconsistencies, substantiated the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. <em>See Secai-da-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 308 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">Moreover, the IJ properly found that the absence of corroboration left Huang unable to rehabilitate testimony that had already been called into question. <em>See Zhou Yun Zhang, </em>386 F.3d at 78. Even if the IJ did not address other relevant documents submitted by Huang, she was not required to address specifically each piece of evidence when she gave \u201creasoned consideration to the petition, and made adequate findings.\u201d <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 337 n. 17 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>Although the IJ\u2019s decision was not without error, remand would be futile here because the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by non-erroneous findings and we can confidently predict that those non-erroneous findings would lead the IJ to reach the same decision were the case remanded. <em>See id. </em>at 338-39. Because the only evidence of a threat to Huang\u2019s life or freedom depended upon his credibility, the adverse credibility determination in this case necessarily precludes success on the claim for withholding of removal. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006). Accordingly, we deny the petition for review as to Huang\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Finally, we lack jurisdiction to review the denial of Huang\u2019s CAT claim or his due process argument because such claims were not exhausted at the administrative level. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>see generally Gill v. INS, </em>420 F.3d 82, 86 (2d Cir.2005) (explaining that, in the absence of manifest injustice, petitioners must administratively exhaust the categories of relief they are claiming and the individual issues on which that relief may turn, but not subsidiary legal arguments).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED, in part, and DISMISSED, in part. The previously granted stay of removal is VACATED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
