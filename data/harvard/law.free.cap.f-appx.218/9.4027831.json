We presume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, the procedural history, and the scope of the issues presented on appeal, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">To overturn his conviction on ineffective assistance grounds, appellant must demonstrate that his attorney\u2019s performance \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness\u201d under the \u201cprevailing professional norms.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). If this showing is made, appellant must also prove that there is a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that absent counsel\u2019s error, the outcome of the proceeding would have been different. <em>Id. </em>at 692, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052; <em>see also Mayo v. Henderson, </em>13 F.3d 528, 533 (2d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">It is usually desirable that a claim for ineffective assistance be made \u201cin the first instance to the district court,\u201d and we generally decline to hear such a claim on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Matos, </em>905 F.2d 30, 32 (2d Cir.1990). We instead either permit the appellant to raise the issue collaterally, e.g., as part of a subsequent \u00a7 2255 petition, or remand to the district court for necessary fact-finding. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Leone, </em>215 F.3d 253, 256 (2d Cir.2000). Nevertheless, we may decide such a claim on direct appeal when the alleged ground of ineffectiveness is sufficiently developed in the trial record. <em>See, e.g., United States v. De La Pava, </em>268 F.3d 157, 163 (2d Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Pena, </em>233 F.3d 170, 174 (2d Cir.2000) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-12\">In this case, every specific instance of allegedly inadequate representation by counsel is readily explainable in tactical or strategic terms. It is well-established that actions or omissions by counsel that \u201cmight be considered sound trial strategy\u201d do not constitute ineffective assistance. <em>Michel v. Louisiana, </em>350 U.S. 91, 101, 76 S.Ct. 158, 100 L.Ed. 83 (1955); <em>Mason v. Scully, </em>16 F.3d 38, 42 (2d Cir.1994). Accordingly, Jefferies\u2019s appeal fails to satisfy the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test for ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">Appellant\u2019s conviction is, therefore, AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
