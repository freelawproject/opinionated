Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993), found that the methodology used by appellant\u2019s expert witness, Dr. Sims, was not sufficiently reliable to support Sims\u2019s opinion that a causal relationship existed between the decedent\u2019s use of Metoclopram-ide and the decedent\u2019s depression and eventual suicide. Having made that finding, the court excluded Dr. Sims\u2019s opinion and granted appellee summary judgment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">This appeal turns on one issue: whether the district court abused its discretion in excluding Dr. Sims\u2019s opinion on the ground that her methodology was unreliable. After examining the record on which the court made its finding, we conclude that the court\u2019s exclusion of the proffered opinion was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
