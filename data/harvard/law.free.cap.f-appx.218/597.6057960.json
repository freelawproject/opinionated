We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Where, as here, the BIA affirms without an opinion, we review directly the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 849 (9th Cir.2003). We review for substantial evidence and may reverse only if the evidence compels such a result. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacari-as, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-22\">Petitioners contend that the BIA violated due process because it summarily affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision. This contention is unpersuasive. <em>See Falcon Carriche, </em>350 F.3d at 849-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-23\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that petitioners failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution based on an enumerated ground. <em>See Rostomian v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 1088, 1089 (9th Cir.2000) (concluding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>that petitioners had failed to demonstrate past persecution because the violence they endured was a random act during an unstable time in Armenia, and had failed to demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution because petitioners only showed that general animosity and hostility still existed in Armenia).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Because petitioners did not establish eligibility for asylum, it follows that they did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Substantial evidence supports the denial of CAT relief because petitioners did not establish that it is more likely than not that they will be tortured if returned to Armenia. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b626-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
