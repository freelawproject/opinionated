Adrain appeals from a judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas in favor of Su-perchips, Inc. and various other defendants (collectively \u201cSuperchips\u201d) in his suit alleging infringement of United States Patent No. 5,523,948 (\u201cthe '948 patent\u201d). <em>Adrain v. Superchips, Inc., </em>No. H-04-4117, 2006 WL 734423 (S.D.Tx. March 14, 2006). The district court correctly construed claims 1 and 5 to require the device to remain installed in a vehicle, such that the accused products do not infringe. With respect to claim 19, we hold that claim 19 was anticipated by United States Patent No. 5,278,759 (\u201cBerra\u201d). We therefore <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1011-23\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-24\">The '948 patent was the subject of a prior appeal before this court. See <em>Adrain v. Hypertech, Inc., </em>70 Fed.Appx. 557 (Fed.Cir.2003) <em>(\u201cHypertech </em>\u201d). Asserted claims 1, 5 and 19 were reproduced in that opinion, <em>id. </em>at 558-59, and will not be repeated here.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1011-25\">Briefly, the '948 patent is directed to an apparatus and method for modifying an engine control module (\u201cECM\u201d) in an automobile. An ECM is an onboard computer that controls a variety of engine functions. ECMs can be customized to enhance engine performance or reconfigured so the engine operates differently than originally intended by the vehicle manufacturer. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>For example, as described in the specification, an ECM can be reprogrammed so an engine designed to burn gasoline or diesel will also run on alternative fuels. <em>See </em>'948 patent, col.l 1.60-eol.2 1.3, eol.6 11.14-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">On October 22, 2004, Mr. Adrain filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas against Su-perchips. After the parties filed their claim construction briefs, a court-appointed special master filed his recommendations on December 16, 2005; various objections were filed. A <em>Markman </em>hearing was held on February 8, 2006. The district court subsequently issued an order (1) construing the disputed claims; (2) granting summary judgment of non-infringement as to claims 1 and 5; and (3) granting summary judgment of invalidity as to claim 19. <em>Adrain v. Superchips, Inc., </em>2006 WL 734423, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25212 (S.D.Tx. March 14, 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">Judgment was entered accordingly, and a timely appeal followed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AVY\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-7\">Mr. Adrain first argues that summary judgment of non-infringement with respect to the apparatus claims was improperly granted because the court erred in its claim construction. We review a district court\u2019s claim construction without deference. <em>Cybor Corp. v. FAS Techs., Inc., </em>138 F.3d 1448, 1454-56 (Fed.Cir.1998) (en banc). In construing disputed claim terms, we determine the customary meaning as understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art according to the methodology described in <em>Phillips v. AWH Corp., </em>415 F.3d 1303, 1312-19 (Fed.Cir.2005) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-8\">Although multiple claim terms were disputed, Mr. Adrain only seeks appellate review of one of them. Specifically, he contends that the district court erred in construing the preamble phrase \u201c[a]n improvement in a vehicle\u201d in claim 1 to require that the module remain part of the vehicle once attached. <em>Adrain, </em>at *4, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25212 at *11-12. We reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-10\">The prosecution history of an earlier patent in the same family \u201capplies with equal force to subsequently issued patents that contain the same claim limitation.\u201d <em>Elkay Mfg. Co. v. Ebco Mfg. Co., </em>192 F.3d 973, 980 (Fed.Cir.1999). Here, the '948 patent is a continuation-in-part of United States Patent No. 5,446,655, which is a continuation of United States Patent No. 5,293,317, which is itself a continuation of United States Patent No. 5,200,900 (\u201cthe '900 patent\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-11\">Most relevant to this appeal, the district court pointed to the prosecution history of the '900 patent. Although the original claims of that application referred to \u201can improvement in an apparatus,\u201d they were amended to read \u201can improvement in a vehicle.\u201d The examiner had cited United States Patent No. 4,502,324 (\u201cMarino\u201d) as prior art, but the patentee argued that claim 1, as amended, was not anticipated because \u201cMarino is not an improvement in a vehicle, but a stationary piece of shop equipment.\u201d Indeed, this court has previously observed that this statement \u201csuggests that the phrase \u2018an improvement in a vehicle,\u2019 which was carried through to claim 1 in the '948 patent, may require the invention to be incorporated within or retrofitted to the vehicle.\u201d <em>Hypertech, </em>70 Fed.Appx. at 561. Because the argument was not raised in that appeal, however, the panel declined to address it. <em>Id. </em>Now that the issue is squarely before us, we do not hesitate to affirm the district court\u2019s construction of \u201can improvement in a vehicle\u201d to mean \u201ca module that becomes part of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>vehicle and is intended to remain part of the vehicle during use.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">Based on this interpretation, the district court granted summary judgment of non-infringement as to claims 1 and 5. We review this decision de novo, reapplying the same standard used by the district court. <em>See, e.g., Cook Biotech, Inc. v. Acell, Inc., </em>460 F.3d 1365, 1372 (Fed.Cir. 2006). Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">The accused products are handheld devices used to reprogram ECMs; after-wards, these devices are disconnected from the vehicle. To survive a summary judgment motion, the non-movant \u201cmust set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e); <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 250, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). As Mr. Adrain presented nothing to rebut Superchips\u2019 evidence that the accused products do not remain part of the vehicles that they reprogram, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment of non-infringement with respect to the apparatus claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-8\">With respect to the method claim, Mr. Adrain argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment of invalidity. The \u201cselectively controlling\u201d clause<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of claim 19 was construed to mean \u201cmaking a decision to switch control of the engine from the programmed mode provided in the originally provided memory to the additional programmed mode provided by the adapter module, with the adapter module remaining coupled to the bus such that control of the engine can be switched back and forth between the originally provided programmed mode and the additional programmed mode.\u201d <em>Adrain, </em>at <em>*7, </em>2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25212 at *20. Yet, the court clarified that this interpretation \u201cdoes not require that the device permit switching between modes while the vehicle is in operation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *7, at n. 2. In finding claim 19 anticipated by Berra, the court rejected Mr. Adrain\u2019s argument that Berra did not disclose retaining the vehicle\u2019s originally provided memory during and after reprogramming of the ECM. <em>Id. </em>at *9-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-12\">We generally agree with the district court\u2019s claim construction. Claim 19 does not recite the \u201cimprovement in a vehicle\u201d limitation of the apparatus claims. As such, the claimed method does not require that the adapter module remain attached to the vehicle. Moreover, the language of claim 19 makes no reference to switching back and forth between the originally provided programmed mode and the additional programmed mode during vehicle operation. Nor does claim 19 require the further step of storing the original configuration elsewhere in an additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>memory, as Mr. Adrain argues. It merely requires that the adapter module provide at least one additional programmed mode not originally included in the ECM.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">As construed, claim 19 is anticipated by Berra, which discloses a method of reprogramming an ECM with an off-board controller. We reject Mr. Adrain\u2019s argument that Berra does not disclose retaining or otherwise storing the original program so that it can be restored later. The district court correctly interpreted Berra as disclosing a method wherein the original program code is \u201cpreferably erased,\u201d <em>see </em>col.4 1.62, (but not necessarily erased) when the ECM is reprogrammed. Indeed, as the district court noted, the \u201cSummary of the Invention\u201d section of the Berra specification states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1014-5\">In one form of the present invention, the reprogramming method follows a predetermined transfer protocol which assists in <em>preventing the existing computer program code stored in the non-volatile memory from being improperly erased or re-vnitten.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1014-6\">Col.4 11.2-29 (emphasis added). By disclosing the ability to preserve the original code, Berra inherently discloses the ability return to the original code at a later point. Furthermore, dependent claims 11 and 15 refer to erasure of \u201cat least a portion\u201d or \u201csubstantially the entire contents\u201d of the existing memory, but the broadest method <em>claim </em>\u2014 i.e., independent claim 10 \u2014 merely requires storing the new computer program code. In other words, claim 10 is sufficiently broad to disclose a method wherein the original program code is left intact alongside the new code. As such, summary judgment of invalidity was properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-7\">Having reached this conclusion, we need not and do not decide whether the accused products infringe claim 19. We affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1011-18\">. Independent claim 1 and dependent claim 5 are apparatus claims, while claim 19 is a method claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1013-9\">. Although Mr. Adrain argues that the module need not be \"permanently\u201d attached because the patent expressly contemplates the ability to restore the ECM to its original configuration, <em>see </em>'948 patent, col.6,11.8-10, the district court acknowledged that \"the patented invention may, like any other automobile part, be removed after installation.\u201d <em>Adrain, </em>at *4, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25212 at *12. In other words, the module can be uninstalled and the ECM returned to its original, unmodified state.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1013-14\">. Claim 19 recites the following limitation: \u201cselectively controlling said engine by means of said first computer through at least one additional programmed mode provided by said adapter module, said additional programmed mode not being originally included in said originally provided memory.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b1014-8\">PROST, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ao0\">dissenting-in-part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-9\">Because, in my view, under the proper construction of claim 19, Berra cannot support the district court\u2019s finding of invalidity, I respectfully dissent from part B of the opinion. The majority reads claim 19 as having \u201cno reference to switching back and forth between the originally provided programmed mode and the additional programmed mode during vehicle operation.\u201d While lacking a requirement to switch during vehicle operation, the claim <em>does </em>require \u201cselectively controlling\u201d the engine. As the district court properly recognized, \u201cselectively controlling\u201d indicates the ability to switch back and forth between multiple programmed modes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-10\">Giving appropriate meaning to \u201cselectively,\u201d Berra fails to anticipate claim 19. As the majority discusses, Berra may allow two programs to exist simultaneously in the onboard controller, and therefore allows the possibility of returning to the original program in the future. To properly anticipate claim 19, however, Berra must disclose the means by which to return to the original program, not just leave open a possibility. Contrary to the majority, I do not believe Berra discloses the <em>ability </em>to return to that program. Accordingly, I would reverse the district court\u2019s finding of invalidity based on Berra.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-11\">Appellees additionally assert anticipation of claim 19 based on the Microburst device. The district court did not address the Microburst device, and the record on appeal provides insufficient basis to support a grant of summary judgment at this time. I would therefore remand to the district court to evaluate anticipation based on the Microburst device.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
