Additionally, Wilbourn has filed numerous motions requesting appointment of counsel, relief on the merits, and leave to conduct discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-15\">In a September 1, 2005 order, the district court dismissed Wilbourn\u2019s complaint without prejudice upon (1) determining Wilbourn had \u201cthree strikes\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was not under imminent danger of serious physical injury, and had not paid the district court filing fee; and (2) opining Wilbourn had failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. We affirm the district court\u2019s finding Wilbourn had \u201cthree-strikes\u201d within the meaning of section 1915(g). <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g); <em>Martin v. Neb. Dep\u2019t of Corr. Servs., </em>242 F.3d 376 (8th Cir.2000) (unpublished per curiam) (affirming district court\u2019s \u201cthree strikes\u201d finding under \u00a7 1915(g)). Because Wilbourn\u2019s IFP complaint was not properly before the district court, we decline to address the court\u2019s alternative holdings.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-20\">The district court\u2019s preservice dismissal without prejudice is affirmed, and Wilb-ourn\u2019s pending motions are denied as moot. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47A(a).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b581-16\">. The Honorable Richard H.
