TYMKOVICH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b813-16\">Shawn Schillinger Allred was convicted of (1) four counts of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), and (2) two counts of possession of an unregistered sawed-off shotgun in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d)(3). The district court sentenced Allred to 188 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-17\">On appeal, he contends the district court erred by applying the fifteen-year mandatory minimum sentence contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1) for individuals convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) who have been previously convicted of three or more violent felonies. He argues he has not been convicted of three prior violent felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-18\">Allred acknowledges that he has two previous violent felony convictions. He argues, however, that the third prior conviction used by the court \u2014 a Utah conviction for burglary of a non-dwelling \u2014 was not a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) and <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 599, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>Even if Allred\u2019s argument had merit, any error in the application of \u00a7 924 was harmless because \u00a7 924 did not affect All-red\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(a) requires us to disregard any claimed error that does not affect substantial rights. \u201cAn error with respect to sentencing does not affect substantial rights when it did not affect the sentence imposed by the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Ollson, </em>413 F.3d 1119, 1120 (10th Cir.2005). The judge\u2019s reasoning during the sentencing hearing makes clear that Allred would have received the same sentence \u2014 188 months \u2014 even if the \u00a7 924 mandatory minimum of 180 months did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">At sentencing, the district court started with a United States Sentencing Guidelines range of 262 to 327 months based on Allred\u2019s offense level and criminal history. The court then offered to let Allred accept responsibility to \u201creduce the range from a low end of 262 to a low end of 188.\u201d R. Vol. IV at 9. Although the court also believed at sentencing that the mandatory minimum penalty under \u00a7 924 would apply, in the end, the fifteen-year minimum did not factor into the calculation of All-red\u2019s sentence. Instead, the court based its sentence entirely on the advisory Guidelines. As the court noted at sentencing, \u201cThe guidelines indicate a sentence of above 15 years even with the acceptance of responsibility.\u201d R. Vol. IV at 15. The court ultimately rejected Allred\u2019s request to base his sentence on the fifteen-year mandatory minimum rather than the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">Allred has not challenged the judge\u2019s application of the Guidelines to his case. Because the judge calculated the sentence based on the Guidelines and not on \u00a7 924, any error regarding \u00a7 924 is harmless. Finally, although Allred does not attack the reasonableness of his sentence, the record is clear that the district court evaluated the sentencing factors contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) in imposing the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-9\">Because we see no error in the sentence, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b813-11\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b813-20\">. A violent felony under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) is \u201cany crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... that (i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or (ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>injury to another.\u201d The Supreme Court held that \u201cany crime ... having the basic elements of unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or structure, with intent to commit a crime\u201d is a \"generic burglary\u201d that qualifies as a violent felony under the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924 definition. <em>Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 599, 110 S.Ct. 2143. Allred argues that the broad definitions of \"building\u201d and \"entry\u201d in the Utah burglary statute bring it outside the <em>Taylor </em>definition of \"generic burglary\u201d and require the government to show that his conduct actually met the definition of a violent felony described in <em>Taylor. </em>We note a panel of this court has held in an unpublished decision that the Utah statute meets the \"generic burglary\u201d definition in <em>Taylor. United States v. Blanco-Munoz, </em>No. 98-4094, 1999 WL 300662 (10th Cir. May 13, 1999). <em>See also United States v. DeCarlo, </em>88 Fed.Appx. 707 (5th Cir.2004) (reaching same conclusion).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
