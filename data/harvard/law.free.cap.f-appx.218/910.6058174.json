The facts of the case are adequately set forth in the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment filed on September 29, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo </em>applying the same legal standards as the district court. <em>Fitzpatrick v. City of Atlanta, </em>2 F.3d 1112, 1117 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court correctly granted summary judgment in favor of Commonwealth. Although the district court determined that at the time Sinkwieh entered into a contract to purchase the property, title to the property was marketable because liens against the property had been satisfied, we need not resolve that issue to affirm the grant of summary judgment. Even if we assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that title to the property was found unmarketable, appellants would not be able to recover under the terms of the Commonwealth policy because their own actions caused the loss. According to the exclusions contained in the policy, \u201crisks that are created, allowed, or agreed to by the policy owner\u201d are excluded from coverage. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
