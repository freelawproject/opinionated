Having reviewed the record and considered the briefs and oral argument of counsel, we find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-22\">First, Rivero\u2019s argument that the government\u2019s prosecution under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(n) violated his Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms is foreclosed by our reading of <em>United States v. Wright, </em>117 F.3d 1265, 1272 (11th Cir.1997). Second, we reject Rivero\u2019s argument that the word \u201creceive\u201d in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(n) is unconstitutionally vague, finding that it gives ordinary persons clear notice of what is prohibited therein. Third, we find no merit to Rivero\u2019s argument that the indictment failed to adequately state the offense when it alleged only that Rivero had been \u201cpreviously charged by indictment\u201d instead of alleging that Rivero was \u201cunder\u201d indictment when he received the firearm at issue. The indictment expressly refers to the statutory provisions on which the charges were based and the date of the incident in question, and, accordingly, pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>vides notice to Rivero of the charges he faced and would preclude any subsequent prosecution for the same offense. <em>See United States v. Fern, </em>155 F.3d 1318, 1325 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">With reference to asserted errors at trial, after a review of the trial record, we cannot say that the trial judge abused its discretion when it admitted testimony that Rivero impersonated a police officer. Nor can we say that there was an impermissible variance between the allegations in the indictment and the proof at trial simply because the jury asked a question pertaining to Rivero\u2019s firearm rentals on a different day than that of the charged conduct. Finally, we find the government presented sufficient evidence for a jury to find that Rivero was guilty of the charged conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
