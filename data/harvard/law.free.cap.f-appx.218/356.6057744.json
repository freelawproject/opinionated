However, Hamlett\u2019s brief describes virtually none of the facts or issues involved in this case and instead provides pages of legal quotations and general, conclusory allegations that she satisfied her prima facie burden and that GMAC\u2019s stated reasons for its actions were pretextual. By failing to adhere to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(a)(9)(A)\u2019s requirement that an appellant\u2019s brief contain the \u201cappellant\u2019s contentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>parts of the record on which the appellant relies,\u201d Hamlett has abandoned those contentions. <em>See United States v. Miranda, </em>248 F.3d 434, 443-44 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The only statement in her brief that could be construed as an argument against summary judgment \u2014 that a person with less experience got a job in another Houston office \u2014 is unaccompanied by any allegation or evidence that she applied for and was denied that job, that she was qualified for that job, that the job was related to her situation in any way, or that age was a factor in that employee\u2019s hiring or GMAC\u2019s later offer to her of a job in North Carolina, and is insufficient to establish a pri-ma facie case of age discrimination. <em>See Bodenheimer v. PPG Indus., Inc., </em>5 F.3d 955, 957 (5th Cir.1993). Even if she had established a prima facie case, she makes no argument and points to no evidence as to why GMAC\u2019s reason for offering her the choice of a transfer to North Carolina or a severance package \u2014 that GMAC was closing for economic reasons the office in which Hamlett worked \u2014 was pretextual or that age was in any way a motivating factor in GMAC\u2019s actions. <em>See Rachid v. Jack in the Box, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 305, 312 (5th Cir.2004). Hamlett\u2019s appeal is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">AFFIRMED. Costs shall be borne by plaintiff-appellant.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b384-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b384-15\">. As GMAC points out, Hamlett actually alleged in her Original Petition a claim under the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act (\"TCHRA\u201d), Tex. Lab.Code Ann. \u00a7 21.001 <em>et seq. </em>Because TCHRA claims for age discrimination are subject to the same analysis as ADEA claims, <em>see Quantum Chem. Corp. v. Toennies, </em>47 S.W.3d 473, 475-76, 480-81 (Tex.2001), Hamlett\u2019s misstatement as to the source of her claims is not material.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
