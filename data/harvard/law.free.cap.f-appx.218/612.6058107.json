We dismiss the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-20\">We iack jurisdiction to consider Hakim\u2019s sole contention: that his late arrival at his removal hearing was due to exceptional circumstances. This issue was resolved by the BIA in its December 28, 2004 order, which Hakim did not appeal. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1258 (9th Cir.1996) (holding that petitioners seeking review of a denied motion to reopen or reconsider are required to have filed a separate petition for review challenging the BIA\u2019s dismissal of their appeal, if they wish to contest the earlier decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-21\">As Hakim\u2019s opening brief does not address the BIA\u2019s reasons for denying his second motion to reopen and reconsider, he has waived review of that order. <em>See id. </em>at 1259-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-22\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b641-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
