For reversal, Flores argues that <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), effectively overruled <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>350 (1998), and that the district court therefore violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights in finding that his prior controlled-substanee convictions qualified him for sentencing as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Flores\u2019s argument fails as we are still bound by <em>Almendarez-Torres. See United States v. Torres-Alvarado, </em>416 F.3d 808, 810 (8th Cir.2005) (\u201cwe are bound by <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>until the Supreme Court explicitly overrules it\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Marcussen, </em>403 F.3d 982, 984 (8th Cir.) (holding that district court, not jury, determines whether prior convictions subject defendant to be sentenced as career offender), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 457, 163 L.Ed.2d 347 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b577-26\">.
