As his sole argument on appeal, Fletcher argues that the jury heard the testimony concerning the nature of his prior felony drug conviction in violation of the holding in <em>Old Chief v. United States, </em>519 U.S. 172, 117 S.Ct. 644, 136 L.Ed.2d 574 (1997). We review the district court\u2019s evidentiary ruling for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Insaulgarat, </em>378 F.3d 456, 464 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-27\">Under <em>Old Chief, </em>519 U.S. at 174, 117 S.Ct. 644 a district court abuses its discretion if it admits the name or nature of a stipulated prior conviction when such is offered solely to prove the prior-conviction element of the offense, and its introduction raises a risk of a verdict tainted by improper considerations. The instant case is distinguishable from <em>Old Chief </em>because the Government did not seek to introduce evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>dence of the prior conviction \u201csolely\u201d to prove the prior-conviction element of the offense. Rather, the Government elicited the testimony in order to establish that Williams might have a bias in favor of Fletcher. The potential bias of a witness is always relevant testimony. <em>United States v. Powell, </em>124 F.3d 655, 661 (5th Cir.1997). As in the instant case, evidence of bias may include testimony concerning the prior history between a witness and a defendant where the history establishes a possible motive for slanted testimony. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>The district court did not abuse its discretion by allowing the testimony. <em>See Insaulgarat, </em>378 F.3d at 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b382-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
