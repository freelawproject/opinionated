W.W. Grainger, Inc., </em>257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir.2001). Summary judgment is appropriate where \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-21\">In his appellate brief, Thornton presents two issues for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b870-22\">(1) Whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment for FedEx on Thornton\u2019s claim of breach of contract; and</p>\n<p id=\"b870-23\">(2) Whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment for FedEx on Thornton\u2019s claim of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-24\">Because the remaining issues discussed in the district court\u2019s memorandum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>opinion were not raised in Thornton\u2019s appellate brief, they are deemed waived. <em>See U.S. v. Nealy, </em>232 F.3d 825, 830 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">Concerning the breach of contract claim, we agree with the district court that it fails as a matter of law. Thornton failed to produce evidence demonstrating that he and FedEx entered into a legally binding contract. Moreover, he failed to produce evidence that could convince a reasonable juror that there was an offer and acceptance or any mutual assent as to the terms of the alleged agreement. At most, Thornton produced evidence that he and FedEx entered into an agreement to agree at some point in the future. Under Alabama law, an agreement to agree at some point in the future is not enforceable by a breach of contract claim. <em>See Grayson v. Hanson, </em>843 So.2d 146, 150-151 (Ala.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">We also agree with the district court that Thornton\u2019s negligence claim fails as a matter of law. Thornton failed to identify a legal duty that FedEx allegedly breached that could form the basis of Thornton\u2019s negligence claim against FedEx. Under Alabama law, in order to establish a claim of negligence, a plaintiff must show, among other things, that the defendant breached a legal duty it owed to plaintiff. <em>See Thompson v. Mindis Metals, Inc., </em>692 So.2d 805, 807 (Ala.1997). Moreover, Alabama law provides that \u201c[a] legal duty arises either from the common law or from a statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Graveman v. Wind Drift Owners\u2019 Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>607 So.2d 199, 203 (Ala.1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">Accordingly, for the above-stated reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of FedEx.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
