We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-20\">The record shows that Sewell engaged in coordinated conduct that went beyond simple \u201cbuy-sell\u201d transactions. He frequently traveled with John Tierce to Atlanta to buy methamphetamine, sometimes pooling his and Tierce\u2019s money to make purchases. He also enlisted his girlfriend, Jamie Davis, to hold large amounts of money and drugs for him. There is sufficient evidence, if believed, to convict Sewell of conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-21\">The district court gave the standard Eleventh Circuit jury instruction on the elements of conspiracy. This instruction sufficiently addressed the substance of Se-well\u2019s requested \u201cbuyer-seller\u201d instruction. <em>See United States v. Brazel, </em>102 F.3d 1120, 1140 (11th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Lively, 803 </em>F.2d 1124, 1128-29 (11th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-22\">Evidence of witness intimidation is generally admissible to show a defendant\u2019s consciousness of guilt, <em>see Brazel, </em>102 F.3d at 1154. There is no showing that Sewell\u2019s particular acts of intimidation were so unduly prejudicial that they should have been excluded under Fed.R.Evid. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-23\">This court\u2019s precedent clearly establishes that escape is a crime of violence for purpose of applying the Career Offend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>er Guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>See United States v. Gay, </em>251 F.3d 950, 954 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">Sewell\u2019s alleged miscalculation arguments are all moot. The district court subjected Sewell to the Career Offender Guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Under the Career Offender Guideline, Sewell\u2019s offense level was automatically set at 34 and his criminal history was automatically set at VI, regardless of how his offense level and criminal history would otherwise have been calculated. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">Sewell provides absolutely no reasoning as to why his 250-month sentence was unreasonable. The party challenging the sentence has the burden of showing that it is unreasonable, <em>United States v. Pope, </em>461 F.3d 1331, 1333 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">Sewell argues that his assistance was substantial, and \u201c[tjhere is no way the Government can claim that it was honestly dissatisfied with his performance.\u201d This bare allegation of substantial assistance is insufficient to compel the Government to make a substantial-assistance motion. As the Supreme Court has said, \u201c[A] claim that a defendant merely provided substantial assistance will not entitle a defendant to a remedy or even to discovery or an evidentiary hearing____although a showing of assistance is a necessary condition for relief, it is not a sufficient one.\u201d <em>Wade </em>v. <em>United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 186-87, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 1844, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
