California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), Callahan\u2019s counsel has filed a brief stating there are no grounds for relief, along with a motion to withdraw as counsel of record. No pro se supplemental brief has been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-24\">Our independent review of the record pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 82-83, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), indicates that Callahan knowingly and voluntarily waived the right to appeal his sentence and was sentenced within the terms of the plea agreement. We therefore enforce the waiver and dismiss the appeal as to his sentence. <em>See United States v. Nguyen, </em>235 F.3d 1179, 1182 (9th Cir.2000) (stating that an appeal waiver is valid when it is entered knowingly and voluntarily).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-25\">With regard to his conviction and the conditions of supervised release from which Callahan retained his right to appeal, our independent review of the record discloses no grounds for relief, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-26\">Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and the appeal is DIS<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>MISSED in part and AFFIRMED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b603-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
