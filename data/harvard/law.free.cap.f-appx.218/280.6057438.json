United States Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>No. 04-062-ARB (ARB Dec. 30, 2005). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-21\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
