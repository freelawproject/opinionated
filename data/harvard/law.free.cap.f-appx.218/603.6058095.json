We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Where, as here, the BIA reviewed the IJ\u2019s decision and specifically incorporated portions of it as its own, we review the incorporated parts of the IJ\u2019s decision as the BIA\u2019s. <em>See Molina-Estrada v. INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1093 (9th Cir.2002). We review for substantial evidence, <em>see INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992), and we grant the petition for review in part and remand, and deny in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">The IJ was unclear about whether Bo-dagh had established past persecution, whether a rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear was applied, and who had the burden of proof to show changed country conditions. Thus, we cannot conduct a proper review of this case, and we grant and remand to the BIA for clarification as to Bodagh\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims. <em>See Recinos De Leon v. Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 1185, 1192, 1194 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">However, substantial evidence supports the denial of CAT relief because Bodagh did not establish that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if returned to Iraq. <em>See Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2003). Accordingly, we deny the petition as to the CAT claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED in part and REMANDED, and DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b632-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
