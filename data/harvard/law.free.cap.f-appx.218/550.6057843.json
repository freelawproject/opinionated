Morton, </em>412 F.3d 901, 909 (8th Cir.2005). His counsel has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and Johnson argues pro se that the district court erred in calculating his criminal history. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-24\">Johnson was sentenced in June 2004 to 97 months in prison for conspiring to distribute cocaine base. He contended on appeal that the government had breached the plea agreement by not moving for an additional one-level acceptance-of-responsibility reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E 1.1(b). <em>See Morton, </em>412 F.3d at 903-04. We agreed and remanded for resentencing, directing the government to file a motion in accordance with the plea agreement, and stating that at resentencing the district court would be obligated to follow <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See </em>412 F.3d at 908-09. On remand, the government filed the appropriate motion. After \u201cevaluating those factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a),\u201d the district court found that 87 months \u2014 the bottom of the new advisory Guidelines range \u2014 \u201crepresents a fair and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>appropriate sentence under all of the circumstances, based upon the record before the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">We first note that in this appeal Johnson may not challenge any of the district court\u2019s findings \u2014 such as criminal-history calculations \u2014 that were undisturbed by our previous decision and that he could have challenged, but did not, in his first appeal. <em>See United States v. Behler, </em>187 F.3d 772, 776-77 (8th Cir.1999) (resentencing court may not disregard scope of any limitations imposed by appellate court; district court had no basis for revisiting issues previously decided by both it and appellate court); <em>United States v. Bartsh, </em>69 F.3d 864, 866 (8th Cir.1995) (law-of-case doctrine prevents relitigation of settled issues in case and requires courts to adhere to decisions made in earlier proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Second, we conclude that the 87-month sentence, which was at the bottom of the Guidelines range and was selected after consideration of the section 3553(a) factors, was not unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Gnavi, </em>474 F.3d 532, 538 (8th Cir.2007) (although district court is required to consider each of \u00a7 3553(a) factors, it need not \u201c\u2018categorically rehearse\u2019\u201d each of these factors as long as they were clearly considered; district court\u2019s statement that it had taken \u201call those [\u00a7 3553(a) factors] into account\u201d was sufficient to show district court had taken them into account (citation to quoted case omitted)); <em>United States v. Long Soldier, </em>431 F.3d 1120, 1123 (8th Cir.2005) (relevant inquiry is whether court actually considered \u00a7 3553(a) factors and whether appellate court\u2019s review of those factors leads it to conclude that they support finding of reasonableness).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Accordingly, we affirm, and we grant counsel leave to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b578-16\">. The Honorable Donovan W. Frank, United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
