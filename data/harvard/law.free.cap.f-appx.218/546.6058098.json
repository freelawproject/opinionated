Because he was subject to a 15-year statutory minimum, his Guidelines sentence was 180 months. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b). After considering the advisory Guidelines and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced Norris to 240 months in prison and 5 years of supervised release. On appeal, his counsel has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and seeks leave to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-22\">In light of the justification the district court offered for Norris\u2019s sentence \u2014 including his relatively young age and repeat-offender status, the likelihood he would commit another sex crime, the need for deterrence and protection of the public, and his need for intensive treatment \u2014 we conclude that the sentence is not unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (requiring review for unreasonableness).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-23\">After reviewing the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we have found no nonfrivolous issues for appeal. Accordingly, we grant counsel leave to withdraw, and we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b574-17\">.
