DENNIS JACOBS, Chief Judge, Hon. WALKER, Hon.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b75-14\">GUIDO CALABRESI, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b75-15\">\n<em>SUMMARY ORDER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b75-16\">In 1998, the National Association of Securities Dealers (\u201cNASD\u201d), a self-regulatory organization (\u201cSRO\u201d), was investigating Renaissance Financial Securities Corporation (\u201cRenaissance\u201d), a member company of the NASD. Scher, general counsel for Renaissance, was interviewed by NASD and perjured herself; she was convicted of perjury in New York State court. <em>Scher v. NASD, </em>386 F.Supp.2d 402, 405 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) <em>(quoting People v. Cohen, </em>No. 1474-2000, 2001 WL 1537669 (N.Y.Sup.Ct. Nov. 1, 2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-17\">Scher has sued NASD and various NASD officials for failing to warn her that false testimony during her interview, under oath, could result in a perjury conviction. The district court (Mukasey, J.) dismissed Scher\u2019s claims, concluding that [1] NASD is absolutely immune from suit, [2] NASD is not a state actor, and [3] Scher\u2019s claims were without merit. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-18\">NASD, \u201cas a SRO, stands in the shoes of the SEC in interpreting the securities laws for its members and in monitoring compliance with those laws. It follows that the [NASD] should be entitled to the same immunity enjoyed by the SEC when it is performing functions delegated to it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>under the SEC\u2019s broad oversight authority.\u201d <em>D\u2019Alessio v. NYSE, Inc., 258 F.3d </em>93, 105 (2d Cir.2001). NASD\u2019s interview of Scher, referral of the matter to state authorities, and subsequent alleged cooperation with state prosecutors are all actions within the scope of NASD\u2019s delegated regulatory authority. <em>See id. </em>at 105-06. Accordingly, NASD and its officers were entitled to absolute immunity from Scher\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">Because we conclude that the defendants are entitled to absolute immunity, we do not reach the merits of Scher\u2019s claims or the question whether NASD\u2019s action constituted state action. For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
