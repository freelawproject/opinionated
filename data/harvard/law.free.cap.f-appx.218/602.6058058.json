We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252 and we review for substantial evidence. <em>Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962 (9th Cir.2004). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">Jey testified that she fears persecution by the Iranian government on account of her conversion from Islam to Christianity. Jey\u2019s testimony contained major discrepancies, however, regarding the time line of events and when she was arrested for practicing Christianity in relation to both the 1979 regime change and in relation to her departure from Iran. The discrepancies concern pivotal events and constitute substantial evidence to support the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1043 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">In the absence of credible evidence, petitioners have failed to show eligibility for asylum or withholding. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003). Because their claim under the CAT is based on the same facts that the BIA found to be not credible, and they point to no other evidence that the BIA should have considered, they have failed to establish eligibility for relief under the CAT. <em>See id. </em>at 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b631-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
