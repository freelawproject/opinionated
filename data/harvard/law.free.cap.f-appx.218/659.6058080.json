We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review claims of due process violations in deportation proceedings de novo. <em>Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Grigoryan\u2019s sole contention before this court is that the IJ denied her due process by requiring the merits hearing to proceed despite Grigoryan not having counsel present. Contrary to the government\u2019s contention, Grigoryan exhausted this claim before the BIA. <em>See Biwot v. Gonzales, </em>403 F.3d 1094, 1097-98 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">Grigoryan\u2019s due process claim is in essence a claim that the IJ abused her discretion by not granting a continuance. <em>See De la Cruz v. INS, </em>951 F.2d 226, 229 n. 4 (9th Cir.1991) (noting that the petitioner\u2019s argument that he was denied his right to present evidence was \u201cmerely another way of stating that the IJ abused his discretion in failing to continue the hearing\u201d). The IJ had warned Grigoryan that the merits hearing would proceed with or without counsel, yet Grigoryan fired her attorney just a few weeks prior to the hearing. The Id\u2019s refusal to grant a continuance under these circumstances was not an abuse of discretion, and it therefore did not violate Grigoryan\u2019s due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b687-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
