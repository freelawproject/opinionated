HARTZ, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">Plaintiff Timothy Pisciotta appeals from an order of the district court affirming the Commissioner\u2019s decision denying his application for Social Security Disability and Childhood Disability Benefits. He filed for these benefits on October 12, 2001. At the time of his application, he was 19 years old. He alleged disability due to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), learning disability, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), depression, mild hearing loss, and knee joint problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-12\">The agency denied his applications initially and on reconsideration. On January 8, 2004, he received a de novo hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ). The ALJ determined that he retained the residual functional capacity (RFC) to perform medium work \u201cwhich is simple, routine, and non-repetitive.\u201d R., Vol. II, at 30. The ALJ further restricted his RFC by stating: \u201cThe environment must be non-complex with no fixed quotas. The claimant can have no supervisory responsibilities and must be able to alternate sitting and standing.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b794-13\">The ALJ found that Mr. Pisciotta had no past relevant work to which he could return. But he concluded that Mr. Pisciot-ta \u201ccould be expected to make a vocational adjustment to work that exists in significant numbers in both the local and the national economies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 31. He gave as examples of such jobs, \u201cduplicating machine operator, laundry folder, and microfilm mounter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Given this capacity, the ALJ concluded, he was not disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act. The Appeals Council denied review, making the ALJ\u2019s decision the Commissioner\u2019s final decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-14\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b794-15\">We review the Commissioner\u2019s decision to determine whether the factual findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record and whether the correct legal standards were applied. <em>See Andrade v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number><em>Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>985 F.2d 1045, 1047 (10th Cir.1993). Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Fowler v. Bowen, </em>876 F.2d 1451, 1453 (10th Cir.1989) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">The Commissioner follows a five-step sequential evaluation process to determine whether a claimant is disabled. <em>See Williams v. Bowen, </em>844 F.2d 748, 750-52 (10th Cir.1988). The claimant bears the burden of establishing a prima facie case of disability at steps one through four. <em>See id. </em>at 751 n. 2. If the claimant successfully meets this burden, the burden of proof shifts to the Commissioner at step five to show that the claimant retains sufficient RFC to perform work in the national economy, given his age, education, and work experience. <em>See id. </em>at 751.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">The key issue in Mr. Pisciotta\u2019s applications for Disability Insurance Benefits and Childhood Disability Benefits was whether he was \u201cunder a disability\u201d within the statutory definition. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 402(d)(1)(G), 423(a)(1)(E). The time period relevant to this evaluation differed between the two types of benefits. As the ALJ explained, Mr. Pisciotta received Child\u2019s Insurance Benefits because of his mother\u2019s disability until April 2000, the month before the month in which he celebrated his 18th birthday. The earliest date on which he could receive Childhood Disability Benefits was May 1, 2000, and so the ALJ focused on the time period after that date. As for Disability Insurance Benefits, he was first insured on his own account on April 1, 2000; accordingly, the ALJ focused on the time period between that date and June 30, 2003, when he was last insured for Disability Insurance Benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">II. ALJ\u2019s Assessment of Mr. Pisciot-ta\u2019s RFC</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">On appeal Mr. Pisciotta raises a single issue: whether the ALJ properly assessed his RFC. Specifically, he complains that the ALJ unjustifiably rejected opinions expressed by his treating psychiatrist, Dr. Stanley, concerning his ability to work. Dr. Stanley stated his opinions in a letter dated September 21, 2001, and in a form entitled \u201cMedical Opinion re: Ability to do Work-Related Activities (Mental),\u201d completed January 17, 2004. R., Vol. II, at 312.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-9\">A. Dr. Stanley\u2019s Opinions</p>\n<p id=\"b795-10\">In the letter dated September 21, 2001, Dr. Stanley noted that Mr. Pisciotta had been hospitalized several times at Two Rivers Psychiatric Hospital for reevaluation and medication adjustments. He had provided medications and family counseling to him between these hospitalizations. During the period from approximately June 2000 until March 2001, Dr. Stanley explained, Mr. Pisciotta was \u201cout of treatment, grandiose, rebellious, living away from home and faffing in all areas, including repeated job failures.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 253. Since that time, he had moved back in with his family, got back on his medication, and was \u201cagain making progress.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b795-11\">But Dr. Stanley was less than sanguine concerning the nature of that progress. \u201cIf an examiner believed [Mr. Pisciotta\u2019s] grandiose self-assessment and unrealistic future plans,\u201d he opined, \u201che would indeed look as though he were doing well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cActually,\u201d however, \u201che was not doing well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Dr. Stanley noted that Mr. Pisciotta was in special-education classes, worked parttime in a family restaurant, was \u201csocially inept\u201d and had \u201cpoor hy-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number><em>gieneId. </em>He assigned Mm a GAF score of 45.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">The form that Dr. Stanley completed in January 2004 asked him to provide an opinion concerning how Mr. Pisciotta\u2019s mental or emotional capacities were affected by his impairments. He was asked to rate his ability to perform certain activities, assigning them to one of four categories: \u201cUnlimited or Very Good,\u201d meaning \u201cAbility to function in this area is more than satisfactory\u201d; \u201cGood,\u201d meaning \u201cAbility to function in this area is limited but satisfactory\u201d; \u201cFair,\u201d meaning \u201cAbility to function in this area is seriously limited, but is not precluded\u201d; and \u201cPoor or None,\u201d meaning Mr. Pisciotta had \u201c[n]o useful ability to function in this area.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 312. Dr. Stanley rated Mr. Pisciotta \u201cgood\u201d in his ability to \u201c[understand and remember very short and simple instructions\u201d; \u201c[c]arry out very short and simple instructions\u201d; \u201c[a]sk simple questions or request assistance\u201d; and \u201c[b]e aware of normal hazards and take appropriate precautions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 313-14. He rated Mr. Pisciotta \u201cfair\u201d in his ability to \u201c[rjemem-ber work-like procedures\u201d; \u201c[m]ake simple work-related decisions\u201d; \u201c[r]espond appropriately to changes in a routine work setting\u201d; \u201c[d]eal with stress of semiskilled and skilled work\u201d; and to \u201c[m]aintain socially appropriate behavior.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 313-lb. By far, the rating Dr. Stanley gave most frequently was \u201cpoor or none,\u201d rating Mr. Pisciotta at that level in his ability to \u201c[m]aintain attention for two hour segment\u201d; \u201c[m]aintain regular attendance and be punctual within customary, usually strict tolerances\u201d; \u201c[sjustain an ordinary routine without special supervision\u201d; \u201c[w]ork in coordination with or proximity to others without being unduly distracted\u201d; \u201c[c]omplete a normal workday and workweek without interruptions from psychologically based symptoms\u201d; \u201c[p]erform at a consistent pace without an unreasonable number and length of rest periods\u201d; \u201c[a]c-cept instructions and respond appropriately to criticism from supervisors\u201d; \u201c[g]et along with co-workers or peers without unduly distracting them or exhibiting behavioral extremes\u201d; \u201c[d]eal with normal work stress\u201d; \u201c[understand and remember detailed instructions\u201d; \u201c[c]arry out detailed instructions\u201d; \u201c[s]et realistic goals or make plans independently of others\u201d; \u201c[i]nteract appropriately with the general public\u201d; \u201c[ajdhere to basic standards of neatness and cleanliness\u201d; \u201c[tjravel in unfamiliar place\u201d; and \u201c[u]se public transportation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 313-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">In explanation of these ratings, Dr. Stanley noted that Mr. Pisciotta \u201cis quite immature and dependent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 314. Despite his use of Ritalin, he remained distractable. Tests performed in 1999 showed that he had a low ability to concentrate. As evidence of his immaturity, Dr. Stanley noted that he collected children\u2019s Yu-Gi-Oh and Pokemon trading cards and had an unrealistic goal of attending wrestling school in California. In Dr. Stanley\u2019s opinion, he suffered from low self-concept, low self-confidence, and low motivation.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">With regard to Mr. Pisciotta\u2019s ability to work, Dr. Stanley noted that he had never worked fulltime. When he worked at a restaurant, he performed a reduced workload and was given fewer tables than normal to wait on. His service was \u201cnot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>outstanding enough to get big tips.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 315. Finally, Dr. Stanley opined that his impairments or treatment would cause him to be absent from work \u201c[m]ore than three times a month.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">B. Evaluation of Treating Physician\u2019s Opinions</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">When evaluating the opinion of a treating physician, the ALJ must follow a sequential analysis. In the first step of this analysis, he should consider whether the opinion is well supported by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic technique and is consistent with the other substantial evidence in the record. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(2); <em>Watkins v. Barnhart, </em>350 F.3d 1297, 1300 (10th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). If the answer to both these questions is \u201cyes,\u201d he must give the opinion controlling weight. <em>See id. </em>But even if he determines that the treating physician\u2019s opinion is not entitled to controlling weight, the ALJ must then consider whether the opinion should be rejected altogether, or assigned some lesser weight. He does this by applying the factors provided in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1527 and 416.927. <em>See Watkins, </em>350 F.3d at 1300. These factors include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-7\">(1) the length of the treatment relationship and the frequency of examination; (2) the nature and extent of the treatment relationship, including the treatment provided and the kind of examination or testing performed; (3) the degree to which the physician\u2019s opinion is supported by relevant evidence; (4) consistency between the opinion and the record as a whole; (5) whether or not the physician is a specialist in the area upon which an opinion is rendered; and (6) other factors brought to the ALJ\u2019s attention which tend to support or contradict the opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 1301 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">C. ALJ\u2019s Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b797-10\">The ALJ addressed <em>Dr. </em>Stanley\u2019s opinions, finding them not controlling and assigning them little weight. He found the September 21, 2001, letter internally inconsistent, stating: \u201cDr. Stanley provided conflicting opinions as to the claimant\u2019s status, on one hand he stated that the claimant was \u2018not doing well,\u2019 was socially inept, and demonstrated poor hygiene.\u201d R., Vol. II, at 27. On the other hand, Dr. Stanley \u201cadmitted that the claimant had made progress when he went back on medication and returned to his mother.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b797-11\">\u201cMedical evidence may be discounted if it is internally inconsistent or inconsistent with other evidence.\u201d <em>Knight v. Chater, </em>55 F.3d 309, 314 (7th Cir.1995) (citing 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(c)). Although Dr. Stanley opined that Mr. Pisciotta was \u201cnot doing well,\u201d R., Vol. II, at 253, the only specific, negative factors he mentioned to support that conclusion were that he was \u201csocially inept\u201d and had \u201cpoor hygiene.\u201d <em>Id. </em>There was no indication concerning the severity of these factors or how they would affect Mr. Pisciotta\u2019s ability to work. In fact, Dr. Stanley\u2019s letter cited mostly positive factors concerning his current level of adjustment, noting that he was doing well enough to live with his family, to work in a restaurant, and to attend school. Dr. Stanley did mention that Mr. Pisciotta worked only parttime and was in special-education classes, but it is unclear whether these should even be considered negative factors, since Dr. Stanley presented them in the context of positive developments (his renewed participation in work and school). Also, the fact that his work was only part-time is unsurprising, given that he was still a high school student. Moreover, there is no explanation in the letter why Dr. Stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>ley assigned Mr. Pisciotta a GAF score of 45. On balance, we conclude that the ALJ permissibly assigned low weight to the unsupported and seemingly inconsistent opinions in this letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">Turning to the ratings supplied in the form that Dr. Stanley completed in January 2004, the ALJ found the large number of \u201cpoor\u201d ratings inconsistent with the remainder of the evidence, including the questionnaires accompanying the form and Mr. Pisciotta\u2019s experience at Job Corps. As we have noted, to be entitled to controlling weight, an opinion must not be inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in the record. <em>See Watkins, </em>350 F.3d at 1300. In determining the weight to be given an opinion, the ALJ must consider the consistency between that opinion and the record as a whole. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(4). The ALJ thus provided a legitimate reason for assigning low weight to Dr. Stanley\u2019s opinion, provided of course that his analysis is supported by substantial evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">And we do find substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s assignment of little weight to Dr. Stanley\u2019s opinion. As the ALJ noted, Mr. Pisciotta and his mother completed questionnaires rating a variety of symptoms he experienced over a period of years, from March 2001 to November 2003. These questionnaires asked them to rank his psychiatric and behavioral symptoms on a scale of 1 to 6; 1 being least and 6 being worst. The ALJ noted that none of the questionnaires contained a \u201c6\u201d rating and he calculated that over 67% of the ratings were a \u201c1\u201d; that is, that the symptom listed posed no problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">Other evidence in the record further supports the ALJ\u2019s analysis. During an initial assessment at Pathways Community Behavioral Healthcare done on September 15, 2000, during the period when Dr. Stanley described him as \u201cfailing in all areas,\u201d R., Vol. II, at 253, Mr. Pisciotta underwent a psychiatric assessment. He was diagnosed with ADHD by history, and history of major depression. <em>Id. </em>at 272. He was assessed as having mild to moderate problems with insight, a below-average intellect, and occasional inability to concentrate. The examiner, Julie Broyle, a licensed professional counselor, assigned him a GAF score of 65.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">On February 7, 2001, Ms. Broyle wrote a letter to the team at Mr. Pisciotta\u2019s high school in charge of assessing his special education needs. She noted her belief that he needed to work on social skills, increasing independence, and self-motivation and self-reliance, but that he \u201ccan perform at a higher level than he is currently.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 236. She indicated that he was \u201chelpful to others and has a good sense of humor,\u201d but would \u201cneed some extra help in particular academic areas as well as vocational training and guidance.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">In July 2001 Mr. Pisciotta received a psychological evaluation from Alan R. Israel, Ph.D. The opinions expressed in Dr. Israel\u2019s evaluation were considerably more detailed, thorough, and internally consistent than those contained in the letter and form completed by Dr. Stanley. Dr. Israel noted the considerable improvement in Mr. Pisciotta\u2019s ability to get along with his fellow students and teachers over the prior six months. He noted that he had held the same weekend job for the last seven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>months, and was looking for a second job during the week. Mr. Pisciotta\u2019s mother told Dr. Israel that although he had difficulty concentrating when not on his medication, and continued to have some difficulty sleeping and some mild anxiety, his behavior at home and at work was more appropriate than it had been in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Mr. Pisciotta told Dr. Israel that he was \u201ccapable of grocery shopping, [was] learning to drive, [had] appropriate hygiene, [did] tasks around the house, and [could] follow work related instructions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 244-45. Mr. Pisciotta presented himself at the interview with appropriate hygiene. He acknowledged becoming impulsive at times, being inattentive to details, and having trouble focusing, but stated that his medication helped to control these problems. Although Dr. Israel noted Mr. Pis-ciotta\u2019s previous psychiatric diagnoses, he gave him only a single current diagnosis: \u201cAttention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, combined type.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 245. He observed that at the time of the examination, Mr. Pisciotta was \u201cattending school full-time, working part-time, living at home with family, relating to friends, and engaging in normal teenage activities.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">One of Mr. Pisciotta\u2019s teachers noted in October 2001 that he needed \u201cdirect and constant supervision\u201d and would \u201calways need support on the job or in school,\u201d and was not capable of supporting himself at that time. <em>Id. </em>at 138. But another teacher stated at the same time that she had seen him mature greatly during the previous four years. Mr. Pisciotta\u2019s notes from the Pathways program showed considerable improvement in his ability to cope with life. His discharge summary from Pathways in August 2003 noted mixed progress overall, with Mr. Pisciotta having maintained longterm, parttime employment, graduated from high school, and become independent in major life areas, but still very dependent on others for daily living. When he worked in the Job Corps, he did not request any accommodation</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">In sum, the record provides substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s evaluation of Dr. Stanley\u2019s opinions concerning Mr. Pisciotta\u2019s RFC. The judgment of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b794-10\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed.
