Garcia-Reyes argues that the district court erred by imposing a career offender enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 based upon the classification of his Texas convictions for burglary of a habitation as crimes of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">As Garcia-Reyes concedes, his argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Garcia-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d 454, 455-57 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1398, 164 L.Ed.2d 100 (2006). Although he argues that <em>Garcia-Mendez </em>was incorrectly decided, <em>Garciar-Mendez </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Stone, </em>306 F.3d 241, 243 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">For the first time on appeal, Garcia-Reyes argues that the penalty scheme in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) and (b) is unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Garcia-Reyes concedes that his argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d 580, 582-84 (5th Cir.2000), but he states that he is raising the issue in order to preserve it for Supreme Court review. In <em>Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d at 582, we held that there is \u201cnothing in the Supreme Court decision in <em>Appren-di </em>which would permit [this court] to conclude that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a) and (b), 846, and 860(a) are unconstitutional on their face.\u201d Garcia-Reyes\u2019s argument is foreclosed, as he so concedes. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b349-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
