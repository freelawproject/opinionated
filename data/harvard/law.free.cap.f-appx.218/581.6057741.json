Petitioner fails to present a meritorious equal protection constitutional challenge. Petitioner was charged with removal on April 13, 2004, which was well after IIRIRA\u2019s April 1, 1997 effective date, and therefore petitioner suffered no detrimental reliance on the pre-IIRIRA rules. <em>See INS v. St. Cyr, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>533 U.S. 289, 321-26, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001); <em>see also Jimenez-An-geles v. Ashcroft, </em>291 F.3d 594, 602 (9th Cir.2002) (there are no \u201csettled expectations\u201d based on \u201ctransactions or considerations already past\u201d where alien merely presents herself to INS in hopes of being prosecuted before the effective date of IIRIRA.). For individuals placed in removal proceedings after April 1, 1997, suspension of deportation is not available. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b); <em>Lopez-Castella-nos v. Gonzales, </em>437 F.3d 848, 851-52 (9th Cir.2006). Furthermore, this is not a case involving unfavorable or disparate treatment for a similarly situated group of individuals. <em>Cf. Jimenez-Angeles, </em>291 F.3d at 602 (rejecting equal protection challenge to NACARA notwithstanding Congress\u2019s favorable treatment of certain groups of aliens under IIRIRA\u2019s transitional rules governing suspension of deportation.)</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b609-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
