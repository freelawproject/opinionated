BATCHELDER, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">Appellant Alonzo Monday (\u201cMonday\u201d) appeals the 100-month sentence imposed by the district court after we remanded his case for re-sentencing in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Because we conclude that the district court adequately considered and analyzed the relevant sentencing factors expressed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), we declare that the sentence satisfies our reasonableness review and affirm the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-12\">On November 18, 2002, an officer of the Ingham County Sheriffs Department executed a routine traffic stop on an automobile operated by Alonzo Monday. During the stop, the officer asked Monday if he had any narcotics, and Monday admitted that there was marijuana in the backseat. The officer then asked if Monday had any weapons in the vehicle, and Monday responded that a handgun was located next to the marijuana. After obtaining Monday\u2019s consent, the officer proceeded to search the vehicle and discovered 4.42 grams of marijuana, 21.08 grams of crack cocaine, a semiautomatic pistol, and a police scanner. Upon further questioning, Monday stated that he was transporting the marijuana for someone else and that the gun was lawfully registered to his wife, but he adamantly denied any knowledge of the cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-13\">On February 26, 2003, the federal grand jury returned a three-count indictment charging Monday with (1) knowingly and intentionally possessing with intent to distribute five grams or more of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 841 (b)(1)(B)(iii); (2) possessing a firearm after having been convicted of a felony, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1); and (3) knowingly and intentionally possessing with intent to distribute marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(D). On July 14, 2003, Monday entered into a written plea agreement with the government in which Monday agreed to plead guilty to the second and third counts of the indictment \u2014 possession of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>firearm by a convicted felon and possession with intent to distribute marijuana\u2014 and the government agreed to dismiss the first count \u2014 possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine. The district court accepted Monday\u2019s guilty plea and held a sentencing hearing on October 20, 2003. At the hearing, the district court relied on the presentence investigation report to determine Monday\u2019s base offense level of 27 and criminal history category of IV, which subjected him to a guideline range of 100 to 125 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court, treating the guidelines as mandatory, sentenced Monday to 100 months of incarceration \u2014 at the low end of the guidelines range. Monday appealed his sentence to this Court, and in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. <em>738, 160 </em>L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we remanded to the district court for re-sentencing on June 13, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Prior to re-sentencing, Monday filed a sentencing memorandum with the district court in which he highlighted his rehabilitative efforts since being incarcerated after his initial sentencing in October 2003; these rehabilitative efforts included maintenance of clear conduct records, achievement of good work evaluations, completion of a drug-treatment program, attempts to pay child support, and efforts to maintain contact with his family. Monday requested that the district court impose a sentence below 100 months\u2019 imprisonment on the basis of these post-sentencing rehabilitative efforts. At the sentencing hearing on December 19, 2005, Monday reiterated the arguments expressed in his sentencing memorandum adding that he \u201cha[d] taken advantage of whatever programs that he ha[d] been able to within the [federal prison system]\u201d and he was \u201cnot just biding his time, [but] trying to make a difference in his own life so that he [could] make a difference in other people\u2019s lives once he [was] released.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">In response, the district court judge stated: \u201c[I]t\u2019s my general view that someone who is incarcerated and who has landed a job or improved educationally and so forth, has done the minimum that I expect to see of a person who is in an incarceration setting.... So it takes, in my opinion, someone who ... has gone far beyond what anyone would ordinarily expect [during incarceration] ..., [to] be due ... additional consideration ... in resentenc-ing.\u201d The judge then acknowledged that Monday was not someone who had \u201cgone far beyond what anyone would ordinarily expect\u201d during his imprisonment, and the judge refused to reduce his sentence on that basis. The judge next recognized that Monday had a \u201clengthy and fairly persistent history with criminal activity,\u201d which \u201cpredicted] ... a fairly high likelihood of going out and doing something [illegal]\u201d after his release from prison. Turning to the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the judge noted that he \u201cha[d] to [keep] in mind some degree of protection to the community when [he] tr[ied] to figure out the proper sentence, in addition to all the other factors in the statute ..., which keeps in mind things like ... the need for educational and work experience and rehabilitative efforts ... as well as the purposes of sentencing that include proper actual punishment for the deeds that were done[.]\u201d Ultimately, the judge reimposed the original sentence of 100 months\u2019 imprisonment, stating that he had \u201cconsider[ed] the advisory guideline range ... as well as the other purposes of sentencing expressed in Title 18, Section 3553(a)\u201d and had found 100 months to be \u201can appropriate and reasonable sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">On January 4, 2006, the district court entered an amended judgment reimposing the 100-month sentence, and Monday filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>a timely notice of appeal on January 13, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">A sentencing court\u2019s task is to impose \u201ca sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes\u201d of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2), <em>see United States v. Foreman, </em>436 F.3d 638, 644 n. 1 (6th Cir.2006), and our task on appeal is to review that sentence for reasonableness, <em>see Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 261, 125 S.Ct. 738; <em>United States v. Lonnie Davis, </em>458 F.3d 505, 510 (6th Cir.2006) (\u201cReasonableness is the <em>appellate </em>standard of review in judging whether a district court has accomplished its task.\u201d). In an effort to bring structure and clarity to appellate reasonableness review, our decisions \u201chave distinguished between the procedural and substantive reasonableness of sentences.\u201d <em>United States v. William Davis, </em>458 F.3d 491, 495 (6th Cir.2006). Monday argues that the sentence imposed by the district court was procedurally unreasonable, and we will confine our inquiry accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">A sentence is procedurally reasonable if \u201cthe district court adequately considered and expressed its application of the relevant factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) to permit meaningful appellate review.\u201d <em>Lonnie Davis, </em>458 F.3d at 510 (internal quotations omitted). \u201cThe goal of the procedural reasonableness requirement is to ensure that a sentencing court explains its reasoning to a sufficient degree to allow for reasonable appellate review.\u201d <em>United States v. Dexta, </em>470 F.3d 612, 614 (6th Cir.2006) (citing <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>408 F.3d 301, 305 (6th Cir.2005)). While we have consistently required district courts to consider the Section 3553(a) factors, procedural reasonableness \u201cdoes not require a rote listing,\u201d <em>United States v. Collington, </em>461 F.3d 805, 809 (6th Cir. 2006), or a \u201c \u2018ritual incantation\u2019 of the factors,\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>436 F.3d 706, 709 (6th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>403 F.3d 813, 816 (6th Cir.2005)), as long as the court provides \u201csufficient evidence in the record to affirmatively demonstrate [its] consideration of [the factors],\u201d <em>Lonnie Davis, </em>458 F.3d at 510 (quoting <em>United States v. McBride, </em>434 F.3d 470, 476 n. 3 (6th Cir.2006)), and \u201cto allow for reasonable appellate review.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>436 F.3d at 709 (quoting <em>United States v. Kirby, </em>418 F.3d 621, 626 (6th Cir.2005)); <em>accord United States v. Gale, </em>468 F.3d 929, 934 (6th Cir.2006) (\u201cWhile \u2018[t]he district court need not explicitly reference each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in its sentencing determination,\u2019 \u2018there must be sufficient evidence in the record to affirmatively demonstrate the court\u2019s consideration of [these factors].\u2019 \u201d (alterations in original) (quoting <em>United States v. Jones, </em>445 F.3d 865, 869 (6th Cir.2006))). We may find sentences to be procedurally unreasonable where \u201cthe district judge fails to \u2018consider\u2019 the applicable Guidelines range or neglects to \u2018consider\u2019 the other factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and instead simply selects what the judge deems an appropriate sentence without such required consideration.\u201d <em>Collington, </em>461 F.3d at 808 (quoting <em>United States v. Webb, </em>403 F.3d 373, 383 (6th Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">Our case law also acknowledges that a sentence within the applicable guidelines range is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness. <em>Williams, </em>436 F.3d at 708. Because the district court\u2019s sentence of 100 months\u2019 imprisonment is within the applicable guidelines range, it is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness, and we must operate under this presumption as we engage in our reasonableness inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">In an effort to rebut this presumption, Monday argues that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>court based its sentencing decision on only one of the Section <em>3553(a) </em>factors \u2014 the applicable guidelines range, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4)(A) (directing district courts to consider the sentencing range set forth in the guidelines) \u2014 and failed to consider all the other Section 3553(a) factors. We reject this argument because it has no factual or legal merit. The record plainly establishes that the district court did in fact consider numerous Section <em>3553(a) </em>factors \u2014 more than just the applicable guidelines range. In reaching his decision, the district court judge reviewed and discounted Monday\u2019s rehabilitative efforts during incarceration, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1) (directing sentencing courts to consider the \u201chistory and characteristics of the defendant\u201d); he noted Monday\u2019s \u201clengthy and fairly persistent history with criminal activity,\u201d <em>see id.; </em>he acknowledged that Monday\u2019s criminal record suggested \u201ca fairly high likelihood\u201d of committing future crimes, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C) (directing sentencing courts to consider the need \u201cto protect the public from further crimes of the defendant\u201d); he recognized that he had to \u201ckeep in mind\u201d the need to provide Monday with educational, vocational, and rehabilitative opportunities, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(D) (directing courts to consider the need \u201cto provide the defendant with ... educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner\u201d); and he finally noted that he had to \u201ckeep in mind\u201d the need to punish Monday for the crimes he had committed, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) (directing courts to consider the need for the sentence \u201cto reflect the seriousness of the offense ... and to provide just punishment for the offense\u201d). Moreover, the judge expressly noted that he \u201cconsider[ed] the advisory guideline range ... as well as the other purposes of sentencing expressed in Title 18, Section 3553(a).\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">While the district court\u2019s statement that it considered the Section 3553(a) factors, standing alone, is not sufficient to establish the procedural reasonableness of its sentence, <em>see Lonnie Davis, </em>458 F.3d at 511 (recognizing that \u201cthe focus of sentencing \u2018is on substance rather than form\u2019 \u201d and on the district court\u2019s analysis rather than \u201cany particular \u2018magic words\u2019 \u201d); <em>United States v. Vonner, </em>452 F.3d 560, 568 n. 4 (6th Cir.2006) (\u201c[W]e have ... <em>not </em>held that the mere recitation of the magic words \u2018Section 3553(a)\u2019 is itself <em>sufficient </em>to immunize a district court\u2019s sentencing decision from reversal.\u201d), <em>reh\u2018g en bane granted, </em>No. 05-5295, 2006 U.S.App. LEXIS 27661, at *1 (6th Cir. October 12, 2006), we find that this statement, combined with the district court\u2019s express consideration of many Section 3553(a) factors, resulted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>the issuance of a proeedurally reasonable sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Nor do we find any merit in Monday\u2019s claim that the district court must consider and discuss <em>all </em>of the Section 3553(a) factors. In <em>Williams, </em>we rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that \u201cthe district court\u2019s failure to explicitly discuss <em>each </em>factor rendered his sentence unreasonable.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>436 F.3d at 708 (emphasis added). Similarly, in <em>Dexta, </em>we upheld the procedural reasonableness of a sentence, even though \u201cthe district court did not explicitly consider <em>each and every </em>\u00a7 3553(a) factor,\u201d because the court developed a sufficient record \u201cto allow for meaningful appellate review.\u201d <em>Dexta, </em>470 F.3d at 615 (emphasis added). Because the district court in our case adequately considered and applied numerous Section 3553(a) factors, <em>see Lonnie Davis, </em>458 F.3d at 510, we find that Monday\u2019s sentence satisfies our review for procedural reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Monday also contends that his sentence is proeedurally unreasonable because the district court decried, minimized, and failed to give reasoned consideration to his attempts at rehabilitation since his original sentencing, including his good conduct record, completed substance-abuse program, and attempts to satisfy his familial obligations. The record clearly discloses that the district court did in fact consider Monday\u2019s arguments regarding post-sentencing rehabilitation efforts as a basis for a downward variance and rejected them. After reviewing the sentencing memorandum and hearing Monday\u2019s arguments on the matter, the judge stated that he expected all defendants to engage in rehabilitation efforts while incarcerated and would consider a sentence reduction only for a defendant who had \u201cgone far beyond what anyone would ordinarily expect\u201d during incarceration. Because the judge did not think Monday met that standard, he refused to grant a downward variance from the guidelines range on that basis. Therefore, to the extent Monday contends that the district court did not consider his argument for a downward variance on the basis of his rehabilitative efforts during incarceration, he simply mischaracterizes the district court proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">More importantly, we find that the district court \u2014 charged with the task of re-sentencing Monday in light of Booker\u2014 was not required to consider any of Monday\u2019s post-sentencing rehabilitative efforts. Congress has instructed sentencing courts to consider any pertinent policy statement issued by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(5). One such policy statement, which went into effect prior to Monday\u2019s indictment in this case, provides that \u201c[pjost-sentencing rehabilitative efforts, even if exceptional, undertaken by a defendant after imposition of a term of imprisonment for the instant' offense are not an appropriate basis for a downward departure when resentencing the defendant for that offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.19. Additionally, in <em>United States v. Worley, </em>453 F.3d 706, 709-10 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 450, 166 L.Ed.2d 320 (2006), we considered and dismissed any notion that a district court is required to consider a defendant\u2019s post-sentencing rehabilitation efforts in the context of re-sentencing. The defendant in <em>Worley </em>argued that \u201cthe district court erred in failing to consider his successful efforts at rehabilitation during almost three years that he was incarcerated prior to re-sentencing[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 707. In affirming the district court\u2019s sentence in that case, we concluded that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s] post-sentencing efforts at rehabilitation while incarcerated were not relevant to rebut the presumption that [his] sentence[ ] ... met the reasonableness stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>dard.\u201d <em>id. </em>at 709-10 (citing <em>United States v. Re, </em>419 F.3d 582, 583-84 (7th Cir.2005)), and held that the district court, in performing its limited task of re-sentencing a defendant pursuant to <em>Booker, </em>was not \u201crequire[d] or permit[ted][to] consider[] factors postdating the original sentencing hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 707. Here, we similarly conclude that the district court did not act unreasonably in refusing to grant a downward variance based on Monday\u2019s post-sentencing rehabilitative efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM Monday\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b451-5\">. The district court also noted that the 100-month sentence was \u201can appropriate and reasonable sentence.\u201d We have previously recognized that \u201ca district court's job is not to impose a 'reasonable' sentence. Rather, a district court\u2019s mandate is to impose \u2018a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes\u2019 of Election 3553(a)(2).\u201d <em>Foreman, </em>436 F.3d at 644 n. 1. We conclude \u2014 as we did in <em>Davis </em>\u2014 that \u201cthe district court\u2019s reference to a reasonableness standard does not render [Monday\u2019s] sentence unreasonable in the face of the district court\u2019s satisfaction of the <em>post-Booker </em>sentencing mandates.\u201d <em>Lonnie Davis, </em>458 F.3d at 511; <em>see also United States v. Cruz, </em>461 F.3d 752, 755-56 (6th Cir.2006) (stating that \"the district court\u2019s use of the word 'reasonable' in describing the sentence he wished to impose did not eclipse his thorough application of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and his exercise of independent judgment\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cage, </em>458 F.3d 537, 541 (6th Cir.2006) (\"We decline to conclude that by using the term \u2018reasonable\u2019 or by acknowledging that the appellate court will apply a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness to a sentence, the district court is itself applying that presumption.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
