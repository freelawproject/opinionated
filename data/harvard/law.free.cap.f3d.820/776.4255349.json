Because we conclude that the Commissioner\u2019s decision is lawful and supported by substantial evidence, -we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-20\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b793-21\">Whitehead began treatment with Dr. Jorge Isaza on August 20, 2010, complaining chiefly of neck pain,' after he slipped and hit his head while employed as a heavy equipment' operator several days prior. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>Ultimately, Whitehead informed Dr. Isaza that he intended to apply for social security disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-3\">On July 29; 2011, Whitehead received a Functional Capacity Evaluation (FCE), which showed that he was functioning at a light physical demand capacity. The FCE concluded that Whitehead could perform static standing for 2 to 4 hours in an 8-hour work day, and could occasionally perform repetitive squatting, kneeling, crouching, stair and ladder climbing, forward bent work, and overhead work. The FCE further stated that Whitehead could carry 20 pounds occasionally and 10 pounds frequently, could frequently sit and walk, and could do simple grasping, pushing, and pulling with both his left and right hands. The evaluating physical therapist concluded that Whitehead could return to work with the restrictions in the FCE. Dr. Isaza concurred in this assessment in August, September, and November of 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">Dr. Isaza continued to treat Whitehead in February, June, and September of 2012, and in his treatment reports continued to agree with the restrictions in the FCE. In a letter dated December of 2012, Dr. Isaza stated that he had managed Whitehead\u2019s symptoms conservatively with medications and once again expressed his agreement with the FCE.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">On March 8, 2012, Dr. Herman Toliver performed a consultative examination of Whitehead and found that Whitehead had normal bilateral grip strength, decreased strength in the right arm, normal strength in the left arm, and minor left arm atrophy. Dr. Toliver concluded that Whitehead had mild-to-moderate limitations with pulling, pushing, and lifting heavy objects and should lift no more than 5 to 10 pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">On April 6, 2012, Dr. Jeffrey Nugent, a nonexamining state agency medical expert, reviewed Whitehead\u2019s physical residual functional capacity (RFC) and opined that Whitehead had limitations regarding frequent handling, fingering, and feeling in his right hand and a limitation of 9 pounds for frequent lifting or carrying.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">Whitehead applied for disability insurance benefits on December 29, 2011, alleging that he was disabled beginning on August 15, 2010, due to depression, anxiety, chronic pain, high blood pressure, vision problems, disc replacement in his neck, artery blockage in his neck and heart, hearing problems, knee problems, and sleep apnea. His claim was initially denied and he filed a request for a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">On November 6, 2012, the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) held an administrative hearing and two months later, she issued her decision, conducting the five-step evaluation process and finding that Whitehead was not disabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4). At step one, the ALJ found that Whitehead had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since his application date. At step two, the ALJ found that Whitehead had the severe impairment of cervical spine disease. At step three, the ALJ determined that Whitehead\u2019s impairments did not meet or medically equal the severity for presumptive disability listed at 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpart P, App. 1 (Listings), including Listing 1.04 for disorders of the spine. Before addressing step four, the ALJ considered Whitehead\u2019s RFC and found that he had the maximum RFC to perform light work, except that he could not climb ladders, ropes, and scaffolds, and should avoid overhead reaching with his right arm. The ALJ also found that Whitehead could occasionally stoop, kneel, crouch, and crawl. In making this finding, the ALJ considered Whitehead\u2019s credibility, and determined that his statements concerning the intensity, persistence, and limiting effects of his symptoms were not entirely credible because the ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>jective evidence could not be fully reconciled with his statements. At step four, the ALJ found that Whitehead could not perform his past relevant work as a heavy equipment operator. At step five, the ALJ determined, based on a vocational expert\u2019s testimony, that there were jobs existing in significant numbers in the national economy that Whitehead could perform, such as the occupations of food preparation worker, housekeeping cleaner, and information clerk. Thus, the ALJ found that Whitehead was not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">Whitehead sought review from the Appeals Council on October 30, 2013, which was denied. Whitehead requested review again.and submitted additional evidence consisting of three additional treatment records from Dr. Isaza. The Appeals Council again denied his request for review. In its second denial, the Appeals Council stated that it considered the additional evidence Whitehead submitted, but c\u00f3ncluded that the additional information did not provide a basis for changing .the ALJ\u2019s decision. Thus, the ALJ\u2019s decision became the Commissioner\u2019s final decision, <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.981. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">Whitehead appealed the Commissioner\u2019s final decision to the district court, which affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s decision and dismissed Whitehead\u2019s complaint. Whitehead now appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal, contending that: (1) the Appeals Council failed to adequately consider the additional evidence Whitehead submitted after the ALJ\u2019s decision; (2) the ALJ applied the wrong standard in determining that 'Whitehead did not meet or medically equal Listing 1.04(A); and- (3) the ALJ\u2019s RFC finding is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">II. Jurisdiction and Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">Whitehead sought judicial review of the Commissioner\u2019s final administrative decision under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). The district court entered a final judgment affirming the Commissioner\u2019s decision and dismissing Whitehead\u2019s complaint, and Whitehead timely appealed. We have jurisdiction to review Whitehead\u2019s appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-10\">We review the Commissioner\u2019s denial of social security benefits \u201conly to ascertain- whether (1) the final decision is supported by substantial evidence and (2) whether the Commissioner used the proper. legal standards to evaluate the evidence.\u201d <em>Newton v. Apfel, </em>209 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2000). \u201cA finding, of no substantial evidence is appropriate only if no credible, evidentiary choices or medical findings support the decision.\u201d <em>Boyd v. Apfel, </em>239 F.3d 698, 704 (5th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Harris v. Apfel, </em>209 F.3d 413, 417 (5th Cir.2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-11\">A claimant attempting to establish entitlement to social security benefits \u201chas the burden of proving she has a medically determinable physical or mental impairment- lasting at least twelve months that prevents her from engaging in substantial gainful activity.\u201d <em>Newton, </em>209 F.3d at 452 (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A)). The ALJ then uses a five-step sequential process to evaluate the claimant\u2019s entitlement to social security benefits by determining whether: \u201c(1) the claimant is not working in substantial gainful activity; (2) the claimant has a severe impairment; (3) the claimant\u2019s impairment meets or equals a listed impairment\u2019 in Appendix 1 of the Regulations; (4) the impairment prevents the claimant from doing past relevant work; and (5) the impairment prevents the claimant from doing any other work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 453 (citing 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520). The claimant bears this burden of proof for the first four steps and then the burden shifts to the Commissioner for the fifth step. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b796-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">A: Consideration of New Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Whitehead first argues that the Appeals Council erred in failing to adequately consider, evaluate, or discuss the new evidence Whitehead submitted after the ALJ\u2019s determination: namely, updated treatment records from Dr. Isaza, which Whitehead contends east doubt on the soundness of the ALJ\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">When confronted with new and material evidence, the Appeals-Council \u201cshall evaluate the entire record including the new and material evidence \u2014 It will then review the case if it finds that the administrative law judge\u2019s action, findings, or conclusion is contrary to the weight of the evidence currently of record.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.970(b). However, the regulations do not require the Appeals Council to discuss the newly submitted evidence, nor is the Appeals Council required to give reasons for denying review. <em>See Sun v. Colvin, </em>793 F.3d 502, 511 (5th Cir.2015). Thus, it was not error for the Appeals Council to omit a discussion of the additional treatment records submitted by Whitehead. <em>Id. \u25a0</em></p>\n<p id=\"b796-11\">Whitehead contends that his newly submitted evidence casts doubt on the ALJ\u2019s decision and thus should be addressed by a fact finder. He argues that his case is similar to <em>Sun, </em>where we concluded that new records \u201ccreate[d] considerable uncertainty\u201d regarding the ALJ\u2019s findings that the plaintiff \u201cwas able to ambulate effectively within a year of her injury\u2019s onset[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 512. We disagree. The additional medical records do not change Dr. Isaza\u2019s stated agreement with the restrictions in Whitehead\u2019s FCE. Indeed, as contrasted with :the facts\u2019 in <em>Sun, </em>the newly submitted medical records largely confirm the'evidence already contained in the record. Accordingly, we conclude that the newly submitted evidence was not so significant as to require remand to the ALJ for additional consideration.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-12\">B. Step Three Standard</p>\n<p id=\"An0\">Whitehead next contends that the ALJ applied the wrong standard in determining that Whitehead did not meet or medically equal Listing 1.04(A).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>step three of the evaluation process, Whitehead has the burden of establishing that his impairment meets or equals the criteria for presumptive disability described in the listings. <em>Muse v. Sullivan, </em>925 F.2d 785, 789 (5th Cir.1991). \u201cFor a claimant to show that his impairment matches a listing, it must meet <em>all </em>of the specified medical criteria.\u201d <em>Sullivan v. Zebley, </em>493 U.S. 521, 530, 110 S.Ct. 885, 107 L.Ed.2d 967 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">At step three, the ALJ concluded that \u201cthe medical evidence d[id] not establish the requisite evidence of the nerve root compression, spinal arachnoiditis or lumbar and cervical spinal stenosis as required under listing 1.04.\u201d Whitehead argues that this conclusion was based upon application of the wrong legal standard and that the facts do not support this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">To the extent Whitehead argues that the ALJ applied \u00e1n improper legal standard by requiring EMG or MRI evidence of nerve root or spinal cord compression, there is no evidence that the ALJ did in fact apply such a standard. Rather, the ALJ simply stated that, the medical evidence does not establish the requisite evidence of nerve root compression. Thus, our inquiry is whether the ALJ\u2019s determination is supported by substantial evidence. Newton, 209 F.3d at 452. We conclude that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">First, at no point during his treatment of Whitehead did Dr. Isaza diagnose Whitehead with nerve root or spinal cord compression, nor is there any other direct evidence of nerve root compression contained in the record. <em>See Zimmerman v. Astrue, </em>288 Fed.Appx. 931, 937 (5th Cir.2008) (affirming Commissioner\u2019s conclusion that plaintiffs impairment did not meet or equal Listing 1.04 where there was no direct indication of nerve root compression).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In fact, the only medical record that references \u201ccord impingement\u201d is the letter of Dr. Maury Drummond, Whitehead\u2019s primary care- physician, which the ALJ discounted as being inconsistent with the generally normal findings and because Dr. Drummond sees Whitehead only when he is sick and did not treat Whitehead for his cervical spine condition. Given the evidence from Dr. Isaza, we cannot say that \u201cno credible evidentiary choices or medical findings support the [ALJ\u2019s] decision.\u201d <em>Boyd, </em>239 F.3d at 704. Accordingly, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s determination at step three.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aps\">C. RFC Finding</p>\n<p id=\"b797-11\">Finally, Whitehead argues that the ALJ\u2019s RFC finding is not supported by substantial evidence. In assessing Whitehead\u2019s' RFC, the ALJ found that Whitehead was capable of performing light work with certain limitations. Light work, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>defined by the regulations, \u201cinvolves lifting no more than 20 pounds at a time with frequent lifting or carrying of objects weighing up to 10 pounds.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1567(b). Further, a job constitutes light work when \u201cit requires a good deal of walking or standing, or when it involves sitting most of the time with some pushing and pulling of arm or leg controls.\u201d <em>Id,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">Here, the restrictions outlined in Whitehead\u2019s FCE are consistent with the definition of light work and thus support the ALJ\u2019s RFC determination. The ALJ appropriately gave great weight to Dr. Isaza\u2019s opinion as Whitehead\u2019s treating physician. <em>See Perez v. Barnhart, </em>415 F.3d 457, 465-66 (5th Cir.2005); <em>Newton, </em>209 F.3d at 455 (\u201cThe opinion of the treating physician who is familiar with the claimant\u2019s impairments, treatments and responses, should be accorded great weight in determining disability.\u201d). The ALJ noted that Dr. Isa-za had treated Whitehead every two to three months since August 2010, and thus had sufficient medical information to form an opinion as to Whitehead\u2019s physical ability. Additionally, the ALJ determined that \u201cDr. Isaza\u2019s opinion is not contradicted by any persuasive medical opinion in record.\u201d The ALJ acknowledged that Dr. Toliver\u2019s, Dr. Drummond\u2019s, and Dr. Nugent\u2019s assessments of Whitehead\u2019s abilities contradicted Dr. Isaza\u2019s to some degree. However, the ALJ assigned little weight to those opinions because they contained internal inconsistencies, were contradicted by other medical evidence, and because these physicians lacked the ongoing treatment relationship Dr. Isaza had with Whitehead. Thus, the ALJ appropriately accorded more weight to the FCE and to the conclusions expressed by Dr. Isaza.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Bearing in mind that our role is not to reweigh the evidence or substitute our judgment for the ALJ\u2019s, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s determination regarding Whitehead\u2019s RFC as well as the ALJ\u2019s ultimate determination that Whitehead was not disabled. AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b796-8\">. Whitehead also cites <em>Epps v. Harris, </em>624 F.2d 1267 (5th Cir.1980), to assert that th\u00e9 Appeals Council was required to discuss the additional evidence, and that, in the absence of any discussion, remand is required. Having already concluded that Whitehead\u2019s newly submitted evidence was not sufficiently <em>significant </em>to require remand under <em>Sun v. Colvin, </em>793 F.3d 502 (5th Cir.2015), we also reject Whitehead\u2019s contention that, as in <em>Epps,t </em>the newly submitted evidence <em>directly contradicted </em>the ALJ\u2019s rationale such that remand is required. <em>See Epps, </em>624 F.2d at 1273. Additionally, as we noted in <em>Sun, Epps </em>arose in a different procedural context where the Appeals Council <em>affirmed </em>the decision .of the ALJ and thus has little bearing on the Appeals Council\u2019s denial of a request for review. <em>Sun, </em>793 F.3d at 510-11 (citing <em>Parks ex rel. D.P. v. Comm\u2019r, Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>783 F.3d 847, 853 (11th Cir.2015)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b796-13\">.
