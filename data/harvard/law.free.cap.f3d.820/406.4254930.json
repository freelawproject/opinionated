The district court accepted the plea and imposed <em>a </em>sentence below the guideline range. On appeal, Warren\u2019s only contention is that the district court erred in applying a four-level enhancement under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4)(B) for his possession of a firearm that \u201chad an altered or obliterated serial number.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-19\">At some point, the gun that Warren possessed had its serial number imprinted at two locations: on its frame and on its slide. When Warren was arrested the serial number on the gun\u2019s frame was intact, while the serial number on its slide had been altered or obliterated. The question, one of first impression in our circuit, is whether \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4)(B) applies when only one of two or more serial numbers on a gun has been altered or obliterated.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-20\">We review <em>de novo </em>the interpretation of a sentencing guideline, <em>United States v. Barakat, </em>130 F.3d 1448, 1452 (11th Cir.1997), and we use \u201ctraditional rules of statutory construction to interpret a guideline,\u201d <em>United States v. Mandhai, </em>375 F.3d 1243, 1247 (11th Cir.2004). Under those rules, \u201c[a] guideline\u2019s meaning is derived first from its plain language and, absent ambiguity, no additional inquiry is necessary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWe generally presume the inclusion or exclusion of language in the [guidelines is intentional and purposeful.\u201d <em>United States v. Cruz, </em>713 F.3d 600, 607 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>The guidelines'require only that the firearm in question \u201chad <em>an </em>altered or obliterated serial number.\u201d U.S.S.G.- \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4)(B) (emphasis added). As the First Circuit has recently explained, that language \u201cdoes not require that <em>all </em>of the gun\u2019s serial numbers be so affected.\u201d <em>United States v. Serrano-Mercado, </em>784 F.3d 838, 850 (1st Cir.2015). We have said in other contexts that \u201c[i]n common terms, when \u2018a\u2019 or \u2018an\u2019 is followed by a restrictive clause or modifier^ this typically signals that the article is being used as a synonym for either \u2018any* or \u2018one.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Alabama, </em>778 F.3d 926, 932 (11th Cir.2015). For example, if a speaker says, \u201cGive me <em>an </em>apple,\u201d most reasonable listeners would interpret that as, \u201cGive, me <em>any </em>apple,\u201d or, \u201cGive me <em>just one </em>apple.\u201d Read in that fashion, the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4)(B) enhancement applies either when <em>any </em>serial number on a gun has been altered or obliterated or when <em>just one </em>serial number has been altered or obliterated. Warren loses under either reading because one of the serial numbers on his gun was altered or obliterated. The enhancement applies in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Despite the clear result of that plain language reading, Warren argues that we should read the enhancement <em>in pari materia </em>with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(k), which criminalizes possessing \u201cany firearm which has had the importer\u2019s or manufacturer\u2019s serial number\u201d altered or obliterated. Although he was not convicted under \u00a7 922(k), Warren argues that we should read the guidelines in light of the statute because both cover the same subject matter. Under Warren\u2019s favored reading, \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4)(B) should apply only when the importer\u2019s or manufacturer\u2019s serial number has been altered or obliterated, and not when some other serial number has been altered or obliterated.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">That argument fails because courts generally apply <em>in pari materia </em>only when a legal text is ambiguous. <em>See Ala. Educ. Ass\u2019n v. State Superintendent of Educ., </em>746 F.3d 1135, 1158 (11th Cir.2014) (\u201cCourts generally turn to an <em>in pari materia </em>analysis to resolve a statutory ambiguity____\u201d) (quotation marks and alterations omitted); <em>Martin v. United States, </em>389 F.2d 895, 897 n. 5 (5th Cir.1958) (stating that when the statute was \u201cneither patently nor latently ambiguous ... there is no need, to resort to in pari materia constructions\u201d); <em>Brown v. State, </em>848 So.2d 361, 364 (Fla. 4th DCA 2003) (\u201c[T]he <em>\u2018in pari materia </em>\u2019 canon of statutory construction would be appropriate only if we found ,the statute ambiguous.... \u201d); <em>State v. Nix, </em>220 Ga.App. 651, 469 S.E.2d 497, 499 (1996) (explaining .that \u201cin pari materia may not be resorted to where the language of the statute under consideration is clear\u201d) (quotation marks omitted). Because the text of \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4)(B) is not ambiguous, we need not resort to an <em>in pari materia </em>reading.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">Finally, Warren argues that the serial number on the slide of his gun was not, strictly speaking, a serial number at all because it was not required by federal regulations. .He. describes a \u201cserial number\u201d as just \u201ca number that is put on a product and that is used to identify it.\u201d Here, a number was put on the slide of Warren\u2019s gun and that number was used to identify it. Under Warren\u2019s own definition, it qualifies as a serial number for purposes of the guideline enhancement. The faet that the number was not required by federal regulations is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">AFFIRMED.,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
