Following removal of the case to federal court, McDermott filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that Hefren\u2019s claims were perempt-ed under Louisiana state law and could no longer be brought. The district court granted the motion for summary judgment, and Hefren ;now appeals. For the following reasons, we . AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-16\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b784-17\">The instant case arises out of personal injuries allegedly sustained by Plaintiff-Appellant James Hefren while he was employed by Murphy Exploration &amp; Production Company, USA (Murphy), as a lead operator on the Front Runner Spar. In March 2002, Murphy contracted with Defendant-Appellee ' McDermott, Inc. (McDermott) to have McDermott design and construct the Front Runner Spar, an offshore facility to be used by Murphy for removing and processing petroleum from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>the seabed of the Gulf of Mexico.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In May 2004, Murphy accepted delivery of the Front' Runner Spar and affixed it to the seafloor at the outer continental shelf adjacent to the State of Louisiana where it has remained since,: operating as a platform facility with three decks used for crew quarters, drilling, and production. .</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">According to Hefren, he suffered significant injury on or about June 6, 2011, ori the Front Runner Spar when a flange of a valve struck him in the face. Following his injury, Hefren filed suit against Murphy and McDermott in the 16th Judicial District Court for the Parish of St. Mary in Louisiana on, June 4, 2012.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In his complaint, Hefren invoked jurisdiction under the Jones- Act and general maritime law and asserted claims for negligence. Hefren alleged that both Murphy and McDermott failed to take precautions for Hefren\u2019s safety \u2022 and specifically alleged that McDermott failed to properly design and construct the Front Runner Spar. Murphy then removed the matter to the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana on July 12, 2012, asserting diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 and jurisdiction under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCS-LA). Hefren subsequently filed a motion to remand his -case to state court on August 13, 2012, arguing that he was a seaman under the Jones Act and that Jones Act claims cbuld not be removed to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, the motion was denied on October 25, 2012, by a magistrate judge who concluded that Hefren could not maintain a claim under the Jones Act because the Front Runner Spar was not a vessel and therefore Hefren was not a seaman. On May 2, 2013, the district court entered summary judgment for Murphy, dismissing Hefren\u2019s tort claims against Murphy as barred by the exclusive remedy provisions of the Longshore &amp; Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-12\">.On. February 17, 2014, McDermott filed its own motion .for summary judgment, seeking the dismissal of Hefren\u2019s claims against it with prejudice. McDermott argued that Hefren\u2019s claims were barred or perempted under La. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 9:2772, which provides that no action arising out of deficiencies in the design or construction of immovable property can be brought five years after the date on which the property is accepted by the owner.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because He-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>fren\u2019s claims \u2014 relating to deficiencies in the Front Runner Spar \u2014 were brought in 2013 and Murphy took possession of the Front Runner Spar in 2004, McDermott argued that Hefren\u2019s claim was perempted and that McDermott was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In response, Hefren argued that La. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 9:2772 did not apply to his claims against McDermott because the Front Runner Spar was not immovable as only its mooring system was attached to the seabed, allowing it to be unmoored and transported across the ocean. Hefren also argued that he asserted claims outside of the scope of that statute when he claimed that McDermott failed to identify safety hazards to Murphy employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-3\">The district court granted McDermott\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed Hefreris claims against McDermott with prejudice on April 9, 2014. Examining the undisputed facts, the court noted that the Front Runner Spar was \u201ca structure permanently affixed to the seabed and not a vessel.\u201d The district court then noted that, although Louisiana courts and the Fifth Circuit had never concluded whether spars were immovable property, these courts had held that fixed, offshore platforms permanently affixed to the sea floor were immovable property and that spars were akin to offshore platforms. Based on these cases and certain features of the Front Runner Spar, the court held that the Spar was a \u201cbuilding\u201d and constituted immovable property under La. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 9:2772. Among other features, the court noted that the Spar\u2019s mooring system was permanently attached to the seabed, the Spar was intended to be at its location for a twenty-year lifetime, it would take months of planning and work to remove the Spar from its anchored position in the Gulf of Mexico, and the Spar had remained fixed in its original location since being attached \u2014 even remaining there through several hurricanes. Regarding Hefreris assertion that some of his claims were not within La. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 9:2772, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>held that these claims were essentially failure to warn claims and were perempted by the statute. Hefren timely appealed the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"Adg\">We review a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standard as the district court. <em>Rogers v. Bromac Title Servs., L.L.C., </em>755, F.3d. 347, 350 (5th Cir.2014). Summary judgment is proper \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). A genuine dispute of material fact exists \u201cif the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). However; \u201c[a] mere scintilla of evidence will not preclude granting of a motion for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Schaefer v. Gulf Coast Reg\u2019l Blood Ctr., </em>10 F.3d 327, 330 (5th Cir.1994) (per curiam). \u201cWe construe all facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party when reviewing grants of motions for summary judgment.\u201d' <em>Dillon v. Rogers, </em>596 F.3d 260, 266 (5th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>Murray v. Earle, </em>405 F.3d 278, 284 (5th Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">III. PEREMPTION UNDER LOUISIANA STATE LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b787-9\">In determining whether Hefren\u2019s suit is barred, we look to Louisiana law under OCSLA because the Front Runner Spar is located on the outer continental shelf adjacent to the State of Louisiana. <em>See Fruge ex rel. Fruge v. Parker Drilling Co., </em>337 F.3d 558, 560 (5th Cir.2003) (\u201cOCSLA adopts the law of the adjacent state ... as surrogate federal law, to the extent that it is not inconsistent with other federal laws and regulations.\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under the applicable Louisiana law, any action relating to a deficiency \u201cin the design, planning, inspection, or observation of construction, or in the construction of any improvement to immovable property,\u201d and alleging personal injury or \u201cfailure to warn,\u201d is perempted if brought \u201c[m]ore than five years after ... acceptance of the work by [the] owner.\u201d La. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 9:2772. Rather than simply \u201cbarr[ing] the remedy to be enforced\u201d like a statute of limitations, this \u201cperemptive statute ... totally destroys the previously existing right so that, upon expiration of the statutory period, a cause of action or substantive right no longer exists to be enforced.\u201d <em>KSLA-TV, Inc. v. Radio Corp. of Am., </em>732 F.2d 441, 443 (5th Cir.1984) (per curiam). The parties here disagree over whether the Front Runner Spar is immovable property under Louisiana law. If it is, then Hefren\u2019s claims against McDermott fall within the Louisiana statute of peremption and no longer exist because they were brought more than five years after Murphy accepted delivery of the Front Runner Spar.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-13\">As the district court properly concluded, the Front Runner Spar is immov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>able property and Hefren\u2019s claims are extinguished under La. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 9:2772. In <em>Olsen v. Shell Oil Co., </em>365 So.2d 1285, 1290 (La.1978), the Supreme Court of Louisiana recognized that a fixed offshore drilling platform constituted an immovable \u201cbuilding\u201d within the meaning of a separate .Louisiana statute. In particular, the court explained that, in determining whether an object was a building, there was \u201c[a]n inherent requirement ... that there be a structure of some permanence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1289. Relying on <em>Olsen, </em>a Louisiana appellate court later found that a \u201cfixed drilling platform was a separate immovable,\u201d within the meaning of La. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 9:2772. <em>Bruyninckx v. Bratten, </em>554 So.2d 247, 249 (La.Ct.App.1989). Although spars are not the same as fixed drilling platforms, we have previously noted that a spar can resemble a fixed drilling platform because it \u201cserve[s] as a work platform in a specific, fixed location for the foreseeable future,\u201d and is \u201csecured to the ocean floor ... using ah elaborate system that guarantees movement will be' a difficult and expensive undertaking.\u201d ' <em>Fields, </em>182 F.3d at 358; <em>see also Mendez v. Anadarko Petroleum Corp., </em>466 Fed.Appx. 316, 317 (5th Cir.2012) (per curiam) (unpublished) (noting that a spar\u2019s \u201cfeatures [we]re.... consistent with a fixed structure permanently moored far offshore\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"Atd\">While both <em>Fields </em>and <em>Mendez </em>were Jones Act cases that ultimately concluded that spars viere not vessels for the purpose of the Jones Act, their discussion of spars illustrates the similarity of spars to fixed offshore drilling platforms that are considered immovable property under Louisiana law. This caselaw and the specific facts found by the district court lead us to conclude that the Front Runner Spar is immovable property. Like a \u201cbuilding\u201d under Louisiana law, there is \u201csome permanence\u201d to the Front Runner Spar as it has not moved from its present location, is intended to remain there for its twenty year life, and has a permanent mooring system. <em>Olsen, </em>365 So.2d at 1289. And while Hefren argues that the Front Runner Spar cannot be immovable because it <em>could he </em>moved, he fails to address the district court\u2019s finding that it would take planning, work, and deconstruction of the Front Runner Spar in order to move it from its, anchored position, a feature that gives the Spar \u201csome permanence.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b785-6\">. As previously described by this court, \"[a] spar is a nautical structure designed to float with the bulk of the hull below waves \u2014 something akin to a giant buoy,\u201d and spars have increasingly been used \"to exploit oil and gas resources in deeper ocean waters.\u201d <em>Fields v.

Because the Jones Act incorporates \"[I]aws of the United States regulating recovery for personal injury ... of a railway employee,\u201d <em>id., </em>it- also incorporates those laws' prohibition against removal of actions filed in state court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1445(a) (\"A civil action in any State court against a railroad or its receivers or trustees, arising under [federal, laws applicable to the liability of railroads], may not be removed to any district court of the United States.\u201d),</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b785-14\">.The applicable Louisiana statute provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-15\">A.
