HIGGINSON, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b190-11\">Raphael Diaz lost his position as a paralegal instructor at Kaplan College due to Kaplan\u2019s nationwide reduction-in-force. In the months leading up to his termination, Diaz alerted Kaplan to a student allegation of impropriety involving the classroom attendance procedures of another instructor in the paralegal program. Diaz sued Kap-lan under the anti-retaliation provision of the False Claims Act. The district court granted summary judgment to Kaplan, and Diaz appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b190-14\">Kaplan College hired Diaz as a paralegal instructor at its San Antonio-Ingram campus in 2010. Diaz was one of only two full-time instructors in the department, along with Irma Zatarain, the department\u2019s lead instructor and externship coordinator. A concerned student approached Diaz in April 2012, telling him that Zatarain allowed the student to miss class but marked her as present for attendance purposes. Diaz had the student put the complaint'in writing, and then sent it to Kap-lan\u2019s Assistant Director of Education, who immediately notified Liza Canch\u00f3la, Kap-lan\u2019s Executive Director at its Ingram campus. Canch\u00f3la reported the complaint to Kaplan\u2019s compliance department for investigation. Diaz communicated with the compliance department four times that same month (twice by phone and twice by email) about the allegation. Ultimately, the compliance department\u2019s investigation was inconclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-15\">Canch\u00f3la was a new Executive Director, having been appointed the previous month \u2014 March 2012. One of her first tasks as Executive Director was to implement Ingram\u2019s share of Kaplan\u2019s nationwide reduction-in-force due to decreasing student enrollment. After evaluating the number of students in Ingram\u2019s various programs and the corresponding staff levels, Canch\u00f3la determined that the Ingram campus needed to eliminate several positions, including one full-time position in the Paralegal Studies department \u2014 either Diaz or Zatarain. Canch\u00f3la and Kaplan\u2019s Director of Education evaluated all of the employees in the paralegal department, and Diaz had the lowest rating. Additionally, Zatarain had more direct experience <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>than Diaz, was the lead instructor and externship coordinator, and had been with Kaplan for more than ten years, compared to Diaz\u2019s two. . Canch\u00f3la recommended that Diaz\u2019s position be eliminated, and Kaplan\u2019s leadership approved. Canch\u00f3la informed Diaz that his position was eliminated on June 7. Diaz confirmed that Kaplan eliminated other positions that same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Diaz sued Kaplan in state court, alleging retaliation under the Fais\u00e9-Claims Act and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Kaplan removed the suit to federal court and filed a motion for summary judgment. Both parties moved to strike some of the other party\u2019s summary judgment evidence. The district court denied both motions to strike and granted Kap-lan\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Diaz moved for a new trial, which the district court properly considered as a motion to alter or amend the judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e). The court denied his motion. Diaz timely appealed the district court\u2019s denial of his False Claims Act claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Having reviewed the briefs and record, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, \u201capplying the same standards as the district court.\u201d <em>DePree v. Saunders, </em>588 F.3d 282, 286 (5th Cir.2009). Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the mov-ant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-12\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b191-13\"> Diaz sued Kaplan for retaliation under the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(h).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court held and both parties on appeal agree that the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework applies to \u00a7 3730(h) retaliation claims. <em>See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b192-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Under this framework, the plaintiff must first prove a prima facie case of retaliation by showing \u201c(1) that he engaged in protected activity, (2) that he suffered an adverse employment action, and (3) \u2018that a causal link existed between the protected activity and the adverse action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ortiz v. City of San Antonio Fire Dep\u2019t, </em>806 F.3d 822, 827 (5th Cir.2015) (quoting <em>Davis v. Fort Bend County, </em>765 F.3d 480, 489-90 (5th Cir.2014)). Once an employee establishes a prima facie case, \u201cthe burden shifts to the employer to state a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for its decision. After the employer states its reason, the burden shifts back to the employee to demonstrate that the employer\u2019s reason is actually a pretext for retaliation.\u201d <em>LeMaire v. La. Dep\u2019t of Transp. &amp; Dev., </em>480 F.3d 383, 388-89 (5th Cir.2007) (citation omitted). Here, the district' court found that Diaz established a prima facie case, which Kaplan does not dispute on appeal. The district court then found that Kaplan presented a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for terminating Diaz: Kaplan\u2019s campus-wide reduction-in-force. The district court relied on this court\u2019s decision in <em>Roberson v. Alltel Info. Servs., </em>373 F.3d 647, 656 (5th Cir.2004). In <em>Roberson, </em>we held that the employer\u2019s company-wide reduction-in-force was an \u201cundisputed legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason\u201d for its decision to terminate an employee. <em>Id. </em>The district court correctly applied <em>Roberson </em>to this case and shifted the burden- back to Diaz to show that Kaplan\u2019s reason'was actually pretext for retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">The district court entered summary judgment for .Kaplan because Diaz did not show pretext. Specifically, it found that \u201cDiaz ha[d] not even mentioned the issue of pretext in his response to Kaplan\u2019s motion for summary judgment, let alone presented sufficient evidence to create a fact issue as to whether Kaplan\u2019s proffered explanation for his termination was pretex-tual.\u201d Diaz appeals this finding, and points to two passages in his response to Kaplan\u2019s motion for summary judgment as \u201ccredible evidence and argument\u201d of pretext. The first passage Diaz highlights is in his statement of facts section, and the second is in his discussion of the elements required to prove a prima facie case of retaliation. Neither passage uses the word pretext, much less, discusses pretext; Even though Kaplan\u2019s motion for summary judgment specifically argued that \u201cDiaz presents no evidence of pretext,\u201d Diaz still did-not address pretext anywhere in his response.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">On appeal, Diaz argues that the following evidence supports pretext: (1) a prior audit found that Zatarain was not qualified to teach or be the externship coordinator; (2) Zatarain fraudulently altered attendance records and was the focus of Diaz\u2019s complaint; and (3) Diaz was terminated on the same day as his last email to Kaplan\u2019s compliance department. As the district court noted, however, \u201c[t]he party opposing summary judgment is required to identify specific evidence in the record <em>and to articulate the precise manner in which that evidence supports his or her claim.\u201d Ragas v. Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co., </em>136 F.3d 455, 458 (5th Cir.1998) (emphasis added). Because Diaz failed .to discuss pretext- <em>at all </em>in response to Kaplan\u2019s motion for summary judgment, he necessarily failed \u201cto articulate the precise manner in which [the presented] evidence supports his [ ] claim\u201d of pretext. <em>Id. </em>We do not consider Diaz\u2019s pretext argument on appeal because he failed to raise it in the district court, . <em>See Moreno v. LG Elecs., USA Inc., </em>800 F.3d 692, 697 (5th Cir.2015) (\u201cUnder our general rule, arguments. not raised before the district court are waived and will not be considered on appeal unless the party can demonstrate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>extraordinary circumstances.\u201d (quoting <em>State Indus. Prods. Corp. v. Beta Tech., Inc., </em>575 F.3d 450, 456 (5th Cir.2009))). Diaz has not shown extraordinary circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Finally, Diaz argues that the district court erred by (1) considering the affidavits of Canch\u00f3la and Laura Bledsoe, Kaplan\u2019s Director of Operations, because they are \u201cinterested witnesses\u201d; (2) \u201cdiscounting and finding irrelevant\u201d the affidavit of Julio Lopez; and (3) \u201cdiscounting and finding irrelevant\u201d the student allegation that Zatarain fraudulently altered attendance records. Each of these arguments lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">First, the district court properly considered Canch\u00f3la and Bledsoe\u2019s affidavits. We previously held that \u201c[t]he definition of an interested witness cannot be so broad as to require us to disregard testimony from a company\u2019s agents regarding the company\u2019s reasons for discharging an employee.\u201d <em>Sandstad v. CB Richard Ellis, Inc., </em>309 F.3d 893, 898 (5th Cir.2002). To hold otherwise \u201cwould foreclose the possibility of summary judgment for employers, who almost invariably must rely on testimony of their agents to explain why the disputed action was taken.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Second, Diaz is mistaken when he claims that the district court \u201cseem[ed] to completely disregard\u201d Lopez\u2019s affidavit, which Diaz claims is evidence that Zata-rain \u201cwas unqualified by education to either serve as an instructor or be the 'ex-ternship coordinator.\u201d The district court was clear that it <em>considered </em>Lopez\u2019s affidavit, but found it \u201cirrelevant\u201d because, \u201cthe reduction-in-force occurred in 2012\u201d while the affidavit \u201calleged that Zatarain was unqualified to teach in 2010 or 2011.\u201d The district court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">Third, Diaz argues that the district court \u201cseem[ed] to ignore the fact that evidence was offered- by Diaz that Zatarain had committed clear fraud with' respect to attendance records.\u201d As discussed above, however, Diaz neither raised pretext in the district court nor \u201carticulate[d] the precise manner in which [his] evidence\u201d of alleged attendance fraud \u2014 consisting solely of a single student allegation \u2014 supports his claim of pretext. <em>Ragas, </em>136 F.3d at 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgement of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b191-6\">. The district court dismissed Diaz\u2019s intentional infliction of emotional distress claim because Diaz failed to address it in his response to Kaplan\u2019s motion to dismiss. Diaz does not brief this issue on appeal and therefore has waived it. <em>See In re Tex. Mortg. Servs. Corp., </em>761 F.2d 1068, 1073 (5th Cir.1985) (\"issues 'not raised or argued <em>in the brief </em>of the appellant may be considered waived and thus will not be noticed or entertained by the court- of appeals.\u2019 \u201d (quoting 16 C.
