It appears that the defendant was in possession, that plaintiff demanded rent from defendant, and that none was paid. This is not sufficient to establish a contractual relation between the parties, and there can be no recovery for use and occupation until such relation can be said to exist. The defendant never acknowledged the plaintiff as landlord, and never .promised to pay rent. The mere occupancy, and nothing more, as here proven, is not sufficient to imply tenancy. 12 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. Law, p. 661.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-15\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
