J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGP\">The recovery against the defendant rests upon a contract entered into between plaintiff and defendant\u2019s husband. It can be upheld neither on the theory of actual authority nor on the theory of apparent authority in the husband, for the plaintiff was informed by the husband at the very start that nothing could be done without defendant\u2019s approval. The defendant therefore can only be held on sufficient proof of approval, or, in other words, on proof of ratification with knowledge of the facts. But the evidence is wholly insufficient to establish such ratification. The judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
