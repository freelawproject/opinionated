We have held many times that an affidavit for a bill of particulars, made by the attorney, is not sufficient. The last case was that of Mayer v. Mayer, 29 App. Div. 393, 51 N. Y. Supp. 1079. For this reason the order appealed from must he reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
