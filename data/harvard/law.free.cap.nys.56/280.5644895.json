Pease leased of Christeon G. Howell a store in Corning, at the stipulated rental of $40 per month, and, as co-partners, continued in the occupancy thereof, under this arrangement, until the death of Schenck, October 27, 1895. On November 1st preceding, the co-partners had a settlement with Howell, \"and gave him their firm note for $200, the balance then due for rent. After the death of Schenck, the surviving partner, Pease, remained in possession of the store, and carried on the business without change until March 16, 1896, when the executor of Schenck sold to him the business, in consideration of which Pease assumed all the firm liabilities. Howell knew of this transfer, and, after it was made, Pease occupied the store, carrying on the business in his own name, having a sign indicating that fact, and attorning to the landlord until October, 1897, when he failed in business. In the early part of November, 1896, Howell and Pease had an adjustment of their affairs, and, including the $200 note given by Schenck and Pease, there was a balance due Howell of $677. Pease paid $77 of that indebtedness, and gave his note, due one day after date, as evidence of the balance of the demand. After the failure of Pease, and on the 4th day of October, 1897, Howell sued him on the note, and for the use and occupation of the premises subsequent to its date, and, on November 3d of that year, recovered a judgment against him for $721.85. Execution was returned unsatisfied, and proceedings supplemental to execution were instituted against him. Schenck, by his will, bequeathed his property to various legatees, who, with the exception of Pease, constitute the defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>in this action, which was commenced November 20, 1897. The executor of the will had a judicial settlement of his account in the surrogate\u2019s court, and a distribution of the assets was made to said defending legatees, in pursuance of the decree entered on the judicial settlement of the account of the executor. No claim was presented to the executor by Howell, and no offer to surrender the note or cancel the judgment was made by him until on the trial. The agreement between the executor and Pease is not assailed as fraudulent. The plaintiff is the executrix of Ohristeon Howell, who died since the appeal was taken.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b299-5\">Argued before HARDIN, P.

It is very obvious Christeon Howell, the plaintiff\u2019s testator, intended to treat the defendant Pease as the exclusive debtor. He knew of the fact that Pease, had purchased the interest of his former co-partner of his executor; that, by this purchase, Pease assumed the payment of the firm\u2019s indebtedness, and, after this, Howell recognized and assented to this agreement, by accepting rent from Pease, and treating him as his tenant. Of course, the agreement between the executor and Pease would not ipso facto absolve the executor from liability to Howell for any indebtedness outstanding against Schenck at the time of his death; but the facts exonerating the executor do not depend upon that circumstance, but upon other facts arising from it. After a few months, the landlord had a casting up of accounts with his tenant. He included in his statement the firm note and the rents up to that date, and credited whatever payments had been made by Pease, and also whatever store account the latter or the firm had against him; and this entire account, thus .commingled, was liquidated by Pease paying a part, and giving his note for the major part of the indebtedness. There was no suggestion that this transaction was effected by Pease as surviving partner. The note is by him individually. After this, payments were made on the note, and Pease continued paying rent to Howell, and occupying his store, until his failure. Then there was no offer to return the note to Pease, but, instead, Howell recovered judgment against him. With this judgment still in existence, he sought to enforce Ms demand against the legatees of Schenck. The complaint does not contain an offer to return this note or cancel this judgment. There is no averment and no proof assailing as fraudulent the conduct of Pease in giving the note, and not the slightest suggestion in the record that the executor, by selling the interest of Schenck in the firm assets to Pease, was engaged in any endeavor to defraud Howell. The scheme to make the legatees pay this claim was an afterthought, originating in the suspension of business by Pease. Howell was in no situation to rescind his arrangement with Pease, as he possessed as much knowledge as the executor of his circumstances, and of everything pertaining to the assumption of the firm\u2019s debts by him. With that knowledge, he accepted the fruits of the arrangement, by receiv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>ing payments from Pease, and receiving money for the use and occupation of the building by him. In no event can this action be maintained. If the plaintiff\u2019s contention is correct, he must bring a suit' in equity, offering to rescind the arrangement with Pease, and to cancel the judgment, with suitable averments showing Howell was-the victim of a trick and a fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">There is still another insuperable objection to plaintiff\u2019s recovery in this action. The practice provided in section 1837 and succeeding sections of the Code of Civil Procedure permits a creditor of a decedent to pursue the property after distribution in the hands of the legatees or next of kin, and provides that each person taking is liable to the extent of the property received by him; and section 1839 provides for a ratable apportionment among the recipients of the decedent. This contemplates an action in equity to adjust these-various rights. That is well illustrated in this case. The legatees are eight in number, receiving varying sums, and not one $150 in-amount. Yet, if plaintiff\u2019s contention is correct, each legatee is liable personally for the full amount of this indebtedness, which is vastly in excess of what any legatee has received. The whole scope of the practice provided by these sections is to limit the liability of the legatee or next of kin to the property derived from the decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
