Upon cross-examination the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>same witness said the samples of shirts furnished him. had no cuffs, that he had taken orders for shirts with cuffs, and that he had been informed in one case that an order had been rejected for that reason, but that this was not true in three or four cases. Then he was asked, \u201cDidn\u2019t you take an order from Harris &amp; Mowry for * * * shirts with cuffs?\u201d But, on being \u201cobjected to as no part of the testimony in chief,\u201d the question was excluded, with the remark, \u201cYou are trying to prove your case by this witness.\u201d Neither the ground given for the objection on behalf of the plaintiff, nor the reason for the ruling offered by the justice was good, as the question was relevant to the taking of one of the orders respecting which the witness had given evidence upon his direct examination by the statement introduced in support of the plaintiff\u2019s case. After one of the defendants had stated that he saw the assignor, a traveling salesman, at their place of business from time to time, that he had gone once with him to the shipping room, and there pointed out on the list the orders to be filled, and said that those rejected were in the office below, and also that he used to see him about once a month, the justice, of his own motion, and without suggesting any reason for so doing, excluded the question, \u201cOf what orders did you speak to him whenever you saw him?\u201d The question was open to an objection which the plaintiff\u2019s counsel might urge or disregard,\u2014an objection easily obviated when stated; but as the evidence asked for was relevant in contradiction of the assertions of the plaintiff\u2019s sole witness, as related above, the question might not be excluded without assigning the ground therefor. Later on, the same defendant testified that he had talked with the assignor on-an occasion, of which he gave the date in answer to a question by the. justice, who then inquired: \u201cWhat was the conversation?\u201d and the witness said he had told the assignor they could not get any information in reference to one Taylor, whereupon his own counsel asked, \u201cWhat did you tell him besides that?\u201d And after the defendant had begun his reply, and stated that the firm had written to different people for references, he was interrupted with, \u201cObjected to,\u201d by plaintiff\u2019s counsel, and his answer stricken out, without the assignment of any ground, although the statement, so far as made, was relevant to the evidence previously introduced on the part of the plaintiff. As an exception was duly taken to each of these rulings, each was reversible error, and the judgment should be reversed, with costs to the appellants to abide the event. This necessary disposition of the appeal renders needless any discussion of certain incidents occurring during and after the trial, and much dwelt upon by both parties upon the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellants to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n<author id=\"b968-6\">FREEDMAN, P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Agy\">I am satisfied that the exclusion of the evidence referred to by Mr. Justice MacLEAN was error. The judgment should therefore be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellants to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
