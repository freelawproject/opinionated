He claims that prior to the commencement of the action he duly tendered to the defendants the amount to which they were entitled for their work. The defendants admit receipt of the material, and establish performance of the work, but challenge plaintiff\u2019s valuation of the goods, and assail the alleged tender as bad in form and insufficient in amount. Upon the issue of value, testimony was adduced on both sides, thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1059\">*1059</page-number>producing a situation which required merely the weighing of evidence. The jury, guided by the proper instructions of the justice, determined on an amount which, though less than that claimed by the plaintiff, was amply supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-5\">This leaves for our consideration the subject of tender. The defendants criticise it as having been coupled with a condition, and therefore, as a matter of law, unavailing. There can be no question that the defendants had a lien for their work, and had a right to detain the finished goods until the lien was discharged, either by payment or tender. Kafka v. Levensohn, 18 Misc. Rep. 202, 41 N. Y. Supp. 368. And that tender must be absolute and free from all conditions. Tuthill v. Morris, 81 N. Y. 94; Noyes v. Wyckoff, 114 N. Y. 204, 21 N. E. 158. Recourse must be had to the record, to determine whether this tender was unconditional. It is admitted that the proffer of money was made by one Kopple, and that two persons accompanied him. Kopple, narrating what transpired between him and the defendant Wegh on that occasion, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-6\">\u201cI told him I had eighty dollars with me, and showed him the money. I told him he should give me a bill, and whatever it came to I would settle; that I wanted the goods; that we needed them badly,\u201d\u2014and that Wegh replied, \u201c T can\u2019t give them to you.\u2019 He said to go to see his lawyer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1077-7\">On his cross-examination he restates the interview as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-8\">\u201cI told him I had eighty dollars in my pocket, and was willing to pay whatever the bill came to, if he would give me the goods. He said: \u2018I can\u2019t give it. Go to see my lawyer.\u2019 I told him I would pay whatever it came to, and he said to \u2018go to see my lawyer.\u2019 I said: \u2018What have I got to do with your lawyer, as long as I will pay you what is coming to you?\u2019 He said: \u2018Do whatever you please.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1077-10\">When called in rebuttal, the defendants\u2019 counsel further interrogated Kopple as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-11\">\u201cQ. On the 3d day of June, 1898, when you called at the residence of Mr. Arkaway, did you have eighty dollars with you? A. Positively, eighty dollars in my pocket. Q. And, having that money in your pocket, you said: \u2018I have eighty dollars. Make out a bill, and I\u2019ll pay you\u2019? A. He should give me the goods, and h will pay him. Q. \u2018First give me the goods\u2019? A. No, sir. \u2018Here is your money, give me the goods.\u2019 * * * Q. Ton didn\u2019t put the money in such a position as defendant would take it? A. I had it in my hand. Q. Did you put the money in such a position as Mr. Wegh would take it? A. I can\u2019t understand you. I held the money in my hand. I had it counted out.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1077-13\">One of the two witnesses who accompanied Kopple testified that, when the latter offered Wegh the money and made the demand, Wegh said: \u201cYou can\u2019t get the goods. Go to see my lawyer.\u201d This testimony is corroborated by the other witness. The defendant Wegh did not testify, and but one witness was called by the defense on the subject of tender. She used this language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-14\">\u201cHe [Kopple] stood there and said: \u2018Here is $70. Give me my cuffs and collars.\u2019 Mr. Wegh says, \u2018Give me the full amount, $76.30, and I will return your cuffs and collars.\u2019 And he says, \u2018I have $70.\u2019 Wegh says, \u2018Wait until I see my lawyer.\u2019 He says, T can\u2019t wait,\u2019 and went off.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1077-15\">Kopple flatly contradicted her testimony as to the amount, and persisted in his statement that it was $80.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-16\">We have thus cited all the testimony shedding any light upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1060\">*1060</page-number>nature and amount of the tender. On this evidence we are asked to hold, as a matter of law, that the tender was coupled with the condition that a bill for the work should first be rendered, and that an insufficient sum was offered to discharge the lien. Both were questions for the jury. It cannot be said, as a matter of law, that the request for the bill was made a condition precedent to the payment of the money. The testimony is consistent with a mere inquiry as to the amount of the defendants\u2019 bill. It was for the jury to say whether there was an absolute, unqualified proffer of the money; and, adopting what appears to us the more reasonable construction, they found that the offer was without condition. Also as to the amount of the offer there is presented a decided conflict. It is conceded that under their lien the defendants were entitled to $76.30. They maintain that only $70 were produced, while the plaintiff insists that the sum was $80. Upon request of the defendants, the justice properly charged the jury that they had a right to refuse to accept any sum less than $76.30, the amount of their lien. The jury gave credence to the plaintiff\u2019s version, and we are not disposed to disturb their finding. There is no merit in the defendants\u2019 contention that the tender was bad because the exact amount of the defendants\u2019 lien was not proffered. The law merely requires the tender of a sufficient amount. Even if there were otherwise force in the defendants\u2019 contention of the invalidity of the tender, their positive refusal to deliver the goods relieved the plaintiff from complying with futile formalities. Duffy v. O\u2019Donovan, 46 N. Y. 228; Nelson v. Elevating Co., 55 N. Y. 484; Lawrence v. Miller, 86 N. Y. 131; Keg Co. v. Brown, 9 N. Y. St. Rep. 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-5\">We have considered the rulings of the justice with reference to the admission and exclusion of evidence, as also his refusal to charge as requested by the defendants\u2019 counsel. We find that the exceptions urged upon this appeal are ineffectual. The judgment is correct, and must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-6\">Judgment affirmed, with costs to the respondent. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
