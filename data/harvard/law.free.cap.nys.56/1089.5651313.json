And it is agreed that Frank S. Beard act as stenographer at the taxable rates; and it is further stipulated that one copy need be furnished to the referee, and the stenographer agrees to furnish one carbon to each the plaintiff and defendant at the price of one copy, to be paid for equally by the respective attorneys.\u201d On the trial of this case the referee testified that he spent 50 hours in the consideration of the case, and that defendant therein (plaintiff here, against the sureties) paid him $500; and that, as far as he knew, the clerk had never taxed his fees, nor fixed the time actually spent. The trial court held that it was not necessary for the clerk to do so, that the parties had taken it away from the clerk, and hence plaintiff could recover the amount so paid without proof of its being taxed as part of the costs against the sureties\u2019 principal.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1107-13\">Argued before FITZSIMMONS, C.
