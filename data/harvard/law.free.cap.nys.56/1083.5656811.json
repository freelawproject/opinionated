As there was presented to him the very affidavit contemplated in rule 5 of the rules to\u00bb regulate calendar practice in this department, including the practice in the municipal court (section 1377, Greater New York Charter), the justice erred in not granting the application, and in permitting the plaintiff to take an inquest and recover judgment. This error was not cured by opening the default upon a motion made and heard upon conflicting affidavits, with the imposition of terms upon the defendant. The judgment appealed from should be reversed, and the order vacated, with costs to the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-16\">Judgment reversed, and order vacated, with costs.
