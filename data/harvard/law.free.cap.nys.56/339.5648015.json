Moan, a member of the Catholic Benevolent Legion, was in April, 1889, the holder of a benefit certificate issued by that association, and in it the plaintiff, his wife, was named as the beneficiary. She paid some of the assessments necessary to keep the certificate in force; and after Moan\u2019s death, which occurred in November, 1896, she, having possession of that certificate, claimed the amount secured by it, from the association. The defendant, Moan\u2019s daughter, claimed the same amount; and by an order of the supreme court entered in May, 1897, the association was permitted to pay the money into court,.to await the determination of this action, which involves the ownership of that money as between the parties hereto. The defendant claims as a substituted payee or beneficiary under another certificate issued by the association at the procurement of Moan, in January, 1896. Thus, the plaintiff\u2019s asserted right is based upon an outstanding certificate in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>her favor, as the wife of Moan, and the defendant\u2019s on another outstanding certificate in her favor, as the daughter of Moan; but both certificates relate to the same \u201cbenefit\u201d or fund, and the one sum now on deposit in court. It was adjudged at special term that it belonged to the defendant, less the amounts paid by the plaintiff for premiums or assessments, and from that judgment the plaintiff appeals..</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">That Moan had a right to change the beneficiary at his pleasure, that the plaintiff had no vested right secure against a change, to the amount of the certificate, and that the association could recognize and pay to the substituted nominee, are general propositions, not controverted by the appellant; but it is insisted that, as between these parties, the power to change or substitute one beneficiary for another could be exercised only in compliance with the supposed strict requirement of section 238 of the insurance law of 1892 (Laws 1892, c. 690), by which it is enacted, respecting associations such as the Catholic Legion, that \u201cmembership in any such society, order or association shall give to the member the right at any time upon the consent of such society,\u201d etc., \u201cin the manner and form prescribed by its by-laws, to make a change in its payee, or payees, beneficiary or beneficiaries, without requiring the consent of such payee or beneficiaries.\u201d It is a sufficient answer to this contention to say that the certificate in favor of the plaintiff was issued in 1889, and the contract made by it, so far as it related to the right of a member to change the beneficiary, was controlled by section 18 of the act of 1883 (Laws 1883, c. 175). The incident of the right of substitution of a new beneficiary applied to that certificate, under section 18 of that act. By that section, a member was given the right, at any time, with the consent of the association, to make a change in the payee of the certificate, without the consent of such payee. Section 238 of the insurance law of 1892 is an amendment of section 18 of chapter 175 of the Laws of 1883. Such amendment consists of the insertion of the words \u201cin the manner and form prescribed by its by-laws,\u201d in connection with the right to change the name of the payee on the consent of the association.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">But the constitution of this society provides (section 3) that \u201ca member in good standing may at any time surrender his benefit certificate * * * for a change of beneficiary, and have a new one payable to such legal beneficiary or beneficiaries as he may direct.\u201d When the beneficiary was changed in this case, the original certificate was not surrendered, but Moan made an affidavit that it was lost or destroyed, and thereupon the new certificate was issued, in favor of the defendant. The point is made by the appellant that the requirement of the constitution should have been literally complied with, and that no new payee or beneficiary could otherwise be substituted, so as to deprive her of her inchoate right or interest. It was held in McCormick v. Council, 6 App. Div. 175, 39 N. Y. Supp. 1010, that the beneficiary of a substituted certificate under section 18 of the act of 1883 (which applies here) may, if otherwise entitled, recover the amount of such certificate, notwithstanding a prior certificate issued to other beneficiaries had not been surrendered. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>provision respecting a surrender is for the benefit of the association, and may be waived. To exact absolute conformity with that requirement would in many cases (even under the act of 1892) cause injustice, and defeat that right of substitution which it was the purpose of the law to secure. Where a certificate is lost or destroyed, strict compliance is impossible. The certificate is not negotiable. If it had been assigned for value, or issued pursuant to some contract between the member and the payee, there could be no substitution of a beneficiary to defeat the right of the payee without his consent (Smith v. Society, 123 N. Y. 85, 25 N. E. 197); but neither of those features is in this case. If the certificate were procured by fraud upon the member, the right of the original appointee would not be impaired in a contest between rival claimants. Here there was no fraud on Moan, but it is suggested that there was some fraud of Moan upon his wife. None is proven. Moan had the right to make the change without his wife\u2019s consent, and the society had the power to waive the surrender. It acted upon evidence of the loss or destruction of the first-issued certificate. Moan made affidavit to that effect. Some months afterwards he knew the certificate was in the possession of his wife, for he sought to get it from her, but there is nothing to show he knew it when he made his affidavit; so that, if the question of a fraud upon his wife were *at all involved (and it is not), there was an absolute failure to prove it.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The judgment must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
