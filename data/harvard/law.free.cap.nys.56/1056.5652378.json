Admittedly, he was a member of the club while it was a voluntary association, from some time in 1890, and he continued to pay dues to its treasurer until February, 1896. The club was duly incorporated at the end of 1892, pursuant to proceedings taken upon a resolution adopted at a regular meeting of the club held August 8, 1892. Report of such incorporation was made at the annual meeting on February 13, 1893, whereat and when the report was accepted and adopted. A copy of that report was mailed to all the members. It was findisputed that notifications of the regular meetings were sent to the defendant in the manner provided by the by-laws of the club, and that for a period of three years after its incorporation he continued to pay his obligations to the club. While he might not become a member thereof without his knowledge or against his will and consent, there was sufficient before the tried justice to determine the facts of knowledge of the incorporation and consent by implication to membership in the club as incorporated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-16\">As to the professed resignation, concerning which counsel for defendant chiefly contended on the argument, the defendant testified that on signing a check for dues on February 18, 1895, he dictated to his bookkeeper a letter, in which it was to be stated that, as he had no benefit from the club, they would please drop him from the roll. This his bookkeeper corroborated, adding that he had written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1057\">*1057</page-number>to the effect: \u201cInclosed my check for $30, being the dues, and, as I have no use or benefit from your club, I resign;\u201d that he addressed the letter, and mailed it in the nearest box, as was his habit to mail the letters of the establishment. That any such letter was received by or at the club was denied by the treasurer and by the bookkeeper, whose duty it was to open all the mail to the club or its officers. The bookkeeper further testified that all of \"the club letters were filed, and that he had searched diligently for, and had not found, the alleged letter of -the defendant. Upon this question of fact, _ also, sufficient evidence was before the trial justice to warrant his determination, which was adverse to the defendant. Judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
