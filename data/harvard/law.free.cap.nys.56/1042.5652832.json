Betz Bottling Department, through their salesman, * * * the following arrangement is entered, into, and confirmed by both parties, by their respective signatures annexed hereto: The four parties [named] are to be served by John F. Betz Bottling Department, and seven and one-half (7%) cents is to be credited, for each box so delivered on their respective contract, to Albert Krumenacker\u2019s account. .It is again mutually agreed that no Betz beer is sold by either parties to \"anybody that does not come under the clause particularly provided for by this contract under sixty (60) cents net No rebates or discounts of any kind to be allowed by the respective parties or their agents.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1061-11\">For-,a while the,brewer made the,credits on a prior indebtedness of the bottler, but later declined. Then the bottler brought this action upon \u201cthe agreement,\u201d which he introduced in evidence, together with proof of sales made by the defendant to the four parties named, and said, on cross-examination, that, before the arrangement was entered into, the agent of the defendant went to his customers, and offered the beer cheaper than he sold it to them; that he sold it for 60 cents, and defendant\u2019s agent sold it for 55 cents; that, he complained to the agent, who said, \u201cI will make it good,\u201d and thereupon the agreement was signed by the plaintiff and by the defendant\u2019s attorney in fact. Counsel on his behalf excluded all further questioning of him respecting statements or engagements made as to the agreement, both before and after it was signed, with, \u201cThe contract speaks for itself.\u201d After the plaintiff rested, and the der fendant\u2019s counsel had moved for a dismissal on the ground of failure of consideration, and the justice had intimated that it looked to him like a mere gift, the case was reopened, the plaintiff recalled, and to the question by his attorney, \u201cWhat was the reason for this contract \"being executed?\u201d answered, \u201cBecause they sold the beer for fifty-five cents, and for that reason I could not make any money!\u201d After plaintiff again rested, the motion for dismissal was renewed by the defendant\u2019s counsel. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel asked to go to the jury. That request was denied, and an exception taken. Thereafter judgment was rendered for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-12\">As explained by himself, the \u201cagreement\u201d bound the plaintiff to nothing except continuance in the desuetude to which he was already constrained by circumstances beyond his control. There was thus no act or forbearance, or promise thereof, offered by the plaintiff to, and accepted by, the defendant, as an inducement to enter into the agreement, which therefore cannot be enforced; for the laws of this state supply no-means, nor afford any remedy, to compel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1044\">*1044</page-number>the performance of an agreement made without valuable consideration,, which may be neither past fact, nor mere motive, nor something to be imagined by the court, even upon ingenious suggestion of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-5\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<author id=\"b1062-6\">FREEDMAN, P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Abbn\">The agreement upon which this action was brought was a unilateral one. It bound the plaintiff' to nothing and he parted with nothing on the faith of it. The defendant received no consideration whatever. The judgment for the defendant is therefore right on the ments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-7\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-8\">LEVENTRITT, J.; concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
