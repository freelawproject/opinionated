Y. Supp. 387. There is, however, an additional defense set up, to wit: \u201cThat at the time of the commencement of this action there was, and there is now, pending undetermined in this court a suit wherein this plaintiff is plaintiff and this defendant is defendant, involving the same cause of action.\u201d Action No. 1 is brought on the guaranty, to recover the rent of July month, which is payable in advance. Notice of nonpayment thereof was given to the guarantor on July 30th, and within 30 days thereafter suit could have been commenced against the guarantor. The suit was commenced on September 4, 1896. Action No. 2 is brought to recover the rents of the months of August and September, payable in advance. Notice of nonpayment of the rent for August month was given on August 5th, and for September month on September 2d. This action was commenced on October 23, 1896. Either action No. 1 or 2 accrued, within 30 days after notice of default to guarantor. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>When action No. 1 was commenced, the 30-days notice stipulated for in the guaranty for the bringing of a suit against the guarantor for the rents of August and September months had not expired; in other words, the contingency upon which the bringing of this suit depended had not arisen. The rule of law is that each default in the payment of money due upon a contract payable in installments may be the subject of an independent action, provided it is brought before the next installment becomes due.
