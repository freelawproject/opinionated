The only reason offered by him in justification of his contempt was that at the time of the service upon him of the order for his examination as a judgment debtor he was a nonresident. In support of his contention he submitted his own affidavit and the affidavits of several others, in which the following conclusion is set forth: \u201cHe is not now, and has not been for a period of three years or more, a resident of the city and county of New York, but resides without said city and county.\u201d The special term justice was right in disregarding this conclusion. It alleged no facts which would justify said justice in sustaining the debtor\u2019s conclusion. It was for the court to decide whether the debtor was a nonresident, based upon facts presented by the debtor. He had no right to assume this judicial function.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">The order appealed from is affirmed, with costs, with leave, however, to the debtor to appear and submit to examination, upon payment of costs herein, and also the costs of appeal from the order of December 9, 1898. Upon complying with these terms, the fine of $250 will be remitted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
