J.</author>\n<p id=\"AR1\">This action is of the same nature and upon substantially the same state of facts as the action of Frischman v. Same Defendants, 56 \u00a1N. T. Supp. 1029. The fact that the plaintiff in this case obtained an instrument in writing, signed by the defendant Handel, in which plaintiff attempted to retain title in himself until the property taken by Handel was accounted for, would, in the view' most favorable for the plaintiff, only bring the c\u00e1se within the law relative to conditional sales of personal property (Laws 1897, c. 418, \u00a7\u00a7 112,113, 115); and, as the plaintiff did not comply with the requirements of that law, he is not benefited thereby. The same reasoning applies in this case as in the Frischman Case, above mentioned, and the same result is reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-16\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
