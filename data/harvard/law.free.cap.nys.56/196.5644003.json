But defendant had a right to seek legal redress, and the evidence fails to establish that he used force to repossess himself, within the meaning of the law relating to forcible entry and detainer.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">Judgment dismissing the petition and proceedings without costs should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
