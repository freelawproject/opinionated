The order is a court, and not a judge\u2019s, order. It was made on motion to the court, brought on pursuant to a formal notice, and after hearing counsel both in support and in opposition to the motion, and was entered as a court order. The only authorized practice under section 872 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which regulates applications of' this character, is to apply ex parte to a judge, who, if the papers are sufficient, must make the order. We are aware that it has been decided that, where application is made on notice to examine a party to-an action before trial, and affidavits have been submitted on both sides, the court is in the same position in which it would have been had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>an ex parte order beemfirst granted, and then a motion made on notice to vacate (Witcher v. Association [Super. N. Y.] 14 N. Y. Supp. 290); but the difference between an order of a judge and an order of the' court does not seem to have been considered in that case. That there is such a difference, and that the distinction is radical, has been expressly decided as to an order made under this very section (872) of the Code. In Heishon v. Insurance Co., 77 N. Y. 278, it was held that an order for the examination of a party, made by the court, as distinguished from a judge\u2019s order, was made without power.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The order must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
