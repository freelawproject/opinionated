Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 3169. In support thereof it was necessary that the facts requisite to confer jurisdiction upon the court or judge be shown by the affidavit of a person primarily having knowledge of the facts set forth. In this instance, however, all the statements as of fact were made upon information and belief, without reciting either the names of the informants or any excuse for the absence of their affidavits. That the motion to set aside the attachment was made, not by the defendant, but by judgment creditors, was not good, as it was-shown that the moving parties had obtained their judgment, and so acquired a lien upon the defendant\u2019s property after it was attached, and that their application to vacate the warrant was made before the actual application of the proceeds of the attached property to the payment of the judgment in the action of the plaintiff. Code Civ: Proc. \u00a7 682. The order of the general term of the city court should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-14\">Order of the general term of the city court affirmed, with costs.
