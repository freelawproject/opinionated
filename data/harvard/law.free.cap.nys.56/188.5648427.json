According to the uncontradicted tes-' timony of the plaintiff, the horses of the defendant were upon a sider walk, at large and unattended, and, in passing, one of them jumped and bit a piece out of his coat. They were admittedly where they had no right to be, and where, presumably, they would not have been, if attended. Under such circumstances, failure to prove scienter will not relieve the owner of responsibility; \u201cthe vice of the animal being an essential fact only when, but for it, the conduct of the owner would be free-from fault.\u201d Dickson v.
