O'Shea v. McLear, 15 Civ. Proc. R. 69, 1 N. Y. Supp. 407. The court should, however, have imposed as a condition the payment of costs and such disbursements as the defendant in protecting his rights has been required to pay. This will include a copy of the stenographer\u2019s minutes. The order should be modified by directing the payment of the costs and disbursements by the plaintiff, and, as modified, it should be affirmed, without costs to either party in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-19\">Order modified so as to impose as a condition of the new trial the payment by respondent of the costs and disbursements of the trial had, and, as modified, affirmed, without costs of this appeal to either party.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
