The latter testimony was excluded as incompetent and immaterial. Plaintiff, after notice to defendant to produce the original certificate, offered to prove it by secondary evidence,\u2014by the testimony of the county treasurer, who was not then present nor called as a witness, and by defendant\u2019s application for the certificate,\u2014which offers were excluded for the same reason.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b156-14\">Argued before GOODRICH, P.
