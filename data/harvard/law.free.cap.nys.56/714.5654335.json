This defendant admits that the plaintiff has made demand upon him for the return of the moneys alleged in the complaint to have been paid by him, and admits that this defendant has refused to pay the same or any part thereof; but this defendant denies that he has any knowledge or Information sufficient to form a belief as to whether the plaintiff has made such a demand upon any of the other defendants to this action or whether such defendants have refused to pay the same.

That, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>ever, no payments were made to this defendant, and the parties to the said agreement acknowledged to this defendant, on the 15th day of November, 1895, that they were unable to make said payments, and accordingly this defendant caused a notice to be served npon them, and each of them, canceling the said contract relative to the assigning of this defendant\u2019s interest in the said Imperial Music Hall. And this defendant further alleges that during all the time between the 12th day of October, 1895, and the 15th day of October, 1895, this plaintiff, and the defendants to this suit other than this defendant, held out the inducement and promise and assurance to this defendant that he would receive, on or before the 15th day of November, 1895, the moneys which had been advanced by him as aforesaid. That by reason of the failure of this plaintiff and the other defendants to this action to carry through their arrangement, and for the protection of this defendant, he, this defendant, was obliged to, and did, advance various sums of money towards the completion of the said Imperial Music Hall and the purchase of properties necessary for the same, to the end that the said Imperial Music Hall might be opened for business, and this defendant enabled to obtain the money so advanced by him from the receipts of the business to be carried on therein, and that this defendant has already advanced and paid out, or assumed obligations to advance and pay out, moneys amounting to about forty-five thousand dollars. That the sum of $15,000 was advanced by this defendant towards the erection and completion of the said music hail before the making of the agreement above referred to between this plaintiff and the defendants other than this defendant, and that the payments made by this defendant over and above the said sum of $15,000 have been made by this defendant since the failure of the parties to said last-mentioned agreement to pay this defendant such advances, and were made for the purpose of completing the said music hall, to which, and the business to be done in which, this defendant was obliged to look for the recovery of his money, inasmuch as the other defendants to this action are insolvent. And this defendant further alleges that the rent of the said premises is large, and comes due every three months; and that it will be necessary to make other and further advances and payments for the purpose of enabling business to be carried on in the said Imperial Music Hall, and that it would be a great injustice to this defendant, and would prevent his ever recovering the money so advanced by him, were the prayer of the complaint granted. Wherefore this defendant demands that the complaint be dismissed, with the costs of this action.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b738-4\">Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOs6\">This action was brought to establish an equitable lien upon the leasehold and other property constituting the Imperial Music Hall, of New York City, for moneys advanced by the plaintiff pursuant to an agreement, which moneys were used, with the knowledge, acquiescence, and consent of the defendant Miner, in completing alterations upon the property. It was claimed that the defendant Miner, being a partner or joint owner of the business and a party to the contract, induced the plaintiff to make the advances, refused to give the security agreed upon, and took the benefit of the moneys advanced; and that, by his active procurement, interference, inducement, and representation, the defendant is equitably estopped from claiming the benefit of his legal rights, which are postponed to the equitable lien of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">It appears from the evidence that the defendants Kraus had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>lease of premises in West Twenty-Ninth street and Broadway, in the city of New York, known as the \u201cImperial Music Hall,\u201d and that the defendant Miner had advanced to them about the sum of $15,000 for the purpose of making improvements upon said property. The premises were subject to a mortgage to one Ruppert. The defendants Kraus, in order to secure Miner for the advances which he had made, gave him a mortgage, dated September 10,1895, upon the lease, fixtures, etc., in said music hall, for the sum of $15,000, said sum to be paid by the mortgagors on or before the 1st of September, 1896, out of the profits of the business conducted in said music hall or otherwise. The mortgage provided that, if the defendant Miner should at any time deem his loan unsafe, he might enter upon the premises and foreclose his mortgage. There appears also to have been an agreement between the defendants Kraus and Miner that, as an inducement to Miner to advance the money, after he should be repaid his loan, he was to be entitled to receive one-half the profits of the business earned on in the music hall. The advances of Miner not proving sufficient to carry out the improvements, the defendants Kraus sought other means of raising money; and on the 12th of October, 1895, an agreement was entered into between the Krauses and the plaintiff providing for the forming of a corporation to be known as the \u201cImperial Music Hall,\u201d which should have a capital stock of $100,000, divided into shares of $100 each, all of which was to be issued for the good will, lease, furniture, etc., of the property known as the \u201cImperial Music Hall,\u201d and to be subject only to a mortgage to Jacob Ruppert of not more than $20,000. It was further provided that the company should make, execute, and deliver to the plaintiff a mortgage for $20,000, which was to be subordinate to the Ruppert mortgage; and the plaintiff agreed to advance to the defendants Kraus the full sum of $20,000 in consideration thereof, the Krauses agreeing that they would sell and transfer to the plaintiff 35 per cent, of the entire capital stock of said corporation for the sum of $1. It was further provided that the plaintiff should, upon the signing of the contract, pay the sum of $2,500 on account of said mortgage, and should, on delivery of the mortgage, pay $2,500 within one week from the date thereof, and the balance (less the amount payable to Miner) within two weeks; all of which sums were to be used in the repairs and alterations then in progress on said music hall. The agreement further provided that the plaintiff should pay to Miner, out of said $20,000, the sum which Miner had already advanced, on receipt of which Miner was to satisfy all claims which he had on said lease, furniture, and chattels, and in the meantime was to hold the same as security for such payment. Upon the same day Miner executed an instrument by which he agreed that he would assign his entire claim against the defendants Kraus, and all his interest in the Imperial Music Hall and contracts relating thereto, on payment of the amount advanced by him, on or before November 15, 1895. The plaintiff advanced the $2,500 on the execution of the agreement, the company was incorporated, and the plaintiff paid other sums of money for the completion of the alterations in the building; but the amount due to Miner was not paid, and it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>seems to have been impossible for the plaintiff to comply with the provisions of his contract in regard to the payment to Miner. Miner insisted that the amount due to him should be paid at the time agreed upon in the contract signed by him, and notified the parties that, if the payment was not made, he would elect to declare the contract broken, and proceed therein the same as if no contract had ever existed, and should take such further proceedings in the matter as he was legally entitled to. The amount not having been paid, Miner treated the original agreement between himself and the Krauses as subsisting, and claimed the interest in the property which was given to him by the chattel mortgage and the agreement with them. Various negotiations were carried on between the Krauses, the plaintiff\u2019s representative, and others without result. Eent becoming due, and not being paid, and dispossession proceedings pending, Miner advanced the amount of the rent, took up the Euppert mortgage, and took possession of the property in pursuance of the terms of his mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Upon this state of facts, we fail to see any ground upon which the defendant Miner has become liable for the advances and breach of contract upon the part of the plaintiff. Miner consented to the arrangement between the Krauses and the plaintiff upon the express condition that he was to be repaid his advances on the 15th of November, 1895. He agreed to give up all his interest in the property, which agreement he made because of the plaintiff\u2019s promise to repay him his advances at a period earlier than the agreement between himself and the Krauses required such payment to be made. He was not repaid. He had notified the parties that time was of the essence of the contract, as appears upon its face, and he should not be held to his agreement without performance by the other parties of their part of the contract. It was upon the faith of the agreement entered into between the Krauses and the plaintiff that the latter advanced the moneys for the completion of the alterations in the music hall,' and, when he had failed to comply with his part of the agreement as to Miner, it is difficult to see upon what theory Miner could be pre: vented from resorting to the securities which he had already had for the payment of his money. It would seem, upon a consideration of the case, that it was Miner who was induced to make the agreement he did because of the promise of the plaintiff, and not the plaintiff who was induced to make the advances which he did because of any representations held out by Miner. Under these circumstances, we know of no principle under which Miner could be compelled to pay the advances made by the plaintiff because the plaintiff had failed to comply with his contract to pay the advances which Miner had made, and thus release the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">\u25a0 It is' claimed that Miner cannot escape his liability as partner and tenant in common of this property for the advances made. There is no evidence whatever that he ever became a partner in this business. He was to become a part owner upon a contingency which never happened. After his $15,000 had been repaid to Mm under Ms original agreement, with the defendants Kraus, he was to have a half interest in the property, but, until these advances had been repaid, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>his only interest was that of mortgagee. It was so understood by all the parties, and, as already stated, that interest he agreed to give up if the plaintiff caused to be paid to him the advances he had made. The whole difficulty, so far as Miner is concerned, seems to have arisen because the plaintiff failed to comply with that portion of his agreement by which he agreed to discharge the indebtedness due to Miner; and, he having failed in this regard, we do not see how Miner can be prevented from attempting to secure himself by making use of the liens which he had upon the property. There seems to be no ground, therefore, for holding Miner liable for the advances of the plaintiff because the latter had failed to comply with his agreement to repay the sums advanced by Miner the benefit of which he was to get under his contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">The judgment should be affirmed, but, as the defendants did not furnish the court with any points upon the argument of this appeal, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
