I., to this city, and that the defendant, ignoring her instructions as to care, so negligently performed its undertaking that the articles were injured, to her damage $150. According to her testimony, also, the articles were tagged, \u201cGlass, handle with care, perishable goods,\u201d and the driver was cautioned \u201cnot to drop that barrel; that it contained perishable goods\u201d; to which he replied, \u201cAll right; we have often moved you before, and we will take the best of care of it.\u201d Upon cross-examination the plaintiff produced the paper referred to in her complaint as the \u201cagreement,\u201d and variously called upon the trial \u201creceipt\u201d and \u201ccontract.\u201d At its very top appeared, in capitals, \u201cRead This Receipt,\u201d followed, in smaller but plain type, by, \u201cwhich is the .contract of shipment.\u201d On the very next line was, in conspicuous type, \u201cShippers must have the value of their packages inserted in this receipt, otherwise this company will not be responsible for an amount over $50.\u201d There was also stamped on the line preceding the plaintiff\u2019s address, in red ink, \u201cValue asked, and not given.\u201d One paragraph in the receipt or contract ran:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-16\">\u201cIt is further agreed that this company is not to be held liable or responsible for any loss of, or damage to, said property, or any part thereof, from any cause whatever, unless in every case the said loss or damage be proved to have occurred from the fraud or gross negligence of said company or their servants; nor in any event shall this company be held liable or responsible, nor shall any demand be made upon them, beyond the sum of fifty dojlafs, at which sum said property is hereby valued, unless the just and true value thereof is stated herein; * * * nor upon any fabrics consisting of, or contained in, glass. Articles of glass, or contained in glass, or any of fragile nature, will be taken at the shipper\u2019s risk only\u201d (which latter limitations were printed in italics).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>As the receipt was printed, it was presumably in the form customarily given by the company, with which the plaintiff had had similar dealings during seven or eight or nine years. Notwithstanding this evidence, judgment was rendered for the full amount claimed, in addition to costs and disbursements, aggregating together $170.15. This was error, as the plaintiff, by accepting carriage upon terms of a limited liability, and being silent as to the real value of the articles, in effect indicated the value at which they were to be taken, and also the degree of care and security to be provided. Besides, such of the articles as were of glass, or were contained in glass, were taken at the plaintiff\u2019s risk, and are not the basis for any recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
