Respecting the actual occurrence, there was only the testimony of the plaintiff. As to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>conditions of the place and the circumstances of the defendant\u2019s responsibility, evidence was given by various persons, among whom the conflict was direct. By the defendant it was claimed that the owner of the building furnished the motive power by means of this cogwheel, and that therewith, and with the covering of it, he had nothing to do. Yet the court struck out, upon the mere motion of the plaintiff, the defendant\u2019s statement that he had no control of the cogwheel, or of the box around it, and also, similarly, his statement that he was not allowed to do anything with it. It was the contention of the plaintiff that the stairway was unsafe for the employ\u00e9s, and that the defendant was responsible for the condition, and knew or had reason to know it; but after the defendant had testified that he had been in the building for nearly 30 years, as foreman from 1869, and as lessee for the past 8 years, he was not permitted to answer whether he knew of any change in the cogwheels or their surroundings during the time that they had been there. Mr. Carroll, the representative of, and of the same name as, the owners of the building, testified that he had entire charge of the premises, which he visited often, \u201conce a month regularly, sometimes oftener\u201d; that he had his agents in charge of the building, and the machinery there was run by Mr. Lorraine, an engineer employed by his firm, whose duty it was to examine, take care of, and inspect all the machinery and appliances; but he was not allowed to answer whether a right of way was given to the defendant through this very stairway, or to tell whether, in all his acquaintance, of 15 years, with the premises, he knew any accident or injury had been occasioned by the cogwheels or their immediate surroundings. Practically, the same question was put to Mr. Lorraine in two forms, but excluded, as was also the question, \u201cWho put up the new box?\u201d probably adduced to show upon whom devolved the responsibility of the situation; but this last exclusion was practically cured by this engineer afterwards testifying, \u201cWe had a breakdown of the wheels about six weeks after this accident, and that breakdown caused us to put up new boxings.\u201d All of the evidence called for by these questions, and excluded under exception of the defendant, either tended to prove that the place was out of the control of the defendant, or bore upon the question of knowledge and the degree of care to be exercised in preventing injury. Furthermore, the defendant was allowed to be asked, \u201cYou know that the law requires the person in charge of a factory to keep the cogwheels covered, don\u2019t you?\u201d to which he answered, \u2018Yes;\u201d thus erroneously presenting as a fact what is not contained in the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">For these errors in the exclusion of evidence material to the case of the defendant, and for the admission of an erroneous interpretation of the act, likely to produce prejudicial opinion as to the duty of the defendant, the judgment of the general term should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
