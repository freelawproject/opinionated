Place, 5 Daly, 110); nor is it now required under sections 1298 and 1299 of the consolidation act, made applicable to the present practice and procedure of the municipal courts by section 1369 of the greater New York charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-18\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-19\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant <em>to </em>abide the event.
