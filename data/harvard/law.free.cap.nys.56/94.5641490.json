Y., on or about January 8, 1894, defendant made his certain promissory note in writing, in the words and figures following, to wit: \u201c8500. Auburn, N. Y., January 8th, 1894. Three months after date I promise to pay to the order of Charles S. Beardsley five hundred dollars, at Cayuga County National Bank, Auburn, N. Y., for value received, with interest. Henry L. Storke.\u201d (2) That thereafter, and before the commencement of this action, the said Charles S. Beardsley duly indorsed and transferred said note, and, so indorsed, the same came, for value, before maturity, lawfully into the possession of the plaintiff, who is now the owner and holder thereof, and no part thereof has been paid by said defendant. Wherefore the plaintiff demands judgment against the defendant for the sum of five hundred dollars, and interest from the 8th day of January, 1894, besides the costs and disbursements of this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-14\">And the answer is as follows, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-15\">The defendant, answering the complaint herein, shows to the court and alleges as follows: First. He admits the making of the note set forth in the complaint, but denies that the plaintiff is the owner thereof. Second. He avers that he made said note on the 6th day of January, 1894; that same was indorsed by the payee; but he denies he ever received any value for same, and he avers same was made solely for the accommodation of the payee, who was to take care of same and pay same at maturity, as the plaintiff well knows, as this defendant is informed and believes. Third. This defendant further avers, on information and belief, that the plaintiff herein, with full knowledge of all the facts hereinbefore set forth, came into possession of said note long after the maturity thereof, and after payments on same had been made t\u00f3 parties representing the Mulligan estate, of Philadelphia, which estate claimed to own same. Wherefore defendant demands judgment for the dismissal of the complaint and for costs.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b112-16\">Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.

The complaint alleges, and the answer expressly admits, the making of the note, and its indorsement by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>payee, one Beardsley. The complaint further alleges, and the answer admits, by not denying, that the note so indorsed \u201ccame, for value, before maturity, lawfully into the possession of the plaintiff.\u201d The answer then avers that the note was made by the defendant for the accommodation of the payee, \u201cwho was to pay the same at maturity, as the plaintiff well knows.\u201d This was no defense. What the plaintiff well knew when the answer was interposed is quite immaterial. But, even were the knowledge alleged contemporaneous with the original transaction, this defense would have been equally bad. Having admitted that the note came into the plaintiff\u2019s possession, for value, before maturity, the defendant was liable, though the plaintiff knew when he took it that it was accommodation paper. The answer further avers that the plaintiff, with knowledge of the fact that the note was accommodation paper, came into possession of it long after maturity. Having admitted that the note came into the plaintiff\u2019s possession, for value, before maturity, the defendant was not at liberty to deny the fact, or to prove any state of facts inconsistent with such admission. Fleischmann v. Stern, 90 N. Y. 114. The allegation in question, however, had no relation to the plaintiff\u2019s original possession. It seems that the plaintiff, after he originally became possessed of the note, \u201cfor value, before maturity,\u201d turned it over to one Mulligan. Long after maturity he paid Mulligan\u2019s estate what was due upon it, and then took it back. This is what the defendant\u2019s allegation refers to. Thus the allegation is entirely consistent with the admission. Upon this state of the pleadings, the only issue was the ownership of the note, and that was abundantly established. The learned trial judge should have directed a verdict for the plaintiff. No harm was done, however, by the taking of superfluous testimony, and the submission of unnecessary questions to the jury, except in the consumption of time; for the jury gave the plaintiff the verdict he was entitled to. The exceptions to the exclusion of evidence and to certain refusals to charge are trivial in themselves, and, as the case stands upon the pleadings, entirely unimportant.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The appeal is without merit, and the judgment and order denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
