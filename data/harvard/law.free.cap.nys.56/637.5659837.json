The fact that he has defaulted in answering the original complaint is of no importance. It may well be that he did Krai choose to answer the original complaint, but that he might desire to put in issue the facts which the plaintiff-finds it necessary t\u00a9 allege by the amendment. The order therefore was erroneous in permitting the amendment of this complaint without giving the defendant an opportunity to answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-14\">For this reason, the order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs, without prejudice to a motion on the part of the plaintiff, upon payment of above costs, to set aside the judgment, and serve an amended complaint, if he shall be so advised. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
