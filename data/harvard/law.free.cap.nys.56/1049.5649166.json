No allowance beyond the present surface of the meadow will be made for any shrinkage or settlement, and the cost of replacing any material sinking or settling will be included in the price paid for filling, measured as above stated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1067-16\">The plan, as introduced at the trial, contains a series of blue and yellow lines below the grade line of 161st street. They were marked \u201cmud\u201d where they crossed the creek, and were evidently intended to represent the surface of the ground. The engineer for the commissioner of street improvements, under whose direction the plan was made, testified that the two lower lines indicated the levels of the respective sides of the street. This plan bore the inscription, \u201cNo allowance will be made for any filling below the surface of the ground;\u201d and also: \u201cThe lower line indicates the surface to which the embankment will be allowed. No allowance will be made for any fill below this surface.\u201d The sole question is whether the plaintiff is entitled to recover for some 45,000 cubic yards of material used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1050\">*1050</page-number>to fill in beneath the level indicated by blue and yellow lines on the plan..</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-4\">The contract, specifications, and plan must be read together, and, when so read, are quite unambiguous. The specifications fix the limit to which allowance shall be made for filling as the \u201cpresent surface of the meadow.\u201d These words seem plainly to indicate the surface of the ground at the time of the making of the contract. The argument that they mean a durable or tenable surface, capable of supporting filling, is, at the best, based upon a gratuitous assumption; and it directly conflicts with the conditions under which the language was used, for the \u201cpresent surface,\u201d as the parties well knew, was most of it soft and yielding. And the meaning seems to be made entirely clear by the following provision that there shall be no allowance for \u201cshrinkage or settlement,\u201d or for \u201cmaterial sinking or settling.\u201d If, however, there is any ambiguity in the contract and specifications,.it is resolved by the plan. On this lines are drawn to represent the surface of the ground, and a superscription states distinctly that no allowance will be made for filling below the surface as thus indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-5\">None of the exceptions were well taken. Parol evidence as to the meaning of the words, \u201cpresent surface of the meadow,\u201d was properly excluded, for there was no ambiguity in the written agreement. It is also contended that it was error to exclude testimony as to the meaning of the lines shown on the plan. \u25a0 But such testimony was not excluded. Some preliminary questions and some' questions calling for conclusions were excluded, but the substantial fact, as to what the lines indicated, was, as we have seen, allowed to be proved by the engineer. None of the other exceptions require mention. We think, therefore, that the judgment rendered at the trial was clearly right.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-6\">On the motion for a new trial* it was shown that the words: \u201cThe lower line indicated the surface to which the embankment will be measured and allowed. \u25a0 No allowance will be made for any fill below this surface,\u201d\u2014were not upon the plan when it was signed, or on January 3 or 4, 1894, when the plaintiff\u2019s agent' examined it for the purpose of preparing a bid. This is established by uncontradicted proof. There was a conflict of evidence as to whether the blue and yellow lines were also added subsequent to the examination of the plaintiff\u2019s agent or were on the plan throughout. But we cannot- say that the weight of evidence on this head supports the plaintiff\u2019s claim. On the contrary, the weight of evidence is really with the defendant. That leaves for consideration merely the effect of the uncontradicted evidence as to the absence of the superscription. \u25a0 We think that superscription added nothing to the force and effect of the written agreement. As already stated, the specifications, by themselves, clearly negative the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover for material used to fill in below the surface of the meadow, as that surface existed when he undertook the work. The absence of the superscription from the plan in no way affected his rights or influenced' his conduct.' But there is another conclusive reason why he. is not entitled to a new trial. - On March 20, 1894, shortly after the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1051\">*1051</page-number>mencement of the work, an interview took place between the plaintiff and Commissioner Haffen, Chief Engineer Bisse, and Engineer Thompson. This meeting was had for the very purpose of \u00bfvoiding all misunderstanding as to the work which the plaintiff was to do. Certain questions were put to him, and his answers taken down by a stenographer. He was asked the following questions and gave the following answers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1069-5\">\u25a0 \"Ques. by Chief Bisse: One question-1 would like to ask Mr. Barry, and that is, do you understand perfectly well that no allowances for filling in below the present surface, as indicated on the plan, will be allowed? Ans. by Mr. Barry: You\u2019mean no allowance for displacement? Ans. by Chief Engineer Bisse: Yes, sir. Ques. by Commissioner Haffen: You signed the specifications, Mr. Barry, did you not? Ans. by Mr. Barry: Yes, sir. Ques. by Commissioner Haffen: You understood what you were bidding on, did you not, Mr. Barry? Ans. by Mr. Barry: Yes, sir. Ques. by Commissioner Haffen: Mr. Thompson, I believe you have a question to ask, and that is that there was no allowance to be made for filling in below the present surface line. You understood that, Mr. Barry, did you not? Ans. by Mr. Barry: Yes, sir; I suppose the specifications stated that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AT9Y\">We thus have the plaintiff\u2019s distinct admission that he understood and believed that he was to be paid only for filling above the actual surface of the ground, and was to receive no allowance for what sunk beneath this surface. If there was any ambiguity in the written agreement, this conclusive parol evidence \u00f3f the understanding ef the parties completely negatives the plaintiff\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-7\">The judgment and order should each be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
