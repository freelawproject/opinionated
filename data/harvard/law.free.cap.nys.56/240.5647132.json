The plaintiff is the owner of the house and lot No. 317 West 125th street, in this city, and the defendant is the owner of the adjoining premises on the west, namely, 319 West 125th street. In 1894 the defendant built a one-story brick extension to his house. This extension was about 18 feet in height and was some 66 feet in depth. It began at the rear of the plaintiff\u2019s house, and ran back to the rear of the plaintiff\u2019s lot. The plaintiff\u2019s claim is that the east wall of this extension encroaches upon-her lot at least 3\u00bf inches. The defendant denies that there is any such substantial encroachment. Upon conflicting evidence as to the situation of the wall in question,\u2014which does not preponderate on the plaintiff\u2019s side sufficiently to warrant a reversal,\u2014the learned trial judge found that there was a slight encroachment, but that it did not exceed one-half of an inch. Upon this finding his conclusion was that the encroachment was so insignificant and inconsiderable as to deprive the. plaintiff of the equitable relief asked. He \u25a0 accordingly dismissed the complaint, with costs to the amount of actual disbursements, and without prejudice to an action at law to recover the damages caused by the continuing trespass. Why, when he had reached this conclusion, he did not retain the action, and permit further proof to be adduced upon which an award of compensation might be made, does not appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-12\">It will not be necessary to consider the correctness of the learned trial judge\u2019s general conclusion, for the reason that he plainly overlooked uncontradicted evidence as to the encroachment of the foundation upon which the defendant\u2019s wall is erected. Whatever conflict there was as to the wall itself, there was none as to this foundation. The plaintiff\u2019s husband, Michael Mulrein, testified as follows: \u201cThe foundation of this brick wall goes still further on my wife\u2019s lot than the wall itself; the stonework and brick on the front on the south two and three-quarters, and the rear measurement about three and a half inches,\u2014that is, east of the wall itself.\u201d And again, upon cross-examination, he said: \u201cI say the foundation projected to the extent that I say over on the land belonging to her,\u2014east of the brick wall, I am speaking now. The foundation extends east of the wall itself two and one-half inches in some places.\u201d When this en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>croachment is added to that found with regard to the wall itself, we have an undoubted encroachment upon the plaintiff\u2019s land of between three and four inches. It is needless to say that the foundation encroachment is just as serious as that above the surface of the land. The plaintiff is thus effectually deprived of the right to build upon the full width of her land; and the defendant has, in effect, taken part of her. land from her, and appropriated it, without her consent, to his own use. Whatever question there may be as to an appropriation of but one-half of an inch,\u2014as to which, in view of the simple character of the extension, and the absence of any element of special inconvenience in the surrounding conditions, we do not wish to be understood as agreeing with the learned trial judge,\u2014there can be none as to so serious an encroachment as from three to four inches.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">There was no estoppel proved against the plaintiff; nor was there laches sufficient to defeat her equitable action. She knew nothing of the encroachment when the extension was being built, nor until a survey was subsequently made. Her husband was not her agent, nor was his knowledge hers. He, however, warned the defendant\u2019s contractor to be careful; and he himself was not, at the time when the extension was being erected, certain as to the lines.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
