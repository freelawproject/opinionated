Plaintiff testified that he constantly renewed the complaint, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>and, when defendant was spoken to after the injury, he said defendant\u2019s landlord was responsible, which last conversation defendant did not deny.

On this lot he had erected a brick structure, the first story of which was used as a blacksmith\u2019s shop, and the second as a dwelling place for his family. Immediately adjoining this building on the west was a vacant lot, of which one Reilly was the tenant in possession. The defehdant was a contractor engaged in digging out cellars and making other excavations. On December 10, 1895, the defendant hired the lot from Reilly for the term of one month, for the purpose of storing sand thereon. For some three days sand was deposited on the lot, against the plaintiff\u2019s wall, to a height of some three feet. It is conceded that this work, at least, was done by the defendant. From this time the deposit of sand was continued until the 18th day of December, at which time pressure of sand (it being some 18 or 20-feet high along the plaintiff\u2019s wall) broke down the plaintiff\u2019s house, and destroyed the personal property he had therein. For this injury to his property the plaintiff brought this action, and from the judgment entered therein in his favor this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-10\">There can be no doubt that there was an invasion of the plaintiff\u2019s property right, for which the persons responsible for the injury were liable to him in damages. The wall was wholly on the plaintiff\u2019s land, and the occupant of the adjacent lot had no right whatever to make use of it as a retaining wall for the support of material stored on that lot, any more than he would have had the right to cut openings into it and place beams therein for the purpose of supporting a building or other structure. Sand or gravel will not stand vertically without support, and, therefore, wherever it is deposited in such a way that the sides are vertical, it exerts a lateral thrust on the supports. There was no right whatever in the party storing the sand to impose this pressure or thrust on the plaintiff\u2019s wall. The act itself was wrongful, and either a trespass or a nuisance. This doctrine should not be carried to an extreme; and we do not say that where a man leans his walking stick or a step ladder against Ms neighbor\u2019s wall, but on his own land, this would give a cause of action. But, wherever the placing of articles or material against the neighboring wall creates pressure sufficient in any way to weaken or injure it, then the property rights of the owner of the wall are violated. Davis. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>v. Evans (Sup.) 13 N. Y. Supp. 437. The action is brought, not for a trespass or a nuisance, but for negligence. We do not see, however, that the form of the action has any very material bearing on the case, for the deposit of sand against the plaintiff\u2019s wall so as to injure or destroy it might be charged as negligence as well as a trespass,, and the jury have found it to be such by their verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">On the trial the defendant insisted that he was not liable, because he had no connection with the work after the first three days. He testifies that at that time he sold the sand then on the lot to one Fogerty, and also gave Fogerty permission to use the lot for the deposit of sand. We do not believe that this fact would necessarily relieve the defendant from liability. It was the pressure of the whole pile of sand, that destroyed the plaintiff\u2019s building. Part of that pressure arose from the sand deposited against the wall by the defendant, as well as that deposited there later. It is true that the defendant\u2019s act alone might not have caused the injury, but nevertheless it was essentially a contributing cause to the injury. In such a ease, where the resulting injury is single, all parties who have contributed to the wrong are liable- for the whole damage. Slater v. Mersereau, 64 N. Y. 138; Simmons v. Everson, 124 N. Y. 319, 26 N. E. 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">The case, however, was submitted to the jury upon the theory that if, after the first three days, the deposit of the sand was made by Fogerty, and not by the defendant, the defendant was not liable; and I suppose it is on this theory that we must dispose of this appeal. The defendant\u2019s statement as to the sale of the sand to Fogerty has already been given. Fogerty corroborated the defendant on this subject, and so did other witnesses. But, on the other hand, the plaintiff testified to conversations and admissions of the defendant which tended to destroy the credibility of the whole story. When the sand was first placed on the lot, the plaintiff complained to the defendant that his wall was not strong enough to support it, and would be injured. To this the defendant replied that the house was strong enough, and it would not hurt it. This complaint was corn stantly renewed, and the same answer given. After the injury had been occasioned, the plaintiff said to the defendant: \u2018You have done exactly what I told you you would do; you have knocked my house down,\u201d\"to which the defendant replied: \u201cYou will have to go and see Beilly [defendant\u2019s landlord]. I am not responsible for your house.\u201d At no time did the defendant intimate that he was not prosecuting the work, or name Fogerty .at all. The last conversation is not denied by the defendant. The defendant\u2019s own testimony as to the first of these conversations is: \u201c\u2018Are you going to put sand on that lot?\u2019 I said, Yes,\u2019 and he said, Will there be any sand up against the wall?\u2019 I said, \u2018I guess there will be some.\u2019 Well,\u2019 he said, \u2018I am afraid the wall won\u2019t stand it.\u2019 \u201d To this last remark the defendant coolly responded, \u201cIf it don\u2019t stand, you had better shore it up.\u201d Beyond these conversations, it appeared that sand was at all times drawn to the lot in carts bearing the defendant\u2019s name. This is not a case of an illusory denial of the defendant\u2019s testimony, or of a mere scintilla of evidence to disprove his claim. The story of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>pretended transfer seems to us quite suspicious, and the truth of the story was properly left to the jury to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">The judgment and order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
