J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXyF\">This is an appeal from an order affirming an order granting a motion made by the defendant, under Laws 1892, c. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1081\">*1081</page-number>689, \u00a7 115, known as the \u201cBanking Law,\u201d to have one Alexander Mc-Keown made a party defendant in this action. Under the decision in the case of Mahro v. Bank, 16 Misc. Rep. 537, 40 N. Y. Supp. 29, this order must be affirmed as hereinafter modified. The case at bar is much stronger than the case above cited, as in this case it is conceded that Alexander McKeown had an interest in the fund in question; said fund having been deposited with the defendant bank in the name of the plaintiff and said Alexander McKeown jointly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-5\">Under the authority of Faivre v. Bank (Super. N. Y.) 13 N. Y. Supp. 423, the order appealed from must be modified by striking out the words, \u201cOrdered that the said funds on deposit, which are the subject of this action, remain with the defendant Bank for Savings upon the same interest as other deposits of like amount, until the final determination herein,\u201d and inserting in place thereof, \u201cThat the said defendant Bank for Savings be required to deposit said fund in court, according to the usual practice in such cases, within ten days after entry of this order, and service of notice of entry upon said defendant bank, unless the parties within that time stipulate in writing that the said fund remain with said bank\u201d; and as so modified the order of the special and the general terms is affirmed, with costs to defendant, the Bank for Savings, to be paid out of said fund. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
