Shipping\u2014Action for Freight\u2014Evidence.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b217-9\">Where the defense to an action for the freight of a cargo is that It was carried under special charter by the day, and a bill of lading of the cargo has been introduced, evidence that it is not customary to give a bill of lading where the boat is chartered by the day is admissible.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b217-10\">3. Same\u2014Bill of Lading\u2014Parol Testimony.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b217-11\">Such evidence is not incompetent, as proving the contents of the bill of lading or varying its terms, where it is neither a special agreement nor the agreement sued on.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b217-12\">Appeal from municipal court, borough of Brooklyn, Second district.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b217-13\">Action by Frederick Zimmerman against William T.

There was a judgment for plaintiff, and defendants appeal.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AcLn\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b217-14\">This action was brought to recover freight on a cargo of coal shipped by defendants, on a boat belonging to the plaintiff, from South Amboy, N. J., to the borough of Brooklyn, this city, at the alleged rate of 16 cents per ton, less advances for towing and trimming. The defendants denied that such was the rate agreed upon, contending that the agreement for carriage was at the rate of 83.50 per day.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b217-15\">Argued before FREEDMAN, P.

The only ground of objection to this evidence was its immateriality. The bill of lading, however, was seemingly neither a special agreement nor the agreement upon which the plaintiff based his cause of action; hence the testimony did not prove or vary its purport, but applied to another fact, namely, that, if the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>had been as contended for by the defendants, they would not have been able to produce the paper in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur; LEVENTRITT, J., in-result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
