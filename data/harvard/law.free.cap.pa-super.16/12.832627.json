L. Gillette, Esq., auditor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-13\">From the record it appeared that the auditor filed two reports. The first report was referred back to him for a fuller findings of facts. On exceptions to the second report, Al-bright, J., filed the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>Henry Stine, the testator, died December 24, 1896, aged about seventy-three years. He left surviving him a widow, a second wife, John, a son of the latter, and four children by a former wife. In a codicil of date of October 26, 1892, testator provided that out of the first proceeds of his life insurance policies the sum of $3,000 should be paid to his son John; that this sum was given for the purpose of equalizing him as nearly as possible with testator\u2019s other children to whom he had made \u201c advancements for their education,\u201d etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-5\">Testator then held a scholarship in Muhlenberg college at Allentown: Two of his older sons had graduated there. It was contemplated by the testator then that John, who was then about twenty years of age, should take a course at Muhlenberg, for he entered the preparatory school of the college in November, 1892, (he graduated there in 1897).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-6\">Lewis S. Lenhart was a half brother of John, being the son of the latter\u2019s mother by a former husband.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-7\">On November 16, 1892, the testator assigned absolutely a paid up policy on his life in the New York Life Insurance Company upon which there was due at the insured\u2019s decease about $2,565 to said Lenhart. Concerning said assignment Lenhart testified : \u201c He gave it to me to send John Stine to college; I was to pay out of the proceeds of the policy John\u2019s expenses in getting an education. I paid Henry Stine no money at the time for the policy. After Mr. Stine\u2019s death I drew the amount of the policy, about $2,750\u201d (out of that he paid to the executors' $161.07, income accrued at the time of assignment). \u201cI paid John\u2019s expenses of going to college .... $1,442.20 .... that is all I paid to him or for him .... the balance of the proceeds of the policy I still have .... I agreed to pay all of John\u2019s expenses through college .... the cash value of the policy at the time I took it was $1,469.26, the balance between the face value of the policy and what I paid out I claim as mine, that is the difference between $2,560 and $1,442.20. . . . Nothing was said to me by the decedent as to what should be done with the balance of the proceeds of the policy after John received his education.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-8\">As remarked, John graduated at said college, Lenhart paid his expenses while attending there, amounting to $1,442.20; interest on the payments amounted to $126.58, a total of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>$1,568.78. Tbe learned auditor decided that said $3,000 legacy to John was adeemed to the extent of $1,568.78, and awarded to John the residue, $1,431.22. To this action John and the residuary legatees excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-5\">An ademption of a legacy takes place where a parent bequeaths a legacy to a child, and afterwards gives a portion to the same child which is ejusdem generis. If there be nothing on the face of the will and no circumstances in proof to indicate an intention to give a double portion, the advancement will be a satisfaction or ademption of the legacy: Swoope\u2019s App., 27 Pa. 58.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-6\">There may be an ademption pro tanto: Gill\u2019s Est., 1 Pars. Eq. Cases, 139.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-7\">A testator bequeathed $1,250 to trustees to be used as his nephew required to complete his studies at a particular college, with a proviso that if the latter wished to discontinue his studies at said college then said amount or what was left of it should go to said college; the nephew had entered the college before the date of the will; he graduated from the collegiate department, entered that of theology, but left without completing the course; the testator paid the nephew\u2019s expenses while at college amounting to $1,295. It was held that the payment of the college expenses operated as an ademption of the legacy: App. of Ursinus College, 1 Monaghan, 196.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-8\">While the education of John was considered by the testator, it did not entirely control. The expressed purpose of the legacy of $3,000 was to equalize him with the older children to whom he had made advancements for purposes including an education. The idea conveyed is that each of the older ones had received about $3,000; no doubt more had been expended for education of the two who passed through college, than for the other son and daughter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-9\">The testimony of Mr. Lenhart being relied on to explain the absolute transfer to him, must be accepted as a whole. It is the only evidence as to consideration for, or conditions of, the transfer of the policy. He says he agreed with the testator to pay all the expenses of John\u2019s collegiate education. The testator was of the conviction that Mr. Lenhart could and would keep that promise as he actually afterwards did.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-10\">Evidently it was not contemplated by either party that Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Lenhart should be a loser by the transaction ; he was to advance the money, which probably the testator did not then have available, and was to be made whole for the outlay so far as the proceeds of the policy would accomplish that purpose; it is a fact that the value of the policy then was $1,469.26.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-5\">John ought not and does not seriously complain that Mr. Len-hart is made whole including interest on what lie expended. The residuary legatees are benefited by the decision that the legacy is adeemed to the amount of $1,568.78 instead of $1,469.26.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-6\">The testator did not bestow the policy on John. The result of the transaction of transfer was to benefit John to the extent of $1,568.78 and no more. If anything beyond that is taken to have been given it was to a third person, that is, to Mr. Len-hart. If the latter is answerable either to John or to the executors for the excess, the court has not jurisdiction to decide as to such liability in this proceeding. In order that there might be a decision as to that, Mr. Lenhart must be summoned and accorded a day in court. There is no demand to surcharge the executors with such excess, no allegation that they ought to have realized it from Mr. Lenhart, and in violation of duty failed to do so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-7\">The case of John must be regarded to be the same as if the testator in his lifetime after making the testamentary provision of $8,000 had given to him or paid for his education the sum of $1,568.78.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-8\">The argument, that what was realized on the policy must be deducted from the legacy, both having been payable at testator\u2019s decease, would be sound if the assignment had made the policy the property of John. But as already stated he did not become the owner of the policy. It is not shown that Mr. Len-hart voluntarily gave John the $1,431.22.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-9\">The action of the auditor is approved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-10\">July 5, 1899, the exceptions are dismissed and the reports confirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-11\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the decree of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b45-12\"><em>Edward </em>Harvey, with him <em>John Rupp, </em>for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AEn\">Trusts in personal property may be proved by parol: Osmond\u2019s Est., 161 Pa. 542; Smith\u2019s Est., 144 Pa. 428; Maffitt v.

The facts are fully set forth in the opinion of the court below. It is not necessary to restate them here. The appellant assigns as error the action of the court below in referring the first report of the auditor back for the finding of additional facts.- Abundant justification for this reference is found in the opinion of the court below directing it, in which the court says: \u201c The court is of the belief that a just decision requires a regarding of facts.not now appearing. The argument before the court above referred to indicates that counsel are of the same opinion. The facts found are meager.\u201d Then follow at least twelve distinct questions as to which the court desired definite information, in order to a proper under-, standing and disposition of the case. All this shows a desire on the part of the court to be properly furnished with all the pertinent facts necessary to reach a just conclusion in a question of such importance. A court undoubtedly has such a right. The reference back was eminently proper and is fully justified by the result. This must have been apparent to the appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>counsel, as these specifications are practically abandoned, or at least not referred to in the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">As the appellant pertinently remarks in the opening sentence of his argument, \u201c There is no dispute about the facts of this case and none about the principles of law involved in it. \u201d ' The assignment of the life insurance policy, which is the bone of contention, made by the testator to Lenhart, was absolute on its face. Four years after the assignment, as is admitted by Len-hart, he received |2,565. Out of this, he had paid for John\u2019s education $1,442.20, which, with interest on the payments as made, $126.58, constituted the amount, $1,568.78, which the auditor found to be an ademption pro tanto of John\u2019s legacy of $3,000, bequeathed by the last codicil of the testator\u2019s will. He, therefore, awarded him the balance of the legacy, $1,431.22, out of the balance for distribution. From this finding, confirmed by the court, spring all the various assignments of error other than those hereinbefore referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">It is clear that John received no benefit from the policy assigned to Lenhart other than that with which he is charged. The difference between that amount and the amount of the policy, as paid to Lenhart, is in his possession, claimed by him as rightfully his. John apparently has no right of action against him, for he was not in any way a party to the transaction by which the policy was assigned to Lenhart and, if the latter\u2019s testimony be taken as verity, he had no interest whatever in the policy, except that which he received. The right to recover the balance from Lenhart, if it exists, would, therefore, seem to be in the legal representative of the testator, which right could neither be considered nor enforced in this proceeding, as the court below very pertinently remarks. Whether Lenhart took the policy at its value at the time of the assignment or took it merely as security for advancements which he was to make to John for his education, are questions which need not now be considered, as they will be passed upon in another tribunal, at another time.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">The questions involved are so fully passed upon in the opinion of the court below, that we do not deem it necessary to discuss them at greater length. All the points involved are fully considered and clearly disposed of. No error is apparent in the disposition made of the case and the decree is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
