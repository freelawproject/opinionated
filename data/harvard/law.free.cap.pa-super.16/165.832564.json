The city authorities, doubting his good faith, demanded that he should pay a license fee fixed by ordinance for transient retail merchants. Plaintiff acting under advice of counsel and without any compulsion of legal proceedings, voluntarily paid to the city solicitor the license fee demanded under an agreement by which the money was to be returned to him at the end of three months if the city authorities should then be satisfied as to the permanency of the business. The agreement further provided that the question as to the permanency or otherwise of the business might be referred to the judge of the court of common pleas. If the plaintiff ceased to do business in the city within three months, the amount paid to the city solicitor was to be forfeited to the city. Plaintiff ceased to do business at the end of one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>month. The act of assembly authorizing the ordinance imposing the license tax in question imposed a fine of not less than <em>$ </em>100, or imprisonment of thirty days for violation of the ordinance. <em>Held, </em>that the payment by plaintiff was not under duress of either person or property, and that he was not entitled to recover back the amount which he had paid to the city solicitor.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b196-5\">Argued Oct. 25, 1900.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AnW\">Appeal, No. 106, Oct.

That on or about January 11, 1899, the plaintiff, not having been previously engaged in the clothing business in the city of Bradford, applied to the city solicitor of the city of Bradford for a yearly license, representing that he had been to the mayor at his store and had been told to come to the city solicitor and get a yearly license, as the city clerk who had charge of the license application blanks was ill at home. The plaintiff then paid the city solicitor the sum of $25.00 for a yearly license and took his receipt therefor, which is hereto attached and marked exhibit \u201c A; \u201d that shortly after the city solicitor learned from the mayor that he had not authorized a yearly license to plaintiff, but on the contrary had demanded a transient retail merchant\u2019s license under ordinances No. 491 and No. 638 hereinafter referred to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-10\">And thereupon, said city solicitor tendered back to said plaintiff said $25.00, which tender was refused by plaintiff; that subsequently at the time of the signing said agreement marked exhibit \u201c D \u201d which is hereinafter referred to, it verbally was agreed that plaintiff should come to the city solicitor\u2019s office, bring back and deliver up his receipt for $25.00 and receive back his $25.00, which plaintiff has failed to do.

The plaintiff claimed that he intended to do a permanent business, and that, therefore, he was not liable to a transient retail merchant\u2019s license; and further, that even if he was a transient merchant, the ordinance above referred to, and the act of assembly under which they were passed, were unconstitutional and void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-8\">6.

On this subject the law is well, settled. A voluntary payment of money under a claim of right cannot in general be recovered back, but it has been held that when a party is compelled by duress of his person or goods to pay money for which he is not liable, it is not voluntary, but compulsory; and he may rescue himself from such duress by payment of the money, and afterwards on proof of the fact recover it back: Christ Church Hospital v. Philadelphia County, 24 Pa. 229; Harvey v. Girard National Bank, 119 Pa. 212; Peebles v. Pittsburg, 101 Pa. 304; Neely\u2019s Appeal, 124 Pa. 406 ; Gould v. McFall, 118 Pa. 455; De La Cuesta v. Insurance Co. of North America, 136 Pa. 62, 658; Payne v. Coudersport Borough School District, 168 Pa. 386.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">To entitle a recovery back in such a case there must be compulsion, actual, present and potential, in inducing the payment by force of process available for instant seizure of person or property, when the party so paying it must give notice of the illegality of the demand, and of his involuntary payment. The element of coercion being essential, a mere protest or notice will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>not change the character of the payment, or confer of itself a right of recovery: Harvey v. Girard National Bank, snpra. The threat of legal process is not such duress, and it has been held that payment of taxes imposed under an act of assembly which was afterwards held to be unconstitutional, was not compulsory because made under a threat, express or implied: Taylor v. Board of Health, 31 Pa. 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The facts as detailed in the case stated do not constitute duress either of person or property. The plaintiff claimed the right to conduct a business in the city of Bradford as a permanent one. The city authorities doubted his good faith in the prospective enterprise, and contended that his purpose was to be a transient retail merchant, for which reason the city demanded that he should pay to it the license fee fixed by its ordinance for such a business. This was the sole controversy, and its solution depended upon the character of business the plaintiff intended to conduct. In order to carry on his business, and after he had consulted with counsel as to his liability and duty, he paid to the city solicitor the amount of license fee demanded. No legal proceeding had been instituted against him. By the act of assembly authorizing the city to enact, the ordinance, the only penalty which could have been imposed upon him was a fine of not less than $100, to be collected as all other fines are by law collectible, and in default of payment of said fine and costs to be imprisoned in the jail of said county or city for a period of thirty days; which result could be reached only after due course of law had been had in the matter. The agreement further provided for a reference of the dispute, at the request of the defendant, to .the judge of the court of common pleas, among other matters submitting \u201c the fact as to the permanency or otherwise of said business ; \u201d and further that if the plaintiff ceased to do business in said city within three months, the amount paid to the city solicitor should be forfeited to the city. It is this money, which he paid voluntarily, he now seeks to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The fact that the money was paid to the city solicitor and not directly to the city treasurer is not material, as the plain meaning of the agreement was that it should pass to the latter official upon the contingency provided for, and which contingency the plaintiff caused to happen by discontinuing his busi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>ness within the time mentioned. The court below found as a fact that within less than a month he ceased to do business, left the city, and forfeited his money by the very terms of his contract. The case stated fully warranted this conclusion of fact and. precludes the plaintiff from recovering back the money.</p>\n<p id=\"A426\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
