That the evidence offered is not admissible under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>pleadings in this case, for the reason that the declaration charges that the plaintiff for many years prior to the grievance herein mentioned, was and still is the owner in fee of all that certain lot or piece of ground, situate, lying and being in the borough of Shamokin, county of Northumberland and state of Pennsylvania, and known, designated and described upon the map or plan of said borough as lot numbered 5, in block numbered 111.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-6\">That in February, 1894, or thereabouts, the precise time or date cannot now be accurately given, as the plaintiff had no means of knowing, and all information thereof was concealed from her by the said corporation, the said defendant knowing that the said coal was on the land of another and the exclusive property of another, with force and arms and in a wilful and fraudulent manner, and in the utter disregard of the plaintiff\u2019s right, broke and entered into, and upon and under the surface of the said land of the plaintiff, and mined and dug out divers large quantities of coal, etc., and if this amendment is allowed it is for the purpose of allowing them the claim from the inception of their alleged equitable title, which would add nine years prior to the date charged in the declaration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-7\">The Court: We are of the opinion that the plaintiff has a right to show an equitable title to the lot in question under the parol contract, and to prove their possession and the payment of purchase money is offered, and to sustain their alleged right to recover for the coal mined under the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-8\">To which the defendant excepts and bill sealed.

Therefore, all evidence of the mining and removal of coal from underneath the said lot, prior to the execution and the delivery of said deed, must be excluded. <em>Answer: </em>Negatived.

The time of the alleged trespass is stated as follows: \u201c That in February, A. D. 1894, or thereabouts, the precise time or date cannot now be accurately given as the plaintiff had no means of knowing, and all information thereof was concealed from her by the said corporation, 'the said defendant, \u201d and she avers' \u201c that for many years prior to the grievance she was, and still is, the owner in fee simple of all that certain lot or piece of ground, \u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">The defendants pleaded not guilty; and on the trial (October 11,1899), after evidence had been adduced which showed a trespass as far back as 1890, the defendant for further plea, without dissent, added that of actio non accrevit infra sex annos. The plaintiff was permitted to prove, under objection and exception, that she had acquired an equitable title to the premises in 1885 by a parol contract, pursuant to which she had gone into possession, made improvements, continued in notorious possession, paid all of the purchase money, and received a deed in fee simple therefor in 1891, \u201cfor the purpose of showing an equitable title ha the plaintiff at the time some of the trespasses, complained of in the declaration, were committed.\u201d The offer and objections thereto are covered by the first assignment of error. The cause of action in this case was for the coal dug from under the plaintiff\u2019s lot. She had been in possession of the premises during the whole time covered by the trespass. Her inceptive title, dated in 1885, was followed by her continuous possession and payment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>purchase money. It is true that the legal title to the lot remained in Lewis Yerger until September 5,1891, the date of his deed to her, and the quantity of her estate was not a perfected fee simple. Under the contract with her father she had become the purchaser in fee of the property, but had the equitable title only, although she was to all intents and purposes the owner of the property. Being the equitable owner in fee, and as against this trespasser, she may be said to have been the entire, unconditional, and sole owner. Such would be held to be the law in determining the extent of her estate under an insurance policy which exempted the company from liability \u201c if the interests of the assured be other than the entire, unconditional, and sole ownership:\u201d Imp. F. Ins. Co. v. Dunham, 117 Pa. 460; Collins v. London Assurance Corporation, 165 Pa. 298. The holder of such a title, particularly where the possession is not disputed, may maintain an action of trespass against a wrongdoer: Ward v. Taylor, 1 Pa. 238 ; Baker v. King, 18 Pa. 138; Miller v. Zufall, 113 Pa. 317; Arnold v. Pfoutz, 117 Pa. 103; Irwin v. Patchen, 164 Pa. 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Amending the record by adding to the name of the present plaintiff that of Lewis Yerger, as a coplaintiff, averts all danger of injury to the defendant. As the case was tried on its merits, and the evidence affected by the condition of the record was received on the trial, we see no reason for not treating the record as so amended. It has been done in many cases in the Supreme Court in order to prevent injustice and facilitate the administration of law: Commonwealth v. McWilliams, 11 Pa. 61; Erie City Iron Works v. Barber, 118 Pa. 19; Shaffer v. Eichert, 132 Pa. 285; Chapin v. Cambria Iron Co., 145 Pa. 478; Weaver v. Iselin, 161 Pa. 386. Under the evidence it was not possible for her to have knowledge of the defendant\u2019s work under the ground. Had the trespass been on the surface she would have been bound to notice it. In Lewey v. Frick Coke Company, 166 Pa. 536, it was held as follows : \u201c To require an owner under such circumstances to take notice of a trespass upon his underlying coal at the time it takes place, is to require an impossibility; and to hold that the statute begins to run at the date of the trespass is in most cases to take away the remedy of the injured party before he can know that an injury has been done him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Tbe statement does not give a definite date to fix.tbe commission of tbe trespass, and specifically urges that the precise time or date cannot be accurately given, as she had no means of knowing, all information thereof being concealed from her by the defendant. Therefore the statute runs against such an injury, as is clearly proved in this case, from the time of actual discovery, or the time when discovery was reasonably possible: Lewey v. Frick Coke Company, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The assignments of error are overruled and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
