Before Mobbison, J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-7\">At the trial the court entered a compulsory nonsuit, which it subsequently refused to take off.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-8\">On a motion to take off the nonsuit, Mobbison, J., filed an opinion in which he stated the facts to be as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-9\">At the trial it was conceded that for some years prior to 1896, one C. S. Whitney was the owner of certain real estate at Mt. Alton, consisting of a lot of land and hotel building thereon, known as the Butts House. Whitney had leased this property prior to 1896, to Ward and King, who had placed in the corner store room, on the ground floor of said hotel building, shelving, counters and prescription case, fitting said room for a drug store. The shelving, counters and prescription case constituted what is known as trade fixtures. There is no question raised here that they were owned by Ward and King, and their value was about $240.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-10\">In February, 1896, the plaintiff bought these trade fixtures from Ward, and later, on April 7, 1896, this property was sold by a constable on an execution against Ward and King, and the plaintiff purchased it at that sale. Sometime in 1896, the defendant, Mahoney, went into possession of the Butts House property under a lease or contract with C. S. Whitney, under which Mahoney subsequently became the owner of the real estate. On April 7, 1896, the defendant, Mahoney, and the plaintiff, Straight, executed a certain tenant lease for the store room, in which the said trade fixtures were in use.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-11\">By this lease, in consideration of the sum of $1.00, the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>tiff, Straight, was to have the use of said, store room from April 7, 1896, until February 1, 1897, then next ensuing, and fully to be completed and ended on February 1, 1897. No mention is made of these trade fixtures in the lease. At the date of this lease the plaintiff owned the fixtures and there can be no doubt of his right to remove them during the term of said lease. But this he did not do. The evidence shows conclusively, without dispute, that after February 1, 1897, the said room with the counters, shelving and prescription case were in the possession of Mahoney, the defendant. By the said lease of April 7,1896, the plaintiff, Straight, fully recognized Mahoney as his landlord. After the expiration of said lease, Straight attempted to remove said trade fixtures from the room covered by his expired lease. Mahoney refused to permit such removal, claiming to Straight,that he, Mahoney, then owned such fixtures. Straight then demanded the fixtures and afterwards brought the pending action in trespass to recover their value.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AUk\">January 22, 1901:</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-5\"><em>Error assigned </em>was refusal to take off nonsuit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b187-6\"><em>Eugene </em>Mullin, of <em>Mullin &amp; </em>Mullin, for appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AcC\">cited Campbell v.

The named articles had been placed in the drug store by a former tenant, through whom the plaintiff derived his title to them. On the trial their value was admitted to be $250, and the court, on motion of the defendant, directed a compulsory nonsuit, which it subsequently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>declined to take off for the reasons as stated, \u201c that the property consisted of what is known as trade fixtures, and that the plaintiff had not taken proper steps to remove them prior to the expiration of the lease.\u201d As to what fixtures are, is always a mixed question of law and fact. \u201c In all the recent cases, the true criterion has been held to be, the intention on the part of the tenant to remove the fixtures during his term, at the time he placed them upon the property.\u201d The intention which thus becomes controlling is not the undisclosed purpose of the actor, but the intention implied and manifested by his acts : Campbell v. O\u2019Neill, 64 Pa. 290; Heysman v. Dettre, 89 Pa. 506; Carver v. Gough, 153 Pa. <em>225; </em>National Bank of Catasauqua v. North, 160 Pa. 303; Albert v. Uhrick, 180 Pa. 283; Wick v. Bredin, 189 Pa. 83; Silliman v. Whitmer, 196 Pa. 363.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">There is not sufficient evidence in this case to declare as matter of law that \u201c the two counters, prescription case and shelving \u201d were affixed to the real estate. From all that appears in the testimony they may have been movable articles and as easily shifted in position as chairs or tables. It is not so universally the custom to equip a drug store by physically annexing such articles to the real estate as to justify the court in holding that they were fixtures, without evidence of the intention and manner which determined their construction and use. They might readily be articles used in the profession without being trade fixtures. A jury should determine the fact, and the court erred in entering the compulsory nonsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">The judgment is reversed and a venire facias de novo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
