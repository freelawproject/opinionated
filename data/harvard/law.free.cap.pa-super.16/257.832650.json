Mary Ellen Hauer, a deceased child of testatrix, died on December 14, 1896, of full age, unmarried and without issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-10\">William H.

Hauer; one share to my daughter Eliza Hauer, and one share to my son Harry G. Hauer. In case any of my said children shall be deceased at the time of my death then the share to which he or she would be entitled, if living, shall be equally divided to and among the issues of such deceased child; and in case such deceased child shall have left no such issue surviving, then the share to which he or she would be entitled, if living, shall go to the surviving brothers and sisters, their heirs or legal representatives.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-5\">A claim was made on behalf of the widow and children of William H. Hauer before the auditor, that under the provisions of the will of the testatrix, they were entitled to receive the one-seventh part of the share of the estate bequeathed to Mary Ella Hauer, the amount so claimed by them being 1816.04. The contention of the claimants was that William H. Hauer, having been a brother of the legatees named in the will, his heirs and legal representatives were entitled to their pro rata share of the bequest to Mary Ella Hauer, who died leaving no issue surviving.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-6\">The auditor disallowed the claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-7\">The court in an opinion by Ehrgood, P.

Hough, 4 Rawle, 363; Dickinson v. Lee, 4 Watts, 82.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-6\">The construction of the will must be made upon the entire instrument and not merely upon disjointed parts of it: Lynn v. Downes, 1 Yeates, 518; Turbett v.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">According to the natural interpretation of the residuary clause, it would seem that the share of a legatee dying without issue would go to the brothers and sisters surviving him or her, and, in case of the death of any of them before the death of the testatrix, the heirs and legal representatives of such surviving brother or sister, who would take by representation. Under this interpretation the children of William H. Hauer, he having died before the date of the will, do not answer the description. But it is urged that, in order to avoid a construction which disinherits them, it is allowable to read the word \u201csurviving\u201d as meaning \u201cother,\u201d or to omit it altogether, in which case, says counsel, the issue of William would take by representation. The case of Lapsley v. Lapsley, 9 Pa. 130, which is supposed to give countenance to this construction, seems to us to fall short of sustaining his contention. As remarked in later cases that case was decided \u201c under its peculiar circumstances,\u201d and because the conclusion that would be reached by interpreting the will according to the usual meaning of the word \u201c survivors \u201d would be (we now quote from the opinion) \u201c unsustained by the intention properly imputable to the devisor, who, in the absence of ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>press direction or an equivalent implication, ought not to be suspected of a design to disinherit the issue of those who had fulfilled'the principal condition annexed to the gift. To avoid such a result the word \u2018 survivors \u2019 in the connection in which it is here found, has been construed to mean \u2018 others,\u2019 so as to let in the issue of the first takers.\u201d Even if, as is suggested hi the opinion of the learned judge of the court below, the case cited would be authority for a construction of the present will which would let in the issue of one of the first takers dying before the legatee dying without issue, it would not help the appellant\u2019s case. In doubtful cases the courts favor that construction which, consistently with the words of the instrument, will result in a disposition in conformity to the general rules of inheritance, rather than one which will disinherit an heir at law. But we do not regard this as a doubtful case. It is only by assuming that the testatrix did not mean what her words mean, that doubt can be raised. But there is nothing in the context which warrants such assumption. Her \u201c actual, personal and individual \u201d intent is clear and must control: Tyson\u2019s Estate, 191 Pa. 218; Thran v. Herzog, 12 Pa. Superior Ct. 551. It seems to be a case where the terse remark is applicable, \u201c It is a rule of common sense as well as law not to attempt to construe that which needs no construction: \u201d Reck\u2019s Appeal, 78 Pa. 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The decree is affirmed and the appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
