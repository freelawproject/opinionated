B. Roberts, president of the Mutual Aid Association of Philadelphia County Medical Society, set forth the death of Albert Fricke on or about November 17, 1899, a copy of his will duly proved, by which he appointed Nicholas Lennig executor, to whom letters were duly issued, and directed and empowered him to sell and convey his real estate free and clear of all uses, limitations and' trusts, the said association being made the residuary devisee and legatee of one half of his estate; the sale at public auction on July 17, 1900, by said executor, of premises No. 235 North Sixth street, Philadelphia, subject to an irredeemable ground rent of $195, part of said estate, to J. L. Cresse, the appellant, for $50.00, there being no deed yet executed, the valuation of said premises at $2,500 subject, etc., in the application for letters testamentary; an offer since the sale by George <em>W. </em>Tobler to the executor, to purchase said property if again offered for sale for $500, and that by reason of sickness in Tobler\u2019s family he was unable to attend the sale; that petitioner believed the price bid at the sale was inadequate ; that the property was worth at least $500 above the ground rent; that petitioner would be greatly damaged if said sale was consummated, and prayed for a citation to said executor and J. L. Cresse to restrain the said executor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>from executing a deed for said premises and why said sale should not be set aside and a new sale ordered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-5\">The answer of J. L. Cresse averred that the redemption money named in the ground rent deed reserving said ground rent was $3,250; that the sale to him was made by the said executor by virtue of the power in said will by Barnes &amp; Lofland, auctioneers, at public auction, after due advertisement by handbills and notices in newspapers published in Philadelphia; that he was the highest and best bidder, and that the whole of said consideration was paid by him at the time of sale; that the market value of irredeemable ground rents was fifty per cent premium, which would make the full selling price of said rent $4,875, the new offer being therefore less than ten per cent increase of the price bid by appellant; that he was advised that security should have been entered before issuing said citation ; that he had no knowledge as to what valuation was given of said premises in the petition for letters testamentary, nor as to the reason for the nonattendance of Tobler at the sale, and if they were relevant, requested that petitioner be compelled to- prove the same. He admitted the other facts, averred in said petition, and prayed the court to dismiss the petition with costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-6\">The answer of Nicholas Lennig averred that the said J. L. Cresse was the only bidder at the sale, which took place in the public salesrooms of the Philadelphia Bourse; admitted the facts set forth in the petition and submitted himself to the direction of said court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-7\">The court entered a decree setting aside the sale and ordering a resale on bond being entered, conditioned that the property should bring $500 at the resale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-8\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the decree of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b69-9\"><em>C.

Porter, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">Albert Fricke by his will directed and empowered the executor thereof to sell his real estate at public or private sale. Pursuant to this direction the executor offered a piece of the decedent\u2019s real estate at public sale. It was purchased, by J. L. Cresse for $50.00, subject to an irredeemable grount rent. Petition was made by one of the parties interested under the will, to set aside the sale on the ground of inadequacy of price, and representing that one Tobler was ready to give $500 for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>property. Answers were filed by Cresse, the purchaser, and by the executor, the latter containing a submission to such decree as the court should make in the premises. The orphans\u2019 court thereupon entered a decree setting aside the sale, on bond being entered by Tobler, conditioned that the property should bring $500 at the resale therein ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">The sole question for consideration now presented is, whether the sale having been made by the executor under the power conferred by the will, the orphans\u2019 court had jurisdiction to intervene and order a resale. -No doubt the court might make such an order in the case of a sale made by virtue of its own decree : Armstrong\u2019s Appeal, 68 Pa. 409, and cases cited. But it is contended that the power does not extend to a sale made by an executor by virtue of the expressed provisions of a will. This contention is met by the case of Dundas\u2019s Appeal, 64 Pa. 325, where the question was fairly raised. After reviewing the legislation and authorities on the subject, Mr. Justice Agnew uses this language: \u201c It would appear from this legislation that the orphans\u2019 court has power to control executors and other testamentary trustees in the exercise of their powers over real and personal estate. There would seem to be good reason, therefore, to hold that the orphans\u2019 court has power to review, set aside and, if necessary, to order a resale of real estate made under a testamentary power. . . . This was a sale by authority of the testator, and needed no confirmation of the court or order to convey. The deed passed the estate directly to the purchaser and constituted an inviolable contract, which could be reached only by a judicial proceeding to which the purchaser should be a party, as well as the executors. . . . The orphans\u2019 court within the limits of -its jurisdiction is strictly a court of equity (says Gibson, C. J.), proceeding by petition and answer, and enforcing its decrees by attachment, sequestration and execution, as the case may be. . . . In such a proceeding the orphans\u2019 court can grasp the controversy, set aside the sale, order the purchase money to be restored, and direct a resale by the executors under the will.\u201d This extended quotation is justified by its peculiar applicability to the case before us. It will be seen that the procedure here followed is that suggested and approved by the Supreme Court, and that here the sale has not been completed by the delivery of a deed and is, therefore, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>more open to judicial intervention. The order setting aside the sale made for so palpably an inadequate price, and the ordering of a resale on bond being entered securing a sale at a largely increased price, was within the discretion of the chancellor entering the decree. See Brown\u2019s Appeal, 68 Pa. 53, and Hamilton\u2019s Estate, 51 Pa. 58. There was no abuse in the exercise of the discretion vested in him. We, therefore, have no disposition to disturb the order he has made (see Haslage\u2019s Appeal, 37 Pa. 440, and Williams\u2019 Estate, 140 Pa. 187) further than to make an amendment saving the right of the purchaser who has made a payment on account. From the opinion above quoted, it appears that the decree may, and we believe should, direct a restoration of such purchase money as has been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">The record is remitted, with direction that the decree be amended by adding thereto an order to the executor to restore the cash payment made by Cresse, the costs of this appeal to be paid out of the estate of the decedent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
