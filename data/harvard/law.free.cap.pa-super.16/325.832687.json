Dobbins; wholesale grocer, American House Building, Pottsville, Pa., July 9th, 1890. See your letters of April 5th and 9th. Seth Thomas Clock Company. Gentlemen. I have been experimenting with your No. 8 and No. 10 duplex lever movements (I forget which is the catalogue number) and find the power ample and the lost motion surprisingly slight, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>but as the arbor does not turn as the movement runs down, it is not available. In the hope of finding something that would answer my purpose for a few samples, I bought three of your \u201c turn table \u201d movements, but a trial shows that they are too weak and in other respects unsatisfactory. As I expect to require a number of suitable movements, I write to request you to alter the duplex lever movements first mentioned in the following respects, charging me the price per hour stated in your letter of April 9th last. If you will kindly comply as soon as convenient, I will much appreciate your aid and will be very glad to place an order later. I do not care about having the springs boxed. Alterations to be made: 1. Make both springs arbor turning. 2. Make both springs to .wind from back of movement. That is to say, from opposite side as now made. Send me two movements.

Porter, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">The learned judge directed a verdict for the plaintiff. In this he committed error. There-were certainly two questions which should have been submitted to the jury. The first was whether the nineteen days during which the defendant waited to receive an answer to his order for the work, before giving notice of rescission, was a reasonable time. If it was, his act of rescission barred the plaintiff\u2019s right of recovery, since the defendant\u2019s letter of July 9 was a request to do work, not a reply closing a proposition theretofore made by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">The second was, whether the charge of the plaintiff was excessive in the number of hours alleged to have been expended upon the work. The defendant qualified himself to speak as one having special knowledge respecting the work ordered. He should have been permitted to. testify on this point. Having so testified, it was for the jury to say whether an excessive amount of time had been expended. The clock movements were purchasable in the retail market for $2.50 a piece. The charge of $30.00 for making some alterations in two of them, in connection with the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, raised a question of fact that the jury should have been permitted to pass upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">The assignments of error are sustained, the judgment is reversed and a venire facias de novo is awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
