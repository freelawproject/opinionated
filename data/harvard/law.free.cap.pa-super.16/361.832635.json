John Flanagan was a subcontractor with a claim against the house for about $500, for which he had a right to file a mechanic\u2019s lien. Mrs. Sheridan executed the note in controversy, which was for $175, to the order of McDonough, and delivered it to her attorney or agent, C. F. Woodruff. Subsequently Flanagan executed a release of liens and accepted in full payment of his claim the note in question and the checks of McDonough and Woodruff. Flanagan assigned the note to Luther Keller, who entered judgment upon it. Defendant claimed as a ground for opening the judgment that McDonough had falsely stated and represented to Woodruff that all parties who could file liens against the house had been paid, except Flanagan, and that relying upon these representations Woodruff had. delivered the note to Flanagan. There was no evidence that Flanagan had any knowledge of the false representations alleged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-11\">The court discharged the rule to open the judgment.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AfH\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>February 14, 1901.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-4\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the order of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b392-5\"><em>J.

Defendant left with her attorney, or at least her agent fpr the time, a note payable to the order of William McDonough, the contractor for the building of her house, for $175. Flanigan, who had done work upon the house and was legally entitled to a lien therefor, presented his claim in McDonough\u2019s presence to the defendant\u2019s agent or attorney. There was no dispute as to the ainount. It was settled by the transfer of the note in McDonough\u2019s name, by a check by McDonough, and a check for the balance by the defendant\u2019s agent. In consideration of the transfer of this note and of the checks received by him, Flanigan released his lien. So far as appears by the testimony Flanigan had no knowledge of any representations made by McDonough, nor was he interested in any way in the question as to whether or not there were any other claims which might be the subject of mechanic\u2019s lien. He had a legitimate claim undisputed, for which he had a right to file his lien. In consideration of the transfer of the note, which he subsequently transferred to the use plaintiff, and of the checks received, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>released Ms right to the lien, accepting them as actual payment of Ms claim. So far as the defendant and Flanigan are concerned, she received from Mm full consideration for the note. It was in effect, if not in fact, a novation, so far as he was concerned. He was not bound in any way by any representations which McDonough may have made, being neither a party nor privy thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The court below not only exercised proper discretion in refusing to open the judgment upon the petition of the defendant, but could not have done otherwise without a manifest breach of its discretion. The manner in which such discretion should be exercised has been lately fully discussed in Steel Iron Co. v. Jacobs, 9 Pa. Superior Ct. 122, and in Blauvelt v. Kemon, 196 Pa. 128. It is unnecessary to cite other authorities. The court below acted M full accord with the well known principles and practice therein recognized.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Decree affirmed.'</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
