Farquhar: We call attention with this, to lay ground <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>for the admission of this proof, to the declaration in this case and to the affidavit of defense which admits the execution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b672-4\">Mr. Schalck: That we object to at this time;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b672-5\">Mr. Bechtel: Defendant\u2019s counsel objects to the receipt of this note in evidence, first, because it differs from the note described in the narr. in this case, in this respect: That the copy in the narr. makes the note payable to bearer without showing that the word \u201c order \u201d is crossed out, the copy is not a true copy of the note now offered in evidence. Second, because this note shows upon its face that the word \u201c order \u201d is crossed out, and \u201c bearer\u201d written over it, and before this note can be received in evidence it must first be shown that the word \u201c order \u201d was crossed out and the word \u201c bearer \u2019\u2019written over it before it was executed and delivered by these defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b672-6\">Mr. Schalck: Also that the alteration of the note in a material portion of it appears from the face of the instrument and that such note thus altered is not admissible until the bona fides of the alteration are first proven. On the face of the instrument it is not admissible without explanatory evidence which the plaintiff is bound to produce in the first instance of the alteration and the circumstances under which it was made and when; that it is incumbent upon the plaintiff to prove that such alteration was made before the execution and delivery of the note, before the same is admissible in evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b672-7\">The Court: In view of rule of court No. 8, and in view of the fact that one of the counsel for the defendants accepted service for all and appeared generally for all of them upon the appearance.docket, and in view of this statement made in the affidavit of defense filed in this case on May 8, 1897, to wit: John S. Stoudt, one of the above named defendants, being duly sworn according to law, doth depose and say that he and the other defendants have a just, full and legal defense to the whole of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, the nature and character of which is as follows: The above suit is founded upon a promissory note dated May 1,1891, for $600, given by your deponent other defendants to Faulkner &amp; Brother, payable at Safe Deposit Bank three years after date, that this note was given to Faulkner &amp; Brother, and so <em>forth; </em>the affidavit of defense being indorsed by said counsel, these words referring to the note now offered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>in evidence, upon these statements, and for these reasons the objections are overruled and the offer is sustained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b673-6\">Defendants except. Bill sealed. [7]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b673-7\">Mr. Schalck: It is proposed to prove by the witness on the stand (one of the defendants) that when this note was executed by him it was made payable to Faulkner &amp; Company, or order, and not to bearer, and that the word \u201c order \u201d was stricken out and the word \u201c bearer \u201d inserted in the note in suit after the execution thereof by this witness ; this it is proposed to prove, not by anything that occurred between the witness on the stand and John Sunday, the decedent, but by things that occurred between the witness on the \u2022 stand and others, living and competent witnesses, namely, among others, one Reynolds, one John A. Sunday, and one Nees, the latter two, John A. Sunday and Nees, being in court here now, the one as the plaintiff in this case, and the other as a witness for the plaintiff; it is claimed that the witness is competent to testify to these matters, not only under the act of 1887, as already stated, but especially so under the act of 1891 just cited to the court, and the construction thereof in Irwin v. Patchen, 164 Pa. 52.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b673-8\">Mr. Farquhar: We renew our objection to the competency of the witness and the relevancy and the materiality of the testimony offered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b673-9\">The Court: The proof proposed is to prove a state of facts that occurred during the lifetime of John Sunday, the deceased, in this case. The party offered here as a witness not having brought himself within the provisions of the act of 1891, or rather being improperly called, the occasion not yet having arisen for his calling as a witness, the objection is sustained and the offer is overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b673-10\">Defendants except. Bill sealed. [8]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b673-11\">Mr. Schalck: We now renew the offer and propose to follow it up with evidence that at the time of the execution of this note by this defendant and the other defendants to Faulkner &amp; Company, that the note was given in consideration of a certain stallion named Pierre, which was then at Friedensburg, and which was then sold by Faulkner &amp; Company to the defendants in this case; that as a part of the transaction and of the occurrences between him, the witness on the stand, and the others present there, there was a written guarantee given by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>Faulkner <em>&amp; </em>Company, guaranteeing unto Neri Dietrich and other defendants that this stallion which was then sold by Faulkner <em>&amp; </em>Company to these defendants for $2,500, $700 of which was paid at the time to Faulkner &amp; Company, and $1,800 remaining unpaid, for which three notes were given for $600 each by these defendants, the note in suit being one, and that in and by said guarantee th\u00e9 said Faulkner &amp; Company guaranteed the said stallion to be a reasonably sure foal getter, with proper care and handling, and made other guarantees therein stated, and agreed to replace him with another horse of the same breed and price if he should not prove so; that this transaction occurred between this witness and the parties herein already above named, still living and competent to testify, and who are here in court, and it is proposed to follow the evidence already offered by the evidence now offered to show a failure of consideration. This to be followed up by the proof of such failure of consideration; that the guarantee and the assurances entirely failed, and there was no consideration for the note in question and this is offered especially also in view- of the fact that the note here given in evidence by this plaintiff shows that said note came into the hands of John Sunday, the plaintiff decedent, with an alteration upon the face of it; that he was bound to take notice not only of such alteration, but also affected by any and all equities that the defendants might have against Faulkner <em>&amp; </em>Company or the holder of this note, the same as if it had been taken by Faulkner &amp; Company after maturity of the note; that he is not a bona fide holder, and liable to all the defenses that may be made showing want of consideration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b674-5\">Mr. Farquhar: Plaintiff objects, that the evidence already shows that John Sunday, the decedent whose administrator is the plaintiff in this case, died September 11, 1894, and the defendant on the stand is incompetent to prove anything that occurred prior to the death of John Sunday. The plaintiff furthermore objects to the relevancy, competency and materiality of the testimony offered, also that it is said to be in writing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b674-6\">The Court: The objection is sustained, that is as to such testimony as is proposed to be offered by the verbal testimony of this witness. We consider such testimony illegal. If the offer includes any independent or separate testimony which does not come from the mouth of this witness, those are matters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>which we will consider when they are separately offered, distinctly apart from that portion of the offer which includes any testimony to be given by the witness on the stand.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b675-5\">Defendants except.

Porter, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">The court below admitted in evidence a promissory note which upon its face showed unmistakable evidence of material alterations, without any evidence whatever explaining said alterations. The learned judge based his ruling upon a rule of court in the following language : \u201c In actions upon promissory notes or other instruments of writing, if a copy thereof be filed thirty days or more before the time of trial of any case, and notice of such filing, together with a copy of said instrument, be served upon the defendant or his counsel not less than thirty days before said time of trial, it shall not be necessary in the trial in court or before arbitrators to prove the execution thereof, or the handwriting of the parties, drawers or makers, but the same shall be taken as admitted, unless the defendant shall file an affidavit denying that the same was executed by him or with his authority, or that the handwriting is the proper handwriting of such parties.\u201d This is a very valuable rule of court, it was intended to simplify and shorten the trial of issues, and in trials which come within its province the court and jury ought not to be called upon to consider evidence touching matters with regard to which there is no dispute between the parties. In framing this rule the learned court below saw fit to embody certain conditions with which the plaintiff must comply before he can have the benefit of the rule. The incorporation of these conditions was, no doubt, wise and just; the power of the court to impose the conditions was ample as its power to ordain the rule, and the rule can only be enforced under the conditions which it establishes. It is not shown by either the record or the evidence that notice of the filing of a copy of the note in question, together with a copy of said instrument, was served upon the defendants or their counsel, and it is admitted in the paper-book of the appellee that this was not done. The plaintiff had not complied with the conditions precedent to the enforcement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>this rule of court and he could take nothing by its terms.- An act of assembly which confers a right upon the performance pf a condition can only be invoked when the condition has been performed. There is no peculiar virtue in a rule of court which will permit it to be enforced without regard to the conditions clearly set forth in its terms, upon which suitors had the unquestionable right to rely. If the ruling of the learned judge below can be sustained, it must be upon some other foundation than upon this rule of court. Had the rule provided that upon the mere filing of a copy of a note the defendant should be required, without further notice, within thirty days to file an affidavit denying the execution of the instrument under penalty, upon default, of having the execution taken as admitted; or if it had been shown that the conditions of the existing rule had been complied with, the ruling of the learned judge would have been free from error: Jacoby v. Westchester Fire Insurance Co., 10 Pa. Superior Ct. 171; Neely v. Bair, 144 Pa. 250 ; Whitehead v. School Dist. of North Huntingdon, 145 Pa. 418. As the plaintiff was not in a position to take advantage of this rule of court he was left in precisely the position which he would have occupied if the rule of court had never been written. In the absence of a rule of court the affidavit of defense had no bearing on the issue, and if the plaintiff wished to take advantage of it as an admission, he was bound to offer it in evidence at the trial: Flegal v. Hoover, 156 Pa. 276. When under such circumstances, and unaided by any rule of court, an affidavit of defense is offered in evidence, it is for the consideration of the jury, and does not change the issue : Brown v. DeLattre, 6 Wharton, 429; Stockwell v. Loecher, 9 Pa. Superior Ct. 241. The learned counsel for the plaintiff did not offer the affidavit in evidence, but contented himself with calling the attention of the court to it for the purpose of determining the issues being tried. The affidavit was, therefore, not before the jury for the purpose of evidence, and there was, for their consideration, no evidence pf an admission that the defendants had anything to do with the execution of the note. Under the procedure act of 1887 the defendants were not bound to plead specially, and the plea of non assumpsit placed upon the plaintiff the burden of making out his whole case. The defendant who made the affidavit of defense did not even allege that he was acting as the agent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>his codefendants, and if the affi davit had been in evidence it coul,d not have been considered an admission by the other parties. These defendants were not partners, and the declarations of one were evidence against himself alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">When the note was offered in evidence it appeared upon the face thereof that the word \u201c order \u201d had been struck out and the word \u201c bearer \u201d had been interlined immediately above the other alteration. The negotiability of this note was dependent upon the presence therein of either the word \u201c order \u201d or \u201c bearer,\u201d for there were no other words employed which could give that character: Raymond v. Middleton, 29 Pa. 529. The alterations which clearly appeared on the face of the note were,therefore, in a material part of the instrument. It was not for the court to assume that the striking out of the word \u201c order \u201d and the interlineation of the word \u201c bearer \u201d were done at the same time. The parties to the contract may have intentionally stricken out the word \u201c order,\u201d at the time of the execution of the instrument, for the purpose of destroying its negotiability, and the word \u201c bearer \u201d may have been subsequently interlined without authority, by some party whose interest it was to make the instrument negotiable and thus deprive the makers of a just defense. The burden was up' n the holder of the note to produce evidence explaining these alterations before the note could be received in evidence: Simpson v. Stackhouse, 9 Pa. 186; Heffner v. Wenrich, 32 Pa. 423 ; Nagle\u2019s Estate, 134 Pa. 31; Nesbitt v. Turner, 155 Pa. 429 ; Gettysburg Nat. Bank v. Chisholm, 169 Pa. 564; Struthers v. Kendall, 41 Pa. 214; Hartley v. Corboy, 150 Pa. 23. The admission of the note in evidence, without requiring of the plaintiff an explanation of the alterations, was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">This action was brought on a negotiable note, and the liability of the defendants to the plaintiff, if any existed, was a necessary part of the original contract. The action was directly upon the contract; John Sunday was dead and this action was brought by his administrator. The defendants made various offers to impeach the contract by the testimony of the several defendants. It is contended that the defendants were competent to testify to occurrences prior to the death of the plaintiff, for the reason that certain disinterested parties were alleged to have been present when the transaction occurred, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>that, therefor, the Act of June 11, 1891, P. L. 287 applies. The difficulty with the position of the defendants was that the alleged disinterested parties had not been called as witnesses, and the competency of the testimony was to be determined as' of the time when it was offered: Roth\u2019s Estate, 150 Pa. 261; Thomas v. Miller, 165 Pa. 216; Kauss v. Rohner, 172 Pa. 481. The evidence of the defendants was properly rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">The judgment is reversed and a venire facias de novo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
