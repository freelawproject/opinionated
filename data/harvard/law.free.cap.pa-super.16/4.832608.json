Roberts, the above named defendant, being duly sworn according to law, says by way of supplement to his affidavit of defense heretofore filed in the above stated case, that under the said contract, a copy of which is set forth in the statement of plaintiffs\u2019 claim, filed, the said plaintiff was required to furnish the stone without delay. In addition to the said requirement of the said contract, the treasurer and manager of the plaintiffs\u2019 company, Charles T. Eastburn, at the time of the making of the said contract, undertook for and on behalf of the said plaintiff to furnish the said stone and make full delivery thereof by July 1, 1899. The plaintiff company did not furnish the said stone without delay, and did not complete the delivery thereof by July 1,1899, but on July 1,1899, a large <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>part of the stone, to wit: one fourth, remained undelivered. The said stone remaining undelivered on July 1,1899, was fuh ther delayed by the plaintiff in the delivery thereof until December 1,1899. By reason of the said delay and the said breach of contract on the part of the said plaintiff, the said defendant has been subjected to great damage and expense, and particularly has incurred a liability to the King Bridge Company of $750 under the following circumstances: The said defendant, relying upon the said undertaking of the said plaintiff, as to the time of the delivery of the said stone, entered into a contract with the King Bridge Company to construct the abutments of the said bridge, and undertook to have the same completed on the first day of July, 1899. By reason of the said failure on the part of the said plaintiff to perform its said contract as aforesaid,- the said defendant was unable to perform his said contract with the King Bridge Company, and complete said abutments at the time specified, whereby the defendant was subjected to damages to the said King Bridge Company, to the amount of the said sum of $750, being at the rate of thirty days at $25.00 per day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-5\">The court entered judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense in an opinion by Johnson, P.

The written agreement, which is included in the statement upon which the plaintiff\u2019s demand is founded, is set forth in full, leaving the date on or before which the stone, which was the subject of the contract, was to be delivered, blank. The affidavit of defense avers that at the time the said contract was made Charles T. Eastburn, treasurer and manager of the plaintiff\u2019s company, \u201c undertook for and on behalf of the said plaintiff to furnish the said stone and make full delivery thereof by July 1, 1899.\u201d There is no allegation that Eastburn, as an officer of the company, executed the written agreement, nor is it averred that he had power to bind the company either in writing or by the alleged parol agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">There is no averment that the provisions of the alleged contract with the King Bridge Company, under and in pursuance of which the defendant was required to complete the abutments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>of the bridge by the 1st of July, for which the stone furnished by the plaintiff was to be used, were ever communicated to the plaintiff, nor is there any allegation that the King Bridge Company has enforced or attempted to enforce the penalty provided for in their agreement with defendant for the violation of the contract. The allegations of liability to pay and of being subjected to damages to the King Bridge company were vague and indefinite. It is not even alleged that the King Bridge Company demands the payment of the said alleged forfeiture. If the case were on trial, defendant would not be allowed to offer either of the alleged defenses in evidence, if his offers contained no more than what appears in the affidavit of defense. We see no error in the disposition of the case made by the court below and the judgment is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
