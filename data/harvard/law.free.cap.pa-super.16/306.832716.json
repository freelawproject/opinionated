Before Yerkes, P. J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-11\">At the trial it appeared that on July 10, 1894, the borough of New Hope passed an ordinance, by which it was provided that for the maintenance of each and every telegraph, telephone, and electric light pole within the limits of the said borough, the owner or lessee thereof should pay to the borough treasurer an annual license fee of $1.00, and for the maintenance of each and every mile of telegraph, telephone and electric light wire, $2.50. The plaintiff brought this action to recover from the defendant the sum of $500, being the license fees imposed by said ordinance upon seventy-five poles, and twenty-five miles of wire for the four years from 1895 to 1898, inclusive.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-12\">The poles and wires situate in the borough of New Hope, and upon which these license fees were sought to be imposed, were used by the defendant wholly for the transmission of telegraphic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>messages between tbe different states of tbe United States and for cable messages to be transmitted from the United States to other countries, and no office was maintained by the defendant in the borough of New Hope.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-4\">The defendant alleged that under these circumstances there was no power in the borough of New Hope to levy such a license tax by ordinance or otherwise, or any authority for so doing, since the defendant, in the transaction of the business carried on by means of said poles and wires, Avas engaged in the transaction of commerce between the states and between the United States and foreign countries ; that the license fees in question amounted to a regulation of commerce between the states, and that the ordinances were therefore void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-5\">The court was asked upon the trial to so charge, but the case was left to the jury to determine the question of whether or not the license fees were reasonable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-6\">Verdict and judgment for plaintiff for 1377.40.

Citizens\u2019 Electric Light &amp; Power Co., 9 Pa. Superior Ct. 620; North Braddock v. Central District &amp; Printing Tel. Co., 11 Pa. Superior Ct. 24; Kittanning Electric Light Co. v. Kittanning, 11 Pa. Superior Ct. 31. See also McKeesport v. McKeesport, etc., Pass. Ry., Co., 2 Pa. Superior Ct. 242; North Braddock v. Second Ave. Traction Co., 8 Pa. Superior Ct. 233; Lansdowne v. Delaware County, etc., Electric Ry. Co., 9 Pa. Superior Ct. 621; Taylor Boro. v. Central Penna. Telephone, etc., Co., 8 Pa. Dist. Repr. 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">In many of the foregoing cases the license fee was the same as that imposed by the ordinance under consideration. In none <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>of the cases was the ordinance declared void for unreasonableness, although it was inferentially conceded that a case might arise where the license fee would be so grossly disproportioned to the burden imposed upon the municipality in consequence of the erection and maintenance of the poles and wires as to warrant the court in presuming that the ordinance was a revenue measure, not a police regulation. None of the cases lay down a fixed and invariable rule by which that question is to be determined, but after a comparison' of the facts developed on the trial of this case, with the facts of some of the cases above cited, we have been led by the conclusion that the court would not have been justified by the precedents in declaring the ordinance void. The facts being undisputed, we take it that the question of the validity of the ordinance was for the court to decide. But, if on the undisputed facts, the court would not have been warranted in declaring the ordinance void, the submission of the question of the reasonableness of the fee to the jury was an error of which the defendant has no just cause to complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
